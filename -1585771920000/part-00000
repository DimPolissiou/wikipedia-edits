The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via [[nuclear fission]] and  [[nuclear fusion]]).\n\nThe heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into [[mechanical energy]] via a [[heat engine]]. Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, [[cooking]], or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with [[combustion]]. Fuels are also used in the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[organism]]s in a process known as [[cellular respiration]], where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. [[Hydrocarbon]]s and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\n\nFuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release [[electrical energy]] (such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[capacitor]]s) or mechanical energy (such as [[flywheel]]s, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).\n\n==History==\nThe first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' nearly two million years ago.<ref>{{cite book| title = Origin of Humankind | author = [[Richard Leakey|Leakey, Richard]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=75-cwH1905QC&pg=PR9&dq=%22first+use+of+Fire%22 | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 978-0-465-03135-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Throughout most of human history only fuels derived from plants or animal fat were used by humans.

They have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society, with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power.\n\nCurrently the trend has been towards renewable fuels, such as [[Renewable energy#Biofuel|biofuels]] like alcohols.\n\n==Chemical==\nChemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them, most notably by the process of [[combustion]]. Most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel, but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 15\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O<sub>2</sub> | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J.

First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: ''primary (natural fuel)'' and ''secondary (artificial fuel)''. Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ General types of chemical fuels\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Primary (natural)\n! scope=\"col\" | Secondary (artificial)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Solid fuel]]s\n| [[wood]], [[coal]], [[peat]], [[Feces|dung]], etc. || [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[charcoal]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Liquid fuel]]s\n| [[petroleum]] || [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[coal tar]], [[naphtha]], [[ethanol]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Gaseous fuel]]s\n| [[natural gas]] ||[[hydrogen]], [[propane]], [[methane]], [[coal gas]], [[water gas]], [[blast furnace]] gas, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] oven gas, [[CNG]]\n|}\n<!--either needs expansion or deletion<gallery>\nFile:Charcoal.jpg|[[Charcoal]]\nFile:Saterland peat digging by hand 1963.jpg|[[Peat]] digging by hand in [[Saterland]], 1963\n</gallery>-->\n\n===Solid fuel===\n{{main|Solid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Coal is an important solid fuel]]\n\nSolid fuel refers to various types of [[solid]] material that are used as fuel to produce [[energy]] and provide [[heating]], usually released through [[combustion]]. Solid fuels include [[wood]] , [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s, and pellets made from wood (see [[wood pellets]]), [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]] and other [[cereal|grains]]. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] technology also uses solid fuel (see [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]]). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to [[making fire|create fire]]. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the [[industrial revolution]], from firing [[furnace]]s, to running [[steam engine]]s. Wood was also extensively used to run [[steam locomotive]]s. Both peat and coal are still used in [[electricity generation]] today.\nThe use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, [[anthracite|smokeless coal]] is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat [[briquette]]s are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.\n\n===Liquid fuels===\n{{main|Liquid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Benzinepomp002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[gasoline station]]]]\n\nLiquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create [[mechanical energy]], usually producing [[kinetic energy]]. They must also take the shape of their container; the fumes of liquid fuels are flammable, not the fluids.\n\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the [[fossil fuels|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as [[hydrogen fuel]] (for [[automotive]] uses), [[ethanol]], [[jet fuel]] and [[bio-diesel]], which are all categorized as liquid fuels. [[Emulsified fuel]]s of oil in water, such as [[orimulsion]], have been developed as a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled easily. They are also relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and in home use. Fuels like [[kerosene]] are rationed in some countries, for example in government-subsidized shops in India for home use.\n\nConventional [[diesel fuel|diesel]] is similar to [[gasoline]] in that it is a mixture of [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s extracted from [[petroleum]]. Kerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. [[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. [[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles. Propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\n===Fuel gas===\n{{main|Fuel gas}}\n\n[[File:Propane tank 20lb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 20-pound ({{nowrap|9.1 kg}}) propane cylinder]]\n\nFuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are [[gas]]eous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of [[hydrocarbons]] (such as [[methane]] or [[propane]]), [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential [[heat energy]] or [[light energy]] that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and from [[solid fuel]]s, though some fuel gases are [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a [[gas explosion]]. For this reason, [[odorizer]]s are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is [[natural gas]].\n\n===Biofuels===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\n\n[[Biofuel]] can be broadly defined  as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from [[biomass]]. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power\u2014known as ''biomass fuel''. Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.\n\nPerhaps the earliest fuel  employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at [[Swartkrans]], South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and an early species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' were present at the sites.<ref>{{Cite news\n | last=Rincon | first=Paul | date=22 March 2004\n | title=Bones hint at first use of fire | publisher=[[BBC News]]\n | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3557077.stm\n | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}</ref> As a fuel, wood has remained in use up until the present day, although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources.

So we must conserve these fuels and use them judiciously. The production and use of fossil fuels raise environmental concerns. A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>  Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|the vast majority of climate scientists]] agree will cause major [[Effects of global warming|adverse effects]].\nFuels are a source of energy.\n\n===Energy===\nThe amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the [[stoichiometric ratio]], the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its [[specific energy]], the energy per unit mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ [[Energy capacity|Energy capacities]] of common types of fuel\n|-\n!

Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy,{{dubious|date=October 2016}} but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. ''Nuclear fuel'' can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of '''fuel rods''') composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy [[fissile]] elements that are capable of nuclear fission.  When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart.  This makes possible a self-sustaining [[chain reaction]] that releases energy with a controlled rate in a [[nuclear reactor]] or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a [[nuclear weapon]].\n\nThe most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U) and [[Pu-239|plutonium-239]] (<sup>239</sup>Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission.  [[Plutonium-238]] and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by [[radioactive decay]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and other types of [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. Also, light [[nuclide]]s such as [[tritium]] (<sup>3</sup>H) can be used as fuel for [[nuclear fusion]].\nNuclear fuel has the highest [[energy density]] of all practical fuel sources.\n\n===Fission===\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel]] pellets are used to release nuclear energy]]\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy [[fissile]] elements that can be made to undergo [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]]s in a  [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]; ''nuclear fuel'' can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of [[fuel rod]]s) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.  The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Pu-239|<sup>239</sup>Pu]], and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], which is important for its relevance to [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Fusion===\nFuels that produce energy by the process of [[nuclear fusion]] are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for [[star]]s. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as [[hydrogen]] which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.\n\nIn stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of [[atomic nuclei]] that can release energy by the absorption of a [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form [[helium]] through the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] or by the [[CNO cycle]]. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once [[iron-56]] or [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-56]] nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement ([[ITER]]), [[inertial confinement]](heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Fewell | first = M.

This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density can also be provided by an [[internal combustion engine]]. These engines require clean-burning fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alcohol fuel]]\n* [[Alternative fuels]]\n* [[Ammonia]]\n* [[Battery (electricity)]]\n* [[Bitumen-based fuel]]\n* [[Biofuels]]\n* [[Compressed natural gas]]\n* [[Cryogenic fuel]]\n* [[Emulsified fuel]]\n* [[Fuel card]]\n* [[Fuel cell]]\n* [[Fuel container]]\n* [[Fuel management systems]]\n* [[Fuel oil]]\n* [[Fuel poverty]]\n* [[Filling station]]\n* [[Hydrogen economy]]\n* [[Hydrogen fuel]]\n* [[Hypergolic fuel]]\n* [[Liquid fuels]]\n* [[List of energy topics]]\n* [[Marine fuel management]]\n* [[Propellant]]\n* [[Recycled fuel]]\n* [[Solid fuel]]\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| title = Chemistry 1 | author = Ratcliff, Brian| publisher = Cambridge University press | year= 2000 | isbn = 978-0-521-78778-9|display-authors=etal}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Fuels}}\n* {{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/environment/co2/9994/en.pdf |title=Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 13 December 1999, relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars }}&nbsp;{{small|(140&nbsp;KB)}}.\n* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L1268:EN:NOT Council Directive 80/1268/EEC Fuel consumption of motor vehicles].\n{{Motor fuel}}\n{{Firelighting}}\n{{Energy footer}}\n{{Fire}}\n{{Portal bar|Agriculture|Ecology|Energy|Clothing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Fuels| ]]\n[[Category:Energy development]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Material that stores energy later extracted by use of oxidizer, catalyst, or tool, but which is not conserved}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[File:Buying fuelwood.jpeg|thumb|[[Wood]] is one of the first fuels used by [[human]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sgphv2ydAHwC&pg=PA69&dq=wood+one+of+the+first+fuels+used+by+humans#v=onepage&q=wood%20one%20of%20the%20first%20fuels%20used%20by%20humans&f=false|title=Chemistry of Fossil Fuels and Biofuels|last=Schobert|first=Harold|year=2013|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521114004|language=en}}</ref>]]\n\nA '''fuel''' is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases  energy as heat energy or to be used for [[work (physics)|work]].

Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, [[cooking]], or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with [[combustion]]. Fuels are also used in the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[organism]]s in a process known as [[cellular respiration]], where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. [[Hydrocarbon]]s and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\n\nFuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release [[electrical energy]] (such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[capacitor]]s) or mechanical energy (such as [[flywheel]]s, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).\n\n==History==\nThe first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' nearly two million years ago.<ref>{{cite book| title = Origin of Humankind | author = [[Richard Leakey|Leakey, Richard]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=75-cwH1905QC&pg=PR9&dq=%22first+use+of+Fire%22 | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 978-0-465-03135-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Throughout most of human history only fuels derived from plants or animal fat were used by humans.

They have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society, with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power.\n\nCurrently the trend has been towards renewable fuels, such as [[Renewable energy#Biofuel|biofuels]] like alcohols.\n\n==Chemical==\nChemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them, most notably by the process of [[combustion]]. Most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel, but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 15\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O<sub>2</sub> | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J.

First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: ''primary (natural fuel)'' and ''secondary (artificial fuel)''. Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ General types of chemical fuels\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Primary (natural)\n! scope=\"col\" | Secondary (artificial)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Solid fuel]]s\n| [[wood]], [[coal]], [[peat]], [[Feces|dung]], etc. || [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[charcoal]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Liquid fuel]]s\n| [[petroleum]] || [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[coal tar]], [[naphtha]], [[ethanol]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Gaseous fuel]]s\n| [[natural gas]] ||[[hydrogen]], [[propane]], [[methane]], [[coal gas]], [[water gas]], [[blast furnace]] gas, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] oven gas, [[CNG]]\n|}\n<!--either needs expansion or deletion<gallery>\nFile:Charcoal.jpg|[[Charcoal]]\nFile:Saterland peat digging by hand 1963.jpg|[[Peat]] digging by hand in [[Saterland]], 1963\n</gallery>-->\n\n===Solid fuel===\n{{main|Solid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Coal is an important solid fuel]]\n\nSolid fuel refers to various types of [[solid]] material that are used as fuel to produce [[energy]] and provide [[heating]], usually released through [[combustion]]. Solid fuels include [[wood]] , [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s, and pellets made from wood (see [[wood pellets]]), [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]] and other [[cereal|grains]]. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] technology also uses solid fuel (see [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]]). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to [[making fire|create fire]]. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the [[industrial revolution]], from firing [[furnace]]s, to running [[steam engine]]s. Wood was also extensively used to run [[steam locomotive]]s. Both peat and coal are still used in [[electricity generation]] today.\nThe use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, [[anthracite|smokeless coal]] is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat [[briquette]]s are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.\n\n===Liquid fuels===\n{{main|Liquid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Benzinepomp002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[gasoline station]]]]\n\nLiquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create [[mechanical energy]], usually producing [[kinetic energy]]. They must also take the shape of their container; the fumes of liquid fuels are flammable, not the fluids.\n\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the [[fossil fuels|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as [[hydrogen fuel]] (for [[automotive]] uses), [[ethanol]], [[jet fuel]] and [[bio-diesel]], which are all categorized as liquid fuels. [[Emulsified fuel]]s of oil in water, such as [[orimulsion]], have been developed as a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled easily. They are also relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and in home use. Fuels like [[kerosene]] are rationed in some countries, for example in government-subsidized shops in India for home use.\n\nConventional [[diesel fuel|diesel]] is similar to [[gasoline]] in that it is a mixture of [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s extracted from [[petroleum]]. Kerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. [[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. [[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles. Propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\n===Fuel gas===\n{{main|Fuel gas}}\n\n[[File:Propane tank 20lb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 20-pound ({{nowrap|9.1 kg}}) propane cylinder]]\n\nFuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are [[gas]]eous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of [[hydrocarbons]] (such as [[methane]] or [[propane]]), [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential [[heat energy]] or [[light energy]] that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and from [[solid fuel]]s, though some fuel gases are [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a [[gas explosion]]. For this reason, [[odorizer]]s are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is [[natural gas]].\n\n===Biofuels===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\n\n[[Biofuel]] can be broadly defined  as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from [[biomass]]. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power\u2014known as ''biomass fuel''. Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.\n\nPerhaps the earliest fuel  employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at [[Swartkrans]], South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and an early species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' were present at the sites.<ref>{{Cite news\n | last=Rincon | first=Paul | date=22 March 2004\n | title=Bones hint at first use of fire | publisher=[[BBC News]]\n | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3557077.stm\n | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}</ref> As a fuel, wood has remained in use up until the present day, although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources.

A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>  Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|the vast majority of climate scientists]] agree will cause major [[Effects of global warming|adverse effects]].\nFuels are a source of energy.\n\n===Energy===\nThe amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the [[stoichiometric ratio]], the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its [[specific energy]], the energy per unit mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ [[Energy capacity|Energy capacities]] of common types of fuel\n|-\n!

Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy,{{dubious|date=October 2016}} but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. ''Nuclear fuel'' can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of '''fuel rods''') composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy [[fissile]] elements that are capable of nuclear fission.  When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart.  This makes possible a self-sustaining [[chain reaction]] that releases energy with a controlled rate in a [[nuclear reactor]] or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a [[nuclear weapon]].\n\nThe most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U) and [[Pu-239|plutonium-239]] (<sup>239</sup>Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission.  [[Plutonium-238]] and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by [[radioactive decay]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and other types of [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. Also, light [[nuclide]]s such as [[tritium]] (<sup>3</sup>H) can be used as fuel for [[nuclear fusion]].\nNuclear fuel has the highest [[energy density]] of all practical fuel sources.\n\n===Fission===\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel]] pellets are used to release nuclear energy]]\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy [[fissile]] elements that can be made to undergo [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]]s in a  [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]; ''nuclear fuel'' can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of [[fuel rod]]s) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.  The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Pu-239|<sup>239</sup>Pu]], and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], which is important for its relevance to [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Fusion===\nFuels that produce energy by the process of [[nuclear fusion]] are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for [[star]]s. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as [[hydrogen]] which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.\n\nIn stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of [[atomic nuclei]] that can release energy by the absorption of a [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form [[helium]] through the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] or by the [[CNO cycle]]. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once [[iron-56]] or [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-56]] nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement ([[ITER]]), [[inertial confinement]](heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Fewell | first = M.

This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density can also be provided by an [[internal combustion engine]]. These engines require clean-burning fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alcohol fuel]]\n* [[Alternative fuels]]\n* [[Ammonia]]\n* [[Battery (electricity)]]\n* [[Bitumen-based fuel]]\n* [[Biofuels]]\n* [[Compressed natural gas]]\n* [[Cryogenic fuel]]\n* [[Emulsified fuel]]\n* [[Fuel card]]\n* [[Fuel cell]]\n* [[Fuel container]]\n* [[Fuel management systems]]\n* [[Fuel oil]]\n* [[Fuel poverty]]\n* [[Filling station]]\n* [[Hydrogen economy]]\n* [[Hydrogen fuel]]\n* [[Hypergolic fuel]]\n* [[Liquid fuels]]\n* [[List of energy topics]]\n* [[Marine fuel management]]\n* [[Propellant]]\n* [[Recycled fuel]]\n* [[Solid fuel]]\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| title = Chemistry 1 | author = Ratcliff, Brian| publisher = Cambridge University press | year= 2000 | isbn = 978-0-521-78778-9|display-authors=etal}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Fuels}}\n* {{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/environment/co2/9994/en.pdf |title=Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 13 December 1999, relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars }}&nbsp;{{small|(140&nbsp;KB)}}.\n* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L1268:EN:NOT Council Directive 80/1268/EEC Fuel consumption of motor vehicles].\n{{Motor fuel}}\n{{Firelighting}}\n{{Energy footer}}\n{{Fire}}\n{{Portal bar|Agriculture|Ecology|Energy|Clothing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Fuels| ]]\n[[Category:Energy development]]\n", "name_user": "Jarble", "label": "safe", "comment": "editing a link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"}

Clarin Street). It has the fourth largest land area of the province, with 127.27&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (49.14 sq. mi) of land.\n\n== History ==\nThe place is a panorama of verdant hills, rugged mountains and green fields. It is said to have been so named because of the grass ''\"balili\"'' which grew in abundance.\n\nBefore the beginning of the 19th century, Balilihan was a barrio of [[Baclayon, Bohol|Baclayon]] and an old settlement. When the [[Dagohoy Rebellion|Dagohoy revolt]] was suppressed by the Spaniards, the authorities established a garrison in Datag (one of its barrios) to discourage and stamp out further uprisings on the part of the natives. When Balilihan was separated from its mother town on 29 September 1828, the Spanish government formally established a settlement or ''pueblo'' in the sitio \"''Bay sa Iring''\" (named so for the network of caves where cats hide) which was about {{convert|2|km|spell=in|1}} from the Spanish garrison.\n\n[[File:Balilihan watchtower & belfry in Bohol.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Spanish Belfry in Poblacion, Balilihan - served as the watch tower during Spanish regime]]\nLater, due to the scarcity of water, the seat of government was transferred to its present site which is amply supplied with water from various springs. The elevated land also made a good viewing point to keep watch over all nearby towns. Thus the construction of a Spanish belfry similar to the watch towers of the shores atop the hill. This tower is made of adobe stones gathered from the rock deposits of Baclayon. It was erected in the year 1835. It was inaugurated in 1846 ''[[gobernadorcillo]]''. In 1888, Friar Benito Grayoa, who at that time exercised control over local governments, ordered the transfer of the municipio to Cabad, a barrio {{convert|4|km|spell=in|1}} west of the poblacion. The padre's plan met vigorous opposition from the people and through the able leadership of Capitan Bartolome Racho, they filed the protest before the Spanish Military Governor Linares who disapproved the proposal causing Friar Grayoa's ire who then plotted for the consequent punishment of the captain by dragging him with the friar's horse through the streets causing his death in jail. Fearing reprisals from the clergy, some of the people migrated to Surigao, Leyte and Misamis. Not long afterwards, Friar Grayoa was transferred to Siquijor.\n\nThe Spanish era flourished with the construction of Spanish church at the foot of the Spanish watchtower where a large patio became the hall for social affairs and the friar's convent a school for the cartilla, with the municipio across. With the guidance of the local appointed leaders under the control of the Spanish friar, the town slowly progressed peacefully until the outbreak of the revolution in 1898.\n\nOn 12 November 1900, American soldiers were known to be coming from Antequera. All officials of the town led by Capitan Antonio Racho came out to meet the soldiers with a brass band, but when the Americans arrived, they gathered all the officials in the municipal hall building and placed them under guard, for the Americans had heard that the town officials had been supporting the insurgents. The supplications of spokesman Segundo Racho not to burn the town was of no avail and the sounds of the welcoming brass band turned into volleys of gunshots. The officials were ordered to move towards Sevilla while the civilians ran for safety to the outskirts of the town. The town was razed to the ground. The Americans burned the church, the convent, the municipal building, the school building for boys and girls as well as private houses. The only structure that was spared was the belfry on the top of the hill.\n\nIn 1904, there was a move to fuse Balilihan with Antequera in order to meet the requirements of a municipality under the American regime. The people objected to the plan, so the following year the Philippine Commission finally ruled in its Act. No. 350 abolishing the municipality of Catigbi{{nbhyph}}an and instead annexing it to Balilihan as one of its barrios.\n\nDuring World War II, the town residents went into hiding in their mountain hideouts for fear of the Japanese. Balilihan was a haven of refugees from other places who lived a life of privation in the mountains. Many innocent civilians were either tortured or put into death by the enemies on mere suspicions of guerilla activities. Ex-mayor Patricio Ibarra was put up by the people as war time mayor to defend them from their enemies.\n\nThe Japanese atrocities gave rise to the organizations of the guerrillas into full combat force under the supreme command of Mayor Ismael Ingeniero. The people helped the guerilla movement by feeding the troops in the front lines as well as those in the headquarters in [[Batuan, Bohol#Behind the Clouds|Behind the Clouds]], in Maitum which was the famous concentration camp of the war. Enemy collaborators were tried here and those found guilty of high crimes were liquidated. Those with slight offenses were imprisoned for the duration of the war. Another concentration camp was at Hanopol where prisoners were kept.\n\nIn 1948, Balilihan suffered a great loss of territory when the biggest barrio (Catigbi{{nbhyph}}an) was given its town charter in spite of the strong representation against the move by town mayor Balbino Chatto and Gerardo Racho who personally went to Malaca\u00f1ang to see President Elpidio Quirino.\n\n== Barangays ==\n\nBalilihan comprises 31 barangays:\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206001| Baucan Norte            |  666|  688}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206002| Baucan Sur              |  799|  852}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206003| Boctol                  | 1322| 1094}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206004| Boyog Norte             |  227|  212}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206005| Boyog Proper            |  281|  199}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206006| Boyog Sur               |  348|  329}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206007| Cabad                   |  677|  570}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206008| Candasig                |  609|  591}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206009| Cantalid                |  400|  387}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206010| Cantomimbo              |  539|  537}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206011| Cogon                   |  774|  835}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206012| Datag Norte             |  604|  540}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206013| Datag Sur               |  498|  414}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206014| Del Carmen Este ([[Poblacion]])  |  669|  672}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206015| Del Carmen Norte ([[Poblacion]]) |  746|  720}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206017| Del Carmen Sur ([[Poblacion]])   |  615|  600}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206016| Del Carmen Weste ([[Poblacion]]) |  827|  865}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206018| Del Rosario             |  230|  260}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206019| Dorol                   |  746|  751}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206020| Haguilanan Grande       |  686|  836}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206021| Hanopol Este            |  345|  337}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206022| Hanopol Norte           |  384|  349}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206023| Hanopol Weste           |  245|  272}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206024| Magsija                 |  611|  477}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206025| Maslog                  |  524|  428}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206026| Sagasa                  |  613|  512}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206027| Sal{{nbhyph}}ing        |  672|  697}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206028| San Isidro              |  455|  458}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206029| San Roque               |  546|  519}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206030| Santo Ni\u00f1o              |  532|  494}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|071206031| Tagustusan              |  713|  652}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|bottom| 17147}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Balilihan\n| 1903 = 6590\n| 1918 = 9973\n| 1939 = 18991\n| 1948 = 23937\n| 1960 = 11161\n| 1970 = 14533\n| 1975 = 13912\n| 1980 = 13925\n| 1990 = 14850\n| 1995 = 14400\n| 2000 = 16837\n| 2007 = 17131\n| 2010 = 17147\n| 2015 = 17903\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n{{unbulleted list|Number of households: 3,101<ref name=boholgov />\n|Average household size: {{rnd|{{formatnum:{{PH wikidata|population_total}}|R}}/3101|1}}}}\n\n==Town festival==\n\nThe municipality of Balilihan holds its annual town fiesta every 16 July in honor of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]],<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bohol.ph/article32.html | title = ''Fiesta Time''\n| publisher = \"https://www.bohol.ph\"| accessdate = February 13, 2019}}</ref> however, other barangays (Hanopol - comprising 10 barangays) celebrate their fiesta in honor of their patron [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa]] on the 16 January.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt is located {{convert|22|km}} northeast of [[Tagbilaran]] through [[Cortes, Bohol|Cortes]] (via CPG North Avenue), or {{convert|20|km}} northeast through [[Corella, Bohol|Corella]] (via J.A. Clarin Street). It has the fourth largest land area of the province, with 127.27 km<sup>2</sup> (49.14 sq. mi) of land.\n\n== History ==\nThe place is a panorama of verdant hills, rugged mountains and green fields. It is said to have been so named because of the grass ''\"balili\"'' which grew in abundance.\n\nBefore the beginning of the 19th century, Balilihan was a barrio of [[Baclayon, Bohol|Baclayon]] and an old settlement. When the [[Dagohoy Rebellion|Dagohoy revolt]] was suppressed by the Spaniards, the authorities established a garrison in Datag (one of its barrios) to discourage and stamp out further uprisings on the part of the natives. When Balilihan was separated from its mother town on 29 September 1828, the Spanish government formally established a settlement or ''pueblo'' in the sitio \"''Bay sa Iring''\" (named so for the network of caves where cats hide) which was about {{convert|2|km|spell=in|1}} from the Spanish garrison.\n\n[[File:Balilihan watchtower & belfry in Bohol.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Spanish Belfry in Poblacion, Balilihan - served as the watch tower during Spanish regime]]\nLater, due to the scarcity of water, the seat of government was transferred to its present site which is amply supplied with water from various springs. The elevated land also made a good viewing point to keep watch over all nearby towns. Thus the construction of a Spanish belfry similar to the watch towers of the shores atop the hill. This tower is made of adobe stones gathered from the rock deposits of Baclayon. It was erected in the year 1835. It was inaugurated in 1846 ''[[gobernadorcillo]]''. In 1888, Friar Benito Grayoa, who at that time exercised control over local governments, ordered the transfer of the municipio to Cabad, a barrio {{convert|4|km|spell=in|1}} west of the poblacion. The padre's plan met vigorous opposition from the people and through the able leadership of Capitan Bartolome Racho, they filed the protest before the Spanish Military Governor Linares who disapproved the proposal causing Friar Grayoa's ire who then plotted for the consequent punishment of the captain by dragging him with the friar's horse through the streets causing his death in jail. Fearing reprisals from the clergy, some of the people migrated to Surigao, Leyte and Misamis. Not long afterwards, Friar Grayoa was transferred to Siquijor.\n\nThe Spanish era flourished with the construction of Spanish church at the foot of the Spanish watchtower where a large patio became the hall for social affairs and the friar's convent a school for the cartilla, with the municipio across. With the guidance of the local appointed leaders under the control of the Spanish friar, the town slowly progressed peacefully until the outbreak of the revolution in 1898.\n\nOn 12 November 1900, American soldiers were known to be coming from Antequera. All officials of the town led by Capitan Antonio Racho came out to meet the soldiers with a brass band, but when the Americans arrived, they gathered all the officials in the municipal hall building and placed them under guard, for the Americans had heard that the town officials had been supporting the insurgents. The supplications of spokesman Segundo Racho not to burn the town was of no avail and the sounds of the welcoming brass band turned into volleys of gunshots. The officials were ordered to move towards Sevilla while the civilians ran for safety to the outskirts of the town. The town was razed to the ground. The Americans burned the church, the convent, the municipal building, the school building for boys and girls as well as private houses. The only structure that was spared was the belfry on the top of the hill.\n\nIn 1904, there was a move to fuse Balilihan with Antequera in order to meet the requirements of a municipality under the American regime. The people objected to the plan, so the following year the Philippine Commission finally ruled in its Act. No. 350 abolishing the municipality of Catigbi{{nbhyph}}an and instead annexing it to Balilihan as one of its barrios.\n\nDuring World War II, the town residents went into hiding in their mountain hideouts for fear of the Japanese. Balilihan was a haven of refugees from other places who lived a life of privation in the mountains. Many innocent civilians were either tortured or put into death by the enemies on mere suspicions of guerilla activities. Ex-mayor Patricio Ibarra was put up by the people as war time mayor to defend them from their enemies.\n\nThe Japanese atrocities gave rise to the organizations of the guerrillas into full combat force under the supreme command of Mayor Ismael Ingeniero. The people helped the guerilla movement by feeding the troops in the front lines as well as those in the headquarters in [[Batuan, Bohol#Behind the Clouds|Behind the Clouds]], in Maitum which was the famous concentration camp of the war. Enemy collaborators were tried here and those found guilty of high crimes were liquidated. Those with slight offenses were imprisoned for the duration of the war.

This is done either as a [[near future]] or [[alternate history]] scenario, or occasionally for humorous purposes. Also included are actual British Prime Ministers with a fictional premiership at a different time and/or under different circumstances than the one in actual history.\n\n*'''[[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook]]'''\n:* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Dominion (Sansom novel)|Dominion]]'' by [[C. J. Sansom]], World War II ended in June 1940 when the [[British government]], under the leadership of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], signed a peace treaty with [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] in [[Berlin]]. Due to poor health, Halifax resigned as Prime Minister in 1941 and was succeeded by the 78-year-old [[David Lloyd George]]. Following Lloyd George's death in 1945, Beaverbrook became Prime Minister. He led a coalition government which consisted of the pro-Treaty factions of the Conservatives and Labour as well as the [[British Union of Fascists]]. In November 1952, Beaverbrook made an agreement to transport all [[British Jews]] to the [[Isle of Wight]], which was under Nazi control, so that they could be sent to the [[concentration camp]]s of [[Eastern Europe]].

Brown falls victim to the infected due to an internal outbreak within the bunker, leading to the near total collapse of the British government.\n:* Prime Minister in ''[[The Trial of Tony Blair]]'', portrayed by [[Peter Mullan]]. He succeeds [[Tony Blair]] (played by [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]]) in 2010 (having stayed on as Prime Minister for longer to oversee the government's handling of the invasion of Iraq and the resulting terror attacks on London). Brown wins the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]] over the Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] (played by [[Alexander Armstrong]]) but only by a razor-thin majority of two seats after Blair leaked memos from Brown as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] saying that tax increases were inevitable, having feared that Brown would win a larger parliamentary than he ever did. After that, Brown manipulates events to ensure that Blair is charged for war crimes and put on trial at [[International Court of Justice|The Hague]]. Whilst visiting Blair in hospital, Brown says that he will base his premiership on 'honesty' as opposed to charisma as Blair had done.\n\n* '''[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]\n:* Party: Industrial Radicals\n:* In an alternate history where Charles Babbage managed to build a functioning [[analytical engine]], Brunel is granted a meritocratic lordship and succeeds Lord Byron as Prime Minister after his death in 1855 during the 'Great Stink' and the resultant civil and political unrest.\n\n* '''[[Rab Butler]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in ''[[Random Quest]]'' by [[John Wyndham]]\n:* In a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] in which [[World War II]] never happened, Butler was Prime Minister in 1954.\n\n* '''[[Lord Byron]]'''\n:* Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Industrialists in ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]].\n:* Became Prime Minister in a reality where Charles Babbage managed to build a functioning analytical engine, bringing about the Information Age a hundred-and-fifty years early. His election victory in 1830 prompted the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] to launch an unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat. He would seemingly govern for twenty-five years until his death in 1855 during the 'Great Stink'.\n\n* '''[[Winston Churchill]]'''\n:* In the ''[[Southern Victory Series]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], where the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] won the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], the British Empire and the rest of the [[Allies of World War I|Quadruple Entente]] lost the [[Great War (series)|First Great War]] to the [[Central Powers]] (dominated by the United States and Germany), resulting in the loss of several territories, most notably [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]]. Churchill becomes Prime Minister in 1935 with his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] going into coalition with the [[British Union of Fascists|Silvershirts]], making Oswald Mosley [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and de facto Deputy Prime Minister. The authoritarian Churchill leads Britain into a disastrous [[Settling Accounts|second war against the Central Powers]], resulting in the German superbombings of [[London]], [[Brighton]] and [[Norwich]] and the replacement of him by [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]] as Prime Minister.\n:*In [[Michael Arlen]]'s 1934 novel ''Hell! Said the Duchess'', Churchill becomes Prime Minister in 1936 following the fall of the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]].

Sansom]], World War II ended in June 1940 when the [[British government]], under the leadership of Lord Halifax, signed a peace treaty with [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] in [[Berlin]]. Due to poor health, Halifax resigned as Prime Minister in 1941 and was succeeded by Lloyd George, who was then 78 years old. His second term as Prime Minister lasted until his death in 1945. He was succeeded by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who served in that position until October 1953.\n\n* '''[[George Grenville]]'''\n:* In ''[[The Two Georges]]'', co-authored by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], George Grenville is mentioned as never having become Prime Minister, which prevents the [[American Revolution]] and leads to the creation of the North American Union, a self-governing dominion within the [[British Empire]].\n\n* '''[[Roy Hattersley]]'''\n:* In the [[Jeffrey Archer]] novel ''[[The Prodigal Daughter]]'', Hattersley was the Prime Minister.\n\n* '''[[Denis Healey]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in the 1987 graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s short story \"The Germans Won\"\n\n* '''[[David Irving]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in ''[[The Mirage (Ruff novel)|The Mirage]]'' by [[Matt Ruff]]\n:* In an [[alternate history]] where [[Israel]] was established in [[Germany]], he is one of a number of European and North American leaders to call for Israel's destruction.\n\n* '''[[Ken Livingstone]]'''\n:* In the 2025 episode of the satirical 1994 BBC Radio 4 comedy series ''[[A Look Back at the Nineties|A Look Back at the Future]]'', Ken Livingstone becomes Prime Minister and head of a radical left-leaning government whose policies include the reduction of the powers and privileges of the monarchy. A second [[War of the Three Kingdoms|English Civil War]] is sparked at an extremely frugal [[State Opening of Parliament]], resulting in the exile of King [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles III]] to a remote Scottish island (Livingstone having remembered midway through the royal execution his objections to the [[death penalty]]), the abolition of the monarchy, the establishment of a republican [[The Protectorate|Commonwealth]] and the elevation of Livingstone to [[Lord Protector]].\n\n* '''[[Lord Milner]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in 1926, in the [[Alternative History]]/[[Time Travel]] story \"A Slip in Time\" by [[S. M. Stirling]],<ref>Published in \"Multiverse:Exploring [[Poul Anderson]]'s worlds, edited by [[Greg Bear]] and [[Gardner Dozois]], [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014</ref> featuring a history in which the [[First World War]] was avoided and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] survived. \n:* The story, takes place mainly in the alternate [[Vienna]]. A Vienna paper read by one of the characters makes a reference to \"Lord Milner, the British Prime Minister, considering the lifting of [[Irish War of Independence|martial law in Ireland]] if there were no more outrages\". \n:* In actual history, Lord Milner died in 1925 of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], with which he was infected during a visit to South Africa. Evidently, in the history where he became PM that visit was avoided and he survived.\n\n* '''[[Iain Macleod]]'''\n:* In [[Michael P.

[[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] is still on the throne after his marriage, Winston Churchill is a prisoner on the [[Isle of Man]], and Prime Minister Mosley is conspiring with Adolf Hitler about the fate of Britain's Jewish population.\n:*In [[Philip Roth]]'s ''[[The Plot Against America]]'', a secret pact between [[Charles Lindbergh]] who becomes [[President of the United States]] and Hitler includes an agreement to impose Mosley as the ruler of a German-occupied Britain with America's blessing after a ruse in which Lindbergh convinces Churchill to negotiate peace with Hitler, which deliberately fails \u2014 mirroring the dishonesty and repudiation of key Hitler-signed treaties, the [[Munich Conference]] Accord and [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].\n:* In [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[The Bloody Red Baron]]'', Mosley is shot down and killed in 1918 by Erich von Stalheim (from the ''[[Biggles]]'' series by [[W. E. Johns]]) and a character later comments that \"a career has been ended before it was begun.\"\n:* In the [[Elseworlds]] comic ''[[Superman: War of the Worlds]]'', Mosley becomes Prime Minister after the defeat of the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] invasion of 1938.\n:* In the alternate history novel ''The Man Who Prevented WW2'' by [[Roy Carter]], Mosley became Prime Minister when the British Union of Fascists won the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] and remained in office until his death in March 1980. He forged an alliance with [[Nazi Germany]], [[Fascist Italian|Fascist Italy]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] and went to war with the [[Irish Free State]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Greece]].

This is done either as a [[near future]] or [[alternate history]] scenario, or occasionally for humorous purposes. Also included are actual British Prime Ministers with a fictional premiership at a different time and/or under different circumstances than the one in actual history.\n\n*'''[[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook]]'''\n:* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Dominion (Sansom novel)|Dominion]]'' by [[C. J. Sansom]], World War II ended in June 1940 when the [[British government]], under the leadership of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], signed a peace treaty with [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] in [[Berlin]]. Due to poor health, Halifax resigned as Prime Minister in 1941 and was succeeded by the 78-year-old [[David Lloyd George]]. Following Lloyd George's death in 1945, Beaverbrook became Prime Minister. He led a coalition government which consisted of the pro-Treaty factions of the Conservatives and Labour as well as the [[British Union of Fascists]]. In November 1952, Beaverbrook made an agreement to transport all [[British Jews]] to the [[Isle of Wight]], which was under Nazi control, so that they could be sent to the [[concentration camp]]s of [[Eastern Europe]]. In return, the Nazis allowed the UK greater freedom when it came to trading with the rest of Europe.

Brown falls victim to the infected due to an internal outbreak within the bunker, leading to the near total collapse of the British government.\n:* Prime Minister in ''[[The Trial of Tony Blair]]'', portrayed by [[Peter Mullan]]. He succeeds [[Tony Blair]] (played by [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]]) in 2010 (having stayed on as Prime Minister for longer to oversee the government's handling of the invasion of Iraq and the resulting terror attacks on London). Brown wins the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]] over the Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] (played by [[Alexander Armstrong]]) but only by a razor-thin majority of two seats after Blair leaked memos from Brown as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] saying that tax increases were inevitable, having feared that Brown would win a larger parliamentary than he ever did. After that, Brown manipulates events to ensure that Blair is charged for war crimes and put on trial at [[International Court of Justice|The Hague]]. Whilst visiting Blair in hospital, Brown says that he will base his premiership on 'honesty' as opposed to charisma as Blair had done.\n\n* '''[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]\n:* Party: Industrial Radicals\n:* In an alternate history where Charles Babbage managed to build a functioning [[analytical engine]], Brunel is granted a meritocratic lordship and succeeds Lord Byron as Prime Minister after his death in 1855 during the 'Great Stink' and the resultant civil and political unrest.\n\n* '''[[Rab Butler]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in ''[[Random Quest]]'' by [[John Wyndham]]\n:* In a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] in which [[World War II]] never happened, Butler was Prime Minister in 1954.\n\n* '''[[Lord Byron]]'''\n:* Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Industrialists in ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]].\n:* Became Prime Minister in a reality where Charles Babbage managed to build a functioning analytical engine, bringing about the Information Age a hundred-and-fifty years early.

He would seemingly govern for twenty-five years until his death in 1855 during the 'Great Stink'.\n\n* '''[[Winston Churchill]]'''\n:* In the ''[[Southern Victory Series]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], where the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] won the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], the British Empire and the rest of the [[Allies of World War I|Quadruple Entente]] lost the [[Great War (series)|First Great War]] to the [[Central Powers]] (dominated by the United States and Germany), resulting in the loss of several territories, most notably [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]]. Churchill becomes Prime Minister in 1935 with his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] going into coalition with the [[British Union of Fascists|Silvershirts]], making Oswald Mosley [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and de facto Deputy Prime Minister. The authoritarian Churchill leads Britain into a disastrous [[Settling Accounts|second war against the Central Powers]], resulting in the German superbombings of [[London]], [[Brighton]] and [[Norwich]] and the replacement of him by [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]] as Prime Minister.\n:*In [[Michael Arlen]]'s 1934 novel ''Hell! Said the Duchess'', Churchill becomes Prime Minister in 1936 following the fall of the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]].

Sansom]], World War II ended in June 1940 when the [[British government]], under the leadership of Lord Halifax, signed a peace treaty with [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] in [[Berlin]].

A second [[War of the Three Kingdoms|English Civil War]] is sparked at an extremely frugal [[State Opening of Parliament]], resulting in the exile of King [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles III]] to a remote Scottish island (Livingstone having remembered midway through the royal execution his objections to the [[death penalty]]), the abolition of the monarchy, the establishment of a republican [[The Protectorate|Commonwealth]] and the elevation of Livingstone to [[Lord Protector]].\n\n* '''[[Lord Milner]]'''\n:* Prime Minister in 1926, in the [[Alternative History]]/[[Time Travel]] story \"A Slip in Time\" by [[S. M. Stirling]],<ref>Published in \"Multiverse:Exploring [[Poul Anderson]]'s worlds, edited by [[Greg Bear]] and [[Gardner Dozois]], [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014</ref> featuring a history in which the [[First World War]] was avoided and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] survived. \n:* The story, takes place mainly in the alternate [[Vienna]].

[[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] is still on the throne after his marriage, Winston Churchill is a prisoner on the [[Isle of Man]], and Prime Minister Mosley is conspiring with Adolf Hitler about the fate of Britain's Jewish population.\n:*In [[Philip Roth]]'s ''[[The Plot Against America]]'', a secret pact between [[Charles Lindbergh]] who becomes [[President of the United States]] and Hitler includes an agreement to impose Mosley as the ruler of a German-occupied Britain with America's blessing after a ruse in which Lindbergh convinces Churchill to negotiate peace with Hitler, which deliberately fails \u2014 mirroring the dishonesty and repudiation of key Hitler-signed treaties, the [[Munich Conference]] Accord and [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].\n:* In [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[The Bloody Red Baron]]'', Mosley is shot down and killed in 1918 by Erich von Stalheim (from the ''[[Biggles]]'' series by [[W. E. Johns]]) and a character later comments that \"a career has been ended before it was begun.\"\n:* In the [[Elseworlds]] comic ''[[Superman: War of the Worlds]]'', Mosley becomes Prime Minister after the defeat of the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] invasion of 1938.\n:* In the alternate history novel ''The Man Who Prevented WW2'' by [[Roy Carter]], Mosley became Prime Minister when the British Union of Fascists won the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] and remained in office until his death in March 1980.

In [[Venezuela]], pulp dishes are prepared with coconut milk and shredded fish in a dish called ''mojito en coco''. In [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]], the grated flesh of coconut and coconut milk are used to make sweet ''titot\u00e9''.\n\nCoconut milk is used to make traditional Venezuelan dishes such as ''majarete'' (a typical Venezuelan dessert), and ''arroz con coco'' (the Venezuelan version of coconut rice).\n\n===Drink===\n[[File:Cendol in a Glass.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Cendol]]'', a green jelly drink in iced coconut milk and palm sugar]]\nIn [[Southeast Asia]], coconut milk is used to make many traditional drinks. ''[[Cendol]]'' is a popular iced drink from this region containing chilled coconut milk and green jellies made of rice flour. Coconut milk is also used in hot drinks such as ''[[bandrek]]'' and ''bajigur'', two popular drinks from Indonesia. Sweetened coconut milk, and coconut milk diluted with water are two popular coconut beverages in [[southern China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nThe jelly-like pulp from the inside of the coconut is often added to coconut water to make a tropical drink.

[[Madhvacharya]] (1238\u20131317) was the chief proponent of [[Dvaita Vedanta|Tattvavada]] (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as [[Dvaita]] or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy&nbsp;\u2014 one of the three most influential [[Vedanta]] philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the [[Bhakti movement]]. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of [[Vayu]] (Mukhyaprana), after [[Hanuman]] and [[Bhima]]. The [[Haridasa]] devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.\n\nThis movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally \"servants of Lord Hari\") and took shape in the 13th century \u2013 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as [[Dasa Sahitya]] literature of the servants of the Lord. [[Purandara Dasa|Purandaradasa]] is widely recognised as the ''\"Pithamaha\"'' of [[Carnatic Music|Carnatic music]] for his immense contribution. [[Ramanujacharya]], the leading expounder of ''[[Vishishtadvaita]]'', spent many years in [[Melkote]]. He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the [[Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple]] and a well-organised ''matha'' were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, [[Vishnuvardhana]].<ref name=\"Kamath\">Kamath (2001), pp. 150\u2013152</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth century, [[Lingayatism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of ''\"Vachana Sahitya\"'' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear ''Ishtalinga'' i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. [[Basava]] shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaayaka Tatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith which today counts millions among its followers.<ref name=\"basava\">Kamath (2001), pp. 152\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Jain]] philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Islam]], which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name=\"bam\">Sastri (1955), p. 396.</ref> [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1545.<ref name=\"chris\">Sastri (1955), p. 398.</ref>\n\n[[Buddhism]] was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as [[Gulbarga|Kalaburagi]] and [[Banavasi]].

It was [[Unification of Karnataka|formed]] on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act]]. Originally known as the [[Mysore State|State of Mysore]], it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973. The state corresponds to the [[Carnatic region]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bangalore]].\n\nKarnataka is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Telangana]] to the northeast, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the south. The state covers an area of {{convert|191976|km2|mi2}}, or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the [[List of states of India by area|sixth largest Indian state by area]]. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the [[List of states of India by population|eighth largest state by population]], comprising 30 [[Districts of India|districts]].

Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the [[Bay of Bengal]].\n\nThough [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''n\u0101du'', meaning \"elevated land\". ''Karu Nadu'' may also be read as ''karu'', meaning \"black\" and ''nadu'', meaning \"region\", as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayalu Seeme]] region of the state. The [[British Raj|British]] used the word [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], sometimes ''Karnatak'', to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.<ref>See [[Lord Macaulay]]'s life of Clive and James Talboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98.

[[Madhvacharya]] (1238\u20131317) was the chief proponent of [[Dvaita Vedanta|Tattvavada]] (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as [[Dvaita]] or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy&nbsp;\u2014 one of the three most influential [[Vedanta]] philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the [[Bhakti movement]]. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of [[Vayu]] (Mukhyaprana), after [[Hanuman]] and [[Bhima]]. The [[Haridasa]] devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.\n\nThis movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally \"servants of Lord Hari\") and took shape in the 13th century \u2013 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as [[Dasa Sahitya]] literature of the servants of the Lord. [[Purandara Dasa|Purandaradasa]] is widely recognised as the ''\"Pithamaha\"'' of [[Carnatic Music|Carnatic music]] for his immense contribution. [[Ramanujacharya]], the leading expounder of ''[[Vishishtadvaita]]'', spent many years in [[Melkote]]. He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the [[Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple]] and a well-organised ''matha'' were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, [[Vishnuvardhana]].<ref name=\"Kamath\">Kamath (2001), pp. 150\u2013152</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth century, [[Lingayatism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of ''\"Vachana Sahitya\"'' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear ''Ishtalinga'' i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. [[Basava]] shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaayaka Tatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith which today counts millions among its followers.<ref name=\"basava\">Kamath (2001), pp. 152\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Jain]] philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Islam]], which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name=\"bam\">Sastri (1955), p. 396.</ref> [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1545.<ref name=\"chris\">Sastri (1955), p. 398.</ref>\n\n[[Buddhism]] was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as [[Gulbarga]] and [[Banavasi]].

He was on roster exemption for the season opener game against the [[Denver Broncos]] on September 13, then was added to the active roster the next day and returned to practice in week 7, being inactive for Games 2-10. He played in Games 11-16, and was credited with one start. He made his NFL debut on November 29 against the [[Cleveland Browns]]. On December 13, 2009, Smith was credited with his first official start when usual starting right tackle [[Dennis Roland]] lined up as the extra tight end in the Bengals unbalanced line. He supported three individual 100-yard rushing efforts over the season\u2019s final six games, and aided a Bengals playoff record of 169 rushing yards by running back [[Cedric Benson]] in the wild card playoff game against the [[New York Jets]].\n\n====2010 season====\nIn his second season with the Bengals, Smith claimed the starting right tackle position, playing in Weeks 6, 7, and 8, but then suffered a foot fracture (fifth metatarsal) in practice on November 10, forcing the Bengals to place him on injured reserve with a broken foot and effectively ending his season after playing in seven of the eight regular season games to that date.<ref>http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/11/13/bengals-officially-end-andre-smiths-season/</ref>\n\n====2011 season====\nIn the 2011 preseason, it was reported that Smith was working out and getting fully fit. It was also reported that in the preseason, he spoke with the Bengals starting left tackle, [[Andrew Whitworth]], about how \"it's my time to step up.\" The 2011 season became Smith's breakout year, and he became the starting right tackle for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. He started there in games 1-12 and 15-16, as well as the wild card playoff game, contributing to pass protection that ranked tied for fourth in the NFL in fewest sacks allowed (25). He was inactive for games 13-14 due to an ankle injury. In week 1 at Cleveland, he averted a giveaway by recovering an [[Andy Dalton]] fumble at the Bengals eight-yard line. In week 6 against the [[Indianapolis Colts]], he supported a pass-protection effort that held the Colts for the first time on the season without a sack, playing primarily against All-Pro defensive end [[Robert Mathis]]. He aided a 165-yard rushing effort in week 16 against the [[Arizona Cardinals]].\n\n====2012 season====\nIn 2012, Smith started all 16 games, including the wild card playoff game. He helped running back [[BenJarvus Green-Ellis]] rank first in the league in third-and-one rushing conversions (93.3 percent success rate, on 14 of 15) and was part of a run-blocking effort for Green-Ellis to gain at least 100 yards four times in a five-game stretch (Games 10-12 and 14), with 168.2 team average in that span. He also supported a season-best 221 rushing yards, with 6.5 average, on November 25 against the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\n====2013 season====\n[[File:Andre Smith (offensive tackle) 2013.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Smith with the Cincinnati Bengals in [[2013 Cincinnati Bengals season|2013]].]]\nOn April 26, 2013, Smith re-signed with the Bengals. It was reported by [[NFL.com]]'s [[Ian Rapoport]] that Smith agreed to a three-year, $18 million contract during the second round of the [[2013 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Sessler |first=Marc |title=Andre Smith signs contract with Cincinnati Bengals |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000164327/article/andre-smith-cincinnati-bengals-agree-to-contract |publisher=NFL.com |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref> He started in games 1-11 and 13-16 at right tackle, and came off bench in week 12, helping the Bengals rank tied for sixth in scoring and tenth in net offense. He was a key cog in pass protection, allowing only one sack over games 11-14, tying a team record for fewest sacks allowed in a four-game span. On September 16 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], he helped the offensive line allow no sacks with 407 net yards. He aided a blocking effort in week 6 at Buffalo in which the Bengals offense tallied a season-high in total net yards with 483 yards, including season-highs in both rushing (165) and passing (318). On October 27 against the [[New York Jets]], he contributed to pass protection allowing only one sack for two yards as [[Andy Dalton]] threw for a career-best five touchdown passes. In week 14 against Indianapolis, he helped keep Dalton sack-free for the third straight game and supported a 155-yard rushing effort, and Dalton was named AFC Offensive Player of Week with a 120.5 passer rating. In the wild card playoff game on January 5, 2014, he contributed to a 439-yard offensive output against the [[San Diego Chargers]].\n\n====2014 season====\nSmith missed all of the 2014 preseason while rehabbing from a concussion, but was able to start in the season opener game. He played and started in nine games played on the season. He was inactive for games 9-10, and was placed on Reserve/Injured list on November 25, following a triceps injury suffered in week 11. He played a key role in the Bengals pass protection for the nine games he played, helping the Bengals finish the season ranked third in the NFL in fewest sacks allowed with 23 and in least sack yardage allowed (123 yards). He was part of an offensive line that allowed no sacks in the first three weeks of the season for first time in franchise history. He was credited by coaches with the key block on [[Giovani Bernard]]\u2019s 89-yard touchdown run, the second-longest in Bengals history, on October 12 against the [[Carolina Panthers]].

He was on roster exemption for the season opener game against the [[Denver Broncos]] on September 13, then was added to the active roster the next day and returned to practice in week 7, being inactive for Games 2-10. He played in Games 11-16, and was credited with one start. He made his NFL debut on November 29 against the [[Cleveland Browns]]. On December 13, 2009, Smith was credited with his first official start when usual starting right tackle [[Dennis Roland]] lined up as the extra tight end in the Bengals unbalanced line. He supported three individual 100-yard rushing efforts over the season\u2019s final six games, and aided a Bengals playoff record of 169 rushing yards by running back [[Cedric Benson]] in the wild card playoff game against the [[New York Jets]].\n\n====2010 season====\nIn his second season with the Bengals, Smith claimed the starting right tackle position, playing in Weeks 6, 7, and 8, but then suffered a foot fracture (fifth metatarsal) in practice on November 10, forcing the Bengals to place him on injured reserve with a broken foot and effectively ending his season after playing in seven of the eight regular season games to that date.<ref>http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/11/13/bengals-officially-end-andre-smiths-season/</ref>\n\n====2011 season====\nIn the 2011 preseason, it was reported that Smith was working out and getting fully fit. It was also reported that in the preseason, he spoke with the Bengals starting left tackle, [[Andrew Whitworth]], about how \"it's my time to step up.\" The 2011 season became Smith's breakout year, and he became the starting right tackle for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. He started there in games 1-12 and 15-16, as well as the wild card playoff game, contributing to pass protection that ranked tied for fourth in the NFL in fewest sacks allowed (25). He was inactive for games 13-14 due to an ankle injury. In week 1 at Cleveland, he averted a giveaway by recovering an [[Andy Dalton]] fumble at the Bengals eight-yard line. In week 6 against the [[Indianapolis Colts]], he supported a pass-protection effort that held the Colts for the first time on the season without a sack, playing primarily against All-Pro defensive end [[Robert Mathis]]. He aided a 165-yard rushing effort in week 16 against the [[Arizona Cardinals]].\n\n====2012 season====\nIn 2012, Smith started all 16 games, including the wild card playoff game. He helped running back [[BenJarvus Green-Ellis]] rank first in the league in third-and-one rushing conversions (93.3 percent success rate, on 14 of 15) and was part of a run-blocking effort for Green-Ellis to gain at least 100 yards four times in a five-game stretch (Games 10-12 and 14), with 168.2 team average in that span. He also supported a season-best 221 rushing yards, with 6.5 average, on November 25 against the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\n====2013 season====\n[[File:Andre Smith (offensive tackle) 2013.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Smith with the Cincinnati Bengals in [[2013 Cincinnati Bengals season|2013]].]]\nOn April 26, 2013, Smith re-signed with the Bengals.

He was a key cog in pass protection, allowing only one sack over games 11-14, tying a team record for fewest sacks allowed in a four-game span. On September 16 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], he helped the offensive line allow no sacks with 407 net yards. He aided a blocking effort in week 6 at Buffalo in which the Bengals offense tallied a season-high in total net yards with 483 yards, including season-highs in both rushing (165) and passing (318). On October 27 against the [[New York Jets]], he contributed to pass protection allowing only one sack for two yards as [[Andy Dalton]] threw for a career-best five touchdown passes. In week 14 against Indianapolis, he helped keep Dalton sack-free for the third straight game and supported a 155-yard rushing effort, and Dalton was named AFC Offensive Player of Week with a 120.5 passer rating. In the wild card playoff game on January 5, 2014, he contributed to a 439-yard offensive output against the [[San Diego Chargers]].\n\n====2014 season====\nSmith missed all of the 2014 preseason while rehabbing from a concussion, but was able to start in the season opener game. He played and started in nine games played on the season. He was inactive for games 9-10, and was placed on Reserve/Injured list on November 25, following a triceps injury suffered in week 11. He played a key role in the Bengals pass protection for the nine games he played, helping the Bengals finish the season ranked third in the NFL in fewest sacks allowed with 23 and in least sack yardage allowed (123 yards). He was part of an offensive line that allowed no sacks in the first three weeks of the season for first time in franchise history. He was credited by coaches with the key block on [[Giovani Bernard]]\u2019s 89-yard touchdown run, the second-longest in Bengals history, on October 12 against the [[Carolina Panthers]]. He helped pave the way for three one-yard touchdown runs in goal line situations in week 8 against the [[Baltimore Ravens]], including the game-winning touchdown by [[Andy Dalton]] on a fourth-and-one situation late in the fourth quarter.\n\n====2015 season====\nSmith started in 14 games (Games 1-7 and 10-16) at right tackle, and also started wild card playoff game. He missed games 8-9 due to a concussion suffered on November 1 at Pittsburgh. On September 13 at Oakland, he helped lead pass protection that allowed no sacks and supported 396 yards of net offense. The following week, he contributed with a second straight sack-free game against the [[San Diego Chargers]], in which the rushing offense put up 175 yards on the ground. In week 3, he provided pass protection for [[Andy Dalton]] to register a career-high 383 yards on September 27 against the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The next week against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], he provided a key block for a 13-yard touchdown run by [[Giovani Bernard]] and helped allow no sacks as Bengals posted the first game in franchise history with more than 300 net passing yards (321) and four rushing touchdowns. On October 11 against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], he helped the offense accumulate 419 total yards and score 17 points in the fourth quarter to overcome a 24-7 deficit. In week 6 at Buffalo, he helped allow no sacks as Andy Dalton posted 118.6 passer rating, with three scores and no interceptions. He supported a season-high passer rating (146.8) for Andy Dalton on December 6 at Cleveland, with only one sack allowed. On Dec 20 at San Francisco, he supported a 115.6 passer rating for [[AJ McCarron]] in his first NFL start.\n\n===Minnesota Vikings===\nOn March 18, 2016, Smith signed a one-year contract with the [[Minnesota Vikings]] worth up to $3.5 million with $500,000 guaranteed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vikings.com/news/article-1/Vikings-Sign-T-Andre-Smith/1aa37bfc-0a0d-4b3e-87dc-eb6223a9be82|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623033830/http://www.vikings.com/news/article-1/Vikings-Sign-T-Andre-Smith/1aa37bfc-0a0d-4b3e-87dc-eb6223a9be82|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 23, 2016|title=Vikings Sign T Andre Smith|website=Vikings.com|access-date=March 19, 2016|date=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSmith's first season with the Vikings was cut short after suffering a season-ending triceps injury in Week 4.
