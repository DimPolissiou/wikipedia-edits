[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Insects and small vertebrates make up its diet. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].

Described as ''bistarda deserti'', it was mistaken for a [[bustard]]. Frederick most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th-century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to this species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow [[cere]]. The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short and stout so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet.

They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Insects and small vertebrates make up its diet. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].

Described as ''bistarda deserti'', it was mistaken for a [[bustard]]. Frederick most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th-century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to this species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow [[cere]]. The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short and stout so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet.

They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

G. Wells]]'s novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898). It was performed and broadcast live as a Halloween episode at 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 30, 1938, over the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] radio network. The episode became famous for allegedly causing panic among its listening audience, though the scale of that panic is disputed, as the program had relatively few listeners.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\">{{cite news|last1=Pooley|first1=Jefferson|last2=Socolow|first2=Michael|title=The Myth of the ''War of the Worlds'' Panic |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/history/2013/10/orson_welles_war_of_the_worlds_panic_myth_the_infamous_radio_broadcast_did.single.html |newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]] |date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe one-hour program began with the theme music for the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' and an announcement that the evening's show was an adaptation of ''The War of the Worlds''. Orson Welles then read a prologue which was closely based on the opening of H. G. Wells' novel modified slightly to move the story's setting to 1939. For about the next twenty minutes, the broadcast was presented as a typical evening of radio programming being interrupted by a series of news bulletins. The first few news flashes occur during a presentation of \"live\" music and describe a series of odd explosions observed on Mars, followed by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. The musical program returns briefly before being interrupted by a live report from Grover's Mill, where police officials and a crowd of curious onlookers have surrounded the strange cylindrical object that fell from the sky. The situation escalates when Martians emerge from the cylinder and attack using a heat-ray, which the panicked reporter at the scene describes until his audio feed abruptly goes dead. This is followed by a rapid series of increasingly alarming news updates detailing a devastating alien invasion taking place around the world and the futile efforts of the U.S. military to stop it. The first portion of the show climaxes with another live report from a Manhattan rooftop as giant Martian war machines release clouds of poisonous smoke across New York City. The reporter on the scene describes desperate citizens fleeing as the smoke approaches his location until he coughs and falls silent, after which the program took its first break. During the second half of the show, the style shifts to a more conventional [[radio drama]] format and follows a survivor (played by Welles) dealing with the aftermath of the invasion and the ongoing Martian occupation of Earth. As in the original novel, the story ends with the discovery that the Martians have been defeated by microbes rather than by humans.\n\nWelles's \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast has become famous for supposedly tricking some of its listeners into believing that a Martian invasion was actually taking place due to the \"breaking news\" style of storytelling employed in the first half of the show. The illusion of realism was furthered because the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes after the introduction. Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience may have been listening to ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]'' with [[Edgar Bergen]] and tuned in to \"The War of the Worlds\" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction indicating that the show was a drama; however, contemporary research suggests that this happened only in rare instances.<ref name=\"Schwartz BH\">{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=A.

The announcer introduces Orson Welles:\n\n<blockquote>We know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the 39th year of the 20th century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October. Business was better. The [[timeline of events preceding World War II|war scare]] was over. More men were back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular evening, October 30th, the [[Crossley ratings|Crossley service]] estimated that 32 million people were listening in on radios\u2026<ref name=\"Houseman RT\"/>{{Rp|394\u2013395}}<ref name=WellesNet/></blockquote>\n\nThe radio program begins as a simulation of a normal evening radio broadcast featuring a weather report and music by \"Ramon Raquello and His Orchestra\" live from a local hotel ballroom. After a few minutes, the music begins to be interrupted by several [[news flash]]es about strange gas explosions on [[Mars]]. An interview is arranged with reporter Carl Phillips and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-based Professor of [[Astronomy]] Richard Pierson, who dismisses speculation about life on Mars. The musical program returns temporarily but is interrupted again by news of a strange meteorite landing in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. Phillips and Pierson are dispatched to the site, where a large crowd has gathered. Philips describes the chaotic atmosphere around the strange cylindrical object, and Pierson admits that he does not know exactly what it is, but that it seems to be made of an extraterrestrial metal. The cylinder unscrews, and Phillips describes the tentacled, horrific \"monster\" that emerges from inside. Police officers approach the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] waving a [[flag of truce]], but the invaders respond by firing a [[Heat-Ray|heat ray]], which incinerates the delegation and ignites the nearby woods and cars as the crowd screams. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off mid-sentence, and after a moment of [[dead air]], an announcer explains that the remote broadcast was interrupted due to \"some difficulty with our field transmission.\"\n\nAfter a brief \"piano interlude\", regular programming breaks down as the studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates. A shaken Pierson speculates about Martian technology. The New Jersey [[National Guard of the United States|state militia]] declares [[martial law]] and attacks the cylinder; a captain from their field headquarters lectures about the overwhelming force of properly-equipped infantry and the helplessness of the Martians, until a [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]] rises from the pit. The tripod obliterates the militia, and the studio returns, now describing the Martians as an invading army. Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports as thousands of refugees clog the highways. Three Martian tripods from the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads, reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|Great Swamp]] near [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], as gas explosions continue. The [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] addresses the nation.\n\nA live connection is established to a [[field artillery]] battery in the [[Watchung Mountains]]. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a release of poisonous [[black smoke]], before fading into the sound of coughing. The lead plane of a wing of bombers from [[Langley Field|Langham Field]] broadcasts its approach and remains on the air as their engines are burned by the heat ray and the plane dives on the invaders. Radio operators go active and fall silent. Although the bombers manage to destroy one machine, the remaining five are spreading black smoke across the [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Jersey Marshes]] into [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].\n\nEventually, a news reporter, broadcasting from atop the [[CBS Building|Broadcasting Building]], describes the Martian invasion of New York City \u2013 \"five great machines\" wading the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] \"like [men] wading through a brook\", black smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the [[East River]] \"like rats\", others in [[Times Square]] \"falling like flies\". He reads a final bulletin stating that Martian cylinders have fallen all over the country, then describes the smoke approaching down the street until he has a coughing fit and falls silent, leaving only the sounds of the city under attack in the background. Finally, a [[ham radio]] operator is heard calling, \"2X2L calling CQ, New York. Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone?\"\n\nAfter a period of silence comes the voice of announcer Dan Seymour:\n\n<blockquote>You are listening to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'', in an original dramatization of ''The War of the Worlds'' by H. G. Wells. The performance will continue after a brief intermission. This is the Columbia Broadcasting System.</blockquote>\n\nThe last third of the program is a monologue and dialogue. Professor Pierson, having survived the attack on Grover's Mill, attempts to make contact with other humans. In Newark, he encounters an opportunistic militiaman who holds fascist ideals in regards to man's relationship with the Martians, and intends to use Martian weaponry to take control of both species. Declaring that he wants no part of \"his world\", Pierson leaves the stranger with his delusions. His journey takes him to the ruins of New York, where he discovers that the Martians have died \u2013 as with the novel, they fell victim to earthly [[pathogenic]] [[Microorganism|germs]], to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Life eventually returns to normal, and Pierson finishes writing his recollections of the invasion and its aftermath.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the play, Welles reassumed his role as host and told listeners that the broadcast was a Halloween concoction: the equivalent, he says, \"of dressing up in a sheet, jumping out of a bush and saying, 'Boo!'\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Howard | year=1970 | title=The Panic Broadcast: Portrait of an Event| location= Boston | publisher=Little, Brown and Company | isbn=0-316-50060-7}}</ref> Popular mythology holds the disclaimer was hastily added to the broadcast at the insistence of CBS executives, as they became aware of panic inspired by the program. In fact, at the station break, network executive Davidson Taylor had attempted to prevent Welles, who had added the speech at the last minute, from reading it on air for fear of exposing the network to legal liability, but Welles delivered it anyway.<ref name=\"Schwartz BH\" />{{Rp|95\u201396}}\n\n===Announcements===\nRadio programming charts in Sunday newspapers listed the CBS drama, \"The War of the Worlds\".

At the time, many Americans assumed that a significant number of ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners changed stations when the first comic sketch ended and a musical number by [[Nelson Eddy]] began and then tuned in \"The War of the Worlds\" after the opening announcements, but historian A. Brad Schwartz, after studying hundreds of letters from people who heard \"The War of the Worlds\", as well as contemporary audience surveys, concluded that very few people frightened by Welles's broadcast had tuned out Bergen's program. \"All the hard evidence suggests that ''The Chase & Sanborn Hour'' was only a minor contributing factor to the Martian hysteria,\" he wrote. \"...{{nbsp}}in truth, there was no mass exodus from [[Charlie McCarthy]] to Orson Welles that night.\"<ref name=\"Schwartz BH\" />{{Rp|67\u201369}} Because the broadcast was unsponsored, Welles and company could schedule breaks at will, rather than arranging them around advertisements.

After analyzing those letters, A. Brad Schwartz concluded that although the broadcast briefly misled a significant portion of its audience, very few of those listeners fled their homes or otherwise panicked. The total number of protest letters sent to Welles and the FCC is also low in comparison with other controversial radio broadcasts of the period, further suggesting the audience was small and the fright severely limited.<ref name=\"Schwartz BH\"/>{{Rp|82\u201393}}<ref name=\"Schwartz VF\"/>\n\nFive thousand households were telephoned that night in a survey conducted by the [[C.

About 98% of respondents said they were listening to other radio programming (''The Chase and Sanborn Hour'' was by far the most popular program in that timeslot) or not listening to the radio at all. Further shrinking the potential audience, some CBS network affiliates, including some in large markets such as [[Boston metropolitan area|Boston]]'s [[WEZE|WEEI]], had pre-empted ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', in favor of local commercial programming.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\"/>\n\nBen Gross, radio editor for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', wrote in his 1954 memoir that the streets were nearly deserted as he made his way to the studio for the end of the program.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\"/> Producer John Houseman reported that the Mercury Theatre staff was surprised when they were finally released from the CBS studios to find life going on as usual in the streets of New York.<ref name=\"Houseman RT\"/>{{Rp|404}} The writer of a letter that ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published later likewise recalled no panicked mobs in the capital's downtown streets at the time. \"The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast\", media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow wrote in ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' on its 75th anniversary in 2013; \"Almost nobody was fooled\".<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\"/>\n\nAccording to Campbell, the most common response said to indicate a panic was calling the local newspaper or police to confirm the story or seek additional information.

The response may have reflected newspaper publishers' fears that radio, to which they had lost some of the advertising revenue that was scarce enough during the [[Great Depression]], would render them obsolete. In \"The War of the Worlds,\" they saw an opportunity to cast aspersions on the newer medium: \"The nation as a whole continues to face the danger of incomplete, misunderstood news over a medium which has yet to prove that it is competent to perform the news job,\" wrote ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'', the newspaper industry's trade journal.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\" /><ref>Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment, and Future, by Stanley J. Baran, Dennis K. Davis</ref>\n\n[[William Randolph Hearst]]'s papers called on broadcasters to police themselves, lest the government step in, as Iowa Senator [[Clyde L. Herring]] proposed a bill that would have required all programming to be reviewed by the FCC prior to broadcast (he never actually introduced it). Others blamed the radio audience for its credulity. Noting that any intelligent listener would have realized the broadcast was fictional, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' opined, \"it would be more tactful to say that some members of the radio audience are a trifle retarded mentally, and that many a program is prepared for their consumption.\" Other newspapers took pains to note that anxious listeners had called ''their'' offices to learn whether Martians were really attacking.<ref name=GIW />\n\nFew contemporary accounts exist outside newspaper coverage of the mass panic and hysteria supposedly induced by the broadcast.

Its estimate of the program's audience is more than twice as high as any other at the time. Cantril himself conceded that, but argued that unlike [[C. E. Hooper|Hooper]], his estimate had attempted to capture the significant portion of the audience that did not have home telephones at that time. Since those respondents were contacted only after the media frenzy, Cantril allowed that their recollections could have been influenced by what they read in the newspapers. Claims that ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners, who missed the disclaimer at the beginning when they turned to CBS during a commercial break or musical performance on that show and thus mistook \"The War of the Worlds\" for a real broadcast inflated the show's audience and the ensuing alleged panic, are impossible to substantiate.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\" />\n\nApart from his admittedly-imperfect methods of estimating the audience and assessing the authenticity of their response, Pooley and Socolow found, Cantril made another error in typing audience reaction. Respondents had indicated a variety of reactions to the program, among them \"excited\", \"disturbed\", and \"frightened\". However, he included all of them with \"panicked\", failing to account for the possibility that despite their reaction, they were still aware the broadcast was staged. \"[T]hose who did hear it, looked at it as a prank and accepted it that way,\" recalled researcher Frank Stanton.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\" />\n\nBartholomew grants that hundreds of thousands were frightened, but calls evidence of people taking action based on their fear \"scant\" and \"anecdotal\".<ref name=Barth>{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Robert E. |title=Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion |year=2001 |publisher=Macfarland & Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0997-5 |pages=217ff}}</ref> Indeed, contemporary news articles indicate that police were swamped with hundreds of calls in numerous locations, but stories of people doing anything more than calling authorities involved mostly only small groups. Such stories were often reported by people who were panicking themselves.<ref name=\"GIW\" />\n\nLater investigations found much of the alleged panicked responses to have been exaggerated or mistaken. Cantril's researchers found that contrary to what had been claimed,  no admissions for shock were made at a Newark hospital during the broadcast; hospitals in New York City similarly reported no spike in admissions that night. A few suicide attempts seem to have been prevented when friends or family intervened, but no record of a successful one exists. A ''Washington Post'' claim that a man died of a heart attack brought on by listening to the program could not be verified.

G. Wells]]'s novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898). It was performed and broadcast live as a Halloween episode at 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 30, 1938, over the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] radio network. The episode became famous for allegedly causing panic among its listening audience, though the scale of that panic is disputed, as the program had relatively few listeners.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\">{{cite news|last1=Pooley|first1=Jefferson|last2=Socolow|first2=Michael|title=The Myth of the ''War of the Worlds'' Panic |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/history/2013/10/orson_welles_war_of_the_worlds_panic_myth_the_infamous_radio_broadcast_did.single.html |newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]] |date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe one-hour program began with the theme music for the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' and an announcement that the evening's show was an adaptation of ''The War of the Worlds''. Orson Welles then read a prologue which was closely based on the opening of H. G. Wells' novel modified slightly to move the story's setting to 1939. For about the next twenty minutes, the broadcast was presented as a typical evening of radio programming being interrupted by a series of news bulletins. The first few news flashes occur during a presentation of \"live\" music and describe a series of odd explosions observed on Mars, followed by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. The musical program returns briefly before being interrupted by a live report from Grover's Mill, where police officials and a crowd of curious onlookers have surrounded the strange cylindrical object that fell from the sky. The situation escalates when Martians emerge from the cylinder and attack using a heat-ray, which the panicked reporter at the scene describes until his audio feed abruptly goes dead. This is followed by a rapid series of increasingly alarming news updates detailing a devastating alien invasion taking place around the world and the futile efforts of the U.S. military to stop it. The first portion of the show climaxes with another live report from a Manhattan rooftop as giant Martian war machines release clouds of poisonous smoke across New York City. The reporter on the scene describes desperate citizens fleeing as the smoke approaches his location until he coughs and falls silent, after which the program took its first break. During the second half of the show, the style shifts to a more conventional [[radio drama]] format and follows a survivor (played by Welles) dealing with the aftermath of the invasion and the ongoing Martian occupation of Earth. As in the original novel, the story ends with the discovery that the Martians have been defeated by microbes rather than by humans.\n\nWelles's \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast has become famous for supposedly tricking some of its listeners into believing that a Martian invasion was actually taking place due to the \"breaking news\" style of storytelling employed in the first half of the show. The illusion of realism was furthered because the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes after the introduction. Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience may have been listening to ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]'' with [[Edgar Bergen]] and tuned in to \"The War of the Worlds\" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction indicating that the show was a drama; however, contemporary research suggests that this happened only in rare instances.<ref name=\"Schwartz BH\">{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=A.

We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the 39th year of the 20th century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October. Business was better. The [[timeline of events preceding World War II|war scare]] was over. More men were back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular evening, October 30th, the [[Crossley ratings|Crossley service]] estimated that 32 million people were listening in on radios\u2026<ref name=\"Houseman RT\"/>{{Rp|394\u2013395}}<ref name=WellesNet/></blockquote>\n\nThe radio program begins as a simulation of a normal evening radio broadcast featuring a weather report and music by \"Ramon Raquello and His Orchestra\" live from a local hotel ballroom. After a few minutes, the music begins to be interrupted by several [[news flash]]es about strange gas explosions on [[Mars]]. An interview is arranged with reporter Carl Phillips and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-based Professor of [[Astronomy]] Richard Pierson, who dismisses speculation about life on Mars. The musical program returns temporarily but is interrupted again by news of a strange meteorite landing in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. Phillips and Pierson are dispatched to the site, where a large crowd has gathered. Philips describes the chaotic atmosphere around the strange cylindrical object, and Pierson admits that he does not know exactly what it is, but that it seems to be made of an extraterrestrial metal. The cylinder unscrews, and Phillips describes the tentacled, horrific \"monster\" that emerges from inside. Police officers approach the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] waving a [[flag of truce]], but the invaders respond by firing a [[Heat-Ray|heat ray]], which incinerates the delegation and ignites the nearby woods and cars as the crowd screams. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off mid-sentence, and after a moment of [[dead air]], an announcer explains that the remote broadcast was interrupted due to \"some difficulty with our field transmission.\"\n\nAfter a brief \"piano interlude\", regular programming breaks down as the studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates. A shaken Pierson speculates about Martian technology. The New Jersey [[National Guard of the United States|state militia]] declares [[martial law]] and attacks the cylinder; a captain from their field headquarters lectures about the overwhelming force of properly-equipped infantry and the helplessness of the Martians, until a [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]] rises from the pit. The tripod obliterates the militia, and the studio returns, now describing the Martians as an invading army. Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports as thousands of refugees clog the highways. Three Martian tripods from the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads, reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|Great Swamp]] near [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], as gas explosions continue. The [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] addresses the nation.\n\nA live connection is established to a [[field artillery]] battery in the [[Watchung Mountains]]. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a release of poisonous [[black smoke]], before fading into the sound of coughing. The lead plane of a wing of bombers from [[Langley Field|Langham Field]] broadcasts its approach and remains on the air as their engines are burned by the heat ray and the plane dives on the invaders. Radio operators go active and fall silent. Although the bombers manage to destroy one machine, the remaining five are spreading black smoke across the [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Jersey Marshes]] into [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].\n\nEventually, a news reporter, broadcasting from atop the [[CBS Building|Broadcasting Building]], describes the Martian invasion of New York City \u2013 \"five great machines\" wading the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] \"like [men] wading through a brook\", black smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the [[East River]] \"like rats\", others in [[Times Square]] \"falling like flies\". He reads a final bulletin stating that Martian cylinders have fallen all over the country, then describes the smoke approaching down the street until he has a coughing fit and falls silent, leaving only the sounds of the city under attack in the background. Finally, a [[ham radio]] operator is heard calling, \"2X2L calling CQ, New York. Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone?\"\n\nAfter a period of silence comes the voice of announcer Dan Seymour:\n\n<blockquote>You are listening to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'', in an original dramatization of ''The War of the Worlds'' by H. G. Wells. The performance will continue after a brief intermission. This is the Columbia Broadcasting System.</blockquote>\n\nThe last third of the program is a monologue and dialogue. Professor Pierson, having survived the attack on Grover's Mill, attempts to make contact with other humans. In Newark, he encounters an opportunistic militiaman who holds fascist ideals in regards to man's relationship with the Martians, and intends to use Martian weaponry to take control of both species. Declaring that he wants no part of \"his world\", Pierson leaves the stranger with his delusions. His journey takes him to the ruins of New York, where he discovers that the Martians have died \u2013 as with the novel, they fell victim to earthly [[pathogenic]] [[Microorganism|germs]], to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Life eventually returns to normal, and Pierson finishes writing his recollections of the invasion and its aftermath.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the play, Welles reassumed his role as host and told listeners that the broadcast was a Halloween concoction: the equivalent, he says, \"of dressing up in a sheet, jumping out of a bush and saying, 'Boo!'\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Howard | year=1970 | title=The Panic Broadcast: Portrait of an Event| location= Boston | publisher=Little, Brown and Company | isbn=0-316-50060-7}}</ref> Popular mythology holds the disclaimer was hastily added to the broadcast at the insistence of CBS executives, as they became aware of panic inspired by the program.

At the time, many Americans assumed that a significant number of ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners changed stations when the first comic sketch ended and a musical number by [[Nelson Eddy]] began and then tuned in \"The War of the Worlds\" after the opening announcements, but historian A. Brad Schwartz, after studying hundreds of letters from people who heard \"The War of the Worlds\", as well as contemporary audience surveys, concluded that very few people frightened by Welles's broadcast had tuned out Bergen's program. \"All the hard evidence suggests that ''The Chase & Sanborn Hour'' was only a minor contributing factor to the Martian hysteria,\" he wrote. \"...{{nbsp}}in truth, there was no mass exodus from [[Charlie McCarthy]] to Orson Welles that night.\"<ref name=\"Schwartz BH\" />{{Rp|67\u201369}} Because the broadcast was unsponsored, Welles and company could schedule breaks at will, rather than arranging them around advertisements.

After analyzing those letters, A. Brad Schwartz concluded that although the broadcast briefly misled a significant portion of its audience, very few of those listeners fled their homes or otherwise panicked. The total number of protest letters sent to Welles and the FCC is also low in comparison with other controversial radio broadcasts of the period, further suggesting the audience was small and the fright severely limited.<ref name=\"Schwartz BH\"/>{{Rp|82\u201393}}<ref name=\"Schwartz VF\"/>\n\nFive thousand households were telephoned that night in a survey conducted by the [[C.

The response may have reflected newspaper publishers' fears that radio, to which they had lost some of the advertising revenue that was scarce enough during the [[Great Depression]], would render them obsolete. In \"The War of the Worlds,\" they saw an opportunity to cast aspersions on the newer medium: \"The nation as a whole continues to face the danger of incomplete, misunderstood news over a medium which has yet to prove that it is competent to perform the news job,\" wrote ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'', the newspaper industry's trade journal.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\" /><ref>Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment, and Future, by Stanley J.

Herring]] proposed a bill that would have required all programming to be reviewed by the FCC prior to broadcast (he never actually introduced it). Others blamed the radio audience for its credulity. Noting that any intelligent listener would have realized the broadcast was fictional, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' opined, \"it would be more tactful to say that some members of the radio audience are a trifle retarded mentally, and that many a program is prepared for their consumption.\" Other newspapers took pains to note that anxious listeners had called ''their'' offices to learn whether Martians were really attacking.<ref name=GIW />\n\nFew contemporary accounts exist outside newspaper coverage of the mass panic and hysteria supposedly induced by the broadcast.

Its estimate of the program's audience is more than twice as high as any other at the time. Cantril himself conceded that, but argued that unlike [[C. E. Hooper|Hooper]], his estimate had attempted to capture the significant portion of the audience that did not have home telephones at that time. Since those respondents were contacted only after the media frenzy, Cantril allowed that their recollections could have been influenced by what they read in the newspapers. Claims that ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners, who missed the disclaimer at the beginning when they turned to CBS during a commercial break or musical performance on that show and thus mistook \"The War of the Worlds\" for a real broadcast inflated the show's audience and the ensuing alleged panic, are impossible to substantiate.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\" />\n\nApart from his admittedly-imperfect methods of estimating the audience and assessing the authenticity of their response, Pooley and Socolow found, Cantril made another error in typing audience reaction. Respondents had indicated a variety of reactions to the program, among them \"excited\", \"disturbed\", and \"frightened\". However, he included all of them with \"panicked\", failing to account for the possibility that despite their reaction, they were still aware the broadcast was staged. \"[T]hose who did hear it, looked at it as a prank and accepted it that way,\" recalled researcher Frank Stanton.<ref name=\"2013 Slate article\" />\n\nBartholomew grants that hundreds of thousands were frightened, but calls evidence of people taking action based on their fear \"scant\" and \"anecdotal\".<ref name=Barth>{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Robert E. |title=Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion |year=2001 |publisher=Macfarland & Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0997-5 |pages=217ff}}</ref> Indeed, contemporary news articles indicate that police were swamped with hundreds of calls in numerous locations, but stories of people doing anything more than calling authorities involved mostly only small groups. Such stories were often reported by people who were panicking themselves.<ref name=\"GIW\" />\n\nLater investigations found much of the alleged panicked responses to have been exaggerated or mistaken. Cantril's researchers found that contrary to what had been claimed,  no admissions for shock were made at a Newark hospital during the broadcast; hospitals in New York City similarly reported no spike in admissions that night. A few suicide attempts seem to have been prevented when friends or family intervened, but no record of a successful one exists. A ''Washington Post'' claim that a man died of a heart attack brought on by listening to the program could not be verified.

Wells expressed good-natured skepticism about the actual extent of the panic caused by \"this sensational Halloween spree,\" saying: \"Are you sure there was such a panic in America or wasn't it your Halloween fun?\"<ref name=\"Wells\"/> Orson Welles appreciated the comment: \"I think that's the nicest thing that a man from England could say about the men from Mars. Mr. Hitler made a good deal of sport of it, you know.... It's supposed to show the corrupt condition and decadent state of affairs in democracy, that 'The War of the Worlds' went over as well as it did. I think it's very nice of Mr. Wells to say that not only I didn't mean it, but the American people didn't mean it.\"<ref name=\"Wells\"/>\n\nWhen Shaw interjected that there was \"some excitement\" that he did not wish to belittle, Welles asked him, \"What ''kind'' of excitement? Mr. H. G. Wells wants to know if the excitement wasn't the same kind of excitement that we extract from a practical joke in which somebody puts a sheet over his head and says 'Boo!' I don't think anybody believes that that individual is a ghost, but we do scream and yell and rush down the hall. And that's just about what happened.\"<ref name=\"Wells\"/>\n\n\"That's a very excellent description,\" Shaw said.<ref name=\"Wells\"/>\n\n\"You aren't quite serious in America, yet,\" said Wells. \"You haven't got the war right under your chins.

workers that he will be  obliged to close it soon as it is not profitable.  The boss, a local [[Russian oligarch|oligarch]] called Kalugin was kidnapped from his car by masked and armed persons who demanded for him a big ransom. The money is taken to the workers by the head of the oligarch personal security team. His heavily armed mercenaries arrive at night at the factory where the boss is being held hostage.\n\nThose who barricaded themselves in the workshop are local workers led by a former [[Spetsnaz|Special Forces]] soldier, nicknamed Sedoi. Six months without a salary and the impending bankruptcy of the plant pushed them to a desperate step.\n\nTo pull out their boss, nothing will stop the mercenaries.
