The station is owned by Seal Rock Broadcasters; [[Entravision Communications]], which owns [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]-licensed [[Univision]] affiliate [[KSMS-TV]] (channel 67) and [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-powered]], [[Class A television service|Class A]] [[UniM\u00e1s]] affiliate [[KDJT-CD]] (channel 31), operates KCBA under a [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA). The three stations share studios on Garden Court in Monterey; KCBA's transmitter is located on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Fremont Peak]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe station was launched on November 1, 1981 by [[Sainte Partners II, L.P.|Sainte Broadcasting Group]]. It began as a [[Univision|Spanish International Network]] affiliate from noon until about 1&nbsp;a.m. daily. In the mornings, it carried [[religious broadcasting|religious programming]] such as ''[[Jimmy Swaggart#Television|Jimmy Swaggart]]'', ''[[The PTL Club]]'' and ''[[The 700 Club]]'' weekdays and others on weekends. While the station was primarily a [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish-language]] broadcaster, the religious programming was in English.\n\nThe station was put up for sale in the winter of 1986 and sold to [[Ackerley Group|Ackerley Broadcasting]] in May 1986. In June the station changed formats to an English-language conventional general-entertainment format. The station added [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] from 6 to 9&nbsp;a.m. weekdays. The religious shows, held over from the Sainte days aired from 9&nbsp;a.m. to about noon. The afternoon initially consisted of a [[feature film|movie]] and eventually classic [[sitcom]]s. By about 2:30&nbsp;p.m. the station aired cartoons, followed by more off-network sitcoms by 5&nbsp;p.m., a prime-time movie, and a blend of sitcoms, [[drama (film and television)|dramas]], and movies into late night. On weekends, the station ran additional movies, and the Sunday morning religious shows remained for many more years.\n\n===As a Fox affiliate===\nKCBA joined the Fox network at its inception in October 1986 and remains so today. Like most Fox stations and [[independent station (North America)|independents]], KCBA moved away from older sitcoms and added talk shows, reality shows, and court shows by the mid-1990s. In 1994, KCBA entered into a [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA) with what was then KCCN-TV, which was then owned by Harron Communications. KCBA took over the operations of KCCN, which changed its call letters to [[KION-TV]] two years later. Although KCCN/KION was longer-established, KCBA functioned as the senior partner in the LMA during the years that Ackerley owned Channel 35. Ackerley bought KION outright in 1998 and sold KCBA to a pair of investors [[doing business as]] Seal Rock Broadcasters and Utica Television Partners (although only one of them, Seal Rock Broadcasters, serves as the licensee). The transactions were completed on January 12, 2000; however, Ackerley retained control of KCBA through an LMA with its new owners. As a result, Channel 46 became the senior partner in the LMA. Cartoons were phased out in 2001, and in 2002 newscasts were added. KION and the LMA for KCBA were sold to Clear Channel Communications as part of a group deal. In addition, KCBA and KION shared a secondary affiliation with UPN from 1995 until 2003.\n\n[[Image:KCBA3509.png|thumb|right|KCBA's previous logo while under LMA with [[KION-TV]] until December 1, 2013]]\n[[Image:KCBA 2014 logo.jpg|thumb|right|KCBA's first logo as an Entravision station December 1, 2013 to September 10, 2015]]\n\n===Sale to Cowles Publishing Company===\nOn April 20, 2007, Clear Channel Communications (now [[iHeartMedia]]), the owner of KION at the time, entered into an agreement to spin off its entire television stations group to [[Newport Television]], a broadcasting holding company controlled by the private equity firm [[Providence Equity Partners]].<ref name=\"Clear Channel Television\">{{cite press release|title=Clear Channel Agrees to Sell Television Station Group to Providence Equity Partners |publisher=[[Clear Channel Communications]] |url=http://www.clearchannel.com/Corporate/PressRelease.aspx?PressReleaseID=1943 |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425161056/http://www.clearchannel.com/Corporate/PressRelease.aspx?PressReleaseID=1943 |archivedate=2007-04-25 }}</ref> Newport Television subsequently announced the sale of KION and its LMA with KCBA to [[Cowles Company|Cowles Publishing Company]].

Its studios, offices and analog transmitter are located at the GMA Skyview Complex, Nivel Hills, Apas, [[Cebu City]], while its digital transmitter facilities is situated at Mt. Busay, Brgy. Bonbon, Cebu City.\n\nUpon the establishment of GMA's first provincial television station in Cebu in 1963, DYSS-TV currently serves as the formation of the network's Central and Eastern Visayas market consisting of the Cebu-based station as its studio facility, and relays across Bohol, Negros Oriental, Leyte and Samar, which culminating in 2017.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Inception as RBS (1963-1972) ===\nThe origin of GMA Cebu can traced back to radio station in Cebu, [[DYSS]] (1560 kHz (now 999 kHz) AM band), which began airing its radio operations on July 4, 1957, and launched its first provincial AM station in Cebu City. DYSS was then owned by GMA Network's predecessor Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]] in Manila, later Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. of [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart]]. Upon the launch, their old studios of radio operation in Fortunata Building, at the corner of Magallanes & Lapu-lapu Streets, Cebu City, with the location of 1-kilowatt BC Gates Transmitter is at Mambaling Seaside. After the success of its radio station, the company ventured into television and started operations on November 20, 1963 as DYSS Channel 7 Cebu. With this venture, DYSS-TV Channel 7 became the third VHF television station established in Cebu City after the establishment of provincial stations of [[DYCB-TV|ABS Channel 3]] (owned by [[ABS-CBN]]'s predecessor Alto Broadcasting System) and [[DYPT-TV|ABC Channel 11]] (owned by the [[TV5 Network, Inc.|Associated Broadcasting Corporation]]) which began its broadcasts on June 14, 1961 and September 11, 1963 respectively. The original studios of TV operations was inaugurated since then at the Sundowner Centrepoint Hotel along Plaridel St. cor. Osme\u00f1a Blvd., Cebu City and at that time, the station broadcast with a power output of 5,000 watts.\n\nOn March 1, 1969, RBS was then known as \"Greater 7 Cebu\", using the [[Circle 7 logo]] that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was using for all of its owned-and-operated stations at the time. The station's programming is composed of canned programs from the [[United States]] and it later produced local programs.\n\n=== Martial Law era; Returns to operations, GMA Radio-Television Arts and Rainbow Satellite Network era (1972-1999) ===\nFollowing the proclamation of [[Martial Law]] by then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], DYSS-TV was forced to shut down on September 21, 1972, though it only lasted for more than 3 months. In December of the same year, DYSS-TV (along with the flagship station in Manila, [[DZBB-TV]]) was given the green light by the [[National Media Production Center]] (NMPC) to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits.\n\nIn 1974, RBS were sold to a [[triumvirate]] composed of [[Felipe Gozon]], Gilberto Duavit, Sr., and Menardo Jimenez. Under the new management, DYSS-TV reopened with a new identity as GMA Radio-Television Arts and introduced the ''Where You Belong'' slogan to catch the attention of local viewers around the world. Despite its network rebranding, Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. The relaunch of GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also had a [[circle 7 logo]] in use. In its final years, the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities (later used the rainbow colors of red, yellow, green and blue stripes, as GMA prepares for a network reformatting). In the same year, DYSS-TV was converted into an originating station with its English local news bulletin \"News Digest Cebu\", a local newscast show of [[GMA News Roundup]]. GMA Radio-Television Arts Cebu launched its local newscast \"News at Seven Cebu\" in 1979 using the English-language after [[DZBB-TV|GMA-7 Manila]]'s [[News at Seven]], which premiered 3 years ago. It also launched its first live coverage of [[Sinulog|Sinulog Festival]] in Plaza Independencia, Cebu City on January 20, 1980.\n\nIn 1990, GMA Channel 7 Cebu transferred to the studio and transmitter facilities located at GMA Skyview Complex in Nivel Hills, Apas, Cebu City for better broadcast equipments and an upgraded transmitter tower, with increased transmitting power output to 60,000 watts (259,000 watts ERP) to replace an old 5-kilowatt TPO located at the Sundowner Centrepoint Hotel in Plaridel St. for 3 decades. The transmitter upgrades resulted in clearer and better signal reception in Metro Cebu, and the Central and Eastern Visayas.\n\nOn April 30, 1992, as part of the network's expansion of coverage which started exactly four years after with the inaugurated its Tower of Power, GMA Channel 7 Cebu was launched as the ''Rainbow Satellite Network''. Through its nationwide satellite broadcast, GMA's national programmings were seen across the Philippine archipelago and [[Southeast Asia]] which became a relay (satellite-selling) station of the network's flagship station [[DZBB-TV]] Channel 7 Manila to reach Cebuano viewers around the [[Central Visayas Region]], [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]]. With the launch, GMA utilizes a new logo to correspond with the rebranding and a satellite-beaming rainbow in a multicolored striped based on the traditional scheme of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, with GMA in a metallic form uses a San Serif Century Gothic Extra Bold and analogous gloominess of Indigo as its fonts in the letters. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. Six years after, in 1986, the former ABC and BBC were subsequently closed down in between pre-Martial Law days and its dissolution on the original channel 11 frequency and permanently switched its affiliations of the state-run [[People's Television Network]] on the newly-launched station [[DYPT-TV]]\u2014twenty-three years from what used to be their former call letters DYMT-TV and DYCW-TV had before, with the commercial ABS-CBN was reopened and took back [[DYCB-TV]] under the Lopez-owned network on the current Channel 3 frequency four years ago and ABC was given to the newly bought [[DYET-TV]] transferred to that station's UHF assignment to the current Channel 21 in the Metro Cebu area, which opened on April to the said year; now under the foundation of the currently [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network Inc.]]. On May 16, 1996, Republic Broadcasting System formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''.\n\n=== GMA Cebu; expansion across Central and Eastern Visayas (1999-present) ===\nOn October 1999, GMA Channel 7 Cebu launched its local newscast [[Balitang Bisdak]] with Bobby Nalzaro as its sole anchor, two years after he was resigned with [[DYMF|Bombo Radyo Cebu]] and joined with GMA/RGMA Cebu. In 2005, \"Balitang Bisdak\" and \"Singgit Cebu\" were re-launched and were taken under the wing of GMA News & Public Affairs and GMA Entertainment TV Group respectively. On October 2005, GMA Entertainment TV Group in Cebu re-launched \"Oi!\", a local variety show which saying it was dynamic, interactive and stylish, leveling to the standards of [[DZBB-TV|GMA-7]]'s Sunday variety show [[SOP (TV program)|SOP]]. GMA News & Public Affairs Cebu's local morning show, \"[[Buena Mano Balita]]\" was launched on October 8, 2007, patterned from [[DZBB-TV|GMA Manila]]'s morning news program [[Unang Hirit]]. On November 2007, GMA Cebu and Television And Production Exponents Inc. (TAPE) launched its first ever regional version \"[[Eat Na Ta!]]\", which was a daily game show on radio through [[DYSS]] Super Radyo Cebu 999&nbsp;kHz (aired during weekdays), and later evolved into a live TV program aired on this channel (aired during Saturdays). It served as a pre-programming for ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' in Visayas until 2008.\n\nOn November 10, 2014, as part of their changes of graphics and theme music of the network's flagship newscast of [[24 Oras]], GMA News & Public Affairs Cebu was re-launched and adopted the branding of its flagship regional newscast \"24 Oras Central Visayas\". However on February 1, 2016, in preparation for the newly launch of GMA's Regional TV division, GMA News & Public Affairs Cebu's flagship regional newscast 24 Oras Central Visayas reverted to the original title Balitang Bisdak, just after more than a year hiatus together with [[DZEA-TV|GMA Dagupan]]'s [[Balitang Amianan]]. Follow the return, DYSS became the oldest local newscast of GMA Network in the Central and Eastern Visayas since it was premiered in 1999. Balitang Bisdak was relaunched on November 13, 2017 similar to sister newscasts [[Balitang Amianan]] and [[One Mindanao]], which will be simultaneously broadcast in key cities and provinces in Central and Eastern Visayas through GMA Network's local channels in Tacloban, Bohol and Ormoc. On May 23, 2018, GMA Cebu started digital test broadcasts on UHF 26 covering Metro Cebu and the provinces of Cebu, Negros Oriental and Bohol, as well as several parts of Leyte and Samar.\n\n==GMA Cebu local programmings==\nAs of April 22, 2019, DYSS-TV currently produces around 1 hour of local programming. However, the station does not produce nor distribute local contents to its coverage area on weekend (although the station aired local advertising), with exceptions of The Word of God Network; which airing every Sundays, and major events held in the city covered by GMA Regional TV. During [[Paschal Triduum]] of the [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]] annually, DYSS-TV was closed down as an originating station, as GMA Cebu would reported to a direct satellite station of [[DZBB-TV]] in Metro Manila for its Lenten special programmings.\n\n===Current===\n* [[Balitang Bisdak]]\n* The Word of God Network\n* GMA Regional TV Live!\n* Sinulog Festival (annually, every 3rd Sunday of January)\n* Siete Palabras (annually, every Good Friday, produced in cooperation with [[Archdiocese of Cebu]])\n\n===Formerly-produced or distributed programs===\n* 24 Oras Central Visayas\n* [[Buena Mano Balita]]\n* Coffee with Us (1978\u20131981)\n* [[Eat Na Ta!]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LHVSauBSDI Eat Na 'Ta, December 29, 2007 episode]</ref>\n* GMA Musicale\n* GMA News Cebu\n* Istayl Nato\n*[[Isyu Ngayon|Central Visayas Isyu Karon]]\n* [[Ka Ina]]\n* [[Kape at Balita]]\n* Let's Fiesta\n* Mga Balita sa Kilum-Kilum (1981\u20131986)\n* [[News at Seven|News at Seven Cebu]] (1978\u20131986)\n* News Digest Cebu (1974\u20131978)\n* Oi!\n* Sabado Box Office Hits\n* Holy Mass\n* Siete Palabras @ Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral (every Good Friday)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/90013/former-ofw-scavenger-join-seven-last-words-activity|title=Former OFW, scavenger join Seven Last Words activity|publisher=[[Cebu Daily News]]|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n* Goot da Wanderpol (also aired on [[DXSS-TV|SBN-GMA TV-7 Davao]]) (1980-1985)\n* Singgit Cebu (1999\u20132005)\n* The Visayan Agenda (special programming for 2010 elections)\n* Visita Iglesia\n\n[[File:GMA Cebu coverage area.png|150px|thumbnail|right|'''Red:''' Home location of GMA Cebu<br>'''Light red and red:''' Market audience of GMA Cebu<br>'''Violet:''' Areas that may receive signals from GMA Cebu]]\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nUHF Channel 26 (545.143&nbsp;MHz)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In December of the same year, DYSS-TV (along with the flagship station in Manila, [[DZBB-TV]]) was given the green light by the [[National Media Production Center]] (NMPC) to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits.\n\nIn 1974, RBS were sold to a [[triumvirate]] composed of [[Felipe Gozon]], Gilberto Duavit, Sr., and Menardo Jimenez. Under the new management, DYSS-TV reopened with a new identity as GMA Radio-Television Arts and introduced the ''Where You Belong'' slogan to catch the attention of local viewers around the world. Despite its network rebranding, Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. The relaunch of GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also had a [[circle 7 logo]] in use. In its final years, the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities (later used the rainbow colors of red, yellow, green and blue stripes, as GMA prepares for a network reformatting). In the same year, DYSS-TV was converted into an originating station with its English local news bulletin \"News Digest Cebu\", a local newscast show of [[GMA News Roundup]]. GMA Radio-Television Arts Cebu launched its local newscast \"News at Seven Cebu\" in 1979 using the English-language after [[DZBB-TV|GMA-7 Manila]]'s [[News at Seven]], which premiered 3 years ago. It also launched its first live coverage of [[Sinulog|Sinulog Festival]] in Plaza Independencia, Cebu City on January 20, 1980.\n\nIn 1990, GMA Channel 7 Cebu transferred to the studio and transmitter facilities located at GMA Skyview Complex in Nivel Hills, Apas, Cebu City for better broadcast equipments and an upgraded transmitter tower, with increased transmitting power output to 60,000 watts (259,000 watts ERP) to replace an old 5-kilowatt TPO located at the Sundowner Centrepoint Hotel in Plaridel St. for 3 decades. The transmitter upgrades resulted in clearer and better signal reception in Metro Cebu, and the Central and Eastern Visayas.\n\nOn April 30, 1992, as part of the network's expansion of coverage which started exactly four years after with the inaugurated its Tower of Power, GMA Channel 7 Cebu was launched as the ''Rainbow Satellite Network''. Through its nationwide satellite broadcast, GMA's national programmings were seen across the Philippine archipelago and [[Southeast Asia]] which became a relay (satellite-selling) station of the network's flagship station [[DZBB-TV]] Channel 7 Manila to reach Cebuano viewers around the [[Central Visayas Region]], [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]]. With the launch, GMA utilizes a new logo to correspond with the rebranding and a satellite-beaming rainbow in a multicolored striped based on the traditional scheme of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, with GMA in a metallic form uses a San Serif Century Gothic Extra Bold and analogous gloominess of Indigo as its fonts in the letters. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. Six years after, in 1986, the former ABC and BBC were subsequently closed down in between pre-Martial Law days and its dissolution on the original channel 11 frequency and permanently switched its affiliations of the state-run [[People's Television Network]] on the newly-launched station [[DYPT-TV]]\u2014twenty-three years from what used to be their former call letters DYMT-TV and DYCW-TV had before, with the commercial ABS-CBN was reopened and took back [[DYCB-TV]] under the Lopez-owned network on the current Channel 3 frequency four years ago and ABC was given to the newly bought [[DYET-TV]] transferred to that station's UHF assignment to the current Channel 21 in the Metro Cebu area, which opened on April to the said year; now under the foundation of the currently [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network Inc.]]. On May 16, 1996, Republic Broadcasting System formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''.\n\n=== GMA Cebu; expansion across Central and Eastern Visayas (1999-present) ===\nOn October 1999, GMA Channel 7 Cebu launched its local newscast [[Balitang Bisdak]] with Bobby Nalzaro as its sole anchor, two years after he was resigned with [[DYMF|Bombo Radyo Cebu]] and joined with GMA/RGMA Cebu. In 2005, \"Balitang Bisdak\" and \"Singgit Cebu\" were re-launched and were taken under the wing of GMA News & Public Affairs and GMA Entertainment TV Group respectively. On October 2005, GMA Entertainment TV Group in Cebu re-launched \"Oi!\", a local variety show which saying it was dynamic, interactive and stylish, leveling to the standards of [[DZBB-TV|GMA-7]]'s Sunday variety show [[SOP (TV program)|SOP]]. GMA News & Public Affairs Cebu's local morning show, \"[[Buena Mano Balita]]\" was launched on October 8, 2007, patterned from [[DZBB-TV|GMA Manila]]'s morning news program [[Unang Hirit]]. On November 2007, GMA Cebu and Television And Production Exponents Inc. (TAPE) launched its first ever regional version \"[[Eat Na Ta!]]\", which was a daily game show on radio through [[DYSS]] Super Radyo Cebu 999&nbsp;kHz (aired during weekdays), and later evolved into a live TV program aired on this channel (aired during Saturdays). It served as a pre-programming for ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' in Visayas until 2008.\n\nOn November 10, 2014, as part of their changes of graphics and theme music of the network's flagship newscast of [[24 Oras]], GMA News & Public Affairs Cebu was re-launched and adopted the branding of its flagship regional newscast \"24 Oras Central Visayas\". However on February 1, 2016, in preparation for the newly launch of GMA's Regional TV division, GMA News & Public Affairs Cebu's flagship regional newscast 24 Oras Central Visayas reverted to the original title Balitang Bisdak, just after more than a year hiatus together with [[DZEA-TV|GMA Dagupan]]'s [[Balitang Amianan]]. Follow the return, DYSS became the oldest local newscast of GMA Network in the Central and Eastern Visayas since it was premiered in 1999. Balitang Bisdak was relaunched on November 13, 2017 similar to sister newscasts [[Balitang Amianan]] and [[One Mindanao]], which will be simultaneously broadcast in key cities and provinces in Central and Eastern Visayas through GMA Network's local channels in Tacloban, Bohol and Ormoc. On May 23, 2018, GMA Cebu started digital test broadcasts on UHF 26 covering Metro Cebu and the provinces of Cebu, Negros Oriental and Bohol, as well as several parts of Leyte and Samar.\n\n==GMA Cebu local programmings==\nAs of April 22, 2019, DYSS-TV currently produces around 1 hour of local programming. However, the station does not produce nor distribute local contents to its coverage area on weekend (although the station aired local advertising), with exceptions of The Word of God Network; which airing every Sundays, and major events held in the city covered by GMA Regional TV. During [[Paschal Triduum]] of the [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]] annually, DYSS-TV was closed down as an originating station, as GMA Cebu would reported to a direct satellite station of [[DZBB-TV]] in Metro Manila for its Lenten special programmings.\n\n===Current===\n* [[Balitang Bisdak]]\n* The Word of God Network\n* GMA Regional TV Live!\n* Sinulog Festival (annually, every 3rd Sunday of January)\n\n===Formerly-produced or distributed programs===\n* 24 Oras Central Visayas\n* [[Buena Mano Balita]]\n* Coffee with Us (1978\u20131981)\n* [[Eat Na Ta!]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LHVSauBSDI Eat Na 'Ta, December 29, 2007 episode]</ref>\n* GMA Musicale\n* GMA News Cebu\n* Istayl Nato\n*[[Isyu Ngayon|Central Visayas Isyu Karon]]\n* [[Ka Ina]]\n* [[Kape at Balita]]\n* Let's Fiesta\n* Mga Balita sa Kilum-Kilum (1981\u20131986)\n* [[News at Seven|News at Seven Cebu]] (1978\u20131986)\n* News Digest Cebu (1974\u20131978)\n* Oi!\n* Sabado Box Office Hits\n* Holy Mass\n* Siete Palabras @ Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral (every Good Friday)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/90013/former-ofw-scavenger-join-seven-last-words-activity|title=Former OFW, scavenger join Seven Last Words activity|publisher=[[Cebu Daily News]]|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n* Goot da Wanderpol (also aired on [[DXSS-TV|SBN-GMA TV-7 Davao]]) (1980-1985)\n* Singgit Cebu (1999\u20132005)\n* The Visayan Agenda (special programming for 2010 elections)\n* Visita Iglesia\n\n[[File:GMA Cebu coverage area.png|150px|thumbnail|right|'''Red:''' Home location of GMA Cebu<br>'''Light red and red:''' Market audience of GMA Cebu<br>'''Violet:''' Areas that may receive signals from GMA Cebu]]\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nUHF Channel 26 (545.143&nbsp;MHz)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

They are a member of the [[American Indoor Football Association]].  The team began play as the '''Montgomery Maulers''' of the [[National Indoor Football League]] and won the Atlantic Conference Central Division Championship in 2005. The 2005 season ended in the conference playoff semifinals of the [[Rome Renegades]], who went on to appear in the NIFL Championship Indoor Bowl V.\n\nThe team folded in October 2007.[http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071002/SPORTS/710020331/1002]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n==Entire team fired==\nLate in April 2006, the second year of the club's existence, Donald Jackson, an attorney representing members of the team said the club had not paid the players, staff or coaches in more than a month. The team's owner (Jamie LaMunyon) made national news on April 27, 2006, by terminating the contracts of all players and announcing that replacements would be hired. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/football/nfl/04/27/bc.fbo.teamfired.ap/index.html?cnn=yes]\n\n==New ownership==\nOn May 3, 2006, the Maulers came under new ownership. After losing five of their first six games, the team has rallied under new management, winning five of the next six (the lone defeat was a 1-point overtime loss in an away game). The Maulers showed their renewed tenacity most recently in the Osceola rematch. After a downed Montgomery player was speared in the back of the head (with no penalty having been assessed), the teams broke out into a 17-minute bench clearing brawl resulting in 19 players being ejected. Montgomery managed to overcome a 15-point deficit in the fourth quarter to pull off the 1 point win. Although this was officially the second time these teams have played, the first meeting was actually fielded by players from the [[Southern States Football League|SSFL]]'s Gulf Coast Raiders (a team owned by Michael Mink) due to the previously mentioned contract disputes. Following the loss, Michael Mink and John Morris decided to become more involved with arena football and purchased the Maulers franchise with Mink becoming head coach and Morris becoming general manager. Subsequently, a number of Raiders players have been signed to the Maulers roster, which has brewed speculation that the Raiders will be used as a farm team for the Maulers.\n\n==2006 playoffs==\nFollowing a drumming by the top ranked [[Fayetteville Guard]], the Maulers were 6-7 overall and surprisingly made the playoffs. Tied for 7th place in the conference with the [[Charleston Sandsharks]] who was scheduled in the final game of the regular season, the winner was to receive the final playoff spot (only 6 teams per conference would qualify). The Maulers lost the game 28-39, but Charleston's general manager Al Bannister had already stated the organization would skip the playoffs and focus on next season. It was noticed that the official NIFL web site had an asterisk by the team's name and stated no team with outstanding operational items (stats) would be eligible for the playoffs. Later, it was revealed the franchise had cheated by using at least six illegal players and also had outstanding fines due to administrative issues (not exchanging film with opponents or keeping statistics at home games). Subsequently, the Sandsharks were banned from the playoffs for the infractions, with the Maulers being awarded the sixth Atlantic conference spot. However this all proved academic as the Maulers lost in the first week of the playoffs on July 8 at [[Lakeland Thunderbolts|Lakeland]]. Falling behind 27-0 in the first quarter, Montgomery stormed back but could not make the comeback falling 70-62; they ended their season 7-8.\n\nAfter the 2006 season, the team announced they were changing their name to the Montgomery Bears and moving to the [[American Indoor Football Association]].\n\n==Season-by-season==\n{{Start NFL SBS}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''Montgomery Maulers (NIFL)'''\n|-\n|2005 || 8 || 6 || 0 || 1st Atlantic Central || Won AC Quarterfinal ([[Florida Frenzy|M.

They are a member of the [[American Indoor Football Association]].  The team began play as the '''Montgomery Maulers''' of the [[National Indoor Football League]] and won the Atlantic Conference Central Division Championship in 2005. The 2005 season ended in the conference playoff semifinals of the [[Rome Renegades]], who went on to appear in the NIFL Championship Indoor Bowl V.\n\nThe team folded in October 2007.[http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071002/SPORTS/710020331/1002]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n==Entire team fired==\nLate in April 2006, the second year of the club's existence, Donald Jackson, an attorney representing members of the team said the club had not paid the players, staff or coaches in more than a month. The team's owner (Jamie LaMunyon) made national news on April 27, 2006, by terminating the contracts of all players and announcing that replacements would be hired. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/football/nfl/04/27/bc.fbo.teamfired.ap/index.html?cnn=yes]\n\n==New ownership==\nOn May 3, 2006, the Maulers came under new ownership. After losing five of their first six games, the team has rallied under new management, winning five of the next six (the lone defeat was a 1-point overtime loss in an away game). The Maulers showed their renewed tenacity most recently in the Osceola rematch. After a downed Montgomery player was speared in the back of the head (with no penalty having been assessed), the teams broke out into a 17-minute bench clearing brawl resulting in 19 players being ejected. Montgomery managed to overcome a 15-point deficit in the fourth quarter to pull off the 1 point win. Although this was officially the second time these teams have played, the first meeting was actually fielded by players from the [[Southern States Football League|SSFL]]'s Gulf Coast Raiders (a team owned by Michael Mink) due to the previously mentioned contract disputes. Following the loss, Michael Mink and John Morris decided to become more involved with arena football and purchased the Maulers franchise with Mink becoming head coach and Morris becoming general manager. Subsequently, a number of Raiders players have been signed to the Maulers roster, which has brewed speculation that the Raiders will be used as a farm team for the Maulers.\n\n==2006 playoffs==\nFollowing a drumming by the top ranked [[Fayetteville Guard]], the Maulers were 6-7 overall and surprisingly made the playoffs. Tied for 7th place in the conference with the [[Charleston Sandsharks]] who was scheduled in the final game of the regular season, the winner was to receive the final playoff spot (only 6 teams per conference would qualify). The Maulers lost the game 28-39, but Charleston's general manager Al Bannister had already stated the organization would skip the playoffs and focus on next season. It was noticed that the official NIFL web site had an asterisk by the teams name and stated no team with outstanding operational items (stats) would be eligible for the playoffs. Later, it was revealed the franchise had cheated by using at least six illegal players and also had outstanding fines due to administrative issues (not exchanging film with opponents or keeping statistics at home games). Subsequently, the Sandsharks were banned from the playoffs for the infractions, with the Maulers being awarded the sixth Atlantic conference spot. However this all proved academic as the Maulers lost in the first week of the playoffs on July 8 at [[Lakeland Thunderbolts|Lakeland]]. Falling behind 27-0 in the first quarter, Montgomery stormed back but could not make the comeback falling 70-62; they ended their season 7-8.\n\nAfter the 2006 season, the team announced they were changing their name to the Montgomery Bears and moving to the [[American Indoor Football Association]].\n\n==Season-by-season==\n{{Start NFL SBS}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''Montgomery Maulers (NIFL)'''\n|-\n|2005 || 8 || 6 || 0 || 1st Atlantic Central || Won AC Quarterfinal ([[Florida Frenzy|M.
