Many Guyanese-born writers have emigrated abroad.\n\n==History of Guyanese literature==\n\nThe first book written on Guyana, by [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] in the 16th century, was ''The Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Beautiful Empyre of Guiana (With a Relation of the Great and Golden Citie of Manoa (Which the Spanyards call El Dorado) and of the Provinces of Emeria, Aromaia, Amapaia, and Other Countries, with Their Riulers, Adjoyning'' (Robert Robinson: London, 1596).\n\nOne of the earliest and most notable Guyanese authors was [[Edgar Mittelholzer]], author of ''Corentyne Thunder'' (1941). His works often deal with issues of interracial relations, particularly the strain between European and non-European Guyanese.\n\nFamous novelists include [[E. R. Braithwaite]] (author of ''[[To Sir, With Love (book)|To Sir, With Love]]'', 1959), [[Wilson Harris]] (author of ''[[Palace of the Peacock]]'', published in 1960 and followed by many other novels), [[Jan Carew]], [[Roy Heath]] (author of works including ''The Murderer'', the ''Georgetown Trilogy'' and ''The Shadow Bride''),  and dramatist [[Michael Gilkes (writer)|Michael Gilkes]].\n\nThey were succeeded by a new generation of writers from the 1980s onward, including [[Beryl Gilroy]], [[John Agard]], [[Grace Nichols]], [[Jan Shinebourne]], [[Cyril Dabydeen]], [[Sasenarine Persaud]], [[David Dabydeen]] and Barney Singh (author of ''Tales in the Guyanese Vernacular'').<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thestar/obituary.aspx?pid=166555853 \"Basil 'Barney' Singh BSc Eng.\"], Obituary, ''Toronto Star''.</ref>\n\n[[Martin Carter]] is considered Guyana's greatest poet.<ref>[http://www.stabroeknews.com/2012/features/06/24/martin-carter-and-his-poems/ Al Creighton, \"Martin Carter and his poems\"], ''Stabroek News'', 24 June 2012.</ref>\n\n[[Michael Abbensetts]] was a noted playwright of works for the stage and television in the UK, whose work included the drama series \u2014 ''[[Empire Road]]'', which [[BBC TV]] aired from 1978 to 1979.<ref name=Guardian>Michael Coveney, [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/30/michael-abbensetts-obituary \"Michael Abbensetts obituary\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 November 2016.</ref>\n\nVincent Roth's two-volume memoirs, ''A Life in Guyana: Volume 1 - A Young Man's Journey, 1889-1923'' and ''A Life in Guyana: Volume 2 - Later Years, 1923-1935'' (edited by Michael Bennett), were published in 2002 by Peepal Tree Press.\n\nIn more recent years, [[Pauline Melville]] has written fiction including ''The Ventriloquist's Tale'' (1997) and ''The Migration of Ghosts'' (1998), [[Oonya Kempadoo]] is the author of ''Buxton Spice'' (1998) and ''Tide Running'' (2001), and [[Sharon Maas]] has had published ''Of Marriageable Age'' (1999), ''Peacocks Dancing'' (2001) and ''The Speech of Angels'' (2003).\n\nThe influential intellectual and historian [[Walter Rodney]] was Guyanese, his most important book being ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]'' (1972).

Like most nomarchs of the time he also held some priestly charges.<ref>Grajetzki, pp.&nbsp;110-11</ref><ref>Kamrin, p.&nbsp;1; 26.</ref>\n\nHis predecessor as nomarch was probably his relative [[Netjernakht]], and Khnumhotep honored him by building his tomb. His mother was Baqet while his father was an official named Neheri. Khnumhotep had two wives, the main of them was Khety, herself a daughter of the unnamed nomarch of the neighbouring 17th nome with [[Cynopolis|Hardai]] as capital. Like her husband, Khety held a remarkable number of titles such as ''daughter of a governor, king's acquaintance, foremost of actions, lady of the house'', and was also a priestess of [[Hathor]] and [[Pakhet]]. Khnumhotep's secondary wife was Tjat who held few, modest titles such as ''sealer, lady of the house'' and ''one who knows her lord''; she is the only known female sealer at the court of a local governor. Those peculiarities and the fact that both consorts appears several times in Khnumhotep's tomb suggests that the one between him and Khety was likely a [[Marriage of state|politically arranged marriage]] while Tjat could have been his true love who was appointed ''sealer'' by him in order to have her closer.<ref>Grajetzki, pp.&nbsp;136-38; 160-61</ref>\n\nFrom his two consorts, Khnumhotep II had several children:<ref>Grajetzki, pp.&nbsp;136-38</ref>\n*Nakht inherited his maternal grandfather's charge of nomarch at Hardai\n*Khnumhotep IV, followed his father as nomarch of the 16th nome, but does not appear in his father's tomb and is only known by his unfinished tomb at Beni Hasan\n*[[Khnumhotep III]] entered to the royal court where he managed to become ''[[high steward (Ancient Egypt)|high steward]]'' and later ''[[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]]''\n*Neheri was buried in a small tomb at Beni Hasan where a stela of him was found\n*another son is known for being a \"[[Haty-a|mayor]]\" in a contiguous nome.\n\nFor more about Khnumhotep's genealogy, see \"[[Oryx nome#Nomarchs of the Oryx nome|Nomarchs of the Oryx nome]]\".\n\n==The tomb BH3==\n[[File:BeniHasanKhnumhotep.jpg|thumb|220px|Exterior of the Tomb BH3]]\nKhnumhotep II is buried in Beni Hasan in the rock-cut Tomb 3 (BH3), one of the most notable of the whole necropolis. In ancient times, the tomb would have been approached via a path that was distinguishable by dark brown boulders on either side; the path extended from the open outer court down the hill to the edge of the cultivated land.<ref name=Newberry52>Newberry, p.&nbsp;52</ref>\n\nThe tomb is fronted by a columned [[portico]] and a small courtyard; the courtyard would have been surrounded by mud-brick walls. The small columned portico is on the west side of the courtyard, directly in front of the tomb entrance.<ref>Kamrin, p.&nbsp;30</ref> The ceiling of the portico is curved similar to the shape of a segmented barrel. The rock around the doorway leading inside the tomb to the chapel was smoothed and flattened, on which a fourteen line inscription is giving the list of the festal days for the services of funeral offerings, called ''percheru'', along with the name and titles of Khnumhotep II.<ref name=Newberry53>Newberry, p.&nbsp;53</ref> The floor of the main chamber (also referred to as the chapel) is sunk into the ground below the level of the open outer court and is descended into by three steps.<ref name=Newberry53/> The chapel is the main chamber cut straight back into the cliff almost symmetrical with 4 columns and two large shafts (that lead to burial chambers) are cut into the floor. These four main columns support a ceiling that is divided by three segmented barrel shapes.<ref>An illustration of this by [[George Willoughby Fraser]] is available in Newberry\u2019s book.</ref> These vaults are painted in a pattern that may be referencing a tent.<ref>Kamrin, p.&nbsp;33</ref> The only light for this chamber would have come from the doorway to the portico and originally a door, between the portico and the chamber, could have been used to close the tomb to the outdoor elements.<ref name=Newberry52/> [[Percy Newberry]] notes that the only remain from the inward swinging door is the pivot-hole.

It should not be confused with the [[Regular Reserve (United Kingdom)|Regular Reserve]] whose members have formerly served full-time. The Army Reserve was previously known as the '''[[Territorial Force]]''' from 1908 to 1921, the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1921 to 1967, the '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) from 1967 to 1979, and again the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1979 to 2014.\n\nThe Army Reserve was created as the Territorial Force in 1908 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], when the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] combined the previously civilian-administered [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], with the mounted [[Yeomanry]] (at the same time the [[Militia#United Kingdom|Militia]] was renamed the [[Special Reserve]]). Most Volunteer infantry units had unique identities, but lost these in the reorganisation, becoming Territorial battalions of Regular Army infantry regiments. Only one infantry unit, the [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]], has maintained a separate identity.\n\nIts original purpose was home defence, although the establishment of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967 involved a restructuring and revised doctrine leading to the provision of routine support for the regular army overseas. Reservists in the past also served as [[constable]]s or [[bailiff]]s, even holding positions of civic duty as overseer of their parish. The more modern Yeomen of the 18th century were cavalry-based units, which were often used to suppress riots (see the [[Peterloo Massacre]]). Several units that are now part of the Army Reserve bear the title \"militia\",<ref>e.g. [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (Militia), The Jersey Field Squadron (Militia), The [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, the [[Royal Irish Rangers|Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th)]] (North Irish Militia) (until 1993)</ref> reflecting their origins as part of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|that organisation]] prior to the formation of the Special Reserve in 1907.\n\nDuring periods of [[total war]], the Army Reserve is incorporated by the [[Royal Prerogative]] into Regular Service under one code of Military Law for the duration of hostilities or until de-activation is decided upon. After the [[Second World War]], for example, the Army Reserve \u2013 or Territorial Army as it was known then \u2013 was not demobilised until 1947. Army Reservists normally have a full-time civilian job or career, which in some cases provides skills and expertise that are directly transferable to a specialist military role, such as [[National Health Service|NHS]] employees serving in Reservist [[Army Medical Services]] units. All Army Reserve personnel have their civilian jobs protected to a limited extent by law should they be compulsorily mobilised. There is, however, no legal protection against discrimination in employment for membership of the Army Reserve in the normal course of events (i.e. when not mobilised).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation to First World War===\n{{Main|Territorial Force}}\n\nThe Territorial Force was originally formed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], following the enactment of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] which combined and re-organised the old [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] with the [[Yeomanry]]. As part of the same process, remaining units of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] were converted to the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]. The TF was formed on 1 April 1908 and contained fourteen [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]]s, and fourteen mounted yeomanry [[brigade]]s. It had an overall strength of approximately 269,000.\n\nThe individual units that made up each division or brigade were administered by County Associations, with the county's [[lord lieutenant]] as president. The other members of the association consisted of ''military members'' (chosen from the commanding officers of the units), ''representative members'' (nominated by the [[county council]]s and [[county borough]]s in the lieutenancy county) and ''co-opted members'' (often retired military officers). Associations took over any property vested in the volunteers or yeomanry under their administration. Each regiment or battalion had a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] attached as full-time adjutant.\n\nThe use of the word ''territorial'' signified that the volunteers who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas\u2014in 1910, when asked to nominate for Imperial Service overseas in the event of mobilisation, less than 10% of the Force chose to do so. In August 1914, after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], territorial units were given the option of serving in [[France]] and, by 25 August, in excess of seventy [[battalion]]s had volunteered. This question over the availability of territorial divisions for overseas service was one of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s motivations for raising the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] separately.\n\nTerritorial formations initially saw service in [[Egypt]] and [[British Raj|British India]] and other [[British Empire|Empire]] garrisons, such as [[Gibraltar]], thereby releasing regular units for service in France and enabling the formation of an additional five regular army divisions (for a total of eleven) by early 1915. Several reserve units were also deployed with regular formations and the first territorial unit to see action on the Western Front was the [[32 (Scottish) Signal Regiment|Glasgow Territorial Signallers Group, Royal Engineers]] at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] on 11 October 1914. The first fully Territorial division to join the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] was the [[46th (North Midland) Division]] in March 1915, with divisions later serving in [[Gallipoli]] and elsewhere. As the war progressed, and casualties mounted, the distinctive character of territorial units was diluted by the inclusion of conscript and New Army drafts. Following [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the Armistice]] all units of the Territorial Force were gradually disbanded.\n\n===Interwar re-establishment and the Second World War===\nThe Territorial Force (TF) was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the [[Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921]] and renamed in October as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA).<ref>Beckett 2008 p. 97</ref> The First-Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in that year. The TA's intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the [[British Armed Forces]], when compared to the varied methods used during the First World War including the creation of Kitchener's Army. All TA recruits were required to take the general service obligation: if the [[Government of United Kingdom|British Government]] decided, territorial soldiers could be deployed overseas for combat that avoided the complications of the TF, whose members were not required to leave Britain unless they volunteered for overseas service.{{sfn|Allport|2015|p=323}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=53}}{{sfn|Perry|1988|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Simkins|2007|pp=43\u201346}}\n\nThe composition of the divisions was altered, with a reduction in the number of infantry battalions required. There was also a reduced need for cavalry, and of the 55 yeomanry regiments, only the 14 most senior retained their horses.

The cadres became part of a \"sponsoring\" TAVR II unit, although continuing to wear the badges and perpetuating the traditions of their forebears.

Some brigades were re-formed which consisted mostly of TA units.\n\nThe TA was thus re-roled into its modern form. Instead of supplying complete combat divisions, its function was to round out regular formations by supplying units of up to battalion size (including infantry, light artillery and [[Formation reconnaissance regiment|formation reconnaissance]]), and to supply extra support functions, such as engineers, medical units and military police.\n\n===1998 onwards===\nAfter the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, the TA's size of around 56,200 was further reduced. The Infantry suffered most, with 87 companies in 33 battalions reducing to 67 companies in 15 battalions. As of 2006, the Territorial Army had an authorised strength of 42,000 though recruiting difficulties put the actual strength of the TA significantly below that figure (manning is currently at approx 82% across the board, which equates to 34,000, while the actual strength of certain units is almost a skeleton crew, making them unsustainable without direct intervention by full-time personnel).\n\nArmy Reservists have seen service in a number of conflicts that the UK has been involved with since 1945. However, they served in particularly large numbers in two conflicts: the [[Korean War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]; both occurred during the 1950s and, on each occasion, the entire TA was called up. Throughout the Cold War, however, the Territorial Army was never regarded as a particularly usable force overseas, either by the Government of the day or by the Regular Army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This was due to the fact that the entire Territorial Army had to be mobilised by [[Royal Prerogative]] in a wartime scenario, as occurred in the World Wars, with no flexibility to use smaller formations or specialists if required and, as a result, relied purely on territorials willing to volunteer their services. Therefore, its role was, at least unofficially, seen as home defence and, as a result, the TA was not used in conflicts such as the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]]<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm TA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514150113/http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm |date=May 14, 2007 }}</ref> (205 Scottish General Hospital was mobilised as a unit based in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], during the 1991 Gulf War and a number of TA staff officers and others volunteered and served during the conflict, either in supporting roles in Germany or within 1 (UK) Armoured Division in the Middle East.) Some 550 TA personnel volunteered for and deployed on Op RESOLUTE in December 1995; the UK's contribution to the NATO mission to enforce peace in the Former Yugoslavia. The Government subsequently passed the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/14/contents|title=Reserve Forces Act 1996|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> which enables individual Reservists to be compulsorily called up for deployment, with certain [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]s exempting those in full-time education and other compassionate reasons, as well as providing protection by employment law for members' civilian jobs should they be mobilised, which has led to the Army Reserve increasingly providing routine support for the Regular Army overseas including delivery of composite units to release regular units from standing liabilities; including Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands.\n\nIn 2003, 9,500 reservists, the vast majority of them from the Reserve, were mobilised to take part in [[Operation TELIC]], the invasion of [[Iraq]]; in contrast, only some 420 Regular Reservists were called-up. Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on [[Tour of duty|tours of duty]] in Iraq, [[Operation HERRICK]] in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere, normally on six month-long [[roulement]]s. They cannot be used in operations for more than twelve months in any three-year period \u2013 making most of those who have already served ineligible for call up for two years afterwards, although reservists may choose to volunteer for additional deployments.\n\nArmy Reservists have a minimum commitment to serve 27 training days per annum, or 19 days for some national units. This period normally includes a two-week period of continuous training either as an Army Reserve unit, on courses or attached to a Regular unit. Army Reserve soldiers are paid at a similar rate as their regular equivalents while engaged on military activities. Soldiers of the Army Reserve often serve alongside their regular counterparts, including operations in Afghanistan where 1,000 out of the total 10,100 deployed have been Reservists{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, around 10% of the total.

This training can either be spread over 10 weekends at a UOTC, or 2 weeks at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module C''' builds on the Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation taught in Module B, with a greater focus on the theory behind these constructs. CBRN training is also added at this point, and Officer Cadets undergo a number of field exercises to test their military and leadership skills. Module C can only be undertaken at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module D''' Once the Officer Cadet has completed their ArmyOfficer Selection Board, they can complete this final module, after which they will become commissioned officers in the British Army. Based at the RMAS, this module consists primarily of a prolonged field exercise, followed by drill training in preparation for the passing out parade.\n\nOn successful completion of Module D, the Officer Cadets receive their [[Commission (document)|Commission]] and become [[Second Lieutenant]]s. Further training that is required prior to them being considered for operational deployment and promotion to [[Lieutenant]] includes:\n\n'''Post Commissioning Training''' (formerly known as Module 5), again run at an OTC, over 3 weekends.\n\n'''Special To Arm training''' is specific to the type of unit the [[Subaltern]] is joining, and covers a 2-week period. This is increasingly integrated with the tactics phase of a Regular training course. For example, the [[Platoon leader|Platoon Commander's]] Battle Course held at the [[Infantry Battle School]] in [[Brecon]] which is integrated within a Regular training course, or the [[Light Cavalry]] Commander's Course held at the Reconnaissance & Armoured Tactics Division in [[Warminster]] which is run separately to Regular training courses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[List of Territorial Army units (2012)]]\n*[[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]\n*[[Auxiliary Units]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[Exercise Cambrian Patrol]]\n*[[Home Service Force]] (1982\u20131993)\n*[[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n*[[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]\n*[[Royal Marines Reserve]]\n*[[Royal Naval Reserve]]\n{{col-break|gap=3em}}\n*[[Territorial Decoration]]\n*[[The Territorial Army (British Rail)]]\n*[[Volunteer Reserves Service Medal]]\n*[[Australian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Primary Reserve#Army Reserve|Canadian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Army Reserve (Ireland)|Irish Army Reserve]]\n*[[Indian Territorial Army]]\n*[[New Zealand Army#Army Reserve|Territorial Force]]\n*[[Rejimen Askar Wataniah]]\n{{col break|gap=4em}}\n'''People'''\n*[[Alfred Anderson (veteran)|Alfred Anderson]]\n*[[Micky Burn]]\n*[[Billy Connolly]]\n*[[Bill Deedes]]\n*[[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]]\n*[[Bear Grylls]]\n*[[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]]\n*[[Paddy Mayne]]\n*[[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |first=Alan |last=Allport |author1-link=Alan Allport |title=Browned Off and Bloody-minded: The British Soldier Goes to War 1939\u20131945 |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-300-17075-7 |lastauthoramp=y}}\n*Beckett, Ian F.

It should not be confused with the [[Regular Reserve (United Kingdom)|Regular Reserve]] whose members have formerly served full-time. The Army Reserve was previously known as the '''[[Territorial Force]]''' from 1908 to 1921, the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1921 to 1967, the '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) from 1967 to 1979, and again the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1979 to 2014.\n\nThe Army Reserve was created as the Territorial Force in 1908 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], when the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] combined the previously civilian-administered [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], with the mounted [[Yeomanry]] (at the same time the [[Militia#United Kingdom|Militia]] was renamed the [[Special Reserve]]). Most Volunteer infantry units had unique identities, but lost these in the reorganisation, becoming Territorial battalions of Regular Army infantry regiments. Only one infantry unit, the [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]], has maintained a separate identity.\n\nIts original purpose was home defence, although the establishment of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967 involved a restructuring and revised doctrine leading to the provision of routine support for the regular army overseas. Reservists in the past also served as [[constable]]s or [[bailiff]]s, even holding positions of civic duty as overseer of their parish. The more modern Yeomen of the 18th century were cavalry-based units, which were often used to suppress riots (see the [[Peterloo Massacre]]). Several units that are now part of the Army Reserve bear the title \"militia\",<ref>e.g. [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (Militia), The Jersey Field Squadron (Militia), The [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, the [[Royal Irish Rangers|Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th)]] (North Irish Militia) (until 1993)</ref> reflecting their origins as part of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|that organisation]] prior to the formation of the Special Reserve in 1907.\n\nDuring periods of [[total war]], the Army Reserve is incorporated by the [[Royal Prerogative]] into Regular Service under one code of Military Law for the duration of hostilities or until de-activation is decided upon. After the [[Second World War]], for example, the Army Reserve \u2013 or Territorial Army as it was known then \u2013 was not demobilised until 1947. Army Reservists normally have a full-time civilian job or career, which in some cases provides skills and expertise that are directly transferable to a specialist military role, such as [[National Health Service|NHS]] employees serving in Reservist [[Army Medical Services]] units. All Army Reserve personnel have their civilian jobs protected to a limited extent by law should they be compulsorily mobilised. There is, however, no legal protection against discrimination in employment for membership of the Army Reserve in the normal course of events (i.e. when not mobilised).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation to First World War===\n{{Main|Territorial Force}}\n\nThe Territorial Force was originally formed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], following the enactment of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] which combined and re-organised the old [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] with the [[Yeomanry]]. As part of the same process, remaining units of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] were converted to the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]. The TF was formed on 1 April 1908 and contained fourteen [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]]s, and fourteen mounted yeomanry [[brigade]]s. It had an overall strength of approximately 269,000.\n\nThe individual units that made up each division or brigade were administered by County Associations, with the county's [[lord lieutenant]] as president. The other members of the association consisted of ''military members'' (chosen from the commanding officers of the units), ''representative members'' (nominated by the [[county council]]s and [[county borough]]s in the lieutenancy county) and ''co-opted members'' (often retired military officers). Associations took over any property vested in the volunteers or yeomanry under their administration. Each regiment or battalion had a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] attached as full-time adjutant.\n\nThe use of the word ''territorial'' signified that the volunteers who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas\u2014in 1910, when asked to nominate for Imperial Service overseas in the event of mobilisation, less than 10% of the Force chose to do so. In August 1914, after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], territorial units were given the option of serving in [[France]] and, by 25 August, in excess of seventy [[battalion]]s had volunteered. This question over the availability of territorial divisions for overseas service was one of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s motivations for raising the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] separately.\n\nTerritorial formations initially saw service in [[Egypt]] and [[British Raj|British India]] and other [[British Empire|Empire]] garrisons, such as [[Gibraltar]], thereby releasing regular units for service in France and enabling the formation of an additional five regular army divisions (for a total of eleven) by early 1915. Several reserve units were also deployed with regular formations and the first territorial unit to see action on the Western Front was the [[32 (Scottish) Signal Regiment|Glasgow Territorial Signallers Group, Royal Engineers]] at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] on 11 October 1914. The first fully Territorial division to join the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] was the [[46th (North Midland) Division]] in March 1915, with divisions later serving in [[Gallipoli]] and elsewhere. As the war progressed, and casualties mounted, the distinctive character of territorial units was diluted by the inclusion of conscript and New Army drafts. Following [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the Armistice]] all units of the Territorial Force were gradually disbanded.\n\n===Interwar re-establishment and the Second World War===\nThe Territorial Force (TF) was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the [[Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921]] and renamed in October as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA).<ref>Beckett 2008 p. 97</ref> The First-Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in that year. The TA's intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the [[British Armed Forces]], when compared to the varied methods used during the First World War including the creation of Kitchener's Army. All TA recruits were required to take the general service obligation: if the [[Government of United Kingdom|British Government]] decided, territorial soldiers could be deployed overseas for combat that avoided the complications of the TF, whose members were not required to leave Britain unless they volunteered for overseas service.{{sfn|Allport|2015|p=323}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=53}}{{sfn|Perry|1988|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Simkins|2007|pp=43\u201346}}\n\nThe composition of the divisions was altered, with a reduction in the number of infantry battalions required. There was also a reduced need for cavalry, and of the 55 yeomanry regiments, only the 14 most senior retained their horses. The remaining yeomanry were converted to artillery or armoured car units or disbanded.<ref>New Territorial Army \u2013 The Government Scheme, ''The Times'', January 31, 1920</ref><ref>New Citizen Army \u2013 2nd Line Defence Scheme, ''The Times'', January 31, 1920</ref> The amalgamation of 40 pairs of infantry battalions was announced in October 1921.<ref>Territorial Army Reduction, ''The Times'', July 15, 1921</ref><ref>Territorial Army Amalgamations \u2013 40 Battalions Affected ''The Times'', October 5, 1921</ref> As part of the post-war \"[[Geddes Axe]]\" financial cuts, the TA was further reduced in size in 1922: artillery batteries lost two of their six guns, the established size of infantry battalions was cut and ancillary medical, veterinary, signals and [[Royal Army Service Corps]] units were either reduced in size or abolished.<ref>Territorial Army Reductions \u2013 \u00a31,650,000 to be saved, ''The Times'', March 4, 1922</ref> The bounty was also reduced to \u00a33 for trained men and \u00a32.10s 0d for recruits, which resulted in finding \u00a31,175,000 of the total savings required from the army as a whole.<ref>Ian F.

To avoid war, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] met with German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] in September and brokered the [[Munich Agreement]]. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to [[Annexation|annex]] the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275}} Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between both countries soon deteriorated.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=277\u2013278}} On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|the remnants of the Czech state]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=281}}\n\nOn 29 March, Secretary of State for War [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]] announced plans to increase the TA from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}} The plan was for existing TA units to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form second-line divisions from cadres that could be increased.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}}{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=47}} In April, limited [[conscription]] was introduced. This resulted in 34,500 twenty-year-old militiamen being conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before deployment to the forming second-line units.{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=49}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=64}} It was envisioned that the duplicating process and recruiting the required numbers of men would take no more than six months.

The TA's war deployment plan envisioned the divisions being deployed, as equipment became available, in waves to reinforce the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) that had already been dispatched to Europe. The TA would join regular army divisions completed their training, with the final divisions of the entire force deployed one year after the war began.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=455, 507, 514\u2013515}} A mixture of First and Second Line formations were deployed for combat overseas.

Thus, on 1 May 1961, the TA divisional headquarters were merged with regular army districts, which were matched with Civil Defence Regions to aid mobilisation for war.<ref>Beckett 2008, 183, 185.</ref> The number of infantry brigades was<!--'number' is the subject: the number was reduced--> reduced from 31 to 23, and the two armoured brigades were disbanded.\n\n{{anchor|TAVR}}This was followed by a complete reorganisation announced in the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] from 1 April 1967, when the title '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) was adopted, that abolished the former regimental and divisional structure of the TA.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=f9jMDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA106&dq=Territorial+and+Army+Volunteer+Reserve+%221+April+1967%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifrML7t8LeAhWBk4sKHdiPBjIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=Territorial%20and%20Army%20Volunteer%20Reserve%20%221%20April%201967%22&f=false|title=The Statesman's Year-Book 1967\u201368: The One-Volume ENCYCLOPAEDIA of all nations|last=Steinberg|first=S.|date=2016-12-27|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780230270961|location=|pages=106|language=en}}</ref> Units in the new TAVR were divided into four categories:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=gn27AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA282&lpg=PA282&dq=%22TAVR+I%22+%22TAVR+II%22+%22TAVR+III%22+army&source=bl&ots=4zm3yQffph&sig=ACfU3U0absPgvfaUvy2MtLegu7J6m_KJ6A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijxPzisMHgAhUVi3AKHceED8sQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22TAVR%20I%22%20%22TAVR%20II%22%20%22TAVR%20III%22%20army&f=false|title=The Amateur Military Tradition, 1558\u20131945|last=Beckett|first=Ian Frederick William|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=|isbn=9780719029127|location=|pages=282|language=en}}</ref><ref>Frederick, p. 326.</ref>\n\n*'''The Volunteers''' - units given designation of (V)\n**Special Army Volunteer Reserve - TAVR I - every readiness, 6 battalions ready for UN Duty, bringing the regular army to war establishment and replace casualties.\n***TAVR IA (Independent units)\n***TAVR IB (Sponsored)\n***Individuals from TAVR IA & IB\n**TAVR II - forces called 'The Volunteers'\n***TAVR IIA (Independent) - ie: 51st Highland Volunteers\n***TAVR IIB (Sponsered)\n*'''The Territorials''' - TAVR III\n**TAVR III (Independent), - units given (T) designation, mostly [[Cadre (military)|cadres]], maintaining law and order in the event of nuclear attack and were available for home defence, service, and help in case of emergencies\n*TAVR (Sponsored) - University OTC (UOTC), bands, and miscellaneous units.\n\nTAVR I and II units were known as \"Volunteers\", and those in TAVR III as \"Territorials\".

The cadres became part of a \"sponsoring\" TAVR II unit, although continuing to wear the badges and perpetuating the traditions of their forebears. An increase in the size of the TAVR in 1971 led to the formation of a number of battalions based on these cadres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/lists/ta1969.htm |title=Regiments of the British TERRITORIAL & ARMY VOLUNTEER RESERVE 1967 at regiments.org by T.F.Mills |accessdate=2015-02-13 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140005/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/lists/ta1969.htm |archivedate=2007-07-15 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.win.tue.nl/~drenth/BritArmy/Lineage/ Lineage of British Army Regiments 1967 \u2013 2000 by Wienand Drieth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331142241/http://www.win.tue.nl/~drenth/BritArmy/Lineage/ |date=2012-03-31 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the Territorial Army title was restored and, in the following years, its size was somewhat increased, with the regimental system being progressively reinstated. Some brigades were re-formed which consisted mostly of TA units.\n\nThe TA was thus re-roled into its modern form. Instead of supplying complete combat divisions, its function was to round out regular formations by supplying units of up to battalion size (including infantry, light artillery and [[Formation reconnaissance regiment|formation reconnaissance]]), and to supply extra support functions, such as engineers, medical units and military police.\n\n===1998 onwards===\nAfter the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, the TA's size of around 56,200 was further reduced. The Infantry suffered most, with 87 companies in 33 battalions reducing to 67 companies in 15 battalions. As of 2006, the Territorial Army had an authorised strength of 42,000 though recruiting difficulties put the actual strength of the TA significantly below that figure (manning is currently at approx 82% across the board, which equates to 34,000, while the actual strength of certain units is almost a skeleton crew, making them unsustainable without direct intervention by full-time personnel).\n\nArmy Reservists have seen service in a number of conflicts that the UK has been involved with since 1945. However, they served in particularly large numbers in two conflicts: the [[Korean War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]; both occurred during the 1950s and, on each occasion, the entire TA was called up. Throughout the Cold War, however, the Territorial Army was never regarded as a particularly usable force overseas, either by the Government of the day or by the Regular Army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This was due to the fact that the entire Territorial Army had to be mobilised by [[Royal Prerogative]] in a wartime scenario, as occurred in the World Wars, with no flexibility to use smaller formations or specialists if required and, as a result, relied purely on territorials willing to volunteer their services. Therefore, its role was, at least unofficially, seen as home defence and, as a result, the TA was not used in conflicts such as the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]]<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm TA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514150113/http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm |date=May 14, 2007 }}</ref> (205 Scottish General Hospital was mobilised as a unit based in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], during the 1991 Gulf War and a number of TA staff officers and others volunteered and served during the conflict, either in supporting roles in Germany or within 1 (UK) Armoured Division in the Middle East.) Some 550 TA personnel volunteered for and deployed on Op RESOLUTE in December 1995; the UK's contribution to the NATO mission to enforce peace in the Former Yugoslavia. The Government subsequently passed the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/14/contents|title=Reserve Forces Act 1996|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> which enables individual Reservists to be compulsorily called up for deployment, with certain [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]s exempting those in full-time education and other compassionate reasons, as well as providing protection by employment law for members' civilian jobs should they be mobilised, which has led to the Army Reserve increasingly providing routine support for the Regular Army overseas including delivery of composite units to release regular units from standing liabilities; including Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands.\n\nIn 2003, 9,500 reservists, the vast majority of them from the Reserve, were mobilised to take part in [[Operation TELIC]], the invasion of [[Iraq]]; in contrast, only some 420 Regular Reservists were called-up. Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on [[Tour of duty|tours of duty]] in Iraq, [[Operation HERRICK]] in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere, normally on six month-long [[roulement]]s. They cannot be used in operations for more than twelve months in any three-year period \u2013 making most of those who have already served ineligible for call up for two years afterwards, although reservists may choose to volunteer for additional deployments.\n\nArmy Reservists have a minimum commitment to serve 27 training days per annum, or 19 days for some national units. This period normally includes a two-week period of continuous training either as an Army Reserve unit, on courses or attached to a Regular unit. Army Reserve soldiers are paid at a similar rate as their regular equivalents while engaged on military activities. Soldiers of the Army Reserve often serve alongside their regular counterparts, including operations in Afghanistan where 1,000 out of the total 10,100 deployed have been Reservists{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, around 10% of the total. The annual budget of the Army Reserve is approximately \u00a3350 million \u2013 around 1.3% of the total [[List of countries and federations by military expenditures|defence budget]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0070.html|title=British Army \u2013 Reserve Forces \u2013 Types of Reservist and Manpower Strength \u2013 Armed Forces \u2013 a11a3|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2011 onwards and renaming===\n[[File:Army Reservists Applying Camouflage MOD 45156159.jpg|thumb|Army Reservists applying camouflage during a training exercise]]\nUnder the \"Future Reserves 2020\" (FR20) plan outlined by then Secretary of State for Defence [[Liam Fox]] on 18 July 2011, the Ministry of Defence promised to provide more money to train more Army Reservists with the objective of more frequently deploying entire Army Reserve units{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} (much like [[United States Army Reserve]] and [[Army National Guard]] units). Under the reform plan, the total force will be restructured so that, by 2020, the British Army will have 120,000 soldiers, of which 84,000 will be Regulars and 35,000 Reservists (a ratio of 70/30).

This is normally conducted by the Arm or Service that the recruit is joining, for example for infantry units, Phase 2 consists of the two-week Combat Infantryman's Course (TA) (CIC (TA)) held at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]], [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]].<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence\"/>\n\n===Officers===\n\nTo gain a commission, Potential Officers have to pass through four modules of training, which together form the Army Reserve Commissioning Course.\n\n'''Module A''' consists of basic field training and elementary military skills. This can be completed at either a UOTC over a number of weekends, or over 2 weeks at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] (RMAS)\n\n'''Module B''' covers training in Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation, both in theory and in practice, with a focus on the section battle drills and the platoon combat estimate. This training can either be spread over 10 weekends at a UOTC, or 2 weeks at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module C''' builds on the Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation taught in Module B, with a greater focus on the theory behind these constructs. CBRN training is also added at this point, and Officer Cadets undergo a number of field exercises to test their military and leadership skills. Module C can only be undertaken at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module D''' Once the Officer Cadet has completed their ArmyOfficer Selection Board, they can complete this final module, after which they will become commissioned officers in the British Army. Based at the RMAS, this module consists primarily of a prolonged field exercise, followed by drill training in preparation for the passing out parade.\n\nOn successful completion of Module D, the Officer Cadets receive their [[Commission (document)|Commission]] and become [[Second Lieutenant]]s. Further training that is required prior to them being considered for operational deployment and promotion to [[Lieutenant]] includes:\n\n'''Post Commissioning Training''' (formerly known as Module 5), again run at an OTC, over 3 weekends.\n\n'''Special To Arm training''' is specific to the type of unit the [[Subaltern]] is joining, and covers a 2-week period. This is increasingly integrated with the tactics phase of a Regular training course. For example, the [[Platoon leader|Platoon Commander's]] Battle Course held at the [[Infantry Battle School]] in [[Brecon]] which is integrated within a Regular training course, or the [[Light Cavalry]] Commander's Course held at the Reconnaissance & Armoured Tactics Division in [[Warminster]] which is run separately to Regular training courses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[List of Territorial Army units (2012)]]\n*[[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]\n*[[Auxiliary Units]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[Exercise Cambrian Patrol]]\n*[[Home Service Force]] (1982\u20131993)\n*[[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n*[[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]\n*[[Royal Marines Reserve]]\n*[[Royal Naval Reserve]]\n{{col-break|gap=3em}}\n*[[Territorial Decoration]]\n*[[The Territorial Army (British Rail)]]\n*[[Volunteer Reserves Service Medal]]\n*[[Australian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Primary Reserve#Army Reserve|Canadian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Army Reserve (Ireland)|Irish Army Reserve]]\n*[[Indian Territorial Army]]\n*[[New Zealand Army#Army Reserve|Territorial Force]]\n*[[Rejimen Askar Wataniah]]\n{{col break|gap=4em}}\n'''People'''\n*[[Alfred Anderson (veteran)|Alfred Anderson]]\n*[[Micky Burn]]\n*[[Billy Connolly]]\n*[[Bill Deedes]]\n*[[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]]\n*[[Bear Grylls]]\n*[[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]]\n*[[Paddy Mayne]]\n*[[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |first=Alan |last=Allport |author1-link=Alan Allport |title=Browned Off and Bloody-minded: The British Soldier Goes to War 1939\u20131945 |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-300-17075-7 |lastauthoramp=y}}\n*Beckett, Ian F.

{"title_page": "Municipalities of Denmark", "text_new": "{{Politics of Denmark}}\n'''[[Denmark]]''' is divided into five [[regions of Denmark|regions]], which contain 98 '''municipalities''' ({{lang-da|kommuner}} {{IPA-da|k\u02b0o\u02c8mu\u02d0n\u0250|}}, sing.: ''kommune'' {{IPA-da|-n\u0259|}}). The [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]] has 29 municipalities, [[Region of Southern Denmark|Southern Denmark]] 22, [[Central Denmark Region|Central Denmark]] 19, [[Region Zealand|Zealand]] 17 and [[North Denmark Region|North Denmark]] 11.\n\nThis structure was established per an administrative reform (Danish, [[:da:Strukturreformen|''Strukturreformen'']];English, ''(The) Structural Reform'') of the public sector of Denmark, effective 26 June 2005 (council elections 15 November 2005), which abolished the 13 [[Counties of Denmark|counties]] (''amter'';singular ''amt'') and created five [[Regions of Denmark|regions]] (''regioner'';singular ''region'') which unlike the counties (1970-2006) (Danish (singular) [[:da:Amtskommune|amtskommune]] literally ''County Municipality'') are not [[List of municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]]. The 270 municipalities were consolidated into 98 larger units, most of which have at least 20,000 inhabitants.\n\n67 of the present municipalities are mergers as a result of the administrative reform, with [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality|\u00c6r\u00f8]] being allowed to merge already on 1 January 2006, and one municipality, [[Bornholm|Bornholm Regional Municipality]], being a merger from 1 January 2003, that is 68 merged municipalities in all. The 30 remaining municipalities have not merged.\n\nBefore the merger on Bornholm there were 275 municipalities and 14 counties. Two ''[[sui generis]]'' municipalities, namely [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]], were never a part of a county, but were counties in their own right.\n\nMany of the responsibilities of the former counties were taken over by the 98 municipalities. With the increased responsibilities, the income tax that each of the 98 municipalities levies was raised by 3 percentage points on 1 January 2007. This tax had once been a part of the tax levied by the former counties.\n\nThe archipelago of [[Ertholmene]] is not part of any municipality, but is administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe average ''land'' area of a [[List of municipalities of Denmark|Danish municipality]] is 432.59&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 167.08 square miles.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Legal foundation of municipalities==\nThe [[Constitution of Denmark]] states: \"Article 82. The right of municipalities to manage their own affairs independently, under State supervision, shall be laid down by statute.\"<ref>[[wikisource:Constitutional Act of Denmark, 5 June 1953]]</ref>\n\n===Councillors===\n2,522 municipal councillors (and 205 regional councillors) were elected on Tuesday 15 November [[2005 Danish local elections|2005]] being the first councils elected since the new reform. In 1997 there were 4,685 municipal and 374 county councillors in the then 275 municipalities and 14 counties. As an example of the reduction in the number of councillors, [[Bornholm]] then had a total of 122 councillors in five municipalities and one county (15 county councillors). After the merger on 1 January 2003 of the five municipalities and the county, there was one single municipal council with 27 municipal councillors.  They were reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018. After 1 January 2007, when Bornholm Regional Municipality lost its (short-lived;4 years 2003 until 2006) county privileges, there is talk of a reduction to 19 municipal councillors, the guidelines for a municipality with over 20,000 inhabitants being a maximum of 31 and minimum of 19 municipal councillors and the guidelines for a municipality with less than 20,000 inhabitants being a maximum of 31 and minimum of 9 municipal councillors. These guidelines replaced the old guidelines with the council elections in 2005 after the laws initiating the structural reform were passed in parliament. Many newly formed municipalities have chosen to have a maximum number of councillors so that all parts of the new municipalities and the small political parties have a chance of representation in the new councils; [[Copenhagen Municipality]] has 55 municipal councillors, and populous municipalities such as [[Aarhus Municipality|\u00c5rhus]] and [[Aalborg Municipality|Aalborg]] have 31 each, and [[Odense Municipality|Odense]] has 29. [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in elections 2009), [[Glostrup Municipality|Glostrup]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in 2009), [[H\u00f8rsholm Municipality|H\u00f8rsholm]] (from 15 to 19 cllrs in 2005), [[Ish\u00f8j Municipality|Ish\u00f8j]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in 2009), and [[T\u00e5rnby Municipality|T\u00e5rnby]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in 2009) are examples of municipalities that have increased the number of councillors because of the new guidelines.\n\nCouncil elections are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years. The previous were held on 21 November 2017.\n\nThe newly formed 5 regional and 66 municipal councils acted as transitional merger committees (''sammenl\u00e6gningsudvalg'')  in 2006 with the responsibility of arranging the mergers (singular ''sammenl\u00e6gning'') of the old counties and municipalities into 5 and 66 new entities respectively. The 238 municipal councils and 13 county councils that were to be merged and replaced/abolished just continued their work one extra year beyond the fixed four-year term of office they were elected for (2002\u20132005) until 2006, and then ceased to exist. 32 municipalities including those of the recently formed [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality]] (which was included in the reform) and [[Bornholm]] Regional Municipality (which was not merged as a result of the reform, merger decided locally by voters already 29 May 2001 and made effective from 1 January 2003) remained unchanged and were not merged with other municipalities.\n\nLocal elections have also been held in uneven years earlier, but immediately before 1 January 1979, when the fiscal year in the public sector was changed from 1 April until 31 March into 1 January until 31 December, local elections were held in March and the elected councillors took their seats the following month, 1 April.

The number of municipalities was the highest in 1965, at 1345 - with more than 10,000 councillors - of which 88 were market city municipalities, including Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, and 1257 were parish municipalities (800 of which had no staff employed except the mayor and treasurer/supervisor of the administration (Danish [[:da:K\u00e6mner|''k\u00e6mner'']] - a term last used - until 1996 - in [[Sindal Municipality|Sindal]], today a part of [[Hj\u00f8rring Municipality]]), both employed part-time).<ref>[https://www.prosa.dk/aktuelt/prosabladet/artikel/artikel/kommunalreformen/ (Danish) 14.11.06 Behind the scenes of Strukturreformen Retrieved 5.8.16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819185442/https://www.prosa.dk/aktuelt/prosabladet/artikel/artikel/kommunalreformen/ |date=2016-08-19 }}</ref><ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.byhistorie.dk/kommuner/ The local administration 1660-2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231183737/http://www.byhistorie.dk/kommuner/ |date=31 December 2007 }}; Historiske kort (History maps); V\u00e6lg et \u00e5rstal (Select a year).</ref>\n\n===Municipal reform of 1970===\n\nIn 1970, a municipal reform ended the distinction between parish municipalities and market city municipalities. With the reform of 1970, the term municipality (''kommune'') replaced the previous two terms, which are now never used except for historical purposes. By 1 April 1970, the 1098 municipalities existing at the start of 1970 (with around 10,000 councillors) were merged to form 277 new municipalities.\n\nA few years later, the number was slightly reduced again to 275 as a few municipalities in [[Copenhagen County]] merged. 1 April 1974, [[:da:Sengel\u00f8se Sogn|Sengel\u00f8se]] municipality merged with [[H\u00f8je-Taastrup Municipality]], and [[:da:Store Magleby Sogn|Store Magleby parish]] merged with [[:da:Drag\u00f8r Sogn|Drag\u00f8r parish]] to form the new [[Drag\u00f8r Municipality]]. The voters of [[Sengel\u00f8se]] - which was created a municipality 1 April 1970 but only existed until 31 March 1974, being deemed too small in population - and [[Store Magleby parish]] were almost exclusively owner-occupiers, who voted center-rightwing in elections for the municipal council, whereas [[H\u00f8je-Taastrup Municipality]] and [[Drag\u00f8r parish]] consisted of mainly tenants who rented their apartments and who voted center-leftwing, so heated debates took place before the mergers, because the center-rightwing voters in the merged municipalities would be in minority at the elections. (Since 1 January 1962 only two mayors of H\u00f8je-Taastrup have been Social Democrats, namely Per S\u00f8ndergaard from 1978 until 1981 (four years), and Anders Bak (1948-2006) from 1986 until 2005 (20 years);Michael Ziegler, Conservative People's Party, has been mayor from 1 January 2006). Thus the number of municipalities was 277 from 1 April 1970 to 1 April 1974, from that date dropping to 275. Also on 1 April 1974, [[Aved\u00f8re]], which was part of [[Glostrup Municipality]], was conjoined with [[Hvidovre Municipality]]. This combination was logical, as Aved\u00f8re borders Hvidovre, but is separated from Glostrup.\n\nMany of the <!--277 municipalities from 1 April 1970 to 1 April 1974 (from 1 April 1974 Sengel\u00f8se municipality merging with H\u00f8je-Taastrup municipality (1970-) and Store Magleby parish municipality merging with Drag\u00f8r municipality, both in Copenhagen County)--> 275 municipalities after 1 April 1974 built large city halls to consolidate the administration, thus, changing the cityscape of Denmark. It also consolidated other municipal enterprises and the purchase of goods and services from the private sector.\n\nUntil 1978 the [[fiscal year]] from 1 April to 31 March was in use in the public sector since a law was passed in 1849. As a consequence of a law passed by the Folketing in 1976, from 1 January 1979 the fiscal year is [[wikt:concurrent|concurrent]] with the [[calendar year]]. Many reforms and laws passed prior to 1979 therefore have effect from 1 April.\n\nThe 275 municipalities existed from 1 April 1974 until 31 December 2002, when the five municipalities on [[Bornholm]] merged with the county to form [[Bornholm|Bornholm regional municipality]], in the process abolishing the county and thereby reducing the number of counties to 13. This brought the number of municipalities down to 271 from 1 January 2003.\n\n==={{anchor|Municipal reform 2007|Municipality reform 2007|Municipal Reform 2007}} Municipal reform of 2007===\n\nAfter the [[2001 Danish parliamentary election|general election in 2001]] and the formation of a new government, a new municipal reform was discussed. Among the reasons advanced in favour of the reform were more synergies through economies of scale (critical mass and greater professional and financial sustainability) and big item discounts and the possibility of offering a wider array of services closer to the public (via a one-stop place of access to the public sector not unlike the [[unitary council]]s) Also, the reform was intended to alleviate the financial problems of depopulation in some areas due to limited job opportunities, high unemployment and aging, and to make introduction of new information technology more affordable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dr.dk/mitdanmark/da/forside/ |title=A TV series on the municipal reform. |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011081011/http://dr.dk/mitdanmark/da/forside/ |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all |language=da}}</ref> In short: fewer people, fewer municipalities.\n\nA commission on structural reform was set up by the government 1 October 2002 and presented its report 9 January 2004. The government put forward a proposal in April 2004, and a parliamentary majority backing the reform was secured 24 June 2004 when the [[Danish People's Party]] (then 22 seats) said it would support an agreement with the government coalition of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (then 56 seats) and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] (then 16 seats), thus securing 94 seats (90 needed for a majority in the 179 seat [[Folketing]]). The laws behind the mergers were subjected to a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] from 1 December 2004 to collect opinions - for or against or to modify the laws - from organisations and individuals. After the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|national election of 2005]] a final agreement merging many municipalities, as well as abolishing the 13 counties and setting up five [[Regions of Denmark#History|regions]], was reached by the [[Politics of Denmark|parties]] [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], [[Danish People's Party]], [[Socialdemokraterne|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Det Radikale Venstre]]. Presented in February 2005 to the [[Folketing]], the lawmakers finally approved the last of the 50 [[Bill (law)|bills]] needed for the mergers by voting for the bills 16 June 2005. The laws became effective 26 June 2005, as always the day after publication in [[Lovtidende]]. Half of the bills received support from more political parties than the three parties with the political majority of 94 seats. Then the mergers were specified and approved in a departmental order (Danish ''ministeriel bekendtg\u00f8relse'') signed 29 June 2005 by [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], then [[Ministry of Interior and Health (Denmark)|minister of the interior and health]]. As a curiosity, all of [[Billund Airport]], then partly located in [[Give Municipality]], became a part of [[Billund Municipality]], and any future expansion of the airport will also become a part of that municipality. [[2005 Danish local elections|The first elections to the new regions and municipalities]] were held in November 2005. \n\nThe reform replaced the structure of municipalities and counties introduced with the reform of 1970. Three [[sui generis]] municipalities who were also counties lost their county privileges and became part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]], although one of these three municipalities, [[Bornholm Regional Municipality|Bornholm]], which was created 1 January 2003 after the merger of its county with the 5 municipalities was approved in a law by the [[Folketing]] 19 March 2002 - thereby abolishing one of the 14 counties in the process - because of its remote location 150&nbsp;km (93&nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]] retains ''some'' regional functions and is thus called a ''Regional Municipality'' - it performs some tasks that are only performed by the regions in the rest of Denmark. (From 1 January 2016 and 2018 \u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality and [[Fan\u00f8 Municipality]], respectively, will also handle a task on the islands which was formerly the responsibility of the [[Region of Southern Denmark]], namely public mass transit).\n\nAlmost all the mergers of the municipalities took place 1 January 2007, but [[Marstal municipality]] and [[\u00c6r\u00f8sk\u00f8bing municipality]], both on the island of [[\u00c6r\u00f8]], after a referendum on the island had decided to merge the two municipalities, were allowed by the Danish government to merge already from 1 January 2006 to form [[\u00c6r\u00f8 municipality]], thus bringing the number of municipalities down to 270 that were finally reduced by mergers from 1 January 2007 to form 98 municipalities.\n\n=== Sectors affected ===\n\nSince the counties weren't the only structure based on the municipal layout of Denmark, other related changes were carried out as well. Thus, police districts (reduced from 54 to 12),<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/lovstof/politi-og-domstolsreform/nye-politi-og-retskredse/ New police districts and local court circuits with links to maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101013422/http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/lovstof/politi-og-domstolsreform/nye-politi-og-retskredse/ |date=1 November 2007 }}</ref> court districts (reduced from 82 to 24), tax districts (before 2007 the responsibility of the municipalities;after that part of the central government Ministry of Taxation), [[electoral ward]]s, and [[parish]]es in the [[Church of Denmark]] also were reduced following the municipal reform.\n\n=== Number of politicians ===\n\nThe 2007 reform reduced the number of local and regional politicians by almost half to 2,522 (municipal councillors) ([[2005 Danish local elections|council elections November 2005]]; reduced in the [[2009 Danish local elections|2009 elections]] to 2,468; [[2013 Danish local elections|in 2013]] 2,444; [[2017 Danish local elections|in 2017]] 2,432) (1978: 4,735;1998: 4,685; reduced somewhat in council elections November 2001 ([[Bornholm]])) and 205 (regional councillors) (1998: 374 county board cllrs)<ref>{{in lang|da}} Den Store Danske Encyklop\u00e6di + Supplement 2, \"kommunalvalg\".

The [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]] has 29 municipalities, [[Region of Southern Denmark|Southern Denmark]] 22, [[Central Denmark Region|Central Denmark]] 19, [[Region Zealand|Zealand]] 17 and [[North Denmark Region|North Denmark]] 11.\n\nThis structure was established per an administrative reform (Danish, [[:da:Strukturreformen|''Strukturreformen'']];English, ''(The) Structural Reform'') of the public sector of Denmark, effective 26 June 2005 (council elections 15 November 2005), which abolished the 13 [[Counties of Denmark|counties]] (''amter'';singular ''amt'') and created five [[Regions of Denmark|regions]] (''regioner'';singular ''region'') which unlike the counties (1970-2006) (Danish (singular) [[:da:Amtskommune|amtskommune]] literally ''County Municipality'') are not [[List of municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]]. The 270 municipalities were consolidated into 98 larger units, most of which have at least 20,000 inhabitants.\n\n67 of the present municipalities are mergers as a result of the administrative reform, with [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality|\u00c6r\u00f8]] being allowed to merge already on 1 January 2006, and one municipality, [[Bornholm|Bornholm Regional Municipality]], being a merger from 1 January 2003, that is 68 merged municipalities in all. The 30 remaining municipalities have not merged.\n\nBefore the merger on Bornholm there were 275 municipalities and 14 counties. Two ''[[sui generis]]'' municipalities, namely [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]], were never a part of a county, but were counties in their own right.\n\nMany of the responsibilities of the former counties were taken over by the 98 municipalities. With the increased responsibilities, the income tax that each of the 98 municipalities levies was raised by 3 percentage points on 1 January 2007. This tax had once been a part of the tax levied by the former counties.\n\nThe archipelago of [[Ertholmene]] is not part of any municipality, but is administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe average ''land'' area of a [[List of municipalities of Denmark|Danish municipality]] is 432.59&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 167.08 square miles.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Legal foundation of municipalities==\nThe [[Constitution of Denmark]] states: \"Article 82. The right of municipalities to manage their own affairs independently, under State supervision, shall be laid down by statute.\"<ref>[[wikisource:Constitutional Act of Denmark, 5 June 1953]]</ref>\n\n===Councillors===\n2,522 municipal councillors (and 205 regional councillors) were elected on Tuesday 15 November [[2005 Danish local elections|2005]] being the first councils elected since the new reform. In 1997 there were 4,685 municipal and 374 county councillors in the then 275 municipalities and 14 counties. As an example of the reduction in the number of councillors, [[Bornholm]] then had a total of 122 councillors in five municipalities and one county (15 county councillors). After the merger on 1 January 2003 of the five municipalities and the county, there was one single municipal council with 27 municipal councillors.  They were reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018. After 1 January 2007, when Bornholm Regional Municipality lost its (short-lived;4 years 2003 until 2006) county privileges, there is talk of a reduction to 19 municipal councillors, the guidelines for a municipality with over 20,000 inhabitants being a maximum of 31 and minimum of 19 municipal councillors and the guidelines for a municipality with less than 20,000 inhabitants being a maximum of 31 and minimum of 9 municipal councillors. These guidelines replaced the old guidelines with the council elections in 2005 after the laws initiating the structural reform were passed in parliament. Many newly formed municipalities have chosen to have a maximum number of councillors so that all parts of the new municipalities and the small political parties have a chance of representation in the new councils; [[Copenhagen Municipality]] has 55 municipal councillors, and populous municipalities such as [[Aarhus Municipality|\u00c5rhus]] and [[Aalborg Municipality|Aalborg]] have 31 each, and [[Odense Municipality|Odense]] has 29. [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in elections 2009), [[Glostrup Municipality|Glostrup]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in 2009), [[H\u00f8rsholm Municipality|H\u00f8rsholm]] (from 15 to 19 cllrs in 2005), [[Ish\u00f8j Municipality|Ish\u00f8j]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in 2009), and [[T\u00e5rnby Municipality|T\u00e5rnby]] (from 17 to 19 cllrs in 2009) are examples of municipalities that have increased the number of councillors because of the new guidelines.\n\nCouncil elections are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years. The previous were held on 21 November 2017.\n\nThe newly formed 5 regional and 66 municipal councils acted as transitional merger committees (''sammenl\u00e6gningsudvalg'')  in 2006 with the responsibility of arranging the mergers (singular ''sammenl\u00e6gning'') of the old counties and municipalities into 5 and 66 new entities respectively. The 238 municipal councils and 13 county councils that were to be merged and replaced/abolished just continued their work one extra year beyond the fixed four-year term of office they were elected for (2002\u20132005) until 2006, and then ceased to exist. 32 municipalities including those of the recently formed [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality]] (which was included in the reform) and [[Bornholm]] Regional Municipality (which was not merged as a result of the reform, merger decided locally by voters already 29 May 2001 and made effective from 1 January 2003) remained unchanged and were not merged with other municipalities.\n\nLocal elections have also been held in uneven years earlier, but immediately before 1 January 1979, when the fiscal year in the public sector was changed from 1 April until 31 March into 1 January until 31 December, local elections were held in March and the elected councillors took their seats the following month, 1 April. Elections were held in even years (a few examples given here): March 1966, March 1970, March 1974, March 1978.  Term of office for local politicians elected in 1978 was 1 April 1978 until 31 December 1981. Local elections were held in November 1981 for the 4-year term of office (1 January) 1982- (31 December) 1985.

The number of municipalities was the highest in 1965, at 1345 - with more than 10,000 councillors - of which 88 were market city municipalities, including Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, and 1257 were parish municipalities (800 of which had no staff employed except the mayor and treasurer/supervisor of the administration (Danish [[:da:K\u00e6mner|''k\u00e6mner'']] - a term last used - until 1996 - in [[Sindal Municipality|Sindal]], today a part of [[Hj\u00f8rring Municipality]]), both employed part-time).<ref>[https://www.prosa.dk/aktuelt/prosabladet/artikel/artikel/kommunalreformen/ (Danish) 14.11.06 Behind the scenes of Strukturreformen Retrieved 5.8.16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819185442/https://www.prosa.dk/aktuelt/prosabladet/artikel/artikel/kommunalreformen/ |date=2016-08-19 }}</ref><ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.byhistorie.dk/kommuner/ The local administration 1660-2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231183737/http://www.byhistorie.dk/kommuner/ |date=31 December 2007 }}; Historiske kort (History maps); V\u00e6lg et \u00e5rstal (Select a year).</ref>\n\n===Municipal reform of 1970===\n\nIn 1970, a municipal reform ended the distinction between parish municipalities and market city municipalities. With the reform of 1970, the term municipality (''kommune'') replaced the previous two terms, which are now never used except for historical purposes. By 1 April 1970, the 1098 municipalities existing at the start of 1970 (with around 10,000 councillors) were merged to form 277 new municipalities.\n\nA few years later, the number was slightly reduced again to 275 as a few municipalities in [[Copenhagen County]] merged. 1 April 1974, [[:da:Sengel\u00f8se Sogn|Sengel\u00f8se]] municipality merged with [[H\u00f8je-Taastrup Municipality]], and [[:da:Store Magleby Sogn|Store Magleby parish]] merged with [[:da:Drag\u00f8r Sogn|Drag\u00f8r parish]] to form the new [[Drag\u00f8r Municipality]]. The voters of [[Sengel\u00f8se]] - which was created a municipality 1 April 1970 but only existed until 31 March 1974, being deemed too small in population - and [[Store Magleby parish]] were almost exclusively owner-occupiers, who voted center-rightwing in elections for the municipal council, whereas [[H\u00f8je-Taastrup Municipality]] and [[Drag\u00f8r parish]] consisted of mainly tenants who rented their apartments and who voted center-leftwing, so heated debates took place before the mergers, because the center-rightwing voters in the merged municipalities would be in minority at the elections. (Since 1 January 1962 only two mayors of H\u00f8je-Taastrup have been Social Democrats, namely Per S\u00f8ndergaard from 1978 until 1981 (four years), and Anders Bak (1948-2006) from 1986 until 2005 (20 years);Michael Ziegler, Conservative People's Party, has been mayor from 1 January 2006). Thus the number of municipalities was 277 from 1 April 1970 to 1 April 1974, from that date dropping to 275. Also on 1 April 1974, [[Aved\u00f8re]], which was part of [[Glostrup Municipality]], was conjoined with [[Hvidovre Municipality]]. This combination was logical, as Aved\u00f8re borders Hvidovre, but is separated from Glostrup.\n\nMany of the <!--277 municipalities from 1 April 1970 to 1 April 1974 (from 1 April 1974 Sengel\u00f8se municipality merging with H\u00f8je-Taastrup municipality (1970-) and Store Magleby parish municipality merging with Drag\u00f8r municipality, both in Copenhagen County)--> 275 municipalities after 1 April 1974 built large city halls to consolidate the administration, thus, changing the cityscape of Denmark. It also consolidated other municipal enterprises and the purchase of goods and services from the private sector.\n\nUntil 1978 the [[fiscal year]] from 1 April to 31 March was in use in the public sector since a law was passed in 1849. As a consequence of a law passed by the Folketing in 1976, from 1 January 1979 the fiscal year is [[wikt:concurrent|concurrent]] with the [[calendar year]]. Many reforms and laws passed prior to 1979 therefore have effect from 1 April.\n\nThe 275 municipalities existed from 1 April 1974 until 31 December 2002, when the five municipalities on [[Bornholm]] merged with the county to form [[Bornholm|Bornholm regional municipality]], in the process abolishing the county and thereby reducing the number of counties to 13. This brought the number of municipalities down to 271 from 1 January 2003.\n\n==={{anchor|Municipal reform 2007|Municipality reform 2007|Municipal Reform 2007}} Municipal reform of 2007===\n\nAfter the [[2001 Danish parliamentary election|general election in 2001]] and the formation of a new government, a new municipal reform was discussed. Among the reasons advanced in favour of the reform were more synergies through economies of scale (critical mass and greater professional and financial sustainability) and big item discounts and the possibility of offering a wider array of services closer to the public (via a one-stop place of access to the public sector not unlike the [[unitary council]]s) Also, the reform was intended to alleviate the financial problems of depopulation in some areas due to limited job opportunities, high unemployment and aging, and to make introduction of new information technology more affordable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dr.dk/mitdanmark/da/forside/ |title=A TV series on the municipal reform. |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011081011/http://dr.dk/mitdanmark/da/forside/ |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all |language=da}}</ref> In short: fewer people, fewer municipalities.\n\nA commission on structural reform was set up by the government 1 October 2002 and presented its report 9 January 2004. The government put forward a proposal in April 2004, and a parliamentary majority backing the reform was secured 24 June 2004 when the [[Danish People's Party]] (then 22 seats) said it would support an agreement with the government coalition of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (then 56 seats) and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] (then 16 seats), thus securing 94 seats (90 needed for a majority in the 179 seat [[Folketing]]). The laws behind the mergers were subjected to a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] from 1 December 2004 to collect opinions - for or against or to modify the laws - from organisations and individuals. After the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|national election of 2005]] a final agreement merging many municipalities, as well as abolishing the 13 counties and setting up five [[Regions of Denmark#History|regions]], was reached by the [[Politics of Denmark|parties]] [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], [[Danish People's Party]], [[Socialdemokraterne|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Det Radikale Venstre]]. Presented in February 2005 to the [[Folketing]], the lawmakers finally approved the last of the 50 [[Bill (law)|bills]] needed for the mergers by voting for the bills 16 June 2005. The laws became effective 26 June 2005, as always the day after publication in [[Lovtidende]]. Half of the bills received support from more political parties than the three parties with the political majority of 94 seats. Then the mergers were specified and approved in a departmental order (Danish ''ministeriel bekendtg\u00f8relse'') signed 29 June 2005 by [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], then [[Ministry of Interior and Health (Denmark)|minister of the interior and health]]. As a curiosity, all of [[Billund Airport]], then partly located in [[Give Municipality]], became a part of [[Billund Municipality]], and any future expansion of the airport will also become a part of that municipality. [[2005 Danish local elections|The first elections to the new regions and municipalities]] were held in November 2005. \n\nThe reform replaced the structure of municipalities and counties introduced with the reform of 1970. Three [[sui generis]] municipalities who were also counties lost their county privileges and became part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]], although one of these three municipalities, [[Bornholm Regional Municipality|Bornholm]], which was created 1 January 2003 after the merger of its county with the 5 municipalities was approved in a law by the [[Folketing]] 19 March 2002 - thereby abolishing one of the 14 counties in the process - because of its remote location 150&nbsp;km (93&nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]] retains ''some'' regional functions and is thus called a ''Regional Municipality'' - it performs some tasks that are only performed by the regions in the rest of Denmark. (From 1 January 2016 and 2018 \u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality and [[Fan\u00f8 Municipality]], respectively, will also handle a task on the islands which was formerly the responsibility of the [[Region of Southern Denmark]], namely public mass transit).\n\nAlmost all the mergers of the municipalities took place 1 January 2007, but [[Marstal municipality]] and [[\u00c6r\u00f8sk\u00f8bing municipality]], both on the island of [[\u00c6r\u00f8]], after a referendum on the island had decided to merge the two municipalities, were allowed by the Danish government to merge already from 1 January 2006 to form [[\u00c6r\u00f8 municipality]], thus bringing the number of municipalities down to 270 that were finally reduced by mergers from 1 January 2007 to form 98 municipalities.\n\n=== Sectors affected ===\n\nSince the counties weren't the only structure based on the municipal layout of Denmark, other related changes were carried out as well. Thus, police districts (reduced from 54 to 12),<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/lovstof/politi-og-domstolsreform/nye-politi-og-retskredse/ New police districts and local court circuits with links to maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101013422/http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/lovstof/politi-og-domstolsreform/nye-politi-og-retskredse/ |date=1 November 2007 }}</ref> court districts (reduced from 82 to 24), tax districts (before 2007 the responsibility of the municipalities;after that part of the central government Ministry of Taxation), [[electoral ward]]s, and [[parish]]es in the [[Church of Denmark]] also were reduced following the municipal reform.\n\n=== Number of politicians ===\n\nThe 2007 reform reduced the number of local and regional politicians by almost half to 2,522 (municipal councillors) ([[2005 Danish local elections|council elections November 2005]]; reduced in the [[2009 Danish local elections|2009 elections]] to 2,468; [[2013 Danish local elections|in 2013]] 2,444; [[2017 Danish local elections|in 2017]] 2,432) (1978: 4,735;1998: 4,685; reduced somewhat in council elections November 2001 ([[Bornholm]])) and 205 (regional councillors) (1998: 374 county board cllrs)<ref>{{in lang|da}} Den Store Danske Encyklop\u00e6di + Supplement 2, \"kommunalvalg\".

Laud's new ideas and prayers had upset the Scots, and when Charles was refused an army from Parliament, which did not trust him, he created his own.
