The producers kept quiet about the storyline surrounding his exit, although confirmed that he would depart \"in a big way\".

Created by [[William J. Bell]], the character was portrayed by [[Scott Reeves]], who made his first appearance On June 26, 1991 as a businessman who wanted to \"work his way to the top of the corporation ladder\". The character gained popularity upon his relationship with [[Victoria Newman]] ([[Heather Tom]]), which initially received criticism due to the characters' [[age gap]]. He was also involved with [[Nina Webster]] ([[Tricia Cast]]) and the insane [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Tricia Dennison McNeil|Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]).\n\nReeves, who described Ryan as a \"go-getter\" who was \"shrewd\" and a \"charmer\", found his seduction storyline with Victoria hard to \"play out\" considering her age. In October 2001, the actor announced his exit from ''The Young and the Restless'', stating it was to pursue other projects. The producers kept quiet about the storyline surrounding his exit, although confirmed that he would depart \"in a big way\". Within the story, Ryan prepared to remarry Victoria but Tricia, his ex-wife, attempted to shoot her and Ryan took two bullets and died from the injury. Throughout his time on the soap opera, Reeves became popular with fans as one of the genre's leading men, garnering multiple awards and nominations.\n\n==Casting==\nReeves first appeared as Ryan in May 1991, on contract.

In the UK, it is produced by the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9- to12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]].

The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they do not address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final. Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.

competitive cooking show produced by [[Endemol Shine Group]] and is broadcasted in 60 countries around the world. In the UK, it is produced by the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9- to12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they do not address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final.  Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.  Many commentators (who did not realise what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"undercooked\".

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home.

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home.

Nevertheless, Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti has been the dominant club side in Romania since the arrival of the 21st century, recording six titles over the past decade.
