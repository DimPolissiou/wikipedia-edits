He was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the [[U.S. Constitution]], as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the [[Federalist Party]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the ''[[New York Post]]'' newspaper. As the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]], Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of [[George Washington]]'s administration. He took the lead in the Federal government's funding of the states' debts, as well as establishing a [[First Bank of the United States|national bank]], a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, a national bank and support for manufacturing, and a strong military.\n\nHamilton was born out of wedlock in [[Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis|Charlestown]], [[Nevis]]. He was orphaned as a child and taken in by a prosperous merchant.  When he reached his teens, he was sent to New York to pursue his education.  He took an early role in the militia as the [[American Revolutionary War]] began.  In 1777, he became a senior aide to General Washington in running the new [[Continental Army]].  After the war, he was elected as a representative from New York to the [[Congress of the Confederation]]. He resigned to practice law and founded the [[Bank of New York]] before entering politics. Hamilton was a leader in seeking to replace the weak national government under the [[Articles of Confederation]]; he led the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention of 1786]], which spurred Congress to call a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]]. He helped ratify the Constitution by writing 51 of the 85 installments of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', which are still used as one of the most important references for [[Constitutional interpretation]].\n\nHamilton led the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] as a trusted member of President Washington's first Cabinet. Hamilton successfully argued that the [[implied powers]] of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the [[National debt of the United States|\nnational debt]], to assume states' debts, and to create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a [[tariff]] on imports, and later by a controversial [[whiskey tax]]. He opposed friendly relations with the [[French Revolution|French revolutionaries]]. Hamilton's views became the basis for the Federalist Party, which was opposed to the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. In 1795, he returned to the practice of law in New York. He called for mobilization against the [[French First Republic]] in 1798\u201399 under President [[John Adams]], and became [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General]] of the U.S. Army, which he reconstituted, modernized, and readied for war. The army did not see combat in the [[Quasi-War]], and Hamilton was outraged by Adams' diplomatic approach to the crisis with France. His opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause the Federalist party defeat in [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. Jefferson and [[Aaron Burr]] tied for the presidency in the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences.\n\nHamilton continued his legal and business activities in New York City, and was active in ending the legality of the international slave trade.  Vice President Burr ran for governor of New York State in 1804, and Hamilton campaigned against him as unworthy. Taking offense, Burr challenged him to [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|a duel]] on July 11, 1804, in which Burr shot and mortally wounded Hamilton, who died the following day. Hamilton is generally regarded as an astute and intellectually brilliant politician and financier, if often impetuous. His ideas are credited with laying the foundation for American government and finance.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Childhood in the Caribbean==\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=horizontal\n |total_width=300\n |background color=Wheat\n |header_background=White\n |header=Arms of [[Clan Hamilton|Hamilton]] of [[Kerelaw Castle|Grange]]\n |image1=Arms of Hamilton of Grange.svg\n |alt1=Hamilton of Grange arms\n |caption1=Arms: ''Gules'', a lion rampant, ''argent'', betwixt three cinquefoils, ''ermine''<ref name=aha>{{cite web |title=Rare Artifacts at Columbia's RBML |first=Nicole |last=Scholet |year=2011  |website=The Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society |url=http://the-aha-society.com/index.php/initiatives/exhibitions/87-aha-society-articles/112-seeing-the-federalist }}</ref>\n |image2=Armorial of Hamilton of Grange (1823).jpg\n |alt2=Hamilton of Grange arms, crest, and motto\n |caption2=Arms, crest, and motto\n |footer_background=White\n |footer=Arms of the [[Laird]]s of Grange in Ayrshire, Scotland, including Hamilton's paternal grandfather<ref name=Robertson1889>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=William |year=1889 |title=Historical Tales and Legends of Ayrshire, Vol. II |page=Plate 6 |publisher=Hamilton, Adams & Co. |location=London |oclc=1741572}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton was born and spent part of his childhood in [[Charlestown, Nevis|Charlestown]], the capital of the island of [[Nevis]] in the [[Leeward Islands]] (then part of the [[British West Indies]]).

He also accepted an offer from [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] to become receiver of continental taxes for the State of New York.<ref>Chernow, pp. 165-171</ref> Hamilton was appointed in July 1782 to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] as a New York representative for the term beginning in November 1782.<ref>Syrett, p. III:117; for a one-year term beginning the \"first Monday in November next\", arrived in Philadelphia between the November 18 and 25, and resigned July 1783.</ref> Before his appointment to Congress in 1782, Hamilton was already sharing his criticisms of Congress.  He expressed these criticisms in his letter to James Duane dated September 3, 1780.  In this letter he wrote, \"The fundamental defect is a want of power in Congress...the confederation itself is defective and requires to be altered; it is neither fit for war, nor peace.\"<ref>Hamilton, Alexander. ''Alexander Hamilton: Writings''. Compiled by Joanne B. Freeman. New York: Literary Classics of the United States, Inc., 2001. pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nWhile on Washington's staff, Hamilton had become frustrated with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had made it difficult for the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.<ref>Kohn; Brant, p. 45; Rakove, p. 324.</ref>\n\nAn amendment to the Articles had been proposed by [[Thomas Burke (North Carolina)|Thomas Burke]], in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. [[James Madison]] joined Hamilton in influencing Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the national government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also the ability to make laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.<ref name=chernow176>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n195 p. 176].</ref><ref>Brant, p. 100</ref>\n\n===Congress and the army===\nWhile Hamilton was in Congress, discontented soldiers began to pose a danger to the young United States. Most of the army was then posted at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], New York. Those in the army were funding much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, after [[Valley Forge]], the Continental officers had been promised in May 1778 a [[pension]] of half their pay when they were discharged.<ref>Martin and Lender, pp. 109, 160: at first for seven years, increased to life after Arnold's treason.</ref> By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers.<ref name=Tucker15>Tucker, p. 470.</ref> In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. [[Alexander McDougall]]. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life.

[[Philadelphia Convention#Hamilton's plan|He proposed]] to have an elected President and elected [[United States Senate|Senators]] who would serve for life, contingent upon \"good behavior\" and subject to removal for corruption or abuse; this idea contributed later to the hostile view of Hamilton as a monarchist sympathizer, held by James Madison.<ref name=chernow232>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n251 p. 232].</ref> Ultimately Hamilton wanted to take the idea of self government out of the Constitution, claiming that power should go to the \"rich and well born\". This idea all but isolated Hamilton from his fellow delegates and others who were tempered in the ideas of revolution and liberty.<ref>[[#stewart|Stewart, 2016]], p. 33</ref>\n\nAccording to Madison's notes, Hamilton said in regards to the executive, \"The English model was the only good one on this subject. The hereditary interest of the king was so interwoven with that of the nation, and his personal emoluments so great, that he was placed above the danger of being corrupted from abroad...

This draft had most of the features of the actual Constitution. In this draft, the Senate was to be elected in proportion to the population, being two-fifths the size of the House, and the President and Senators were to be elected through complex multistage elections, in which chosen electors would elect smaller bodies of electors; they would hold office for life, but were removable for misconduct. The President would have an absolute veto. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] was to have immediate jurisdiction over all [[lawsuits]] involving the United States, and state governors were to be appointed by the federal government.<ref>Mitchell, pp. I:397 ff.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Convention, Hamilton was still not content with the final Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast improvement over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also.<ref>Brant, p. 195.</ref> Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|206}} He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, [[James Duane]], [[Robert Le Roy Livingston|Robert Livingston]], and [[Richard Morris (U.S. politician)|Richard Morris]] against the Clintonian faction led by [[Melancton Smith]], Lansing, Yates, and [[Gilbert Livingston (legislator)|Gilbert Livingston]].<ref name=Denboer15>Denboer, p. 196.</ref>\n\nMembers of Hamilton's faction were against any conditional ratification, under the impression that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not happen and a compromise would have to be reached.<ref name=Denboer15/><ref name=Kaplan15>Kaplan, p. 75.</ref> Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from ''The Federalist Papers'', and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric.<ref name=Kaplan15/> The vote in the state convention was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.<ref>Denboer, p. 197.</ref>\n\nIn 1788, Hamilton served a second term in what proved to be the last session of the [[Continental Congress]] under the [[Articles of Confederation]].\n\n===''The Federalist Papers''===\n{{main |The Federalist Papers}}\nHamilton recruited John Jay and James Madison to write a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as ''The Federalist Papers'', and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five). Hamilton supervised the entire project, enlisted the participants, wrote the majority of the essays, and oversaw the publication. During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise. Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most pertinent to him: the executive and judicial branches, with some aspects of the Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation.<ref name=chernow247>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n266 pp. 247\u201348].</ref> The papers first appeared in ''[[The Independent Journal]]'' on October 27, 1787.<ref name=chernow247/>\n\nHamilton wrote the first paper signed as [[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], and all of the subsequent papers were signed under the name.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|210}} Jay wrote the next four papers to elaborate on the confederation's weakness and the need for unity against foreign aggression and against splitting into rival confederacies, and, except for Number 64, was not further involved.<ref name=chernow252-257>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n271 pp. 252\u201357].</ref><ref name=schachner />{{rp|211}} Hamilton's highlights included discussion that although republics have been culpable for disorders in the past, advances in the \"science of politics\" had fostered principles that ensured that those abuses could be prevented, such as the division of powers, legislative checks and balances, an independent judiciary, and legislators that were represented by electors (Numbers 7\u20139).<ref name=chernow252-257/> Hamilton also wrote an extensive defense of the constitution (No. 23\u201336), and discussed the Senate and executive and judicial branches in Numbers 65\u201385. Hamilton and Madison worked to describe the anarchic state of the confederation in numbers 15\u201322, and have been described as not being entirely different in thought during this time period in contrast to their stark opposition later in life.<ref name=chernow252-257/> Subtle differences appeared with the two when discussing the necessity of standing armies.<ref name=chernow252-257/>\n\n===Reconciliation between New York and Vermont===\n\n{{further |Vermont Republic}}\nIn 1764, King George III had ruled in favor of New York in a dispute between New York and New Hampshire over the region that later became the state of [[Vermont]].  New York then refused to recognize claims to property derived from grants by New Hampshire governor [[Benning Wentworth]] during the preceding 15 years when the territory had been governed as a de facto part of New Hampshire.  Consequently, the people of the disputed territory, called the [[New Hampshire Grants]], resisted the enforcement of New York's laws within the Grants. [[Ethan Allen]]'s militia called the [[Green Mountain Boys]], noted for successes in the war against the British in 1775, was originally formed for the purpose of resisting the colonial government of New York.  In 1777, the statesmen of the Grants declared it a [[Vermont Republic|separate state to be called Vermont]], and by early 1778, had erected a state government.\n\nDuring 1777\u20131785, Vermont was repeatedly denied representation in the Continental Congress, largely because New York insisted that Vermont was legally a part of New York.  Vermont took the position that because its petitions for [[admission to the Union]] were denied, it was not a part of the United States, not subject to Congress, and at liberty to negotiate separately with the British.  The latter [[Haldimand negotiations]] led to some exchanges of prisoners of war.  The peace treaty of 1783 that ended the war included Vermont within the boundaries of the United States. On March 2, 1784, Governor George Clinton of New York asked Congress to declare war for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Vermont, but Congress made no decision.\n\nBy 1787, the government of New York had almost entirely given up plans to subjugate Vermont, but still claimed jurisdiction.<ref>Hall, Benjamin Homer, ''History of Eastern Vermont : From Its Earliest Settlement to the Close of the Eighteenth Century'', D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1858. p.&nbsp;553.</ref> As a member of the legislature of New York, Hamilton argued forcefully and at length in favor of a bill to recognize the sovereignty of the State of Vermont, against numerous objections to its constitutionality and policy.  Consideration of the bill was deferred to a later date.  In 1787 through 1789, Hamilton exchanged letters with [[Nathaniel Chipman]], a lawyer representing Vermont. In 1788, the new Constitution of the United States went into effect, with its plan to replace the unicameral Continental Congress with a new Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives.  Hamilton wrote: {{quote|One of the first subjects of deliberation with the new Congress will be the independence of Kentucky [at that time still a part of Virginia], for which the southern states will be anxious.  The northern will be glad to find a counterpoise in Vermont.}} In 1790, the New York legislature decided to give up New York's claim to Vermont if Congress decided to admit Vermont to the Union and if negotiations between New York and Vermont on the boundary between the two states were successfully concluded.  In 1790, negotiators discussed not only boundary, but also financial compensation of New York land-grantees whose grants Vermont refused to recognize because they conflicted with earlier grants from New Hampshire. Compensation in the amount of 30,000 Spanish dollars was agreed to, and Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791.\n\n==Secretary of the Treasury==\n{{main |United States Secretary of the Treasury}}\n{{more |Cabinet of the United States}}\n{{Css Image Crop |Image=HAMILTON, Alexander-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize=320 |cWidth=220 |cHeight=260 |oTop=62 |oLeft=48 |Location=|Description=<div style=\"text-align:center;\">A [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury</div>}}\nPresident George Washington appointed Hamilton as the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] on September 11, 1789. He left office on the last day of January 1795. Much of the structure of the government of the United States was worked out in those five years, beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself. Biographer [[Forrest McDonald]] argues that Hamilton saw his office, like that of the British [[First Lord of the Treasury]], as the equivalent of a Prime Minister. Hamilton oversaw his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington. Washington requested Hamilton's advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].

Among these are the [[First Report on the Public Credit]], [[Tariff of 1790|Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports]], [[Report on a National Bank]], On the Establishment of a Mint, [[Report on Manufactures]], and the Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit.<ref>Hamilton; Hamilton; pp. 1, 54, 106, 149, 192, 465</ref> So, the great enterprise in Hamilton's project of an administrative republic is the establishment of stability.<ref>\"Hamilton's Administrative Republic and the American Presidency\", in ''The Presidency in the Constitutional Order'', edited by Joseph M.

Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.<ref name=chernow121>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n136 p. 121].</ref><ref name=schachner />{{rp|244\u201345}}\n\nIn the report, Hamilton felt that the securities should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable and that the government should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.<ref name=chernow296-299/>\n\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton miniature by Charles Shirreff c1790.jpg |thumb |right |Miniature of Hamilton attributed to [[Charles Shirreff (painter)|Charles Shirreff]], {{circa|1790}}]]\nHamilton divided the debt into national and state, and further divided the national debt into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement on how to handle the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with [[promissory notes]] and [[IOU]]s that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.<ref name=chernow296-299/><ref>Murray, p. 124.</ref>\n\nHamilton felt the money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of attempting to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.<ref name=chernow296-299/>\n\nThe last portion of the report dealt with eliminating the debt by utilizing a [[sinking fund]] that would retire five percent of the debt annually until it was paid off. Due to the bonds being traded well below their face value, the purchases would benefit the government as the securities rose in price.<ref name=chernow300-305>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n319 pp. 300\u201305].</ref>{{rp|300}} When the report was submitted to the House of Representatives, detractors soon began to speak against it. Some of the negative views expressed in the House were that the notion of programs that resembled British practice were wicked, and that the balance of power would be shifted away from the Representatives to the executive branch. [[William Maclay (politician)|William Maclay]] suspected that several congressmen were involved in government securities, seeing Congress in an unholy league with New York speculators.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|302}} Congressman [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]] also spoke against New York, with allegations of speculators attempting to swindle those who had not yet heard about Hamilton's report.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|303}}\n\nThe involvement of those in Hamilton's circle such as Schuyler, [[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]], [[James Duane]], Gouverneur Morris, and [[Rufus King]] as speculators was not favorable to those against the report, either, though Hamilton personally did not own or deal a share in the debt.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|304}}<ref name=schachner />{{rp|250}} Madison eventually spoke against it by February 1790. Although he was not against current holders of government debt to profit, he wanted the windfall to go to the original holders. Madison did not feel that the original holders had lost faith in the government, but sold their securities out of desperation.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|305}} The compromise was seen as egregious to both Hamiltonians and their dissidents such as Maclay, and Madison's vote was defeated 36 votes to 13 on February 22.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|305}}<ref name=schachner />{{rp|255}}\n\nThe fight for the national government to assume state debt was a longer issue, and lasted over four months. During the period, the resources that Hamilton was to apply to the payment of state debts was requested by [[Alexander White (Virginia)|Alexander White]], and was rejected due to Hamilton's not being able to prepare information by March 3, and was even postponed by his own supporters in spite of configuring a report the next day (which consisted of a series of additional duties to meet the interest on the state debts).<ref name=schachner />{{rp|297\u201398}} Duer resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and the vote of assumption was voted down 31 votes to 29 on April 12.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|258\u201359}}\n\nDuring this period, Hamilton bypassed the rising issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in Congress, after [[Quaker]]s petitioned for its abolition, returning to the issue the following year.<ref name=chernow307>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n326 p. 307].</ref>\n\nAnother issue in which Hamilton played a role was the temporary location of the capital from New York City. [[Tench Coxe]] was sent to speak to Maclay to bargain about the capital being temporarily located to Philadelphia, as a single vote in the Senate was needed and five in the House for the bill to pass.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|263}} Thomas Jefferson wrote years afterward that Hamilton had a discussion with him, around this time period, about the capital of the United States being relocated to Virginia by mean of a \"pill\" that \"would be peculiarly bitter to the Southern States, and that some concomitant measure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them\".<ref name=schachner />{{rp|263}} The bill passed in the Senate on July 21 and in the House 34 votes to 28 on July 26, 1790.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|263}}\n\n===Report on a National Bank===\nHamilton's Report on a National Bank was a projection from the first Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779,<ref name=schachner />{{rp|268}} he had gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years.

In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and interest on domestic and foreign debts by means of an increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the excise tax on whiskey (Madison's tariff of the same year was a modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).<ref>Stockwell, p. 357.</ref>\n[[File:Portrait of Alexander Hamilton.png|thumb|Portrait of Alexander Hamilton by Walter Robertson. Circa 1794]]\nIn response of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his ''Report on Public Credit'' when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax on both imported and domestic spirits.<ref name=chernow342-343>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n361 pp. 342\u201343].</ref><ref name=\"Murray141\">Murray, p. 141.</ref> The taxation rate was graduated in proportion to the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor.<ref name=\"Murray141\"/> In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption.<ref name=\"Murray141\"/> He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.<ref name=chernow342-343/>\n\nOpposition initially came from Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted that not even the Pennsylvanian legislators had been able to enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state.<ref name=chernow342-343/> Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant.<ref name=\"Murray40\">Murray, pp. 141\u201342.</ref> Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail.<ref name=chernow342-343/> Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders.<ref name=\"Murray40\"/> As soon as 1791, locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive.<ref name=chernow342-343/> Inspectors were also [[tarred and feathered]], blindfolded, and whipped.

In response to the rebellion, believing compliance with the laws was vital to the establishment of federal authority, Hamilton accompanied to the rebellion's site President Washington, General [[Henry Lee III|Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee]], and more federal troops than were ever assembled in one place during the Revolution. This overwhelming display of force intimidated the leaders of the insurrection, ending the rebellion virtually without bloodshed.<ref>Mitchell, I:308\u201331.</ref>\n\n===Manufacturing and industry===\n{{more |Report on Manufactures}}\n[[File:DSCN2897 hamilton statue.jpg |thumb |A statue of Hamilton by [[Franklin Simmons]], overlooking the [[Great Falls of the Passaic River]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], New Jersey, where Hamilton envisioned using the falls to power new factories]]\n\nHamilton's next report was his ''Report on Manufactures''.

[[Noah Webster]], [[John Fenno]], and [[William Cobbett]] were energetic editors for the Federalists; [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]] and [[Philip Freneau]] were fiery Republican editors. All of their newspapers were characterized by intense personal attacks, major exaggerations, and invented claims. In 1801, Hamilton established a daily newspaper that is still published, the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' (now the ''[[New York Post]]''), and brought in [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]] as its editor.<ref name=Nevins1922>Allan Nevins, ''The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism'' (1922)  [https://archive.org/details/eveningpostacen00nevigoog ch. 1 online]</ref>\n\nThe quarrel between Hamilton and Jefferson is the best known and historically the most important in American political history. Hamilton's and Jefferson's incompatibility was heightened by the unavowed wish of each to be Washington's principal and most trusted advisor.<ref>Cooke, pp. 109\u201310</ref>\n\nAn additional partisan irritant to Hamilton was the 1791 [[United States Senate election in New York, 1791|United States Senate election in New York]], which resulted in the election of Democratic-Republican candidate [[Aaron Burr]], previously the [[New York State Attorney General]], over Senator Philip Schuyler, the Federalist incumbent and Hamilton's father-in-law. Hamilton blamed Burr personally for this outcome, and negative characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter. The two men did work together from time to time thereafter on various projects, including Hamilton's army of 1798 and the [[Manhattan Water Company]].<ref>Lomask, pp. 139\u201340, 216\u201317, 220.</ref>\n\n===Jay Treaty and Britain===\n{{main |Jay Treaty}}\n[[File:Jay's-treaty.jpg |thumb|180px |The Jay Treaty]]\nWhen [[First Coalition|France and Britain went to war]] in early 1793, all four members of the Cabinet were consulted on what to do.

Hamilton was active during the Revolution in trying to raise black troops for the army, with the promise of freedom. In the 1780s and 1790s, he generally opposed pro-slavery southern interests, which he saw as hypocritical to the values of the American Revolution. In 1785, he joined his close associate [[John Jay]] in founding the [[New York Manumission Society|New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting Such of Them as Have Been, or May be Liberated]], the main anti-slavery organization in New York. The society successfully promoted the abolition of the international slave trade in New York City and (shortly after his death) passed a state law to end slavery in New York through a decades-long process of emancipation, with a final end to slavery in the state on July 4, 1827.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\"/>\n\nAt a time when most white leaders doubted the capacity of blacks, Hamilton believed slavery was morally wrong and wrote that \"their natural faculties are as good as ours.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=John Chester |last=Miller |title=Alexander Hamilton and the Growth of the New Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWRbVDAUP2gC&pg=PA41 |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction |pages=41\u201342 |isbn=9781412816755}}</ref> Unlike contemporaries such as Jefferson, who considered the removal of freed slaves (to a western territory, the West Indies, or Africa) to be essential to any plan for emancipation, Hamilton pressed for emancipation with no such provisions.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\">{{cite journal |last1=Horton |first1=James Oliver |title=Alexander Hamilton: slavery and race in a revolutionary generation |journal=New-York Journal of American History |date=2004 |volume=65 |pages=16\u201324 |url=http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/about/Horton%20-%20Hamiltsvery_Race.pdf |accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|22}} Hamilton and other Federalists supported [[Toussaint Louverture]]'s revolution against France in [[Haiti]], which had originated as a slave revolt.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\"/>{{rp|23}} Hamilton's suggestions helped shape the Haitian constitution, and when Haiti became the Western Hemisphere's first independent black nation in 1804, Hamilton urged closer economic and diplomatic ties.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\n===On economics===\nHamilton has been portrayed as the \"patron saint\" of the [[American School (economics)|American School]] of economic philosophy that, according to one historian, dominated economic policy after 1861.<ref>Lind, Michael, ''Hamilton's Republic'', 1997, pp. xiv\u2013xv, 229\u201330.</ref>&nbsp; He firmly supported government intervention in favor of business, after the manner of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], as early as the fall of 1781.<ref name=chernow170>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n189 p. 170].</ref><ref>''Continentalist'' V, published April 1782, but written in fall 1781</ref><ref>Syrett, p. 3:77.</ref>&nbsp; Hamilton opposed the British ideas of [[free trade]], which he believed skewed benefits to colonial and imperial powers, in favor of [[protectionism]], which he believed would help develop the fledgling nation's emerging economy.&nbsp; [[Henry C.

He was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the [[U.S. Constitution]], as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the [[Federalist Party]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the ''[[New York Post]]'' newspaper. As the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]], Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of [[George Washington]]'s administration. He took the lead in the Federal government's funding of the states' debts, as well as establishing a [[First Bank of the United States|national bank]], a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, a national bank and support for manufacturing, and a strong military.\n\nHamilton was born out of wedlock in [[Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis|Charlestown]], [[Nevis]]. He was orphaned as a child and taken in by a prosperous merchant.  When he reached his teens, he was sent to New York to pursue his education.  He took an early role in the militia as the [[American Revolutionary War]] began.  In 1777, he became a senior aide to General Washington in running the new [[Continental Army]].  After the war, he was elected as a representative from New York to the [[Congress of the Confederation]]. He resigned to practice law and founded the [[Bank of New York]] before entering politics. Hamilton was a leader in seeking to replace the weak national government under the [[Articles of Confederation]]; he led the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention of 1786]], which spurred Congress to call a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]]. He helped ratify the Constitution by writing 51 of the 85 installments of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', which are still used as one of the most important references for [[Constitutional interpretation]].\n\nHamilton led the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] as a trusted member of President Washington's first Cabinet. Hamilton successfully argued that the [[implied powers]] of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the [[National debt of the United States|\nnational debt]], to assume states' debts, and to create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a [[tariff]] on imports, and later by a controversial [[whiskey tax]]. He opposed friendly relations with the [[French Revolution|French revolutionaries]]. Hamilton's views became the basis for the Federalist Party, which was opposed to the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. In 1795, he returned to the practice of law in New York. He called for mobilization against the [[French First Republic]] in 1798\u201399 under President [[John Adams]], and became [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General]] of the U.S. Army, which he reconstituted, modernized, and readied for war. The army did not see combat in the [[Quasi-War]], and Hamilton was outraged by Adams' diplomatic approach to the crisis with France. His opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause the Federalist party defeat in [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. Jefferson and [[Aaron Burr]] tied for the presidency in the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences.\n\nHamilton continued his legal and business activities in New York City, and was active in ending the legality of the international slave trade.  Vice President Burr ran for governor of New York State in 1804, and Hamilton campaigned against him as unworthy. Taking offense, Burr challenged him to [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|a duel]] on July 11, 1804, in which Burr shot and mortally wounded Hamilton, who died the following day. Hamilton is generally regarded as an astute and intellectually brilliant politician and financier, if often impetuous. His ideas are credited with laying the foundation for American government and finance.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Childhood in the Caribbean==\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=horizontal\n |total_width=300\n |background color=Wheat\n |header_background=White\n |header=Arms of [[Clan Hamilton|Hamilton]] of [[Kerelaw Castle|Grange]]\n |image1=Arms of Hamilton of Grange.svg\n |alt1=Hamilton of Grange arms\n |caption1=Arms: ''Gules'', a lion rampant, ''argent'', betwixt three cinquefoils, ''ermine''<ref name=aha>{{cite web |title=Rare Artifacts at Columbia's RBML |first=Nicole |last=Scholet |year=2011  |website=The Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society |url=http://the-aha-society.com/index.php/initiatives/exhibitions/87-aha-society-articles/112-seeing-the-federalist }}</ref>\n |image2=Armorial of Hamilton of Grange (1823).jpg\n |alt2=Hamilton of Grange arms, crest, and motto\n |caption2=Arms, crest, and motto\n |footer_background=White\n |footer=Arms of the [[Laird]]s of Grange in Ayrshire, Scotland, including Hamilton's paternal grandfather<ref name=Robertson1889>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=William |year=1889 |title=Historical Tales and Legends of Ayrshire, Vol. II |page=Plate 6 |publisher=Hamilton, Adams & Co. |location=London |oclc=1741572}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton was born and spent part of his childhood in [[Charlestown, Nevis|Charlestown]], the capital of the island of [[Nevis]] in the [[Leeward Islands]] (then part of the [[British West Indies]]).

In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures.

A [[probate]] paper from St. Croix in 1768, drafted after the death of Hamilton's mother, listed him as 13 years old, which has caused some historians since the 1930s to favor a birth year of 1755.<ref name=chernow17>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/17 p. 17].</ref>\n\n[[File:The Museum of Nevis History - Alexander Hamilton birthplace.jpg |thumb |left |alt=The Museum of Nevis History, Charlestown |The [[Alexander Hamilton Museum|Hamilton House]], Charlestown, Nevis.

Hugh Knox, a minister and journalist, published the letter in the ''Royal Danish-American Gazette.''

He also accepted an offer from [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] to become receiver of continental taxes for the State of New York.<ref>Chernow, pp. 165-171</ref> Hamilton was appointed in July 1782 to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] as a New York representative for the term beginning in November 1782.<ref>Syrett, p. III:117; for a one-year term beginning the \"first Monday in November next\", arrived in Philadelphia between the November 18 and 25, and resigned July 1783.</ref> Before his appointment to Congress in 1782, Hamilton was already sharing his criticisms of Congress.  He expressed these criticisms in his letter to James Duane dated September 3, 1780.  In this letter he wrote, \"The fundamental defect is a want of power in Congress...the confederation itself is defective and requires to be altered; it is neither fit for war, nor peace.\"<ref>Hamilton, Alexander. ''Alexander Hamilton: Writings''. Compiled by Joanne B. Freeman. New York: Literary Classics of the United States, Inc., 2001. pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nWhile on Washington's staff, Hamilton had become frustrated with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had made it difficult for the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.<ref>Kohn; Brant, p. 45; Rakove, p. 324.</ref>\n\nAn amendment to the Articles had been proposed by [[Thomas Burke (North Carolina)|Thomas Burke]], in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. [[James Madison]] joined Hamilton in influencing Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the national government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also the ability to make laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.<ref name=chernow176>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n195 p. 176].</ref><ref>Brant, p. 100</ref>\n\n===Congress and the army===\nWhile Hamilton was in Congress, discontented soldiers began to pose a danger to the young United States. Most of the army was then posted at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], New York. Those in the army were funding much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, after [[Valley Forge]], the Continental officers had been promised in May 1778 a [[pension]] of half their pay when they were discharged.<ref>Martin and Lender, pp. 109, 160: at first for seven years, increased to life after Arnold's treason.</ref> By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers.<ref name=Tucker15>Tucker, p. 470.</ref> In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. [[Alexander McDougall]]. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.<ref name=Tucker15/>\n\nSeveral Congressmen, including Hamilton, [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[Gouverneur Morris]] (no relation), attempted to use this [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an [[Tax#Tariff|impost]] be established dedicated to the sole purpose of paying that debt.<ref name=ellis141>Kohn; Ellis 2004, pp. 141\u201344.</ref>\n\nHamilton suggested using the Army's claims to prevail upon the states for the proposed national funding system.<ref>Kohn, p. 196.</ref> The Morrises and Hamilton contacted Knox to suggest he and the officers defy civil authority, at least by not disbanding if the army were not satisfied.

[[Philadelphia Convention#Hamilton's plan|He proposed]] to have an elected President and elected [[United States Senate|Senators]] who would serve for life, contingent upon \"good behavior\" and subject to removal for corruption or abuse; this idea contributed later to the hostile view of Hamilton as a monarchist sympathizer, held by James Madison.<ref name=chernow232>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n251 p. 232].</ref> Ultimately Hamilton wanted to take the idea of self government out of the Constitution, claiming that power should go to the \"rich and well born\". This idea all but isolated Hamilton from his fellow delegates and others who were tempered in the ideas of revolution and liberty.<ref>[[#stewart|Stewart, 2016]], p. 33</ref>\n\nAccording to Madison's notes, Hamilton said in regards to the executive, \"The English model was the only good one on this subject. The hereditary interest of the king was so interwoven with that of the nation, and his personal emoluments so great, that he was placed above the danger of being corrupted from abroad...

It may be said this constitutes as an elective monarchy... But by making the executive subject to impeachment, the term 'monarchy' cannot apply...\"<ref name=LarsonWinship2005/> During the convention, Hamilton constructed a draft for the Constitution based on the convention debates, but he never presented it. This draft had most of the features of the actual Constitution. In this draft, the Senate was to be elected in proportion to the population, being two-fifths the size of the House, and the President and Senators were to be elected through complex multistage elections, in which chosen electors would elect smaller bodies of electors; they would hold office for life, but were removable for misconduct. The President would have an absolute veto. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] was to have immediate jurisdiction over all [[lawsuits]] involving the United States, and state governors were to be appointed by the federal government.<ref>Mitchell, pp. I:397 ff.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Convention, Hamilton was still not content with the final Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast improvement over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also.<ref>Brant, p. 195.</ref> Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|206}} He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, [[James Duane]], [[Robert Le Roy Livingston|Robert Livingston]], and [[Richard Morris (U.S. politician)|Richard Morris]] against the Clintonian faction led by [[Melancton Smith]], Lansing, Yates, and [[Gilbert Livingston (legislator)|Gilbert Livingston]].<ref name=Denboer15>Denboer, p. 196.</ref>\n\nMembers of Hamilton's faction were against any conditional ratification, under the impression that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not happen and a compromise would have to be reached.<ref name=Denboer15/><ref name=Kaplan15>Kaplan, p. 75.</ref> Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from ''The Federalist Papers'', and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric.<ref name=Kaplan15/> The vote in the state convention was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.<ref>Denboer, p. 197.</ref>\n\nIn 1788, Hamilton served a second term in what proved to be the last session of the [[Continental Congress]] under the [[Articles of Confederation]].\n\n===''The Federalist Papers''===\n{{main |The Federalist Papers}}\nHamilton recruited John Jay and James Madison to write a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as ''The Federalist Papers'', and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five). Hamilton supervised the entire project, enlisted the participants, wrote the majority of the essays, and oversaw the publication. During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise. Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most pertinent to him: the executive and judicial branches, with some aspects of the Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation.<ref name=chernow247>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n266 pp. 247\u201348].</ref> The papers first appeared in ''[[The Independent Journal]]'' on October 27, 1787.<ref name=chernow247/>\n\nHamilton wrote the first paper signed as [[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], and all of the subsequent papers were signed under the name.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|210}} Jay wrote the next four papers to elaborate on the confederation's weakness and the need for unity against foreign aggression and against splitting into rival confederacies, and, except for Number 64, was not further involved.<ref name=chernow252-257>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n271 pp. 252\u201357].</ref><ref name=schachner />{{rp|211}} Hamilton's highlights included discussion that although republics have been culpable for disorders in the past, advances in the \"science of politics\" had fostered principles that ensured that those abuses could be prevented, such as the division of powers, legislative checks and balances, an independent judiciary, and legislators that were represented by electors (Numbers 7\u20139).<ref name=chernow252-257/> Hamilton also wrote an extensive defense of the constitution (No. 23\u201336), and discussed the Senate and executive and judicial branches in Numbers 65\u201385. Hamilton and Madison worked to describe the anarchic state of the confederation in numbers 15\u201322, and have been described as not being entirely different in thought during this time period in contrast to their stark opposition later in life.<ref name=chernow252-257/> Subtle differences appeared with the two when discussing the necessity of standing armies.<ref name=chernow252-257/>\n\n===Reconciliation between New York and Vermont===\n\n{{further |Vermont Republic}}\nIn 1764, King George III had ruled in favor of New York in a dispute between New York and New Hampshire over the region that later became the state of [[Vermont]].  New York then refused to recognize claims to property derived from grants by New Hampshire governor [[Benning Wentworth]] during the preceding 15 years when the territory had been governed as a de facto part of New Hampshire.  Consequently, the people of the disputed territory, called the [[New Hampshire Grants]], resisted the enforcement of New York's laws within the Grants. [[Ethan Allen]]'s militia called the [[Green Mountain Boys]], noted for successes in the war against the British in 1775, was originally formed for the purpose of resisting the colonial government of New York.  In 1777, the statesmen of the Grants declared it a [[Vermont Republic|separate state to be called Vermont]], and by early 1778, had erected a state government.\n\nDuring 1777\u20131785, Vermont was repeatedly denied representation in the Continental Congress, largely because New York insisted that Vermont was legally a part of New York.  Vermont took the position that because its petitions for [[admission to the Union]] were denied, it was not a part of the United States, not subject to Congress, and at liberty to negotiate separately with the British.  The latter [[Haldimand negotiations]] led to some exchanges of prisoners of war.  The peace treaty of 1783 that ended the war included Vermont within the boundaries of the United States. On March 2, 1784, Governor George Clinton of New York asked Congress to declare war for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Vermont, but Congress made no decision.\n\nBy 1787, the government of New York had almost entirely given up plans to subjugate Vermont, but still claimed jurisdiction.<ref>Hall, Benjamin Homer, ''History of Eastern Vermont : From Its Earliest Settlement to the Close of the Eighteenth Century'', D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1858. p.&nbsp;553.</ref> As a member of the legislature of New York, Hamilton argued forcefully and at length in favor of a bill to recognize the sovereignty of the State of Vermont, against numerous objections to its constitutionality and policy.  Consideration of the bill was deferred to a later date.  In 1787 through 1789, Hamilton exchanged letters with [[Nathaniel Chipman]], a lawyer representing Vermont. In 1788, the new Constitution of the United States went into effect, with its plan to replace the unicameral Continental Congress with a new Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives.  Hamilton wrote: {{quote|One of the first subjects of deliberation with the new Congress will be the independence of Kentucky [at that time still a part of Virginia], for which the southern states will be anxious.  The northern will be glad to find a counterpoise in Vermont.}} In 1790, the New York legislature decided to give up New York's claim to Vermont if Congress decided to admit Vermont to the Union and if negotiations between New York and Vermont on the boundary between the two states were successfully concluded.  In 1790, negotiators discussed not only boundary, but also financial compensation of New York land-grantees whose grants Vermont refused to recognize because they conflicted with earlier grants from New Hampshire. Compensation in the amount of 30,000 Spanish dollars was agreed to, and Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791.\n\n==Secretary of the Treasury==\n{{main |United States Secretary of the Treasury}}\n{{more |Cabinet of the United States}}\n{{Css Image Crop |Image=HAMILTON, Alexander-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize=320 |cWidth=220 |cHeight=260 |oTop=62 |oLeft=48 |Location=|Description=<div style=\"text-align:center;\">A [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury</div>}}\nPresident George Washington appointed Hamilton as the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] on September 11, 1789. He left office on the last day of January 1795. Much of the structure of the government of the United States was worked out in those five years, beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself. Biographer [[Forrest McDonald]] argues that Hamilton saw his office, like that of the British [[First Lord of the Treasury]], as the equivalent of a Prime Minister. Hamilton oversaw his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington. Washington requested Hamilton's advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]. In 1791, while Secretary, Hamilton was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter H |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref> Hamilton submitted various financial reports to Congress. Among these are the [[First Report on the Public Credit]], [[Tariff of 1790|Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports]], [[Report on a National Bank]], On the Establishment of a Mint, [[Report on Manufactures]], and the Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit.<ref>Hamilton; Hamilton; pp. 1, 54, 106, 149, 192, 465</ref> So, the great enterprise in Hamilton's project of an administrative republic is the establishment of stability.<ref>\"Hamilton's Administrative Republic and the American Presidency\", in ''The Presidency in the Constitutional Order'', edited by Joseph M. Bessette and [[Jeffrey K. Tulis]] (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1981), p. 93</ref>\n\n===Report on Public Credit===\n{{main |First Report on the Public Credit}}\nBefore the adjournment of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make a report on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790.<ref name=Murray121>Murray, p. 121.</ref> Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781, that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence.<ref name=Murray121/> The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as [[Jacques Necker]] and [[Montesquieu]] to British writers such as [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], and [[Malachy Postlethwayt]].<ref name=chernow296-299>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n315 pp. 296\u201399].</ref> While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as [[John Witherspoon]] and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.<ref name=chernow121>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n136 p. 121].</ref><ref name=schachner />{{rp|244\u201345}}\n\nIn the report, Hamilton felt that the securities should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable and that the government should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.<ref name=chernow296-299/>\n\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton miniature by Charles Shirreff c1790.jpg |thumb |right |Miniature of Hamilton attributed to [[Charles Shirreff (painter)|Charles Shirreff]], {{circa|1790}}]]\nHamilton divided the debt into national and state, and further divided the national debt into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement on how to handle the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with [[promissory notes]] and [[IOU]]s that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.<ref name=chernow296-299/><ref>Murray, p. 124.</ref>\n\nHamilton felt the money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of attempting to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.<ref name=chernow296-299/>\n\nThe last portion of the report dealt with eliminating the debt by utilizing a [[sinking fund]] that would retire five percent of the debt annually until it was paid off. Due to the bonds being traded well below their face value, the purchases would benefit the government as the securities rose in price.<ref name=chernow300-305>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n319 pp. 300\u201305].</ref>{{rp|300}} When the report was submitted to the House of Representatives, detractors soon began to speak against it. Some of the negative views expressed in the House were that the notion of programs that resembled British practice were wicked, and that the balance of power would be shifted away from the Representatives to the executive branch. [[William Maclay (politician)|William Maclay]] suspected that several congressmen were involved in government securities, seeing Congress in an unholy league with New York speculators.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|302}} Congressman [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]] also spoke against New York, with allegations of speculators attempting to swindle those who had not yet heard about Hamilton's report.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|303}}\n\nThe involvement of those in Hamilton's circle such as Schuyler, [[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]], [[James Duane]], Gouverneur Morris, and [[Rufus King]] as speculators was not favorable to those against the report, either, though Hamilton personally did not own or deal a share in the debt.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|304}}<ref name=schachner />{{rp|250}} Madison eventually spoke against it by February 1790. Although he was not against current holders of government debt to profit, he wanted the windfall to go to the original holders. Madison did not feel that the original holders had lost faith in the government, but sold their securities out of desperation.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|305}} The compromise was seen as egregious to both Hamiltonians and their dissidents such as Maclay, and Madison's vote was defeated 36 votes to 13 on February 22.<ref name=chernow300-305/>{{rp|305}}<ref name=schachner />{{rp|255}}\n\nThe fight for the national government to assume state debt was a longer issue, and lasted over four months. During the period, the resources that Hamilton was to apply to the payment of state debts was requested by [[Alexander White (Virginia)|Alexander White]], and was rejected due to Hamilton's not being able to prepare information by March 3, and was even postponed by his own supporters in spite of configuring a report the next day (which consisted of a series of additional duties to meet the interest on the state debts).<ref name=schachner />{{rp|297\u201398}} Duer resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and the vote of assumption was voted down 31 votes to 29 on April 12.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|258\u201359}}\n\nDuring this period, Hamilton bypassed the rising issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in Congress, after [[Quaker]]s petitioned for its abolition, returning to the issue the following year.<ref name=chernow307>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n326 p. 307].</ref>\n\nAnother issue in which Hamilton played a role was the temporary location of the capital from New York City. [[Tench Coxe]] was sent to speak to Maclay to bargain about the capital being temporarily located to Philadelphia, as a single vote in the Senate was needed and five in the House for the bill to pass.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|263}} Thomas Jefferson wrote years afterward that Hamilton had a discussion with him, around this time period, about the capital of the United States being relocated to Virginia by mean of a \"pill\" that \"would be peculiarly bitter to the Southern States, and that some concomitant measure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them\".<ref name=schachner />{{rp|263}} The bill passed in the Senate on July 21 and in the House 34 votes to 28 on July 26, 1790.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|263}}\n\n===Report on a National Bank===\nHamilton's Report on a National Bank was a projection from the first Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779,<ref name=schachner />{{rp|268}} he had gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith,<ref>Kaplan, p. 21.</ref> extensive studies on the [[Bank of England]], the blunders of the [[Bank of North America]] and his experience in establishing the Bank of New York.<ref name=Cooke82/> He also used American records from [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his Assistant Treasury Secretary Tench Coxe.<ref name=Cooke82/> He thought that this plan for a National Bank could help in any sort of financial crisis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sylla|first=Richard|last2=Wright|first2=Robert E|last3=Cowen|first3=David J|date=2009|title=Alexander Hamilton, Central Banker: Crisis Management during the U.S. Financial Panic of 1792|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0007680500000209|journal=Business History Review|volume=83|issue=1|pages=61\u201386|doi=10.1017/s0007680500000209|issn=0007-6805}}</ref>\n\nHamilton suggested that Congress should charter the [[First Bank of the United States|National Bank]] with a capitalization of $10&nbsp;million, one-fifth of which would be handled by the Government.

It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank,<ref>Cooke, p. 90.</ref> and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not benefit from it.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|270}} Among those critics was [[James Jackson (Georgia politician)|James Jackson]] of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from ''The Federalist Papers''.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|270}} Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill. The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.<ref name=McDonald />{{rp|199\u2013200}}The Whiskey Rebellion also showed about how in other financial plans, there was a distance between the classes as the wealthy profited from the taxes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bogin|first=Ruth|date=July 1988|title=Petitioning and the New Moral Economy of Post-Revolutionary America|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1923642|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=45|issue=3|pages=391|doi=10.2307/1923642|issn=0043-5597}}</ref>\n\nMadison warned the Pennsylvania congress members that he would attack the bill as unconstitutional in the House, and followed up on his threat.<ref name=McDonald />{{rp|200}} Madison argued his case of where the power of a bank could be established within the Constitution, but he failed to sway members of the House, and his authority on the constitution was questioned by a few members.<ref name=McDonald />{{rp|200\u201301}} The bill eventually passed in an overwhelming fashion 39 to 20, on February 8, 1791.<ref name=schachner />{{rp|271}}\n\nWashington hesitated to sign the bill, as he received suggestions from Attorney-General [[Edmund Randolph]] and Thomas Jefferson.

In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and interest on domestic and foreign debts by means of an increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the excise tax on whiskey (Madison's tariff of the same year was a modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).<ref>Stockwell, p. 357.</ref>\n[[File:Portrait of Alexander Hamilton.png|thumb|Portrait of Alexander Hamilton by Walter Robertson. Circa 1794]]\nIn response of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his ''Report on Public Credit'' when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax on both imported and domestic spirits.<ref name=chernow342-343>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n361 pp. 342\u201343].</ref><ref name=\"Murray141\">Murray, p. 141.</ref> The taxation rate was graduated in proportion to the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor.<ref name=\"Murray141\"/> In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption.<ref name=\"Murray141\"/> He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.<ref name=chernow342-343/>\n\nOpposition initially came from Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted that not even the Pennsylvanian legislators had been able to enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state.<ref name=chernow342-343/> Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant.<ref name=\"Murray40\">Murray, pp. 141\u201342.</ref> Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail.<ref name=chernow342-343/> Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders.<ref name=\"Murray40\"/> As soon as 1791, locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive.<ref name=chernow342-343/> Inspectors were also [[tarred and feathered]], blindfolded, and whipped.

In response to the rebellion, believing compliance with the laws was vital to the establishment of federal authority, Hamilton accompanied to the rebellion's site President Washington, General [[Henry Lee III|Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee]], and more federal troops than were ever assembled in one place during the Revolution.

On July 4, 1792, the society directors met [[Philip Schuyler]] at [[Abraham Godwin]]'s hotel on the [[Passaic River]], where they would lead a tour prospecting the area for the national manufactory.

They favored strong state governments based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national government supported by a national army and navy.

They built their own national coalition to oppose the Federalists. Both sides gained the support of local political factions, and each side developed its own partisan newspapers. [[Noah Webster]], [[John Fenno]], and [[William Cobbett]] were energetic editors for the Federalists; [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]] and [[Philip Freneau]] were fiery Republican editors. All of their newspapers were characterized by intense personal attacks, major exaggerations, and invented claims. In 1801, Hamilton established a daily newspaper that is still published, the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' (now the ''[[New York Post]]''), and brought in [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]] as its editor.<ref name=Nevins1922>Allan Nevins, ''The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism'' (1922)  [https://archive.org/details/eveningpostacen00nevigoog ch. 1 online]</ref>\n\nThe quarrel between Hamilton and Jefferson is the best known and historically the most important in American political history. Hamilton's and Jefferson's incompatibility was heightened by the unavowed wish of each to be Washington's principal and most trusted advisor.<ref>Cooke, pp. 109\u201310</ref>\n\nAn additional partisan irritant to Hamilton was the 1791 [[United States Senate election in New York, 1791|United States Senate election in New York]], which resulted in the election of Democratic-Republican candidate [[Aaron Burr]], previously the [[New York State Attorney General]], over Senator Philip Schuyler, the Federalist incumbent and Hamilton's father-in-law. Hamilton blamed Burr personally for this outcome, and negative characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter. The two men did work together from time to time thereafter on various projects, including Hamilton's army of 1798 and the [[Manhattan Water Company]].<ref>Lomask, pp. 139\u201340, 216\u201317, 220.</ref>\n\n===Jay Treaty and Britain===\n{{main |Jay Treaty}}\n[[File:Jay's-treaty.jpg |thumb|180px |The Jay Treaty]]\nWhen [[First Coalition|France and Britain went to war]] in early 1793, all four members of the Cabinet were consulted on what to do.

It kept that decision secret, but Hamilton revealed it in private to George Hammond, the British Minister to the United States, without telling Jay or anyone else. His act remained unknown until Hammond's dispatches were read in the 1920s.

Hamilton influenced Washington in the composition of his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington contemplated retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft that was used in a similar manner to Hamilton's.<ref>Garrity and Spalding, pp. 47, 50\u201355.</ref><ref>Murray, p. 207.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1796 United States presidential election|election of 1796]], under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential [[Electoral College (United States)|electors]] had two votes, which they were to cast for different men.

This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, as they had been thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, then Vice President, and all but a few for [[Thomas Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]].<ref name=chernow117/>\n\nAdams resented Hamilton's influence with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous in his private life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President.<ref name=chernow510>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n545 p. 510].</ref> Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with [[Edward Rutledge]] to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, but it did not work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but ''not'' for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick; ''Age of Federalism'', pp. 523\u201328, 859.

Hamilton was active during the Revolution in trying to raise black troops for the army, with the promise of freedom. In the 1780s and 1790s, he generally opposed pro-slavery southern interests, which he saw as hypocritical to the values of the American Revolution. In 1785, he joined his close associate [[John Jay]] in founding the [[New York Manumission Society|New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting Such of Them as Have Been, or May be Liberated]], the main anti-slavery organization in New York. The society successfully promoted the abolition of the international slave trade in New York City and (shortly after his death) passed a state law to end slavery in New York through a decades-long process of emancipation, with a final end to slavery in the state on July 4, 1827.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\"/>\n\nAt a time when most white leaders doubted the capacity of blacks, Hamilton believed slavery was morally wrong and wrote that \"their natural faculties are as good as ours.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=John Chester |last=Miller |title=Alexander Hamilton and the Growth of the New Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWRbVDAUP2gC&pg=PA41 |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction |pages=41\u201342 |isbn=9781412816755}}</ref> Unlike contemporaries such as Jefferson, who considered the removal of freed slaves (to a western territory, the West Indies, or Africa) to be essential to any plan for emancipation, Hamilton pressed for emancipation with no such provisions.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\">{{cite journal |last1=Horton |first1=James Oliver |title=Alexander Hamilton: slavery and race in a revolutionary generation |journal=New-York Journal of American History |date=2004 |volume=65 |pages=16\u201324 |url=http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/about/Horton%20-%20Hamiltsvery_Race.pdf |accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|22}} Hamilton and other Federalists supported [[Toussaint Louverture]]'s revolution against France in [[Haiti]], which had originated as a slave revolt.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\"/>{{rp|23}} Hamilton's suggestions helped shape the Haitian constitution, and when Haiti became the Western Hemisphere's first independent black nation in 1804, Hamilton urged closer economic and diplomatic ties.<ref name=\"New-York Journal\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\n===On economics===\nHamilton has been portrayed as the \"patron saint\" of the [[American School (economics)|American School]] of economic philosophy that, according to one historian, dominated economic policy after 1861.<ref>Lind, Michael, ''Hamilton's Republic'', 1997, pp. xiv\u2013xv, 229\u201330.</ref>&nbsp; He firmly supported government intervention in favor of business, after the manner of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], as early as the fall of 1781.<ref name=chernow170>Chernow, [https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/n189 p. 170].</ref><ref>''Continentalist'' V, published April 1782, but written in fall 1781</ref><ref>Syrett, p. 3:77.</ref>&nbsp; Hamilton opposed the British ideas of [[free trade]], which he believed skewed benefits to colonial and imperial powers, in favor of [[protectionism]], which he believed would help develop the fledgling nation's emerging economy.&nbsp; [[Henry C.
