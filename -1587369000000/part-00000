It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C.

Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N.

To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J.

concerns any involvement of the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic [[fraternal and service organizations|fraternal service organization]], to try to influence public and government policy.\n\nDuring the 20th century and especially the [[Cold War]], the order had a history of anti-anarchist, anti-socialist and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] crusades.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=364\u2013365}} It also established the Commission on Religious Prejudices and the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission to combat racism.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}} It was supportive of [[trade unionism]] and published the works of men including [[George Ernest Schuster|George Schuster]], [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]], [[Allan Nevins]], and [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus. Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], and further state, \"It is even more absurd for senators to imply that a judge, who cannot propose or enact legislation, would be incapable of setting aside his religious beliefs when interpreting our written laws. ...If sitting lawmakers are allowed to make such assumptions of Catholic nominees, religious minorities could very well be next.\"<ref name=Rocklin/>\n==History==\n===War and peace issues===\n====World War I====\n[[File:See him through--Help us to help the boys.jpg|thumb|A Knights of Columbus poster from WWI]]\n\nOn April 14, 1917, soon after the United States entered [[World War I]], the board of directors passed a resolution calling \"for the active cooperation and patriotic zeal of 400,000 members of the order in this country to our Republic and its law, pledge their continued and unconditional support to the President and Congress of the Nation, in their determination to protect its honor and its ideals of humanity and right.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=2}}\n\nThe order also instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million to provide for the welfare of the troops fighting in Europe.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million to support the effort.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Canadian knights took up the cause earlier, reflecting their earlier entry into the conflict.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}} It was said it was their \"finest hour\" as Catholics and as Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\nIn 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights and other organizations undertook another effort to raise funds to support the welfare of the troops both in the United States and overseas, which, along with the contribution of the National Catholic War Council, totaled $30 million.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}\n\nStaff and chaplains were sent to all Army camps and [[cantonment]]<nowiki/>s.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The order's motto for this effort was \"Everyone welcome, everything free.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}{{sfn|Scott|1919|pp=407\u2013408}} The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The remaining $19 million was used to establish educational programs for returning servicemen.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}\n\nAccording to Supreme Knight Flaherty, \"The war provided us with an opportunity to put ourselves before the public in a most favorable light.\"{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=23}} In Canada, it was an opportunity for Knights to show that in addition to being Catholic, they were also loyal Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\n===Cristero War===\nFollowing the [[Mexican Revolution]], the new government began persecuting the church. To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J. Brandon]] sent a telegram to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and Secretary of State [[Frank B. Kellogg]] opposing the deportation of a Mexican archbishop.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} That same year, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico.\n\nThe order subsequently smuggled into Mexico pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the anticlerical Mexican government and its policies,<ref name=\"legacy\" /> provoking efforts at the border to stop the flow.{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=108\u2013109}}<ref name=\"king\" /> Twenty-five [[Saints of the Cristero War|martyrs from the conflict]] would eventually be canonized, including six Knights.<ref name=\"martyr\" />{{sfn|Meyer|1976}}\n\nSupreme Treasurer Daniel J. Callahan persuaded Senator [[William E. Borah]] to launch an investigation in 1935 into human rights violations in Mexico.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=301\u2013302}} Pope [[Pius XI]] in his encyclical ''[[Iniquis afflictisque]]'' praised for the Knights efforts.<ref name=\"columbia\" />\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Church in America supported General [[Francisco Franco]] and the other rebels.{{sfn|Crosby|p=95|1971}} The Knights, and other Catholic groups, fell into the same stance.{{sfn|Crosby|p=95|1971}} When a group of American intellectuals formed the Board of Guardians for Basque Refugee Children and proposed shipping children from Spain to the United States, the Knights and other Catholic groups opposed the plan.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}} It would be better, they said in telegrams to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and other government officials, to send the children to live with Basque families who had fled to France so that the children could speak their own language and practice their own religion.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}} If the children did come to the United States, the Knights and the [[Catholic Order of Foresters]] said they would try to place the children in Catholic homes.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}}\n\nThe Knights supported the embargo on all arms into Spain.<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" /> To remove it, they said, would be to aid a \"vicious and despotic government\" who had forced their own citizens to flee to escape \"annihilation or slavery.\"<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" /> They also opposed the screening of documentaries that were used to recruit volunteers and raise funds for the loyalists.{{sfn|Rob\u00e9|2010|p=83}} The Knights believed these films were pro-Marxist and anti-Catholic, and as a result wrote to [[Will H. Hays]], chairman of the [[Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America]], demanding that these films be preceded with a note identifying them as propaganda.{{sfn|Rob\u00e9|2010|p=97}}\n\n===World War II===\nShortly after entering the [[Second World War]], the order established a War Activities Committee to keep track of all activities undertaken during the war.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=349}} They also, in January 1943, established a Peace Program Committee to develop a \"program for shaping and educating public opinion to the end that Catholic principles and Catholic philosophy will be properly represented at the peace table at the conclusion of the present war.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=349\u2013350}} The committee conferred with scholars, theologians, philosophers, and sociologists and proposed a program adopted at the 1943 Supreme Convention.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=350}}<ref name=\"peace\" />\n\n===Middle East===\n{{See also|Charitable activities of the Knights of Columbus#Persecuted Christians}}\nDuring the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian]] and [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|Iraqi Civil Wars]], the Knights lobbied Congress to provide humanitarian relief to the victims of genocide perpetrated by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].<ref name=\"isis\" /><ref name=\"lobby17\" /><ref name=\"continues\" /> In 2017, they praised the decision of the US government to provide direct US aid to persecuted Christians in the Middle East who were suffering at the hands of the Islamic State.<ref name=\"praises\" /> They also led the effort to get the Secretary [[John Kerry]] and the [[United States Department of State]] to declare the atrocities a genocide.<ref name=\"aid\" /><ref name=\"continues\" />\n\nThey also worked with Democratic Congresswoman [[Anna Eshoo]] and Republican Congressman [[Jeff Fortenberry]] to get the United States Congress to unanimously declare that Christians in the region were victims of a genocide.<ref name=\"continues\" /> The Knights alerted the [[White House]] when an ancient Christian town in Iraq was threatened by the ongoing civil war, and worked with them to deescalate the conflict and save the town and its residents.<ref name=\"continues\" /> At the end of 2017, the Knights and the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] recognized a \"Week of Awareness\" for persecuted Christians.<ref name=\"praises\" />\n\nTestimony provided by [[Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus|Supreme Knight]] [[Carl A.

Truman supported the Crusade for the Preservation and Promotion of American Ideals]]\nIn 1914, the order paid the salaries of David Goldstein, who was born Jewish but converted to Catholicism after reading the pro-labor papal encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', and Peter W. Collins, the general secretary of the [[Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]], to lecture around North America.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=178}}<ref name=\"columbia\" /> The pair traveled more than 27,000 miles.<ref name=\"columbia\" /> Local councils were instructed to open up the lectures to the public free of charge.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=178}} More than 2,000,000 people attended the lectures, and more than 800,000 questions were answered.<ref name=\"radical\" />\n\nIn 1946, in his first address to the Supreme Convention as Supreme Knight, Swift proposed a new program eventually called The Knights of Columbus Crusade for the Preservation and Promotion of American Ideals.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=360\u2013361}}<ref name=\"columbia\" /> It was similar to the 1943 Peace Program, except it highlighted Catholic philosophy and [[Catholic social teaching]] regarding the [[Working class|working man]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=360\u2013361}} This was one part of a larger Catholic [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] effort.{{sfn|Kazin|1995|p=174}}\n\nThe crusade listed the workingman's rights as including the right \"to a job, to a family living wage, to collective bargaining and to strike, to ''Joint-Management,'' enroute to Joint Ownership of Industry.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=361}} Until joint ownership happened, workers were also entitled to all forms of social security, including unemployment, disability, and old-age insurance, according to the crusade.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=361}} The crusade's plan also listed 10 \"Abuses of Unrestrained Capitalism.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=361\u2013362}}\n\nThe crusade officially launched in December 1946 and was endorsed by President [[Harry Truman]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=362\u2013363}} By August 1948 over 1,300 local councils had established discussion groups based on the topics. As part of the crusade, several hundred radio stations played segments produced by the order on the evils of communism and the harshness of life in Russia.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=363}} It also took out advertisements in newspapers and distributed copies of [[Fulton Sheen]]'s ''Communism and the Conscience of the West''.{{sfn|Ceplair|2011|p=114}}\n\n===Social justice and anti-communism===\nIn the early 1920s, Supreme Knight [[James A. Flaherty|James Flaherty]] gave speeches in which he \"lashed out at the social irresponsibility of the moneyed classes.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}} During the [[Great Depression]], when President [[Herbert Hoover]] established a Commission on Employment, Supreme Knight [[Martin Carmody]] wrote to him pledging the services of the Knights.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}} Carmody had already encouraged the 2,600 councils to have \"strong and active employment committees.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}} By the end of July 1931, a total of 43,128 unemployed people had been placed into jobs, in addition to those placements made by local councils who were working under the auspices of other organizations.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}} In less than two years, the order would provide more than 100,000 jobs.<ref name=\"columbia\" /> In October of that year, Hoover appointed Carmody to the [[President's Organization for Unemployment Relief]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=321}}\n\nThe order launched a Crusade for Social Justice in 1938 as an outgrowth of their anti-communist efforts.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=336}} It was declared that \"the public must be aroused to realize that only by the application of Christian principles, in private and public affairs, will there be eliminated, so far as humanly possible, the distress and suffering upon which these forces thrive.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=336}} Among the [[social justice]] issues the Supreme Council recommended local councils take on were a [[living wage]], [[credit union]]s, and the cooperative and social responsibilities of employers, bankers, and property owners.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=336}} The Supreme Council also supplied local councils with a great deal of material to encourage members to study the [[Catholic social teaching#Encyclicals and other official documents|social encyclicals]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=336}}\n\nOne of the first actions new Supreme Knight [[John E. Swift]] took in 1945 was to take out five full page newspaper advertisements warning of the dangers of communism.<ref name=\"columbia\" /> In the early 1950s, the Supreme Convention adopted several anti-communist resolutions.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=364\u2013365}} However, ''Columbia'' magazine also published thinly veiled critiques of [[McCarthyism]] and the techniques of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=365}}\n\nIn 1965, the order co-sponsored a conference on human rights with the [[Archdiocese of Hartford]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=\"columbia\" /> In collaboration with the [[John LaFarge Jr.|John LaFarge Institute]], the Knights worked on programs to promote social justice and ecumenical outreach in the 1960s.<ref name=\"columbia\" /> At the end of the decade, in 1969, the Knights donated $75,000 to the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|US Conference of Catholic Bishops]]' Task Force on Urban Problems.<ref name=\"columbia\" />\n\n==Anti-discrimination efforts==\nDuring the [[nadir of American race relations]] in the 1920s, the state councils established lobbyists in state capitals and in [[Washington, D.C.]] to protect the rights of Catholics.{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=37}} They also engaged, along with other Catholic groups of the period, in letter writing campaigns to protect Catholic interests.{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=37}}\n\n===Religious and racial discrimination===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the order established a series of \"huts\" to offer rest and recreational facilities for Allied servicemen under the banner of \"Everyone Welcome, Everything Free.\" Civil rights activist and author [[Emmett Jay Scott]] praised the order, saying that \"to its credit,\" and \"unlike the other social welfare organizations operating in the war, it never drew the color line.&nbsp;... The Negro soldier needs no other countersign than his khaki uniform to gain for him every advantage offered by the Knights service.\"{{sfn|Scott|1919|pp=407\u2013408}}\n\nIn the 1960s, the Knights took steps to eliminate discrimination both within the order and within society.<ref name=\"columbia\" /> In the spring of 1963, Hart attended a conference at the [[White House]] led by Knight and President [[John F.

Schabacker published several books which continued the work of [[Charles Dow]] and [[William Peter Hamilton]] in their books ''Stock Market Theory and Practice'' and ''Technical Market Analysis''.  In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends'' which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify [https://marketknowledgehub.com/%e0%a4%ad%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%b5-%e0%a4%95%e0%a5%80-%e0%a4%9a%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%b2/ price patterns] and [[market trend]]s in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John J.

These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[[https://marketknowledgehub.com/macd/ MACD]]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in [https://marketknowledgehub.com/ technical analysis]. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts.<ref>''Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians'', p. 7</ref> In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.com.au|title=Home - Australian Technical Analysts Association|publisher=}}</ref> (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apta.org.au | title=Home}}</ref>\n\nProfessional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R.

This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]].

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits. Malkiel has compared technical analysis to \"[[astrology]]\".<ref name=huebscher>Robert Huebscher.

July 7, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, professors Andrew Lo and Craig McKinlay published a paper which cast doubt on the random walk hypothesis. In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH. In a 2000 paper, [[Andrew Lo]] back-analyzed data from the U.S. from 1962 to 1996 and found that \"several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value\".<ref name=Foundations/>  Burton Malkiel dismissed the irregularities mentioned by Lo and McKinlay as being too small to profit from.<ref name=huebscher/>\n\nTechnicians say{{who|date=March 2011}} that the EMH and random walk theories both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>Poser, Steven W.

The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V. Azzopardi<ref>Azzopardi, Paul V. (2012), \"Why Financial Markets Rise Slowly but Fall Sharply: Analysing market behaviour with behavioural finance\", Harriman House, ASIN: B00B0Y6JIC </ref> provided a possible explanation why fear makes prices fall sharply while greed pushes up prices gradually.  This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992\u20131996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via 'market testing', a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.\n\n== Quotation board ==\n\nAnother form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of [[Stock market data systems|stock market data]] contained in quotation boards, that in the times before [[electronic visual display|electronic screens]], were huge [[blackboard|chalkboards]] located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements.<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|pp=1, 18}}</ref> It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as [[Brokerage firm|brokerage houses]], [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]], etc.) via the aforementioned tape, [[telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephone]] and later [[telex]].<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThis analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals for [[day trading]] and [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]], as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for [[Swing trading|swing]] and [[Trend following|position trades]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940|pp=17-18}}</ref>\n\n==Charting terms and indicators==\n\n===Concepts===\n* [[Average true range]]{{spaced ndash}}averaged daily trading range, adjusted for price gaps.\n* [[Breakout (technical analysis)|Breakout]]{{spaced ndash}}the concept whereby prices forcefully penetrate an area of prior [[Support (technical analysis)|support]] or [[Resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]], usually, but not always, accompanied by an increase in volume.\n* [[Chart pattern]]{{spaced ndash}}distinctive pattern created by the movement of security or commodity prices on a chart\n* [[Stock market cycles|Cycles]]{{spaced ndash}}time targets for potential change in price action (price only moves up, down, or sideways)\n* [[Dead cat bounce]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon whereby a spectacular decline in the price of a stock is immediately followed by a moderate and temporary rise before resuming its downward movement\n* [[Elliott wave principle]] and the [[golden ratio]] to calculate successive price movements and retracements\n* [[Fibonacci ratio]]s{{spaced ndash}}used as a guide to determine support and resistance\n* [[Momentum (technical analysis)|Momentum]]{{spaced ndash}}the rate of price change\n* [[Point and figure chart|Point and figure analysis]]{{spaced ndash}}A priced-based analytical approach employing numerical filters which may incorporate time references, though ignores time entirely in its construction\n* [[Resistance (technical analysis)|Resistance]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of selling activity\n* [[Support (technical analysis)|Support]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of buying activity\n* [[Market trend|Trending]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon by which price movement tends to persist in one direction for an extended period of time\n\n===Types of charts===\n* [[Candlestick chart]]{{spaced ndash}}Of Japanese origin and similar to OHLC, candlesticks widen and fill the interval between the open and close prices to emphasize the open/close relationship.

Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and [[market trend]]s in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John J.

These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[MACD]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts.<ref>''Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians'', p. 7</ref> In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.com.au|title=Home - Australian Technical Analysts Association|publisher=}}</ref> (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apta.org.au | title=Home}}</ref>\n\nProfessional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R.

However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Backtesting===\nSystematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]]. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.<ref>http://www.iijournals.com/JOT/default.asp?Page=2&ISS=22278&SID=644085</ref>\n\nInvestor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|title=SFO|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006150127/http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nWhether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy.

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits. Malkiel has compared technical analysis to \"[[astrology]]\".<ref name=huebscher>Robert Huebscher.

July 7, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, professors Andrew Lo and Craig McKinlay published a paper which cast doubt on the random walk hypothesis. In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH. In a 2000 paper, [[Andrew Lo]] back-analyzed data from the U.S. from 1962 to 1996 and found that \"several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value\".<ref name=Foundations/>  Burton Malkiel dismissed the irregularities mentioned by Lo and McKinlay as being too small to profit from.<ref name=huebscher/>\n\nTechnicians say{{who|date=March 2011}} that the EMH and random walk theories both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>Poser, Steven W.

''Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably'', John Wiley and Sons, p. 71. {{ISBN|0-471-42007-7}}.</ref> Some signal processing researchers negate the random walk hypothesis that stock market prices resemble [[Wiener process]]es, because the statistical moments of such processes and real stock data vary significantly with respect to window size and [[similarity measure]].<ref>Eidenberger, Horst (2011). \"Fundamental Media Understanding\" Atpress. {{ISBN|978-3-8423-7917-6}}.</ref> They argue that feature transformations used for the description of audio and [[biosignal]]s can also be used to predict stock market prices successfully which would contradict the random walk hypothesis.\n\nThe random walk index (RWI) is a technical indicator that attempts to determine if a stock's price movement is random in nature or a result of a statistically significant trend.  The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V. Azzopardi<ref>Azzopardi, Paul V. (2012), \"Why Financial Markets Rise Slowly but Fall Sharply: Analysing market behaviour with behavioural finance\", Harriman House, ASIN: B00B0Y6JIC </ref> provided a possible explanation why fear makes prices fall sharply while greed pushes up prices gradually.  This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992\u20131996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via 'market testing', a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.\n\n== Quotation board ==\n\nAnother form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of [[Stock market data systems|stock market data]] contained in quotation boards, that in the times before [[electronic visual display|electronic screens]], were huge [[blackboard|chalkboards]] located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements.<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|pp=1, 18}}</ref> It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as [[Brokerage firm|brokerage houses]], [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]], etc.) via the aforementioned tape, [[telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephone]] and later [[telex]].<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThis analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals for [[day trading]] and [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]], as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for [[Swing trading|swing]] and [[Trend following|position trades]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940|pp=17-18}}</ref>\n\n==Charting terms and indicators==\n\n===Concepts===\n* [[Average true range]]{{spaced ndash}}averaged daily trading range, adjusted for price gaps.\n* [[Breakout (technical analysis)|Breakout]]{{spaced ndash}}the concept whereby prices forcefully penetrate an area of prior [[Support (technical analysis)|support]] or [[Resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]], usually, but not always, accompanied by an increase in volume.\n* [[Chart pattern]]{{spaced ndash}}distinctive pattern created by the movement of security or commodity prices on a chart\n* [[Stock market cycles|Cycles]]{{spaced ndash}}time targets for potential change in price action (price only moves up, down, or sideways)\n* [[Dead cat bounce]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon whereby a spectacular decline in the price of a stock is immediately followed by a moderate and temporary rise before resuming its downward movement\n* [[Elliott wave principle]] and the [[golden ratio]] to calculate successive price movements and retracements\n* [[Fibonacci ratio]]s{{spaced ndash}}used as a guide to determine support and resistance\n* [[Momentum (technical analysis)|Momentum]]{{spaced ndash}}the rate of price change\n* [[Point and figure chart|Point and figure analysis]]{{spaced ndash}}A priced-based analytical approach employing numerical filters which may incorporate time references, though ignores time entirely in its construction\n* [[Resistance (technical analysis)|Resistance]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of selling activity\n* [[Support (technical analysis)|Support]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of buying activity\n* [[Market trend|Trending]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon by which price movement tends to persist in one direction for an extended period of time\n\n===Types of charts===\n* [[Candlestick chart]]{{spaced ndash}}Of Japanese origin and similar to OHLC, candlesticks widen and fill the interval between the open and close prices to emphasize the open/close relationship.
