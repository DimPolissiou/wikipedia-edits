This has the effect of dosing a person who doesn't consent to take the drug. Depot injections can also be used for persons under [[Outpatient commitment|involuntary commitment]]' to force compliance with a court treatment order when the person would refuse to take daily oral medication. Depot preparations were limited to high-potency antipsychotics so choice was limited. The United Nations Special Rapporteur On Torture has classified this as a human rights violation and cruel or inhuman treatment.<ref>https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/torture.pdf</ref>\n\nThe oldest depots available were [[haloperidol]] and [[fluphenazine]], with [[flupentixol]] and [[zuclopenthixol]] as more recent additions. All have a similar, predominantly extrapyramidal, side effect profile though there are some variations between patients. More recently, long acting preparations of the atypical antipsychotic, [[risperidone]], and its metabolite  [[paliperidone]], have become available thus offering new choices. However, Risperidone tends to have a higher incidence of extrapyramidal effects when compared to the [[tricyclic]] and [[Tetracyclic antidepressant|tetracyclic]] atypical antipsychotics, such as [[quetiapine]], [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== Typical medications ==\nA measure of \"chlorpromazine equivalence\" is used to compare the relative effectiveness of antipsychotics.<ref name=\"pmid12823080\">{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0607 |pmid=12823080 |title=Chlorpromazine Equivalent Doses for the Newer Atypical Antipsychotics |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=663\u20137 |year=2003 |last1=Woods |first1=Scott W. }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid14624195\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.jcp.0000096247.29231.3a |pmid=14624195 |title=Chlorpromazine Equivalents Versus Defined Daily Doses: How to Compare Antipsychotic Drug Doses? |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=657\u20139 |year=2003 |last1=Rijcken |first1=Claudia A.W. |last2=Monster |first2=Taco B.M. |last3=Brouwers |first3=Jacobus R.B.J. |last4=De Jong-Van Den Berg |first4=Lolkje T.W. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leucht | first1 = S | last2 = Samara | first2 = M | last3 = Heres | first3 = S | last4 = Davis | first4 = JM | date = Jul 2016 | title = Dose Equivalents for Antipsychotic Drugs: The DDD Method | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 42 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = S90\u20134 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbv167 | pmid = 27460622 | pmc = 4960429 }}</ref> The measure specifies the amount (mass) in milligrams of a given drug that must be administered in order to achieve desired effects equivalent to those of 100 milligrams of chlorpromazine.

He ascended the thrones in 1621 and reigned in Portugal until 1640. Philip is remembered for his patronage of the arts, including such artists as [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and his rule over Spain during the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nBy the time of his death in 1665, the [[Spanish Empire]] had reached approximately 12.2 million square kilometers (4.7 million square miles) in area but in other respects was in decline, a process to which Philip contributed with his inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform.\n\n==Personal life==\nPhilip IV was born in [[Royal Palace of Valladolid]], and was the eldest son of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and his wife, [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Margaret of Austria]]. In 1615, at the age of 10, Philip was married to 13-year-old [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth of France]], although the relationship does not appear to have been close; some have even suggested that [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], his key minister, later deliberately tried to keep the two apart to maintain his influence, encouraging Philip to take mistresses instead.<ref name=Stevenson12>Stevenson, p. 12.</ref> Philip had seven children by Elisabeth, with only one being a son, [[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Balthasar Charles]], who died at the age of sixteen in 1646. The death of his son deeply shocked the king, who appears to have been a good father by the standards of the day. Elisabeth was able to conspire with other Spanish nobles to remove Olivares from the court in 1643, and for a brief period she held considerable influence over Philip; by the time of her death, however, she was out of favour, following manoeuvering by Olivares' successor, [[Luis de Haro]].<ref name=Stevenson12/>\n\nPhilip remarried in 1649, following the deaths of both Elisabeth and his only legitimate heir. His choice of his second wife, [[Mariana of Austria|Maria Anna]], also known as Mariana, Philip's niece and the daughter of the [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand]], was guided by politics and Philip's desire to strengthen the relationship with Habsburg Austria.<ref>Wedgwood, p. 495.</ref> They were married on 7 October 1649. Maria Anna bore him five children, but only two survived to adulthood, a daughter [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margarita Teresa]], born in 1651, and the future [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1661 \u2013 but the latter was sickly and considered in frequent danger of dying, making the line of inheritance potentially uncertain.<ref name=Kamen217>Kamen, p. 217.</ref>\n\nPerceptions of Philip's personality have altered considerably over time. Victorian authors were inclined to portray him as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched [[Baroque]] court.<ref name=Aercke140>Aercke, p. 140.</ref> Victorian historians even attributed the early death of Baltasar to [[Sexually transmitted disease|debauchery]], encouraged by the gentlemen entrusted by the king with his education. The doctors who treated the Prince at that time diagnosed [[smallpox]], although modern scholars attribute his death to [[appendicitis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Historians' estimation of Philip gradually improved in the 20th century, with comparisons between Philip and his father being increasingly positive \u2013 some noting that he possessed much more energy, both mental and physical, than his diffident father.<ref name=Wedgwood144>Wedgwood, p. 144.</ref>\n\nHis contemporaries idealised philip as the model of [[Baroque]] kingship. Outwardly he maintained a bearing of rigid solemnity; foreign visitors described him as being so impassive in public he resembled a statue,<ref>Darby, p. 5.</ref> and he was said to have been seen to laugh only three times in the course of his entire public life. Philip certainly had a strong sense of his 'royal dignity',<ref name=Elliot47>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 47.</ref> but was also extensively coached by Olivares in how to resemble the Baroque model of a sovereign,<ref name=Elliot47/> which would form a vital political tool for Philip throughout his reign. Philip was an excellent horseman, a keen [[Hunting|hunter]], and a devotee of [[Bullfighting|bull-fighting]],<ref name=Wedgwood144/> all central parts of royal public life at court during the period.\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez y Serrano 003.jpg|left|thumb|Philip pictured with his older sister, [[Anne of Austria|Anne]] in 1612 by Bartolom\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez y Serrano]]\n\nPrivately, Philip appears to have had a lighter persona. When he was younger, he was said to have a keen sense of humour and a 'great sense of fun.' <ref>Stradling, p. 84.</ref> He privately attended 'academies' in Madrid throughout his reign \u2013 these were lighthearted literary salons, aiming to analyse contemporary literature and poetry with a humorous touch.<ref>Robbins, p. 31.</ref> A keen theatre-goer, he was sometimes criticised by contemporaries for his love of these 'frivolous' entertainments.<ref>Robbins, p. 28.</ref> Others have captured his private personality as 'naturally kind, gentle and affable.' <ref name=\"Stevenson, p. 7\">Stevenson, p. 7.</ref> Those close to him claimed he was academically competent, with a good grasp of [[Latin]] and [[geography]], and could speak French, Portuguese and Italian well.<ref name=Kamen213>Kamen, p. 213-214.</ref> Like many of his contemporaries, including Olivares, he had a keen interest in [[astrology]].<ref>Aercke, p. 139.</ref> His handwritten translation of [[Francesco Guicciardini]]'s texts on political history still exist.\n\nAlthough interpretations of Philip's role in government have improved in recent years, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s contemporary description of Philip's key weakness \u2013 that 'he mistrusts himself, and defers to others too much' \u2014 remains relevant. Although Philip's Catholic beliefs no longer attract criticism from English language writers, Philip is still felt to have been 'unduly pious' in his personal life.<ref name=Kamen213/> Notably, from the 1640s onwards he sought the advice of a noted cloistered abbess, Sor [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], exchanging many letters with her.<ref name=\"Hume, p\">Hume, p. {{Clarify|date=May 2010}}</ref> This did not stop Philip's becoming known for his numerous affairs, particularly with actresses;<ref name=Wedgwood144/> the most famous of these was his actress-mistress Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Calder\u00f3n (La Calderona),<ref name=Aercke160>Aercke, p. 160.</ref> with whom he had a son in 1629, [[John of Austria the Younger|Juan Jos\u00e9]], who was brought up as a royal prince.<ref name=Kamen217/> By the end of the reign, and with the health of Carlos Jos\u00e9 in doubt, there was a real possibility of Juan Jos\u00e9's claiming the throne, which added to the instability of the regency years.\n\n==Philip, Olivares and his royal favourites==\n[[File:Caspar de Crayer - Philip IV (1605\u20131665) in Parade Armor.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Philip IV of Spain in armor (1627\u201328) by [[Gaspar de Crayer]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n\nDuring the reign of Philip's father, Philip III, the royal court had been dominated by the Sandoval noble family, most strikingly by the [[Duke of Lerma]], Philip III's first favorite and chief minister for almost all of his reign. Philip IV came to power as the influence of the Sandovals was being undermined by a new noble coalition, led by Don [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]. De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga regarded it as essential that the Sandovals be unable to gain influence over the future king; de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga first began to develop his influence over Prince Philip,<ref>Munck, p. 52.</ref> and then introduced his nephew, [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], to the prince, ten years old at the time.<ref name=Parker232>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 232.</ref> At first, Philip did not particularly take to Olivares.<ref name=ElliotRev194>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 194.</ref> Over at least a year, however, the relationship became very close,<ref>Stradling, p. 8.</ref> with Philip's tendency towards underconfidence and diffidence counteracted by Olivares' drive and determination.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Olivares rapidly became Philip's most trusted advisor, and when Philip ascended the throne in 1621, at the age of sixteen, he showed his confidence in Olivares by ordering that all papers requiring the royal signature should first be sent to the count-duke. Philip retained Olivares as his confidant and chief minister for the next twenty years.\n\n[[File:Retrato de Felipe IV, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of a youthful Philip IV in 1623 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], displaying the prominent \"[[Habsburg lip]]\"]]\n\nEarly in his reign, Philip would be woken by Olivares in the morning to discuss the day's affairs<ref name=Parker232/> and would meet with him twice more during the day, although later this routine declined until the king would hold only one short meeting on policy with Olivares each day.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Philip intervened far more in policies during 1641\u201342, however, and it has been suggested that Philip paid more attention to policymaking than has traditionally been depicted; some recent histories go so far as to describe him as 'conscientious' in policymaking,<ref name=\"Elliot47\"/> although he is still criticised for his failure to make timely decisions.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 526.</ref> Philip himself argued that it was hardly appropriate for the king himself go house to house amongst his ministers to see if his instructions were being carried out.<ref>Elliot, ''The Statecraft of Olivares'', p. 121.</ref> The close relationship between Philip and Olivares was demonstrated by their portraits' being placed side by side at the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]] \u2014 an act unheard-of in Europe at the time.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 32.</ref> Philip's relationship with Olivares, however, was not a simplistic one. The pair had many rows and arguments throughout their relationship, both as a result of their different personalities and differences of opinion over policies.<ref>Stradling, p. 83.</ref>\n\nInitially, Philip chose to confirm the reappointment of his father's household to assuage grandee opinion.<ref>Stradling, p. 43.</ref> Under the influence of de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Olivares, however, Philip was then quick to place de Lerma's estates \u2013 expanded considerably during his long period as favourite \u2013 under administration, and to remove from office [[Crist\u00f3bal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda]], de Lerma's son, who had initially helped de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga remove his father from office to advance his position.<ref>Williams, p. 248.</ref> Philip's initial announcements reflected an intent to reform the monarchy to the sober, moral position it had been under his grandfather, including selecting ministers whose grandfathers had served under Philip II.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 234.</ref>\n\n[[File:Count-Duke of Olivares.jpg|thumb|Philip IV's most prominent favourite and minister, the [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke Olivares]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip has, in the past, been considered to be 'unimaginative' in his politics,<ref name=Wedgwood144/> but recent histories have stressed the more radical elements of his first two decades in power. There was a febrile atmosphere in Spain in the early 17th century, with numerous ''arbitrista'' offering various advice on how to solve Spain's various ills; this advice could, and would, be given in person by those of the lower classes to the king on suitable occasions, provided it was presented to strengthen the crown.<ref>Corteguera, p. 134.</ref> Those debates extended to the nature of the monarchy. It has been suggested that the writers of the period who best capture Philip's view of royal authority were Justus Lipsius and Giovanni Botero, who promoted religiously inspired, stoic self-sacrifice and a view of Habsburg family-led hegemony respectively.<ref>Ringrose, p. 320.</ref> While at one level conservative \u2013 harking back in foreign policy to the period of [[King Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]], invoking traditional values at home \u2013 Philip's policies were also radical, rejecting the policy towards the rebellious Dutch that had held since 1609, entering into the [[Thirty Years' War]], and introducing a system of ''junta'', or small committee, government across Spain in competition to the traditional system of royal councils.\n\nFollowing Olivares' fall from power amidst the crisis of 1640\u20131643, the victim of failed policies and jealousy from the nobles excluded from power, Philip initially announced that he would rule alone, becoming in effect his first minister. The ''junta'' system of government began to be dismantled in favor of the older council system. In due course, however, this personal rule reverted to rule through a royal favorite, initially [[Luis de Haro]], a nephew of Olivares and a childhood playmate of Philip's,<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 264.</ref> and the counter-reform of the committee system halted. Historians have not highly regarded de Haro; the comment of one, that de Haro was the 'embodiment of mediocrity,' is not atypical.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\">Polisensky, p. 224.</ref> After de Haro died in 1661, Olivares' son-in-law, the Duke of Medina de las Torres, became a royal favourite in his place.<ref name=Kamen228>Kamen, p. 228.</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy and the Thirty Years' War==\n[[File:Felipe IV de casta\u00f1o y plata, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip IV at the height of his success, painted c. 1631\u201332 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip was to reign through the majority of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, a turbulent period of military history. In Philip III's final years, [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] had convinced him to intervene militarily in [[Bohemia]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] on the side of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. Once Philip himself came to power, he was convinced by de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, appointed his principal foreign minister, and Olivares that he should commit Spain to a more aggressive foreign policy in alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This would lead Philip to renew hostilities with the Dutch in 1621 in an attempt to bring the provinces to the negotiating table to achieve a peace treaty favourable to Spanish global interests. Philip's government would pursue a 'Netherlands first' strategy throughout the war until 1643.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 219.</ref> Despite this shift in policy, Philip does not seem to have been particularly aggressive; early on he noted that having inherited such a large empire, war somewhere across his domains was an inevitable condition,<ref>Kamen, ''Vicissitudes of a World Power'', p. 156.</ref> and he appeared genuinely upset when he came to power and contemplated how much the people of Castile had paid 'in blood' to support the wars of his royal predecessors.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, p. 144.</ref>\n\nThe 1620s were good years for Spanish foreign policy: the war with the Dutch went well, albeit at great expense, culminating in the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|retaking of the key city of Breda]] in 1624. By the end of the decade, however, Philip's government was faced with the question of whether to prioritise the war in Flanders or Spain's relationship with France during the [[War of the Mantuan Succession]] (1628\u20131631). Philip's advisors recommended prioritising the war in Flanders, taking action to safeguard the [[Spanish Road]] to the Netherlands but at the cost of antagonising [[Louis XIII]].<ref>Mackay, p. 5.</ref> Strategically this was to prove a disaster. [[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0429.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philip IV]]Despite recent Spanish successes in the mid-1630s \u2013 in particular, the triumph of Philip's government in raising a new Spanish army, marching it into Germany to defeat the Swedish-led [[Protestant Union|Protestant forces]] at the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] in 1634 \u2013 the increased tensions with France made war between the two Catholic states increasingly inevitable. Olivares advised Philip that the coming war with France would be all or nothing; Spain would win or fall by the result.<ref>Corteguera, p. 143.</ref>\n\nThe [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Spanish-French war]] that ensued from 1635 onwards was not a foregone conclusion. Early Spanish successes threatened Paris, and even after the Spanish defeat at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]], Spain remained a strong opponent. But from 1640 onwards, a period which saw large-scale revolts across Spanish territories in protest against the rising costs of the conflict, Spain was finding it difficult to sustain the war. Philip reacted to the increased French threat by finally abandoning his 'Netherlands first' strategy; resources for the [[Army of Flanders]] were savagely cut, and the fight against the French-supported rebels Catalonia took the priority.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 221.</ref> Shortly after Rocroi, Philip \u2013 now having had to dismiss his favourite, Olivares \u2013 issued instructions to his ambassadors to seek a peace treaty. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], delivered by Olivares' replacement [[Luis de Haro]], resolved the long-running [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands and the wars in Germany, but the conflict with France dragged on. Philip responded to the perceived weakness of France during the [[Fronde]] rebellions of 1648 by continuing the fight; he took personal responsibility for the decision to start anew, and ultimately successful, the offensive against the French in Catalonia in 1651.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 539.</ref> True victory over France never emerged, however, and by 1658, after the loss of [[Dunkirk]] to an Anglo-French force, Philip was personally desperate for peace.<ref>Kamen, p. 222.</ref> The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, and the marriage of Philip's daughter [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]] to the young [[King Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\">Ishikawa, p. 77.</ref> finally brought the war with France to a conclusion. The war against Portugal continued, however, as Philip fruitlessly attempted to regain control over his lost kingdom.\n\n==Philip and the Spanish military==\n[[File:Felipe IV; Rey de Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip dressed as a [[cuirassier]], accompanied by a [[court dwarf]], by [[Caspar de Crayer|Gaspar de Crayer]]]]\nBy the late 1620s, the Spanish army was no longer as dominant on the battlefield as it once had been. The feared ''[[tercio]]'' regiments, composed of well-disciplined [[pikemen]], were increasingly appearing inflexible and old-fashioned in the face of the new Swedish and Dutch formations with a higher proportion of [[musketeers]]. Philip and Olivares attempted to address the perceived weaknesses of the army, which they concluded were primarily due to the ''falta de cabezas'', or a lack of leadership. In keeping with their wider agenda of renewing the concepts of duty, service, and aristocratic tradition, the king agreed to efforts to introduce more grandees into the higher ranks of the military, working hard to overcome the reluctance of many to take up field appointments in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] and elsewhere.<ref name=Parker102>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 101-103.</ref>\n\nThe results were not entirely as hoped. The grandees dragooned into service in this way were disinclined to spend years learning the standard professional military skillset; they wished 'to start as generals and soldiers on the same day,' to quote one disgruntled career soldier.{{Who|date=July 2010}} By the 1630s, the king was waiving the usual rules to enable promotion to higher ranks on a shorter timescale, and having to pay significantly inflated salaries to get grandees to take up even these appointments.<ref name=Parker102/> The performance of these officers at battles such as [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] left much to be desired.\n\nPhilip was also notable for his interest in the Spanish ''[[Spanish Navy|armada]]'', or navy. Shortly after taking power, he began to increase the size of his fleets, rapidly doubling the size of the naval budget from the start of his reign, then tripling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 45.</ref> Philip is credited with a 'sensible, pragmatic approach' to provisioning and controlling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 32.</ref> He was prepared to involve himself in considerable details of naval policy; he was commenting on the detail of provisions for the ''armada'' in 1630, for example.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 157.</ref> The ''Junta de Armadas'' was the only ''junta'' committee to survive the fall of Olivares intact.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 34.</ref> Even after the disastrous [[Battle of the Downs]], Philip remained closely interested in his navy, including ensuring ministerial attention. In 1646, de Haro was personally involved in supplying and equipping the Atlantic fleet from [[Cadiz]]. Throughout the period, there was no 'weakening of the importance attached to naval forces'<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 156.</ref> by the king, who argued that joint land and naval operations were essential. Some of his conclusions on naval policy were quite advanced: after the peace of 1648, Philip argued that the Dutch fleets off the Spanish peninsula were good for trade, despite concerns from his senior officials, since they protected the English and French navies.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy and the crisis of the monarchy==\n{{House of Habsburg (Spain)}}\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain.jpg|thumb|left|An older Philip IV, painted in 1656 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip had inherited a huge [[Spanish Empire|empire]] from his father, spanning the known world, but many of his most difficult challenges as king would stem from domestic problems in Spain itself. Spain in the early 17th century was a collection of possessions \u2013 the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the autonomous provinces of [[Catalonia]] and [[Andalusia]], complete with the wider provinces of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Milan]] etc. \u2013 all loosely joined together through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip IV.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 61.</ref> Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than that in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces. This loose system had successfully resisted reform and higher taxation before, ironically resulting in Spain's having had historically, up until the 1640s at least, fewer than the usual number of fiscal revolts for an early modern European state.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nIn the first years of his reign, heavily influenced by his royal favourite Olivares, Philip focused on efforts to reform the most chaotic aspects of this system. Frustrated by the notorious slowness of the system of royal councils, Philip supported Olivares' establishment of ''juntas'' \u2013 small committees designed to circumvent the more formal system and to enact policies quickly. Although successful, these ''juntas'' excluded many of the traditional grandees and caused resentment.<ref name=Munck53>Munck, p. 53.</ref> Olivares put forward the idea of a ''Uni\u00f3n de Armas'', or '[[Union of Arms]].' This would have involved establishing a force of 140,000 paid soldiers, supported by equitable taxes from across the Empire, and has been termed 'the most far-sighted proposal of any statesman of the age';<ref>Anderson, p. 44.</ref> in practice. However, it met fierce opposition from the various regional assemblies and the plan was withdrawn. During the 1620s, again influenced by a desire to reform Spanish life for the better, Philip also passed important legislation with puritanical overtones. In 1623, he closed all the legal [[brothel]]s in Spain, extended the dormant [[sumptuary law]]s on luxury goods and supported [[Pope|Papal]] efforts to regulate priests' sexual behaviour more tightly.<ref>Haliczer, p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional - 108085 - Cent\u00e9n segoviano de 1633 01.jpg|thumb|Large gold coin minted in 1633, under the reign of Philip IV]]\n\nPhilip had clear intentions to try to control the Spanish currency, which had become increasingly unstable during the reign of his father and grandfather, but in practice, inflation soared.<ref name=Kamen228/> Partly this was because in 1627 Olivares had attempted to deal with the problem of Philip's [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers \u2013 who had proved uncooperative in recent years \u2013 by declaring a state bankruptcy.<ref>Munck, p. 55.</ref> With the Genoese debt now removed, Olivares hoped to turn to indigenous bankers for renewed funds. In practice, the plan was a disaster. The [[Spanish treasure fleet]] of 1628 was captured by the Dutch, and Spain's ability to borrow and transfer money across Europe declined sharply.\n\nBy the 1630s, Philip's domestic policies were being increasingly impacted by the financial pressures of the Thirty Years' War, and in particular the growing war with France. The costs of the war were huge, and while they had largely fallen upon Castile, the ability of the crown to raise more funds and men from this source was increasingly limited.<ref name=Munck53/> Philip and his government were desperately trying to reduce the responsibilities of the central government in response to the overstretch of the war, and various reform ideas that might have been pursued during the 1620s were rejected on this basis.<ref>Parker, 2005,{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} p. 81.</ref> Financial restraints and higher taxes were put in place, but Philip was increasingly selling off [[Regalian right|regalian]] and [[feudal]] rights, along with much of the royal estate to fund the conflict.<ref>Anderson, p. 72.</ref> It has been argued that the fiscal stringencies of the 1630s, combined with the strength and role of Olivares and the ''juntas'', effectively cut Philip off from the three traditional pillars of support for the monarchy: the grandees, the Church and the Council of Castile.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\">Stradling, p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe crisis came in 1640. An attempt by Olivares to intervene in Catalonia to deal with the French invasion threat resulted in revolt. An alliance of Catalan rebels and French royal forces proved challenging to suppress, and in trying to mobilise Portuguese noble support for the war, Olivares triggered a second uprising. [[Lisbon]]'s nobles expelled Philip, and gave the throne to the [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]], marking the end of sixty years of the [[Iberian Union]] and the beginning of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. The next year, the [[Dukes of Medina Sidonia#9th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]] attempted another [[Andalusian independentist conspiracy (1641)|rebellion against Philip from Andalusia]], possibly attempting to reproduce the Braganzas' success in Portugal.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 8.</ref> Although Philip and Olivares were able to repress the ducal revolt, Philip had found himself increasingly isolated. On his return from Zaragoza, where he had been commanding the army, he found only one of the Castilian nobility arrived at court on Easter Day 1641. The threat of Philip's being deposed by the grandees of Castile seemed increasingly real.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 262-263.</ref>\n\nMuch shaken by events, Philip's solution was to remove his royal favourite Olivares from office in 1643 in an attempt to compromise with the Spanish elite. He announced he would rule alone, rejecting both the concept of a royal favourite as first minister and the system of ''junta'' government, which he began to dismantle in favour of the older system of royal councils.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\"/> Clemency was shown to the Duke of Medina Sidonia. The situation began to stabilise, and before long, Philip felt secure enough to revert to his preferred method of government. [[Luis de Haro]], Olivares' nephew, took over as favourite and minister, and the counter-reform of the ''juntas'' halted. The spark of reform from Philip's earlier years never returned, however. The Catalan rebellion dragged on for several years. In 1652, the Spanish army retook [[Barcelona]], and Philip issued an amnesty for the rebels, promising to respect traditional customs and rights in the future.<ref>Zagorin, p. 37.</ref>\n\n==Patronage of the arts==\n[[File:Lecci\u00f3n de equitaci\u00f3n del pr\u00edncipe Baltasar Carlos, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|[[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Prince Baltasar Carlos]] with the [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke of Olivares]] outside the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1636]]\n\nPhilip has been remembered both for the 'astonishing enthusiasm' with which he collected art<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]. {{cite episode | title = The Mystical North | episodelink = | series = Art of Spain | serieslink = Art of Spain (TV series) | airdate = 2008-02-14 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> and for his love of theatre. On the stage, he favoured [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]], and other distinguished dramatists. Philip has been credited with a share in the composition of several comedies. Court theatre used [[Theatrical scenery|perspective scenery]], a new invention from Italy not used in commercial theatre at the time. Some writers have likened the illusion of Baroque royal theatre to the illusion of kingly power the performances were designed to reinforce.<ref>Robbins, p. 27-28.</ref> Some recent scholarship has suggested that Philip's financial sponsorship of playwrights, however, may have been less extensive than once thought.<ref name=Aercke160/>\n\nArtistically, Philip became famous for his patronage of his court painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], who originated from [[Seville]];<ref>Stevenson, p. 10.</ref> mutual contacts caused him to become known to Olivares, who came from the same region. Vel\u00e1zquez was summoned to Madrid by the king in 1624.<ref>Stevenson, p. 11.</ref> Despite some jealousy from the existing court painters, Vel\u00e1zquez rapidly became a success with Philip, being retained for the rest of his career until his death, painting a celebration of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] for Philip. The king and Vel\u00e1zquez shared common interests in horses, dogs, and art, and in private they formed an easy, relaxed relationship over the years.<ref name=\"Stevenson, p. 7\"/> Philip supported a number of other prominent painters, including [[Eugenio Cax\u00e9s]], [[Vincenzo Carducci|Vicente Carducho]], [[Gonzales Coques|Gonzales]] and [[Angelo Nardi (painter)|Nardi]]. Philip obtained paintings from across Europe, especially Italy, accumulating over 4,000 by the time of his death; some have termed this unparalleled assemblage a 'mega-collection.' <ref>Ishikawa, p. 72.</ref>\n\nPhilip was nicknamed ''el Rey Planeta'', the 'Planet King',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\">Robbins, p. 27.</ref> by his contemporaries, and much of the art and display at his court has been interpreted in the context of his need to project power and authority, over both Spaniards and foreigners alike.<ref name=Aercke142>Aercke, p. 142.</ref> Older interpretations, which perceived Philip's court as being completely decadent, have been largely superseded, but the art and symbolism of the period certainly did not reflect the wider threat and decline of Spanish power.<ref name=Aercke140/> Indeed, the limited Spanish military successes of the period were celebrated by royal artists to a disproportionate extent. Numerous artists from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] produced work extolling the [[Army of Flanders]], including [[Sebastian Vrancx|Vrancx]], [[Peter Snayers|Snaeyers]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer|Molenaer]] and [[Willem Hondius|de Hondt]]. The [[Siege of Breda (1624)|re-capture of Breda]] alone resulted in major works by Vel\u00e1zquez and the French etcher [[Jacques Callot]], in addition to various plays and books.<ref name=Parker102/>\n\nThe 'Planet King' also invested in a new palace to display both his art and the ritual of court. Through Olivares, Philip commenced the building of the ''[[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]]'' in Madrid, parts of which remain near the [[Prado museum|Prado]]. Work began modestly in 1631,<ref name=Aercke142/> with the magnificent, if costly, 'Hall of Thrones', completed by 1635.<ref name=Aercke140/> The palace included its own 'theatre, ballroom, galleries, bull ring, gardens, and artificial lakes',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\"/> and became the centre for artists and dramatists from across Europe. The palace was built during one of the more difficult periods of Philip's reign. Given both its cost, in a time of stringent wartime savings, and the protest that ensued from a disgruntled public,<ref>Haliczar, p. 26.</ref> it is considered to have been an important part of the attempt to communicate royal grandeur and authority.{{by whom|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Philip and religion==\n[[File:Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas de Agreda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a religious advisor to Philip IV during the second half of his reign]]\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Catholic religion]] and its rituals played an important part in Philip's life, especially towards the end of his reign. Depressed by events across his domains, he became increasingly concerned with religious affairs.<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\"/> In particular, Philip paid special devotions to a painting of the ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Milagro'', the [[Virgin of Miracles]]; the painting was said to miraculously rise and lower its eyes in response to prayer. While married to [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth]], Philip had placed their children under the protection of this image, married to [[Mariana of Austria|Mariana]], they undertook special religious ceremonies together under the gaze of the painting. Philip also had a large standard made with the image of the painting on one side and the royal coat of arms on the other, brought out in processions each year on 12 July.<ref>Goodman, ''Conspicuous In Her Absence'', p. 169-170.</ref> As well as marking a strong personal religious belief, this increasingly visible link between the crown, the Church and national symbols such as the Virgin of Miracles, represented a key pillar of support for Philip as king.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\"/>\n\nMonarchs during the period also had a key role in the [[canonization]] process and could utilise this for domestic or international political effect. Philip, for example, keen to reach out to his Portuguese subjects, put his considerable influence behind the case for [[Elizabeth of Aragon|Isabella of Portugal]], a 14th-century role model of a 'perfect wife,' to great effect, ultimately paying for a lavish celebration in Lisbon after her canonisation in 1625. Internationally, it was important for Spanish prestige for her to receive at least a proportionate, and ideally greater, the share of new saints than other Catholic kingdoms, and Philip sponsored a flurry of texts and books supporting Spain's candidates, particularly in competition with Catholic France.<ref>Haliczer, p. 34-36.</ref>\n[[File:Velazquez-FelipIVVersalles.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Philip in France for his daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]]]]\n\nDuring the emergency of 1640\u20131643, Philip appears to have had a crisis of faith. Philip genuinely believed the success or failure of his policies represented God's favour and judgement on his actions.<ref name=Haliczer27>Haliczer, p. 27.</ref> The combination of the revolts, the French advances, and the loss of his trusted favourite Olivares appears to have deeply shaken him. Queen Isabella and the new president of the [[Council of Castile]], Don Juan Chumacero \u2013 both involved in the removal of Olivares \u2013 encouraged the king to invite [[Mysticism|mystics]] and visionaries from across Europe to his court at [[Zaragoza]]. The mystics' principal advice centred on the importance of the king's rejecting Olivares' replacement, de Haro and the remaining pro-Olivares nobles at court.<ref name=Haliczer26>Haliczer, p. 26.</ref> The various mystics were not acceptable to broader Spanish noble opinion and, with de Haro's encouragement, they were ultimately dismissed.<ref name=Haliczer27/>\n\nInstead, Philip turned to a better established female mystic, Sister [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a prioress known for her religious writings.<ref name=Haliczer27/> He asked her to correspond with him and to advise him in spiritual matters. The two became regular correspondents throughout the remainder of their lives. This is documented in over 600 confidential letters between them over twenty-two years.<ref name=\"Hume, p\"/> Philip believed that Maria could intercede with God on his behalf and provide advice on what God wished him to do, to improve Spain's failing fortunes.<ref name=Haliczer27/> Most believe that Philip was involved in protecting Maria from the Inquisition's investigation of 1650.<ref>Haliczer, p. 92.</ref> Philip's son, as [[King Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], protected her writings from later censorship.\n\n==Titles and style==\nIn the 1630 [[Treaty of Madrid (1630)|Treaty of Madrid]], Philip was styled \"Philip, by the grace of God [[list of Spanish kings|king of the Spains]], [[list of Sicilian kings|Both the Sicilies]], [[list of kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], the Indies, etc., [[archduke of Austria]], [[list of Burgundian dukes|duke of Burgundy]], [[list of Milanese dukes|Milan]], etc., [[list of counts of Habsburg|count of Habsburg]], [[list of Tyrolian counts|Tyrol]], etc.\" in full and \"the [[Most Serene]] Philip IV, [[Rex Catholicismus|Catholic King]] of the Spains,\" for short.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Davenport, p.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1648 [[Treaty of M\u00fcnster (1648)|Treaty of M\u00fcnster]], he was styled \"Don Philip the Fourth, by the grace of God king of [[list of Castilian kings|Castile]], [[list of Leonese kings|Leon]], [[list of Aragonese kings|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|the Two Sicilies]], Jerusalem, [[list of Navarrese kings|Navarre]], [[list of kings of Granada|Granada]], [[list of kings of Toledo|Toledo]], [[list of Valencian kings|Valencia]], [[list of Galician kings|Galicia]], [[list of Majorcan kings|Majorca]], [[list of Minorcan kings|Minorca]], [[list of kings of Seville|Seville]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[list of kings of Cordoba|Cordoba]], [[list of Sardinian kings|Corsica]], [[list of Murcian kings|Murcia]], [[list of kings of Jaen|Jaen]], [[list of kings of Algeciras|Algeciras]], [[list of kings of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], the [[list of kings of the Canary Islands|Canary Islands]], the Eastern and Western Indies, the islands and ''terra firma'' of the Ocean, archduke of Austria, duke of Burgundy, [[list of dukes of Brabant|Brabant]], Milan, count of Habsburg, [[list of Flemish counts|Flanders]], Tyrol, [[list of Barcelonian counts|Barcelona]], lord of [[List of lords of Biscay|Biscay]] and [[list of lords of Molina|Molina]], etc.\" in full and \"King of the Spains, Don Philip the Fourth and King of [[list of Portuguese kings|Portugal]] and the [[list of kings of the Algarves|Algarves]] Don Philip the Third \", for short.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nPhilip IV's reign, after a few years of inconclusive successes, was characterized by political and military decay and adversity.

He ascended the thrones in 1621 and reigned in Portugal until 1640. Philip is remembered for his patronage of the arts, including such artists as [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and his rule over Spain during the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nBy the time of his death in 1665, the [[Spanish Empire]] had reached approximately 12.2 million square kilometers (4.7 million square miles) in the area but in other respects was in decline, a process to which Philip contributed with his inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform.\n\n==Personal life==\nPhilip IV was born in [[Royal Palace of Valladolid]], and was the eldest son of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and his wife, [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Margaret of Austria]]. In 1615, at the age of 10, Philip was married to 13-year-old [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth of France]], although the relationship does not appear to have been close; some have even suggested that [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], his key minister, later deliberately tried to keep the two apart to maintain his influence, encouraging Philip to take mistresses instead.<ref name=Stevenson12>Stevenson, p. 12.</ref> Philip had seven children by Elisabeth, with only one being a son, [[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Balthasar Charles]], who died at the age of sixteen in 1646. The death of his son deeply shocked the king, who appears to have been a good father by the standards of the day. Elisabeth was able to conspire with other Spanish nobles to remove Olivares from the court in 1643, and for a brief period she held considerable influence over Philip; by the time of her death, however, she was out of favour, following manoeuvering by Olivares' successor, [[Luis de Haro]].<ref name=Stevenson12/>\n\nPhilip remarried in 1649, following the deaths of both Elisabeth and his only legitimate heir. His choice of his second wife, [[Mariana of Austria|Maria Anna]], also known as Mariana, Philip's niece and the daughter of the [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand]], was guided by politics and Philip's desire to strengthen the relationship with Habsburg Austria.<ref>Wedgwood, p. 495.</ref> They were married on 7 October 1649. Maria Anna bore him five children, but only two survived to adulthood, a daughter [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margarita Teresa]], born in 1651, and the future [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1661 \u2013 but the latter was sickly and considered in frequent danger of dying, making the line of inheritance potentially uncertain.<ref name=Kamen217>Kamen, p. 217.</ref>\n\nPerceptions of Philip's personality have altered considerably over time. Victorian authors were inclined to portray him as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched [[Baroque]] court.<ref name=Aercke140>Aercke, p. 140.</ref> Victorian historians even attributed the early death of Baltasar to [[Sexually transmitted disease|debauchery]], encouraged by the gentlemen entrusted by the king with his education. The doctors who treated the Prince at that time diagnosed [[smallpox]], although modern scholars attribute his death to [[appendicitis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Historians' estimation of Philip gradually improved in the 20th century, with comparisons between Philip and his father being increasingly positive \u2013 some noting that he possessed much more energy, both mental and physical, than his diffident father.<ref name=Wedgwood144>Wedgwood, p. 144.</ref>\n\nHis contemporaries idealised philip as the model of [[Baroque]] kingship. Outwardly he maintained a bearing of rigid solemnity; foreign visitors described him as being so impassive in public he resembled a statue,<ref>Darby, p. 5.</ref> and he was said to have been seen to laugh only three times in the course of his entire public life. Philip certainly had a strong sense of his 'royal dignity',<ref name=Elliot47>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 47.</ref> but was also extensively coached by Olivares in how to resemble the Baroque model of a sovereign,<ref name=Elliot47/> which would form a vital political tool for Philip throughout his reign. Philip was an excellent horseman, a keen [[Hunting|hunter]], and a devotee of [[Bullfighting|bull-fighting]],<ref name=Wedgwood144/> all central parts of royal public life at court during the period.\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez y Serrano 003.jpg|left|thumb|Philip pictured with his older sister, [[Anne of Austria|Anne]] in 1612 by Bartolom\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez y Serrano]]\n\nPrivately, Philip appears to have had a lighter persona. When he was younger, he was said to have a keen sense of humour and a 'great sense of fun.' <ref>Stradling, p. 84.</ref> He privately attended 'academies' in Madrid throughout his reign \u2013 these were lighthearted literary salons, aiming to analyse contemporary literature and poetry with a humorous touch.<ref>Robbins, p. 31.</ref> A keen theatre-goer, he was sometimes criticised by contemporaries for his love of these 'frivolous' entertainments.<ref>Robbins, p. 28.</ref> Others have captured his private personality as 'naturally kind, gentle and affable.' <ref name=\"Stevenson, p. 7\">Stevenson, p. 7.</ref> Those close to him claimed he was academically competent, with a good grasp of [[Latin]] and [[geography]], and could speak French, Portuguese and Italian well.<ref name=Kamen213>Kamen, p. 213-214.</ref> Like many of his contemporaries, including Olivares, he had a keen interest in [[astrology]].<ref>Aercke, p. 139.</ref> His handwritten translation of [[Francesco Guicciardini]]'s texts on political history still exist.\n\nAlthough interpretations of Philip's role in government have improved in recent years, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s contemporary description of Philip's key weakness \u2013 that 'he mistrusts himself, and defers to others too much' \u2014 remains relevant. Although Philip's Catholic beliefs no longer attract criticism from English language writers, Philip is still felt to have been 'unduly pious' in his personal life.<ref name=Kamen213/> Notably, from the 1640s onwards he sought the advice of a noted cloistered abbess, Sor [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], exchanging many letters with her.<ref name=\"Hume, p\">Hume, p. {{Clarify|date=May 2010}}</ref> This did not stop Philip's becoming known for his numerous affairs, particularly with actresses;<ref name=Wedgwood144/> the most famous of these was his actress-mistress Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Calder\u00f3n (La Calderona),<ref name=Aercke160>Aercke, p. 160.</ref> with whom he had a son in 1629, [[John of Austria the Younger|Juan Jos\u00e9]], who was brought up as a royal prince.<ref name=Kamen217/> By the end of the reign, and with the health of Carlos Jos\u00e9 in doubt, there was a real possibility of Juan Jos\u00e9's claiming the throne, which added to the instability of the regency years.\n\n==Philip, Olivares and his royal favourites==\n[[File:Caspar de Crayer - Philip IV (1605\u20131665) in Parade Armor.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Philip IV of Spain in armor (1627\u201328) by [[Gaspar de Crayer]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n\nDuring the reign of Philip's father, Philip III, the royal court had been dominated by the Sandoval noble family, most strikingly by the [[Duke of Lerma]], Philip III's first favorite and chief minister for almost all of his reign. Philip IV came to power as the influence of the Sandovals was being undermined by a new noble coalition, led by Don [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]. De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga regarded it as essential that the Sandovals be unable to gain influence over the future king; de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga first began to develop his influence over Prince Philip,<ref>Munck, p. 52.</ref> and then introduced his nephew, [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], to the prince, ten years old at the time.<ref name=Parker232>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 232.</ref> At first, Philip did not particularly take to Olivares.<ref name=ElliotRev194>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 194.</ref> Over at least a year, however, the relationship became very close,<ref>Stradling, p. 8.</ref> with Philip's tendency towards underconfidence and diffidence counteracted by Olivares' drive and determination.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Olivares rapidly became Philip's most trusted advisor, and when Philip ascended the throne in 1621, at the age of sixteen, he showed his confidence in Olivares by ordering that all papers requiring the royal signature should first be sent to the count-duke. Philip retained Olivares as his confidant and chief minister for the next twenty years.\n\n[[File:Retrato de Felipe IV, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of a youthful Philip IV in 1623 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], displaying the prominent \"[[Habsburg lip]]\"]]\n\nEarly in his reign, Philip would be woken by Olivares in the morning to discuss the day's affairs<ref name=Parker232/> and would meet with him twice more during the day, although later this routine declined until the king would hold only one short meeting on policy with Olivares each day.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Philip intervened far more in policies during 1641\u201342, however, and it has been suggested that Philip paid more attention to policymaking than has traditionally been depicted; some recent histories go so far as to describe him as 'conscientious' in policymaking,<ref name=\"Elliot47\"/> although he is still criticised for his failure to make timely decisions.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 526.</ref> Philip himself argued that it was hardly appropriate for the king himself go house to house amongst his ministers to see if his instructions were being carried out.<ref>Elliot, ''The Statecraft of Olivares'', p. 121.</ref> The close relationship between Philip and Olivares was demonstrated by their portraits' being placed side by side at the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]] \u2014 an act unheard-of in Europe at the time.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 32.</ref> Philip's relationship with Olivares, however, was not a simplistic one. The pair had many rows and arguments throughout their relationship, both as a result of their different personalities and differences of opinion over policies.<ref>Stradling, p. 83.</ref>\n\nInitially, Philip chose to confirm the reappointment of his father's household to assuage grandee opinion.<ref>Stradling, p. 43.</ref> Under the influence of de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Olivares, however, Philip was then quick to place de Lerma's estates \u2013 expanded considerably during his long period as favourite \u2013 under administration, and to remove from office [[Crist\u00f3bal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda]], de Lerma's son, who had initially helped de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga remove his father from office to advance his position.<ref>Williams, p. 248.</ref> Philip's initial announcements reflected an intent to reform the monarchy to the sober, moral position it had been under his grandfather, including selecting ministers whose grandfathers had served under Philip II.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 234.</ref>\n\n[[File:Count-Duke of Olivares.jpg|thumb|Philip IV's most prominent favourite and minister, the [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke Olivares]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip has, in the past, been considered to be 'unimaginative' in his politics,<ref name=Wedgwood144/> but recent histories have stressed the more radical elements of his first two decades in power. There was a febrile atmosphere in Spain in the early 17th century, with numerous ''arbitrista'' offering various advice on how to solve Spain's various ills; this advice could, and would, be given in person by those of the lower classes to the king on suitable occasions, provided it was presented to strengthen the crown.<ref>Corteguera, p. 134.</ref> Those debates extended to the nature of the monarchy. It has been suggested that the writers of the period who best capture Philip's view of royal authority were Justus Lipsius and Giovanni Botero, who promoted religiously inspired, stoic self-sacrifice and a view of Habsburg family-led hegemony respectively.<ref>Ringrose, p. 320.</ref> While at one level conservative \u2013 harking back in foreign policy to the period of [[King Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]], invoking traditional values at home \u2013 Philip's policies were also radical, rejecting the policy towards the rebellious Dutch that had held since 1609, entering into the [[Thirty Years' War]], and introducing a system of ''junta'', or small committee, government across Spain in competition to the traditional system of royal councils.\n\nFollowing Olivares' fall from power amidst the crisis of 1640\u20131643, the victim of failed policies and jealousy from the nobles excluded from power, Philip initially announced that he would rule alone, becoming in effect his first minister. The ''junta'' system of government began to be dismantled in favor of the older council system. In due course, however, this personal rule reverted to rule through a royal favorite, initially [[Luis de Haro]], a nephew of Olivares and a childhood playmate of Philip's,<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 264.</ref> and the counter-reform of the committee system halted. Historians have not highly regarded de Haro; the comment of one, that de Haro was the 'embodiment of mediocrity,' is not atypical.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\">Polisensky, p. 224.</ref> After de Haro died in 1661, Olivares' son-in-law, the Duke of Medina de las Torres, became a royal favourite in his place.<ref name=Kamen228>Kamen, p. 228.</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy and the Thirty Years' War==\n[[File:Felipe IV de casta\u00f1o y plata, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip IV at the height of his success, painted c. 1631\u201332 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip was to reign through the majority of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, a turbulent period of military history. In Philip III's final years, [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] had convinced him to intervene militarily in [[Bohemia]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] on the side of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. Once Philip himself came to power, he was convinced by de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, appointed his principal foreign minister, and Olivares that he should commit Spain to a more aggressive foreign policy in alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This would lead Philip to renew hostilities with the Dutch in 1621 in an attempt to bring the provinces to the negotiating table to achieve a peace treaty favourable to Spanish global interests. Philip's government would pursue a 'Netherlands first' strategy throughout the war until 1643.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 219.</ref> Despite this shift in policy, Philip does not seem to have been particularly aggressive; early on he noted that having inherited such a large empire, war somewhere across his domains was an inevitable condition,<ref>Kamen, ''Vicissitudes of a World Power'', p. 156.</ref> and he appeared genuinely upset when he came to power and contemplated how much the people of Castile had paid 'in blood' to support the wars of his royal predecessors.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, p. 144.</ref>\n\nThe 1620s were good years for Spanish foreign policy: the war with the Dutch went well, albeit at great expense, culminating in the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|retaking of the key city of Breda]] in 1624. By the end of the decade, however, Philip's government was faced with the question of whether to prioritise the war in Flanders or Spain's relationship with France during the [[War of the Mantuan Succession]] (1628\u20131631). Philip's advisors recommended prioritising the war in Flanders, taking action to safeguard the [[Spanish Road]] to the Netherlands but at the cost of antagonising [[Louis XIII]].<ref>Mackay, p. 5.</ref> Strategically this was to prove a disaster. [[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0429.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philip IV]]Despite recent Spanish successes in the mid-1630s \u2013 in particular, the triumph of Philip's government in raising a new Spanish army, marching it into Germany to defeat the Swedish-led [[Protestant Union|Protestant forces]] at the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] in 1634 \u2013 the increased tensions with France made war between the two Catholic states increasingly inevitable. Olivares advised Philip that the coming war with France would be all or nothing; Spain would win or fall by the result.<ref>Corteguera, p. 143.</ref>\n\nThe [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Spanish-French war]] that ensued from 1635 onwards was not a foregone conclusion. Early Spanish successes threatened Paris, and even after the Spanish defeat at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]], Spain remained a strong opponent. But from 1640 onwards, a period which saw large-scale revolts across Spanish territories in protest against the rising costs of the conflict, Spain was finding it difficult to sustain the war. Philip reacted to the increased French threat by finally abandoning his 'Netherlands first' strategy; resources for the [[Army of Flanders]] were savagely cut, and the fight against the French-supported rebels Catalonia took the priority.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 221.</ref> Shortly after Rocroi, Philip \u2013 now having had to dismiss his favourite, Olivares \u2013 issued instructions to his ambassadors to seek a peace treaty. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], delivered by Olivares' replacement [[Luis de Haro]], resolved the long-running [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands and the wars in Germany, but the conflict with France dragged on. Philip responded to the perceived weakness of France during the [[Fronde]] rebellions of 1648 by continuing the fight; he took personal responsibility for the decision to start anew, and ultimately successful, the offensive against the French in Catalonia in 1651.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 539.</ref> True victory over France never emerged, however, and by 1658, after the loss of [[Dunkirk]] to an Anglo-French force, Philip was personally desperate for peace.<ref>Kamen, p. 222.</ref> The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, and the marriage of Philip's daughter [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]] to the young [[King Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\">Ishikawa, p. 77.</ref> finally brought the war with France to a conclusion. The war against Portugal continued, however, as Philip fruitlessly attempted to regain control over his lost kingdom.\n\n==Philip and the Spanish military==\n[[File:Felipe IV; Rey de Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip dressed as a [[cuirassier]], accompanied by a [[court dwarf]], by [[Caspar de Crayer|Gaspar de Crayer]]]]\nBy the late 1620s, the Spanish army was no longer as dominant on the battlefield as it once had been. The feared ''[[tercio]]'' regiments, composed of well-disciplined [[pikemen]], were increasingly appearing inflexible and old-fashioned in the face of the new Swedish and Dutch formations with a higher proportion of [[musketeers]]. Philip and Olivares attempted to address the perceived weaknesses of the army, which they concluded were primarily due to the ''falta de cabezas'', or a lack of leadership. In keeping with their wider agenda of renewing the concepts of duty, service, and aristocratic tradition, the king agreed to efforts to introduce more grandees into the higher ranks of the military, working hard to overcome the reluctance of many to take up field appointments in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] and elsewhere.<ref name=Parker102>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 101-103.</ref>\n\nThe results were not entirely as hoped. The grandees dragooned into service in this way were disinclined to spend years learning the standard professional military skillset; they wished 'to start as generals and soldiers on the same day,' to quote one disgruntled career soldier.{{Who|date=July 2010}} By the 1630s, the king was waiving the usual rules to enable promotion to higher ranks on a shorter timescale, and having to pay significantly inflated salaries to get grandees to take up even these appointments.<ref name=Parker102/> The performance of these officers at battles such as [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] left much to be desired.\n\nPhilip was also notable for his interest in the Spanish ''[[Spanish Navy|armada]]'', or navy. Shortly after taking power, he began to increase the size of his fleets, rapidly doubling the size of the naval budget from the start of his reign, then tripling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 45.</ref> Philip is credited with a 'sensible, pragmatic approach' to provisioning and controlling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 32.</ref> He was prepared to involve himself in considerable details of naval policy; he was commenting on the detail of provisions for the ''armada'' in 1630, for example.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 157.</ref> The ''Junta de Armadas'' was the only ''junta'' committee to survive the fall of Olivares intact.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 34.</ref> Even after the disastrous [[Battle of the Downs]], Philip remained closely interested in his navy, including ensuring ministerial attention. In 1646, de Haro was personally involved in supplying and equipping the Atlantic fleet from [[Cadiz]]. Throughout the period, there was no 'weakening of the importance attached to naval forces'<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 156.</ref> by the king, who argued that joint land and naval operations were essential. Some of his conclusions on naval policy were quite advanced: after the peace of 1648, Philip argued that the Dutch fleets off the Spanish peninsula were good for trade, despite concerns from his senior officials, since they protected the English and French navies.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy and the crisis of the monarchy==\n{{House of Habsburg (Spain)}}\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain.jpg|thumb|left|An older Philip IV, painted in 1656 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip had inherited a huge [[Spanish Empire|empire]] from his father, spanning the known world, but many of his most difficult challenges as king would stem from domestic problems in Spain itself. Spain in the early 17th century was a collection of possessions \u2013 the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the autonomous provinces of [[Catalonia]] and [[Andalusia]], complete with the wider provinces of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Milan]] etc. \u2013 all loosely joined together through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip IV.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 61.</ref> Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than that in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces. This loose system had successfully resisted reform and higher taxation before, ironically resulting in Spain's having had historically, up until the 1640s at least, fewer than the usual number of fiscal revolts for an early modern European state.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nIn the first years of his reign, heavily influenced by his royal favourite Olivares, Philip focused on efforts to reform the most chaotic aspects of this system. Frustrated by the notorious slowness of the system of royal councils, Philip supported Olivares' establishment of ''juntas'' \u2013 small committees designed to circumvent the more formal system and to enact policies quickly. Although successful, these ''juntas'' excluded many of the traditional grandees and caused resentment.<ref name=Munck53>Munck, p. 53.</ref> Olivares put forward the idea of a ''Uni\u00f3n de Armas'', or '[[Union of Arms]].' This would have involved establishing a force of 140,000 paid soldiers, supported by equitable taxes from across the Empire, and has been termed 'the most far-sighted proposal of any statesman of the age';<ref>Anderson, p. 44.</ref> in practice. However, it met fierce opposition from the various regional assemblies and the plan was withdrawn. During the 1620s, again influenced by a desire to reform Spanish life for the better, Philip also passed important legislation with puritanical overtones. In 1623, he closed all the legal [[brothel]]s in Spain, extended the dormant [[sumptuary law]]s on luxury goods and supported [[Pope|Papal]] efforts to regulate priests' sexual behaviour more tightly.<ref>Haliczer, p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional - 108085 - Cent\u00e9n segoviano de 1633 01.jpg|thumb|Large gold coin minted in 1633, under the reign of Philip IV]]\n\nPhilip had clear intentions to try to control the Spanish currency, which had become increasingly unstable during the reign of his father and grandfather, but in practice, inflation soared.<ref name=Kamen228/> Partly this was because in 1627 Olivares had attempted to deal with the problem of Philip's [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers \u2013 who had proved uncooperative in recent years \u2013 by declaring a state bankruptcy.<ref>Munck, p. 55.</ref> With the Genoese debt now removed, Olivares hoped to turn to indigenous bankers for renewed funds. In practice, the plan was a disaster. The [[Spanish treasure fleet]] of 1628 was captured by the Dutch, and Spain's ability to borrow and transfer money across Europe declined sharply.\n\nBy the 1630s, Philip's domestic policies were being increasingly impacted by the financial pressures of the Thirty Years' War, and in particular the growing war with France. The costs of the war were huge, and while they had largely fallen upon Castile, the ability of the crown to raise more funds and men from this source was increasingly limited.<ref name=Munck53/> Philip and his government were desperately trying to reduce the responsibilities of the central government in response to the overstretch of the war, and various reform ideas that might have been pursued during the 1620s were rejected on this basis.<ref>Parker, 2005,{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} p. 81.</ref> Financial restraints and higher taxes were put in place, but Philip was increasingly selling off [[Regalian right|regalian]] and [[feudal]] rights, along with much of the royal estate to fund the conflict.<ref>Anderson, p. 72.</ref> It has been argued that the fiscal stringencies of the 1630s, combined with the strength and role of Olivares and the ''juntas'', effectively cut Philip off from the three traditional pillars of support for the monarchy: the grandees, the Church and the Council of Castile.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\">Stradling, p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe crisis came in 1640. An attempt by Olivares to intervene in Catalonia to deal with the French invasion threat resulted in revolt. An alliance of Catalan rebels and French royal forces proved challenging to suppress, and in trying to mobilise Portuguese noble support for the war, Olivares triggered a second uprising. [[Lisbon]]'s nobles expelled Philip, and gave the throne to the [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]], marking the end of sixty years of the [[Iberian Union]] and the beginning of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. The next year, the [[Dukes of Medina Sidonia#9th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]] attempted another [[Andalusian independentist conspiracy (1641)|rebellion against Philip from Andalusia]], possibly attempting to reproduce the Braganzas' success in Portugal.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 8.</ref> Although Philip and Olivares were able to repress the ducal revolt, Philip had found himself increasingly isolated. On his return from Zaragoza, where he had been commanding the army, he found only one of the Castilian nobility arrived at court on Easter Day 1641. The threat of Philip's being deposed by the grandees of Castile seemed increasingly real.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 262-263.</ref>\n\nMuch shaken by events, Philip's solution was to remove his royal favourite Olivares from office in 1643 in an attempt to compromise with the Spanish elite. He announced he would rule alone, rejecting both the concept of a royal favourite as first minister and the system of ''junta'' government, which he began to dismantle in favour of the older system of royal councils.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\"/> Clemency was shown to the Duke of Medina Sidonia. The situation began to stabilise, and before long, Philip felt secure enough to revert to his preferred method of government. [[Luis de Haro]], Olivares' nephew, took over as favourite and minister, and the counter-reform of the ''juntas'' halted. The spark of reform from Philip's earlier years never returned, however. The Catalan rebellion dragged on for several years. In 1652, the Spanish army retook [[Barcelona]], and Philip issued an amnesty for the rebels, promising to respect traditional customs and rights in the future.<ref>Zagorin, p. 37.</ref>\n\n==Patronage of the arts==\n[[File:Lecci\u00f3n de equitaci\u00f3n del pr\u00edncipe Baltasar Carlos, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|[[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Prince Baltasar Carlos]] with the [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke of Olivares]] outside the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1636]]\n\nPhilip has been remembered both for the 'astonishing enthusiasm' with which he collected art<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]. {{cite episode | title = The Mystical North | episodelink = | series = Art of Spain | serieslink = Art of Spain (TV series) | airdate = 2008-02-14 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> and for his love of theatre. On the stage, he favoured [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]], and other distinguished dramatists. Philip has been credited with a share in the composition of several comedies. Court theatre used [[Theatrical scenery|perspective scenery]], a new invention from Italy not used in commercial theatre at the time. Some writers have likened the illusion of Baroque royal theatre to the illusion of kingly power the performances were designed to reinforce.<ref>Robbins, p. 27-28.</ref> Some recent scholarship has suggested that Philip's financial sponsorship of playwrights, however, may have been less extensive than once thought.<ref name=Aercke160/>\n\nArtistically, Philip became famous for his patronage of his court painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], who originated from [[Seville]];<ref>Stevenson, p. 10.</ref> mutual contacts caused him to become known to Olivares, who came from the same region. Vel\u00e1zquez was summoned to Madrid by the king in 1624.<ref>Stevenson, p. 11.</ref> Despite some jealousy from the existing court painters, Vel\u00e1zquez rapidly became a success with Philip, being retained for the rest of his career until his death, painting a celebration of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] for Philip. The king and Vel\u00e1zquez shared common interests in horses, dogs, and art, and in private they formed an easy, relaxed relationship over the years.<ref name=\"Stevenson, p. 7\"/> Philip supported a number of other prominent painters, including [[Eugenio Cax\u00e9s]], [[Vincenzo Carducci|Vicente Carducho]], [[Gonzales Coques|Gonzales]] and [[Angelo Nardi (painter)|Nardi]]. Philip obtained paintings from across Europe, especially Italy, accumulating over 4,000 by the time of his death; some have termed this unparalleled assemblage a 'mega-collection.' <ref>Ishikawa, p. 72.</ref>\n\nPhilip was nicknamed ''el Rey Planeta'', the 'Planet King',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\">Robbins, p. 27.</ref> by his contemporaries, and much of the art and display at his court has been interpreted in the context of his need to project power and authority, over both Spaniards and foreigners alike.<ref name=Aercke142>Aercke, p. 142.</ref> Older interpretations, which perceived Philip's court as being completely decadent, have been largely superseded, but the art and symbolism of the period certainly did not reflect the wider threat and decline of Spanish power.<ref name=Aercke140/> Indeed, the limited Spanish military successes of the period were celebrated by royal artists to a disproportionate extent. Numerous artists from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] produced work extolling the [[Army of Flanders]], including [[Sebastian Vrancx|Vrancx]], [[Peter Snayers|Snaeyers]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer|Molenaer]] and [[Willem Hondius|de Hondt]]. The [[Siege of Breda (1624)|re-capture of Breda]] alone resulted in major works by Vel\u00e1zquez and the French etcher [[Jacques Callot]], in addition to various plays and books.<ref name=Parker102/>\n\nThe 'Planet King' also invested in a new palace to display both his art and the ritual of court. Through Olivares, Philip commenced the building of the ''[[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]]'' in Madrid, parts of which remain near the [[Prado museum|Prado]]. Work began modestly in 1631,<ref name=Aercke142/> with the magnificent, if costly, 'Hall of Thrones', completed by 1635.<ref name=Aercke140/> The palace included its own 'theatre, ballroom, galleries, bull ring, gardens, and artificial lakes',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\"/> and became the centre for artists and dramatists from across Europe. The palace was built during one of the more difficult periods of Philip's reign. Given both its cost, in a time of stringent wartime savings, and the protest that ensued from a disgruntled public,<ref>Haliczar, p. 26.</ref> it is considered to have been an important part of the attempt to communicate royal grandeur and authority.{{by whom|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Philip and religion==\n[[File:Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas de Agreda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a religious advisor to Philip IV during the second half of his reign]]\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Catholic religion]] and its rituals played an important part in Philip's life, especially towards the end of his reign. Depressed by events across his domains, he became increasingly concerned with religious affairs.<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\"/> In particular, Philip paid special devotions to a painting of the ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Milagro'', the [[Virgin of Miracles]]; the painting was said to miraculously rise and lower its eyes in response to prayer. While married to [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth]], Philip had placed their children under the protection of this image, married to [[Mariana of Austria|Mariana]], they undertook special religious ceremonies together under the gaze of the painting. Philip also had a large standard made with the image of the painting on one side and the royal coat of arms on the other, brought out in processions each year on 12 July.<ref>Goodman, ''Conspicuous In Her Absence'', p. 169-170.</ref> As well as marking a strong personal religious belief, this increasingly visible link between the crown, the Church and national symbols such as the Virgin of Miracles, represented a key pillar of support for Philip as king.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\"/>\n\nMonarchs during the period also had a key role in the [[canonization]] process and could utilise this for domestic or international political effect. Philip, for example, keen to reach out to his Portuguese subjects, put his considerable influence behind the case for [[Elizabeth of Aragon|Isabella of Portugal]], a 14th-century role model of a 'perfect wife,' to great effect, ultimately paying for a lavish celebration in Lisbon after her canonisation in 1625. Internationally, it was important for Spanish prestige for her to receive at least a proportionate, and ideally greater, the share of new saints than other Catholic kingdoms, and Philip sponsored a flurry of texts and books supporting Spain's candidates, particularly in competition with Catholic France.<ref>Haliczer, p. 34-36.</ref>\n[[File:Velazquez-FelipIVVersalles.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Philip in France for his daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]]]]\n\nDuring the emergency of 1640\u20131643, Philip appears to have had a crisis of faith. Philip genuinely believed the success or failure of his policies represented God's favour and judgement on his actions.<ref name=Haliczer27>Haliczer, p. 27.</ref> The combination of the revolts, the French advances, and the loss of his trusted favourite Olivares appears to have deeply shaken him. Queen Isabella and the new president of the [[Council of Castile]], Don Juan Chumacero \u2013 both involved in the removal of Olivares \u2013 encouraged the king to invite [[Mysticism|mystics]] and visionaries from across Europe to his court at [[Zaragoza]]. The mystics' principal advice centred on the importance of the king's rejecting Olivares' replacement, de Haro and the remaining pro-Olivares nobles at court.<ref name=Haliczer26>Haliczer, p. 26.</ref> The various mystics were not acceptable to broader Spanish noble opinion and, with de Haro's encouragement, they were ultimately dismissed.<ref name=Haliczer27/>\n\nInstead, Philip turned to a better established female mystic, Sister [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a prioress known for her religious writings.<ref name=Haliczer27/> He asked her to correspond with him and to advise him in spiritual matters. The two became regular correspondents throughout the remainder of their lives.

The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', immediately after Australia's [[History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883#Australia win in England 1882|1882 victory]] at [[The Oval]], its first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".<ref>{{cite book | author=Wendy Lewis | author-link=Wendy Lewis | author2=Simon Balderstone | author3=John Bowan | last-author-amp=yes | title=Events That Shaped Australia | page=75 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}</ref> The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the [[History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883#Bligh reclaims the Ashes 1882/3|1882\u201383 series played in Australia]], before which the English captain [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] had vowed to \"regain those ashes\". The English media therefore dubbed the tour ''the quest to regain the Ashes''.\n\nAfter England had won two of the three Tests on the tour, a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of [[Melbourne]] women including [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], whom Bligh married within a year.<ref name=events>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63185850 Summary of Events] ''[[The Illustrated Australian News]]'', 20 February 1884, (foot of column 2) at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref> The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden [[bail (cricket)|bail]], and were humorously described as \"the ashes of Australian cricket\".<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12673335 Cricket] ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]]'', 4 June 1908, p.8, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref> It is not clear whether that \"tiny silver urn\" is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] by Bligh's widow after his death in 1927.\n\n[[The Ashes urn|The urn]] has never been the official trophy of the Ashes series, having been a personal gift to Bligh.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ashes History|url=http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-history/the-ashes|publisher=Lords|access-date=21 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009142619/https://www.lords.org/history/mcc-history/the-ashes/|archive-date=9 October 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, [[replica]]s of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an Ashes series. Since the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1998\u201399|1998\u201399 Ashes series]], a [[Waterford Crystal]] representation of the Ashes urn (called the Ashes Trophy) has been presented to the winners of an Ashes series as the official trophy of that series. Irrespective of which side holds the tournament, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at [[Lord's]]; it has however been taken to Australia to be put on touring display on two occasions: as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, and to accompany the [[English cricket team in Australia in 2006\u201307|Ashes series in 2006\u201307]].\n\nAn Ashes series is traditionally of five Tests, hosted in turn by England and Australia at least once every two years. There have been 71 Ashes series: Australia have won 33, England 32 and six series have been drawn.\n\n==1882 origins==\n{{main|Australian cricket team in England in 1882}}\n[[File:Ranji 1897 page 143 F. R. Spofforth, the demon bowler.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fred Spofforth]], \"The Demon Bowler\", was instrumental in Australia's 1882 victory over England with 14 wickets for 90.]]\nThe first [[Test cricket|Test match]] between England and Australia was played in [[Melbourne]], Australia, [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876\u201377|in 1877]], though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. On their [[Australian cricket team in England and the United States in 1882|tour of England]] that year the Australians played just one Test, at [[the Oval]] in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult [[Cricket pitch|wicket]].<ref>Fred Spofforth, however, contended that, the fourth innings aside, it played perfectly well.</ref> Australia made a mere 63 runs in its first [[innings]], and England, led by [[A. N. Hornby]], took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In its second innings, Australia, boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from [[Hugh Massie]], managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win. The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler [[Fred Spofforth]], spurred on by the [[gamesmanship]] of his opponents, in particular [[W. G. Grace]], refused to give in. \"This thing can be done,\" he declared. Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory.\n\nWhen [[Ted Peate]], England's last batsman, came to the crease, his side needed just ten runs to win, but Peate managed only two before he was bowled by [[Harry Boyle (cricketer)|Harry Boyle]]. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil. When it finally sank in, the crowd swarmed onto the field, cheering loudly and chairing Boyle and Spofforth to the pavilion.\n\nWhen Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner, [[Charles Studd]] (one of the best batsman in England, having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists), to get the runs. Peate humorously replied, \"I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n|first=Jack\n|last=Worrall\n|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83580262\n|title=A Great Bowlers' Victory\n|page=11 \n|newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] \n|location=Perth, WA |date=23 August 1930 \n|accessdate=25 August 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe momentous defeat was widely recorded in the British press, which praised the Australians for their plentiful \"pluck\" and berated the Englishmen for their lack thereof. A celebrated poem appeared in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' on Saturday, 9 September. The first verse, quoted most frequently, reads:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nWell done, [[wikt:cornstalk|Cornstalks]]!

It read:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn Affectionate Remembrance\nof\nENGLISH CRICKET,\nwhich died at the Oval\non\n29 August 1882,\nDeeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing\nfriends and acquaintances\n\nR.I.P.\n\nN.B.\u2014The body will be cremated and the\nashes taken to Australia.\n}}\n\n[[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] promised that on [[English cricket team in Australia in 1882\u201383|1882\u201383 tour of Australia]], he would, as England's captain, \"recover those Ashes\". He spoke of them several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term \"the Ashes\" largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series, at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when [[George Giffen]], in his memoirs (''With Bat and Ball'', 1899), used the term as if it were well known.<ref>Gibson, A., ''Cricket Captains of England'', p. 26.</ref>\n\nThe true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]] took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain \"the ashes\". As had been the case on Bligh's tour 20 years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term and, this time, it stuck. Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled ''How We Recovered the Ashes''. Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend. The first mention of \"the Ashes\" in [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] occurs in 1905, while ''Wisden'''s first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition.\n\n==Urn==\n{{Main|The Ashes urn}}\n[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest published photo of [[the Ashes urn]], from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 1921]]\n[[File:Rupertswood mansion side angle shot.jpg|thumb|[[Rupertswood]] outside Melbourne, where the urn was presented to Bligh]]\nAs it took many years for the name \"The Ashes\" to be given to ongoing series between England and Australia, there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners. As late as 1925 the following verse appeared in ''The Cricketers Annual'':\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nSo here's to Chapman, Hendren and Hobbs,\nGilligan, Woolley and Hearne\nMay they bring back to the Motherland,\nThe ashes which have no urn!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, several attempts had been made to embody the Ashes in a physical memorial. Examples include one presented to Warner in 1904, another to Australian captain M. A. Noble in 1909, and another to Australian captain W. M. Woodfull in 1934.\n\nThe oldest, and the one to enjoy enduring fame, was the one presented to Bligh, later Lord Darnley, during the 1882\u201383 tour. The precise nature of the origin of [[The Ashes urn|this urn]] is matter of dispute. Based on a statement by Darnley in 1894, it was believed that a group of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] ladies, including Darnley's later wife [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], made the presentation after the victory in the Third Test in 1883. More recent researchers, in particular Ronald Willis<ref>{{Cite book| first=Ronald | last=Willis | title=Cricket's Biggest Mystery: The Ashes | isbn=0-7270-1768-3}}</ref> and Joy Munns<ref>{{Cite book| first=Joy | last=Munns | title=Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The birthplace of the Ashes | isbn=0-646-22153-1}}</ref> have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over Christmas 1882 when the English team were guests of [[Sir William John Clarke|Sir William Clarke]], at his property \"[[Rupertswood]]\", in [[Sunbury, Victoria]]. This was before the matches had started. The prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of Clarke.\n\nIn August 1926 Ivo Bligh (now Lord Darnley) displayed the Ashes urn at the ''[[Morning Post]]'' Decorative Art Exhibition held in the Central Hall, Westminster. He made the following statement about how he was given the urn:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58247421?searchTerm=darnley%20cricket%20ashes&searchLimits= |title=Sunday Times (Perth) 15 August 1926 page 9S.

England won two out of the three matches played against Murdoch's Australian Eleven, and after the third match some Melbourne ladies put some ashes into a small urn and gave them to me as captain of the English Eleven.}}\n\nA more detailed account of how the Ashes were given to Ivo Bligh was outlined by his wife, the Countess of Darnley, in 1930 during a speech at a cricket luncheon. Her speech was reported by the London Times as follows:<ref>The Times (London), 27 June 1930. page 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In 1882, she said, it was first spoken of when the Sporting Times, after the Australians had thoroughly beaten the English at the Oval, wrote an obituary in affectionate memory of English cricket \"whose demise was deeply lamented and the body would be cremated and taken to Australia\". Her husband, then Ivo Bligh, took a team to Australia in the following year. Punch had a poem containing the words \"When Ivo comes back with the urn\" and when Ivo Bligh wiped out the defeat Lady Clarke, wife of Sir W. J. Clarke, who entertained the English so lavishly, found a little wooden urn, burnt a bail, put the ashes in the urn, and wrapping it in a red velvet bag, put it into her husband's (Ivo Bligh's) hands. He had always regarded it as a great treasure.}}\n\nThere is another statement which is not totally clear made by Lord Darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn. He was interviewed in his home at Cobham Hall by Montague Grover and the report of this interview was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm=%22cobham%20hall%22%20urn&searchLimits=l-decade=192 |title=Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1.

The report of this statement in the Brisbane Courier was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21053463?searchTerm=darnley%20ashes%20urn&searchLimits=l-decade=192|title=Brisbane Courier, 9 June 1926, page 7.

Though the team did not win, the urn containing the ashes was sent to him just before leaving Melbourne.}}\n\nThe contents of the urn are also problematic; they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump, bail or the outer casing of a ball, but in 1998 Darnley's 82-year-old daughter-in-law said they were the remains of her mother-in-law's veil, casting a further layer of doubt on the matter. However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now \"95% certain\" that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail. Speaking on Channel Nine TV on 25 November 2006, he said x-rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked, and repair work had to be carried out. The urn is made of [[terracotta]] and is about {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall and may originally have been a perfume jar.\n\n[[File:Ashes song.jpg|thumb|The full version of the song from the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', the fourth verse of which is pasted onto the urn]]\nA label containing a six-line verse is pasted on the urn. This is the fourth verse of a song-lyric published in the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'' on 1 February 1883:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nWhen [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo]] goes back with the urn, the urn;\n[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A G Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;\nThe [[wikt:make the welkin ring|welkin]] will ring loud,\nThe great crowd will feel proud,\nSeeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;\nAnd the rest coming home with the urn.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn February 1883, just before the disputed Fourth Test, a velvet bag made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of [[Dublin]], was given to Bligh to contain the urn. During Darnley's lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn, and no record of a published photograph exists before 1921.  ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' published this photo in January 1921 (shown above). When Darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes. MCC first displayed the urn in the Long Room at [[Lord's]] and since 1953 in the MCC Cricket Museum at the ground. MCC's wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy. It is in fact a private memento, and for this reason it is never awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match.\n\nBecause the urn itself is so delicate, it has been allowed to travel to Australia only twice. The first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations; the second was for the 2006/7 Ashes series.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6052544.stm | title=Ashes urn heads to Australia |work=BBC Sport  | date=15 October 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}</ref> The urn arrived on 17 October 2006, going on display at the [[Museum of Sydney]]. It then toured to other states, with the final appearance at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery on 21 January 2007.\n\nIn the 1990s, given Australia's long dominance of the Ashes and the popular acceptance of the Darnley urn as \"the Ashes\", the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC would not agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the [[Earl of Darnley|Earldom of Darnley]], argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.\n\nAs a compromise, the MCC commissioned a larger replica of the urn in [[Waterford Crystal]], known as the Ashes Trophy, to award to the winning team of each series starting with the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1998\u201399|1998\u201399 Ashes]].<ref>[http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy/ \"What is the Ashes Trophy?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910205923/http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy |date=10 September 2013 }}, Lord's website.

Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by [[Result (cricket)|nine wickets]], but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have \"won back the Ashes\" 2\u20131. A fourth match was played, against a \"United Australian XI\", which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 1882\u201383 series. It \"is\" counted as a Test, but as a standalone. This match ended in a victory for Australia.\n\n===1884 to 1896===\nAfter Bligh's victory, there was an extended period of English dominance. The tours generally had fewer Tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, the first five-Test series taking place only in 1894\u201395. England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.\n\nThere was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 1887\u201388, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking its first series win since 1882 with a 2\u20131 victory in 1891\u201392. But England dominated, winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes.\n\nThe [[English cricket team in Australia in 1894-95|1894\u201395]] series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on. Australia had scored a massive 586 ([[Syd Gregory]] 201, [[George Giffen]] 161) and then dismissed England for 325. But England responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed Australia for 166 with [[Bobby Peel]] taking 6 for 67. At the close of the second last day's play, Australia were 113\u20132, needing only 64 more runs. But heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left-arm bowlers, Peel and [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], were all but unplayable. England went on to win the series 3\u20132 after it had been all square before the Final Test, which England won by 6 wickets. The English heroes were Peel, with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70, and [[Tom Richardson (cricketer)|Tom Richardson]], with 32 at 26.53.\n\nIn 1896 England under the captaincy of [[W. G. Grace]] won the series 2\u20131, and this marked the end of England's longest period of Ashes dominance.\n\n===1897 to 1902===\nAustralia resoundingly won the 1897\u201398 series by 4\u20131 under the captaincy of [[Harry Trott]]. His successor [[Joe Darling]] won the next three series in 1899, 1901\u201302 and the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|classic 1902 series]], which became one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket.\n\nFive matches were played in 1902 but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather. In the First Test (the first played at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]), after scoring 376 England bowled out Australia for 36 ([[Wilfred Rhodes]] 7/17) and reduced them to 46\u20132 when they followed on. Australia won the Third and Fourth Tests at [[Bramall Lane]] and [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] respectively. At Old Trafford, Australia won by just 3 runs after [[Victor Trumper]] had scored 104 on a \"bad wicket\", reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day. England won the last Test at [[The Oval]] by one wicket. Chasing 263 to win, it slumped to 48\u20135 before [[Gilbert Jessop|Jessop's]] 104 gave them a chance. He reached his hundred in just 75 minutes. The last-wicket pair of [[George Herbert Hirst|George Hirst]] and Rhodes were required to score 15 runs for victory. When Rhodes joined him, Hirst reportedly said: \"We'll get them in singles, Wilfred.\" In fact, they scored thirteen singles and a two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152487.html|title=Wisden \u2013 The glorious uncertainty|author=|date=|website=espncricinfo.com}}</ref>\n\nThe period of Darling's captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding Australian players such as Trumper, [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[James Kelly (cricketer)|James Kelly]], [[Monty Noble]], [[Clem Hill]], [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]].\n\n===Reviving the legend===\nAfter what the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903\u201304. England won it against the odds, and [[Plum Warner]], the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book ''How We Recovered The Ashes''.<ref>[[Plum Warner]], ''How We Recovered The Ashes'', Longman, 1905</ref> The title of this book revived the Ashes legend and it was after this that England v Australia series were customarily referred to as \"The Ashes\".\n\n===1905 to 1912===\nEngland and Australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Five more series took place between 1905 and 1912. In 1905 England's captain [[Stanley Jackson]] not only won the series 2\u20130, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Monty Noble led Australia to victory in both 1907\u201308 and 1909. Then England won in 1911\u201312 by four matches to one. [[Jack Hobbs]] establishing himself as England's first-choice opening batsman with three centuries, while [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] (32 wickets at 21.62) and [[Sydney Barnes]] (34 wickets at 22.88) formed a formidable bowling partnership.\n\nEngland retained the Ashes when it won the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], which also featured [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The Australian touring party had been severely weakened by a [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|dispute]] between the board and players that caused [[Clem Hill]], [[Victor Trumper]], Warwick Armstrong, [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Sammy Carter]] and [[Vernon Ransford]] to be omitted.<ref>Harte, pp. 251\u2013256.</ref>\n\n===1920 to 1933===\nAfter the war, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. For the first time, the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]] crippled the English batting on a regular basis. Australia recorded overwhelming victories both in England and on home soil. It won the first eight matches in succession including a 5\u20130 [[whitewash (sport)|whitewash]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920-21|1920\u20131921]] at the hands of Warwick Armstrong's team.\n\nThe ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.\n\n[[File:Herbert Sutcliffe 1924.jpg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Sutcliffe]] sweeps [[Arthur Mailey]] during the first Ashes Test in Sydney, 1924.]]\nEngland won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.<ref>Harte, pp. 274\u2013276.</ref><ref name=auslist>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru \u2013 Australia \u2013 Tests \u2013 Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn a rain-hit series in 1926, England managed to eke out a 1\u20130 victory with a win in the final Test at The Oval. Because the series was at stake, the match was to be \"timeless\", i.e., played to a finish. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22. Jack Hobbs and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] took the score to 49\u20130 at the end of the second day, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight, and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket. England seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match. In spite of the very difficult batting conditions, however, Hobbs and Sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and England won the game comfortably.<ref>Harte, pp. 298\u2013301.</ref> Australian captain [[Herbie Collins]] was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level, and some accused him of throwing the match.\n\nAustralia's ageing post-war team broke up after 1926, with Collins, [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Warren Bardsley]] all departing, and Gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928\u201329 series.\n\nDespite the debut of [[Donald Bradman]], the inexperienced Australians, led by [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], were heavily defeated, losing 4\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 312\u2013316.</ref> England had a very strong batting side, with [[Wally Hammond]] contributing 905 runs at an average of 113.12, and Hobbs, Sutcliffe and [[Patsy Hendren]] all scoring heavily; the bowling was more than adequate, without being outstanding.\n\nIn 1930, [[Bill Woodfull]] led an extremely inexperienced team to England.\n\nBradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 139.14, which remains a world record Test series aggregate. A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying \"I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia.\"<ref name=\"Don Bradman on australianscreen online\">{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/1930-australian-xi-ashes/|title=Don Bradman in 'The 1930 Australian XI: Winners of the Ashes' |website=Aso.gov.au|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> In the [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] Test, he made 334, reaching 309* at the end of the first day, including a century before lunch. Bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match, at [[Lord's]], was a better innings. England managed to stay in contention until the deciding final Test at The Oval, but yet another double hundred by Bradman, and 7/92 by [[Percy Hornibrook]] in England's second innings, enabled Australia to win by an innings and take the series 2\u20131. [[Clarrie Grimmett]]'s 29 wickets at 31.89 for Australia in this high-scoring series were also important.\n\nAustralia had one of the strongest batting line-ups ever in the early 1930s, with Bradman, [[Archie Jackson]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Bill Woodfull]] and [[Bill Ponsford]]. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England's 1932\u201333 captain [[Douglas Jardine]] to adopt the tactic of fast [[leg theory]], better known as [[Bodyline]].\n\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a ball from [[Harold Larwood]] with [[Bodyline]] field settings.]]\n\nJardine instructed his [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]], most notably [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked [[leg side|leg-side]] field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it \"leg theory\" but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it \"Bodyline\" (from \"on the line of the body\"). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4\u20131, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] eventually changed the [[Laws of cricket]] to curtail the number of leg side fielders.\n\nJardine's comment was: \"I've not travelled 6,000 miles to make friends. I'm here to win the Ashes\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Top 50 British achievements | first=Patrick | last=Kidd | date=4 September 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821160249/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | archivedate=21 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome of the Australians wanted to use Bodyline in retaliation, but Woodfull flatly refused. He famously told England manager [[Pelham Warner]], \"There are two teams out there.

It should be borne in mind that Tests in Australia prior to the war were all played to a finish. Many batting records were set in this period.\n\nThe 1934 Ashes series began with the notable absence of Larwood, Voce and Jardine. The MCC had made it clear, in light of the revelations of the bodyline series, that these players would not face Australia.

Larwood was forced by the MCC to either apologise or be removed from the Test side. He went for the latter.\n\nAustralia recovered the Ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953, though no Test cricket was played during the Second World War.\n\nAs in 1930, the 1934 series was decided in the final Test at The Oval. Australia, batting first, posted a massive 701 in the first innings. Bradman (244) and Ponsford (266) were in record-breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket. England eventually faced a massive 707-run target for victory and failed, Australia winning the series 2\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 356\u2013357.</ref> This made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes and he retired upon his return to Australia.\n\nIn 1936\u201337 Bradman succeeded Woodfull as Australian captain. He started badly, losing the first two Tests heavily after Australia were caught on [[sticky wicket]]s. However, the Australians fought back and Bradman won his first series in charge 3\u20132.\n\nThe 1938 series was a high-scoring affair with two high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1\u20131 result, Australia retaining the Ashes. After the first two matches ended in stalemate and the Third Test at Old Trafford never started due to rain. Australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low-scoring match at Headingley to retain the urn. In the timeless Fifth Test at The Oval, the highlight was [[Len Hutton]]'s then world-record score of 364 as England made 903-7 declared. Bradman and [[Jack Fingleton]] injured themselves during Hutton's marathon effort, and with only nine men, Australia fell to defeat by an innings and 579 runs,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/6109836.stm Classic Ashes clashes \u2013 1938, The Oval] at [[BBC Sport]], 5 November 2006. Accessed 4 March 2006</ref> the heaviest in Test history.\n\nThe Ashes resumed after the war when England toured in 1946\u201347 and, as in 1920\u201321, found that Australia had made the better post-war recovery. Still captained by Bradman and now featuring the potent new-ball partnership of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], Australia was convincing 3\u20130 winners.\n\nAged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to [[Jack Ikin]]; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain's favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era.\n\nIn 1948 Australia set new standards, completely outplaying its hosts to win 4\u20130 with one draw. This [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team]], led by Bradman, who turned 40 during his final tour of England, has gone down in history as ''The Invincibles''. Playing 34 matches on tour\u2014three of which were not first-class\u2014and including the five Tests, they remained unbeaten, winning 27 and drawing 7.\n\nBradman's men were greeted by packed crowds across the country, and records for Test attendances in England were set in the [[Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Second]] and [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Tests]] at Lord's and Headingley respectively. Before a record attendance of spectators at Headingley, Australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven-wicket victory.\n\nThe 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman played his final innings for Australia in the [[Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fifth Test]] at The Oval, needing to score only four runs to end with a career [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of exactly 100. However, Bradman made a second-ball duck, bowled by an [[Eric Hollies]] googly<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/8036237.stm 1948 \u2013 Bradman's final innings duck] at [[BBC Sport]], 27 May 2009. Accessed 4 March 2015</ref> that sent him into retirement with a career average of 99.94.\n\nBradman was succeeded as Australian captain by [[Lindsay Hassett]], who led the team to a 4\u20131 series victory in 1950\u201351. The series was not as one-sided as the number of wins suggest, with several tight matches.\n\nThe tide finally turned in 1953 when England won the final Test at The Oval to take the series 1\u20130, having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding Test at Headingley. This was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in English cricket history with players such as captain Len Hutton, batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Tom Graveney]], [[Colin Cowdrey]], bowlers [[Fred Trueman]], [[Brian Statham]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Tony Lock]], wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] and all-rounder [[Trevor Bailey]].\n\n===1954 to 1971===\n[[File:Peter May.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] driving [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] on his way to a century at Sydney.]]\nIn [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|1954\u201355]], Australia's batsmen had no answer to the pace of [[Frank Tyson]] and Statham. After winning the First Test by an innings after being controversially sent in by Hutton, Australia lost its way and England took a hat-trick of victories to win the series 3\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 435\u2013437.</ref>\n\nA dramatic series in 1956 saw a record that will probably never be beaten: off-spinner [[Jim Laker]]'s monumental effort at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take 19 out of 20 possible Australian wickets in the Fourth Test.<ref>Harte, pp. 444\u2013446.</ref> It was Australia's second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer, and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn Tests, in which half the playing time was washed out. Bradman rated the team that won the series 2\u20131 as England's best ever.\n\nEngland's dominance was not to last. Australia won 4\u20130 in 1958\u201359, having found a high-quality spinner of their own in new skipper [[Richie Benaud]], who took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, and paceman [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]], who took 24 wickets at 19.00. The series was overshadowed by the furore over various Australian bowlers, most notably [[Ian Meckiff]], whom the English management and media accused of [[throwing (cricket)|illegally throwing]] Australia to victory.\n\nIn 1961 Australia won a hard-fought series 2\u20131, their first Ashes series win in England for 13 years.  After narrowly winning the Second Test at Lord's, dubbed \"The Battle of the Ridge\" because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series with [[Richie Benaud]] taking 6-70 during the English runchase.\n\nThe tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962\u201363, 1964, 1965\u201366 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing. Of the 20 Tests played during the four series, Australia won four and England three. As they held the Ashes, Australia's captains [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] and [[Bill Lawry]] were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. During this period, spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased, but Simpson and Lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction.\n\nIt was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. West Indies defeated England twice in the mid-1960s and South Africa, in two series before they were banned for [[apartheid]], completely outplayed Australia 3\u20131 and 4\u20130. Australia had lost 2\u20131 during a tour of the West Indies in 1964\u201365, the first time it had lost a series to any team other than England.\n\nIn 1970\u201371, [[Ray Illingworth]] led England to a 2\u20130 win in Australia, mainly due to [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]]'s fast bowling, and the prolific batting of [[Geoffrey Boycott]] and [[John Edrich]]. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.<ref>Harte, pp. 526\u2013530.</ref>\n\n===1972 to 1987===\nThe 1972 series finished 2\u20132, with England under Illingworth retaining the Ashes.<ref>Harte, pp. 538\u2013540.</ref>\n\nIn the 1974\u201375 series, with the England team breaking up and their best batsman Geoff Boycott refusing to play, Australian pace bowlers [[Jeff Thomson]] and [[Dennis Lillee]] wreaked havoc. A 4\u20131 result was a fair reflection as England were left shell shocked.<ref>Harte, pp. 557\u2013559.</ref> England then lost the 1975 series 0\u20131, but at least restored some pride under new captain [[Tony Greig]].<ref>Harte, pp. 561\u2013563.</ref>\n\nAustralia won the 1977 Centenary Test<ref>Harte, pp. 580\u2013581.</ref> which was not an Ashes contest, but then a storm broke as [[Kerry Packer]] announced his intention to form [[World Series Cricket]].<ref>Harte, pp. 579\u2013590</ref> WSC affected all Test-playing nations but it weakened Australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with Packer; the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would not select WSC-contracted players and an almost completely new Test team had to be formed. WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view. The West Indies would go on to record resounding Test series wins over Australia and England and dominated world cricket until the 1990s.\n\nWith Greig having joined WSC, England appointed [[Mike Brearley]] as its captain and he enjoyed great success against Australia. Largely assisted by the return of Boycott, Brearley's men won the 1977 series 3\u20130 and then completed an overwhelming 5\u20131 series win against an Australian side missing its WSC players in 1978\u201379. [[Allan Border]] made his Test debut for Australia in 1978\u201379.\n\nBrearley retired from Test cricket in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Ian Botham]], who started the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1981|1981 series]] as England captain, by which time the WSC split had ended. After Australia took a 1\u20130 lead in the first two Tests, Botham was forced to resign or was sacked (depending on the source). Brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the Third Test at Headingley. This was a remarkable match in which Australia looked certain to take a 2\u20130 series lead after it had forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. England, despite being 135 for 7, produced a second innings total of 356, Botham scoring 149*. Chasing just 130, Australia were sensationally dismissed for 111, [[Bob Willis]] taking 8\u201343. It was the first time since 1894\u201395 that a team following on had won a Test match. Under Brearley's leadership, England went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at The Oval.<ref>Harte, pp. 627\u2013628.</ref>\n\nIn 1982\u201383 Australia had [[Greg Chappell]] back from WSC as captain, while the England team was weakened by the enforced omission of their [[South African rebel tours|South African tour rebels]], particularly [[Graham Gooch]] and [[John Emburey]]. Australia went 2\u20130 up after three Tests, but England won the Fourth Test by 3 runs (after a 70-run last wicket stand) to set up the final decider, which was drawn.<ref>Harte, pp. 636\u2013637.</ref>\n\nIn 1985 [[David Gower]]'s England team was strengthened by the return of Gooch and Emburey as well as the emergence at international level of [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]] and [[Mike Gatting]]. Australia, now captained by [[Allan Border]], had itself been weakened by a rebel South African tour, the loss of [[Terry Alderman]] being a particular factor. England won 3\u20131.\n\nDespite suffering heavy defeats against the West Indies during the 1980s, England continued to do well in the Ashes. Mike Gatting was the captain in 1986\u201387 but his team started badly and attracted some criticism.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/268042.html | title=Can't bat, can't bowl, can't field | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | last=Miller | first=Andrew |author2=Martin Williamson  | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}</ref> Then [[Chris Broad]] scored three hundreds in successive Tests and bowling successes from [[Graham Dilley]] and [[Gladstone Small]] meant England won the series 2\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 662\u2013664.</ref>\n\n===1989 to 2003===\n[[File:MCG99.jpg|right|thumb|[[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] Boxing Day Test 1998]]\nThe Australian team of 1989 was comparable to the great Australian teams of the past, and resoundingly defeated England 4\u20130.<ref>Harte, pp. 679\u2013682.</ref> Well led by [[Allan Border]], the team included the young cricketers [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Merv Hughes]], [[David Boon]], [[Ian Healy]] and [[Steve Waugh]], who were all to prove long-serving and successful Ashes competitors.

After re-establishing its credibility in 1989, Australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990\u201391, 1993, 1994\u201395, 1997, 1998\u201399, 2001 and 2002\u201303 series, all by convincing margins.\n\nGreat Australian players in the early years included batsmen Border, Boon, Taylor and Steve Waugh. The captaincy passed from Border to Taylor in the mid-1990s and then to Steve Waugh before the 2001 series. In the latter part of the 1990s Waugh himself, along with his twin brother [[Mark Waugh|Mark]], scored heavily for Australia and fast bowlers [[Glenn McGrath]] and [[Jason Gillespie]] made a serious impact, especially the former. The wicketkeeper-batsman position was held by [[Ian Healy]] for most of the 1990s and by [[Adam Gilchrist]] from 2001 to 2006\u201307. In the 2000s, batsmen [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] became noted players for Australia. But the most dominant Australian player was leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]], whose first delivery in Ashes cricket in 1993, to dismiss Mike Gatting, became known as the [[Ball of the Century]].\n\nAustralia's record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 test wins for Australia to England's 86, 74 tests having been drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+1989;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> By the 2005 series Australia's test wins had increased to 115 whereas England's had increased to only 93 (with 82 draws).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+2005;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times; Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws.

England then achieved its first Ashes win at Lord's since 1934 to go 1\u20130 up. After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, the fourth match at Headingley was convincingly won by Australia by an innings and 80 runs to level the series. Finally, England won the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] by a margin of 197 runs to regain the Ashes. [[Andrew Flintoff]] retired from Test cricket soon afterwards.\n\nThe [[2010\u201311 Ashes series|2010\u201311 series]] was played in Australia. The First Test at Brisbane ended in a draw, but England won the Second Test, at Adelaide, by an innings and 71 runs. Australia came back with a victory at Perth in the Third Test. In the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, England batting second scored 513 to defeat Australia (98 and 258) by an innings and 157 runs. This gave England an unbeatable 2\u20131 lead in the series and so it retained the Ashes. England went on to win the series 3\u20131, beating Australia by an innings and 83 runs at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia, captained by Michael Clarke, batted first on a cloudy day after winning the toss and were bowled out for 280. England made 644, their highest innings total since 1938. England then bowled Australia out again for 281. England's series victory was its most convincing for decades and its first on Australian soil for 24 years. The 2010\u201311 Ashes series was the only one in which a team had won three Tests by innings margins and it was the first time England had scored 500 or more four times in a single series.\n\nAustralia's build-up to the [[2013 Ashes series]] was far from ideal.

However, debutant 19-year-old [[Ashton Agar]] made a world-record 98 for a number 11 and [[Phillip Hughes|Phil Hughes]] an unbeaten 81 to secure a lead of 65. England's second-innings total of 375 set Australia a target of 311, against which it fell short by only 14 runs in a tense finish. In the Second Test, England beat Australia by 347 runs in a very one-sided contest. In the Third Test, held at a newly refurbished Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. It amassed a commanding score of 527\u20137, led by captain Michael Clarke's 187. The pressure was then on the home side to avoid the follow-on. England scored 368 with a century for Kevin Pietersen. Australia's second innings score was 172\u20137 at the end of Day 4, characterised by batting order changes to achieve a fast run rate to allow enough time to bowl England out amid inclement weather forecasts. Australia declared overnight to post England a target of 332 to win. Contrary to expectations, play resumed with only a minor delay on Day 5, and with captain Alastair Cook being bowled out for 0 (his first duck in 26 innings as captain), Australia looked to be in with a significant chance of a win, keeping its series hopes alive. By lunch England were 37\u20133, but on resumption of play only 3 balls were bowled before rain stopped play.

In the next two Tests, the Australian batsmen struggled, being bowled out for 136 in the first innings at [[Edgbaston]], with England proceeding to win by eight wickets.

England eventually went on to make 302. Australia, however, lost four wickets early. A partnership between Steve Smith and [[Shaun Marsh]] ensured Australia would not be blown away, before Smith then paired with Patrick Cummins to see Australia pass England's score. Facing a first-innings deficit, England again lost Alastair Cook early, but Joe Root was able to steady the ship. After he was removed by [[Josh Hazlewood]], little resistance was provided, and the Australians only required 170 to win from tea on day four.

A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes. Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four-match series (1938; 1975) and six-match series (1970\u201371; 1974\u201375; 1978\u201379; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997). Australians have made 264 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] in Ashes Tests, of which 23 have been scores over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which 10 have been over 200. Australians have taken 10 [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] in a match on 41 occasions, Englishmen 38 times.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Match venues==\nThe series alternates between the United Kingdom and Australia, and within each country each of the usually five matches is held at different grounds.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the grounds currently used are [[the Gabba]] in Brisbane (first staged an England\u2013Australia Test in the 1932\u201333 season), [[Adelaide Oval]] (1884\u201385), the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) (1876\u201377), and the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] (SCG) (1881\u201382). A single Test was held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] in 1928\u201329. Traditionally, Melbourne hosts the [[Boxing Day Test]] and Sydney hosts the New Year Test. Additionally [[WACA Ground|the WACA]] in Perth (1970\u201371) hosted its [[2017\u201318 Ashes series#3rd Test|final Ashes Test]] in 2017\u201318 and is due to be replaced by [[Perth Stadium]] for the [[2021\u201322 Ashes series|2021\u201322 series]].\n\nCricket Australia proposed that the 2010\u201311 series consist of six Tests, with the additional game to be played at [[Bellerive Oval]] in Hobart. The England and Wales Cricket Board declined and the series was played over five Tests.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], the grounds currently used are: [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] in Manchester (1884), [[The Oval]] in [[Kennington]], [[South London]] (1884); [[Lord's]] in [[St John's Wood]], [[North London]] (1884); [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] (1899) and [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in [[Birmingham]] (1902). Additionally [[Sophia Gardens]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] (2009); the [[Riverside Ground]] in [[Chester-le-Street]], [[County Durham]] (2013) and [[Trent Bridge]] at [[West Bridgford]], Nottinghamshire (1899), have been used and one Test was also held at [[Bramall Lane]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1902. Traditionally the final Test of the series is played at the Oval. Sophia Gardens and the Riverside were excluded as Test grounds between the years of 2020 and 2024 and therefore will not host an Ashes Test until at least 2027. Trent Bridge is also not due to host an Ashes Test in 2019 or 2023.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:The Ashes Urn Replica (2016).jpg|150px|thumb|right|A modern-day replica of [[The Ashes urn]]]]\n\nThe popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to other sports and games using the name \"Ashes\" for contests between England and Australia. The best-known and longest-running of these events is the [[rugby league]] rivalry between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] (see [[The Ashes (rugby league)|rugby league \"Ashes\"]]). Use of the name \"Ashes\" was suggested by the Australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in 1908. Other examples included the television game shows ''[[Gladiators (TV series)|Gladiators]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (Australian game show)|Sale of the Century]]'', both of which broadcast special editions containing contestants from the Australian and English versions of the shows competing against each other.\n\nThe term became further genericised in Australia in the first half of the twentieth century, and was used to describe many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of Australia vs England.

Irrespective of which side holds the tournament, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at [[Lord's]]; it has however been taken to Australia to be put on touring display on two occasions: as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, and to accompany the [[English cricket team in Australia in 2006\u201307|Ashes series in 2006\u201307]].\n\nAn Ashes series is traditionally of five Tests, hosted in turn by England and Australia at least once every two years.

On their [[Australian cricket team in England and the United States in 1882|tour of England]] that year the Australians played just one Test, at [[the Oval]] in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult [[Cricket pitch|wicket]].<ref>Fred Spofforth, however, contended that, the fourth innings aside, it played perfectly well.</ref> Australia made a mere 63 runs in its first [[innings]], and England, led by [[A. N. Hornby]], took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In its second innings, Australia, boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from [[Hugh Massie]], managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win. The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler [[Fred Spofforth]], spurred on by the [[gamesmanship]] of his opponents, in particular [[W. G.

Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory.\n\nWhen [[Ted Peate]], England's last batsman, came to the crease, his side needed just ten runs to win, but Peate managed only two before he was bowled by [[Harry Boyle (cricketer)|Harry Boyle]]. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil. When it finally sank in, the crowd swarmed onto the field, cheering loudly and chairing Boyle and Spofforth to the pavilion.\n\nWhen Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner, [[Charles Studd]] (one of the best batsman in England, having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists), to get the runs. Peate humorously replied, \"I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n|first=Jack\n|last=Worrall\n|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83580262\n|title=A Great Bowlers' Victory\n|page=11 \n|newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] \n|location=Perth, WA |date=23 August 1930 \n|accessdate=25 August 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe momentous defeat was widely recorded in the British press, which praised the Australians for their plentiful \"pluck\" and berated the Englishmen for their lack thereof.

He spoke of them several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term \"the Ashes\" largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series, at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when [[George Giffen]], in his memoirs (''With Bat and Ball'', 1899), used the term as if it were well known.<ref>Gibson, A., ''Cricket Captains of England'', p. 26.</ref>\n\nThe true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]] took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain \"the ashes\". As had been the case on Bligh's tour 20 years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term and, this time, it stuck. Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled ''How We Recovered the Ashes''. Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend. The first mention of \"the Ashes\" in [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] occurs in 1905, while ''Wisden'''s first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition.\n\n==Urn==\n{{Main|The Ashes urn}}\n[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest published photo of [[the Ashes urn]], from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 1921]]\n[[File:Rupertswood mansion side angle shot.jpg|thumb|[[Rupertswood]] outside Melbourne, where the urn was presented to Bligh]]\nAs it took many years for the name \"The Ashes\" to be given to ongoing series between England and Australia, there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners. As late as 1925 the following verse appeared in ''The Cricketers Annual'':\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nSo here's to Chapman, Hendren and Hobbs,\nGilligan, Woolley and Hearne\nMay they bring back to the Motherland,\nThe ashes which have no urn!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, several attempts had been made to embody the Ashes in a physical memorial. Examples include one presented to Warner in 1904, another to Australian captain M. A. Noble in 1909, and another to Australian captain W. M. Woodfull in 1934.\n\nThe oldest, and the one to enjoy enduring fame, was the one presented to Bligh, later Lord Darnley, during the 1882\u201383 tour. The precise nature of the origin of [[The Ashes urn|this urn]] is matter of dispute. Based on a statement by Darnley in 1894, it was believed that a group of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] ladies, including Darnley's later wife [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], made the presentation after the victory in the Third Test in 1883. More recent researchers, in particular Ronald Willis<ref>{{Cite book| first=Ronald | last=Willis | title=Cricket's Biggest Mystery: The Ashes | isbn=0-7270-1768-3}}</ref> and Joy Munns<ref>{{Cite book| first=Joy | last=Munns | title=Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The birthplace of the Ashes | isbn=0-646-22153-1}}</ref> have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over Christmas 1882 when the English team were guests of [[Sir William John Clarke|Sir William Clarke]], at his property \"[[Rupertswood]]\", in [[Sunbury, Victoria]]. This was before the matches had started. The prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of Clarke.\n\nIn August 1926 Ivo Bligh (now Lord Darnley) displayed the Ashes urn at the ''[[Morning Post]]'' Decorative Art Exhibition held in the Central Hall, Westminster. He made the following statement about how he was given the urn:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58247421?searchTerm=darnley%20cricket%20ashes&searchLimits= |title=Sunday Times (Perth) 15 August 1926 page 9S.

England won two out of the three matches played against Murdoch's Australian Eleven, and after the third match some Melbourne ladies put some ashes into a small urn and gave them to me as captain of the English Eleven.}}\n\nA more detailed account of how the Ashes were given to Ivo Bligh was outlined by his wife, the Countess of Darnley, in 1930 during a speech at a cricket luncheon. Her speech was reported by the London Times as follows:<ref>The Times (London), 27 June 1930. page 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In 1882, she said, it was first spoken of when the Sporting Times, after the Australians had thoroughly beaten the English at the Oval, wrote an obituary in affectionate memory of English cricket \"whose demise was deeply lamented and the body would be cremated and taken to Australia\". Her husband, then Ivo Bligh, took a team to Australia in the following year. Punch had a poem containing the words \"When Ivo comes back with the urn\" and when Ivo Bligh wiped out the defeat Lady Clarke, wife of Sir W. J. Clarke, who entertained the English so lavishly, found a little wooden urn, burnt a bail, put the ashes in the urn, and wrapping it in a red velvet bag, put it into her husband's (Ivo Bligh's) hands. He had always regarded it as a great treasure.}}\n\nThere is another statement which is not totally clear made by Lord Darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn. He was interviewed in his home at Cobham Hall by Montague Grover and the report of this interview was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm=%22cobham%20hall%22%20urn&searchLimits=l-decade=192 |title=Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1.

The report of this statement in the Brisbane Courier was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21053463?searchTerm=darnley%20ashes%20urn&searchLimits=l-decade=192|title=Brisbane Courier, 9 June 1926, page 7.

Though the team did not win, the urn containing the ashes was sent to him just before leaving Melbourne.}}\n\nThe contents of the urn are also problematic; they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump, bail or the outer casing of a ball, but in 1998 Darnley's 82-year-old daughter-in-law said they were the remains of her mother-in-law's veil, casting a further layer of doubt on the matter. However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now \"95% certain\" that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail. Speaking on Channel Nine TV on 25 November 2006, he said x-rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked, and repair work had to be carried out. The urn is made of [[terracotta]] and is about {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall and may originally have been a perfume jar.\n\n[[File:Ashes song.jpg|thumb|The full version of the song from the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', the fourth verse of which is pasted onto the urn]]\nA label containing a six-line verse is pasted on the urn. This is the fourth verse of a song-lyric published in the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'' on 1 February 1883:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nWhen [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo]] goes back with the urn, the urn;\n[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A G Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;\nThe [[wikt:make the welkin ring|welkin]] will ring loud,\nThe great crowd will feel proud,\nSeeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;\nAnd the rest coming home with the urn.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn February 1883, just before the disputed Fourth Test, a velvet bag made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of [[Dublin]], was given to Bligh to contain the urn. During Darnley's lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn, and no record of a published photograph exists before 1921.  ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' published this photo in January 1921 (shown above). When Darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes. MCC first displayed the urn in the Long Room at [[Lord's]] and since 1953 in the MCC Cricket Museum at the ground. MCC's wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy. It is in fact a private memento, and for this reason it is never awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match.\n\nBecause the urn itself is so delicate, it has been allowed to travel to Australia only twice. The first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations; the second was for the 2006/7 Ashes series.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6052544.stm | title=Ashes urn heads to Australia |work=BBC Sport  | date=15 October 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}</ref> The urn arrived on 17 October 2006, going on display at the [[Museum of Sydney]]. It then toured to other states, with the final appearance at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery on 21 January 2007.\n\nIn the 1990s, given Australia's long dominance of the Ashes and the popular acceptance of the Darnley urn as \"the Ashes\", the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC would not agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the [[Earl of Darnley|Earldom of Darnley]], argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.\n\nAs a compromise, the MCC commissioned a larger replica of the urn in [[Waterford Crystal]], known as the Ashes Trophy, to award to the winning team of each series starting with the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1998\u201399|1998\u201399 Ashes]].<ref>[http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy/ \"What is the Ashes Trophy?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910205923/http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy |date=10 September 2013 }}, Lord's website.

Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by [[Result (cricket)|nine wickets]], but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have \"won back the Ashes\" 2\u20131. A fourth match was played, against a \"United Australian XI\", which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 1882\u201383 series. It \"is\" counted as a Test, but as a standalone. This match ended in a victory for Australia.\n\n===1884 to 1896===\nAfter Bligh's victory, there was an extended period of English dominance. The tours generally had fewer Tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, the first five-Test series taking place only in 1894\u201395. England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.\n\nThere was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 1887\u201388, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking its first series win since 1882 with a 2\u20131 victory in 1891\u201392. But England dominated, winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes.\n\nThe [[English cricket team in Australia in 1894-95|1894\u201395]] series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on. Australia had scored a massive 586 ([[Syd Gregory]] 201, [[George Giffen]] 161) and then dismissed England for 325. But England responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed Australia for 166 with [[Bobby Peel]] taking 6 for 67. At the close of the second last day's play, Australia were 113\u20132, needing only 64 more runs. But heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left-arm bowlers, Peel and [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], were all but unplayable. England went on to win the series 3\u20132 after it had been all square before the Final Test, which England won by 6 wickets. The English heroes were Peel, with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70, and [[Tom Richardson (cricketer)|Tom Richardson]], with 32 at 26.53.\n\nIn 1896 England under the captaincy of [[W. G. Grace]] won the series 2\u20131, and this marked the end of England's longest period of Ashes dominance.\n\n===1897 to 1902===\nAustralia resoundingly won the 1897\u201398 series by 4\u20131 under the captaincy of [[Harry Trott]]. His successor [[Joe Darling]] won the next three series in 1899, 1901\u201302 and the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|classic 1902 series]], which became one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket.\n\nFive matches were played in 1902 but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather. In the First Test (the first played at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]), after scoring 376 England bowled out Australia for 36 ([[Wilfred Rhodes]] 7/17) and reduced them to 46\u20132 when they followed on. Australia won the Third and Fourth Tests at [[Bramall Lane]] and [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] respectively. At Old Trafford, Australia won by just 3 runs after [[Victor Trumper]] had scored 104 on a \"bad wicket\", reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day. England won the last Test at [[The Oval]] by one wicket. Chasing 263 to win, it slumped to 48\u20135 before [[Gilbert Jessop|Jessop's]] 104 gave them a chance. He reached his hundred in just 75 minutes. The last-wicket pair of [[George Herbert Hirst|George Hirst]] and Rhodes were required to score 15 runs for victory. When Rhodes joined him, Hirst reportedly said: \"We'll get them in singles, Wilfred.\" In fact, they scored thirteen singles and a two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152487.html|title=Wisden \u2013 The glorious uncertainty|author=|date=|website=espncricinfo.com}}</ref>\n\nThe period of Darling's captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding Australian players such as Trumper, [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[James Kelly (cricketer)|James Kelly]], [[Monty Noble]], [[Clem Hill]], [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]].\n\n===Reviving the legend===\nAfter what the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903\u201304. England won it against the odds, and [[Plum Warner]], the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book ''How We Recovered The Ashes''.<ref>[[Plum Warner]], ''How We Recovered The Ashes'', Longman, 1905</ref> The title of this book revived the Ashes legend and it was after this that England v Australia series were customarily referred to as \"The Ashes\".\n\n===1905 to 1912===\nEngland and Australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Five more series took place between 1905 and 1912. In 1905 England's captain [[Stanley Jackson]] not only won the series 2\u20130, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Monty Noble led Australia to victory in both 1907\u201308 and 1909. Then England won in 1911\u201312 by four matches to one. [[Jack Hobbs]] establishing himself as England's first-choice opening batsman with three centuries, while [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] (32 wickets at 21.62) and [[Sydney Barnes]] (34 wickets at 22.88) formed a formidable bowling partnership.\n\nEngland retained the Ashes when it won the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], which also featured [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The Australian touring party had been severely weakened by a [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|dispute]] between the board and players that caused [[Clem Hill]], [[Victor Trumper]], Warwick Armstrong, [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Sammy Carter]] and [[Vernon Ransford]] to be omitted.<ref>Harte, pp. 251\u2013256.</ref>\n\n===1920 to 1933===\nAfter the war, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. For the first time, the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]] crippled the English batting on a regular basis. Australia recorded overwhelming victories both in England and on home soil. It won the first eight matches in succession including a 5\u20130 [[whitewash (sport)|whitewash]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920-21|1920\u20131921]] at the hands of Warwick Armstrong's team.\n\nThe ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.\n\n[[File:Herbert Sutcliffe 1924.jpg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Sutcliffe]] sweeps [[Arthur Mailey]] during the first Ashes Test in Sydney, 1924.]]\nEngland won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.<ref>Harte, pp. 274\u2013276.</ref><ref name=auslist>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru \u2013 Australia \u2013 Tests \u2013 Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn a rain-hit series in 1926, England managed to eke out a 1\u20130 victory with a win in the final Test at The Oval. Because the series was at stake, the match was to be \"timeless\", i.e., played to a finish. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22. Jack Hobbs and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] took the score to 49\u20130 at the end of the second day, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight, and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket. England seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match. In spite of the very difficult batting conditions, however, Hobbs and Sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and England won the game comfortably.<ref>Harte, pp. 298\u2013301.</ref> Australian captain [[Herbie Collins]] was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level, and some accused him of throwing the match.\n\nAustralia's ageing post-war team broke up after 1926, with Collins, [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Warren Bardsley]] all departing, and Gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928\u201329 series.\n\nDespite the debut of [[Donald Bradman]], the inexperienced Australians, led by [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], were heavily defeated, losing 4\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 312\u2013316.</ref> England had a very strong batting side, with [[Wally Hammond]] contributing 905 runs at an average of 113.12, and Hobbs, Sutcliffe and [[Patsy Hendren]] all scoring heavily; the bowling was more than adequate, without being outstanding.\n\nIn 1930, [[Bill Woodfull]] led an extremely inexperienced team to England.\n\nBradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 139.14, which remains a world record Test series aggregate. A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying \"I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia.\"<ref name=\"Don Bradman on australianscreen online\">{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/1930-australian-xi-ashes/|title=Don Bradman in 'The 1930 Australian XI: Winners of the Ashes' |website=Aso.gov.au|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> In the [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] Test, he made 334, reaching 309* at the end of the first day, including a century before lunch. Bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match, at [[Lord's]], was a better innings. England managed to stay in contention until the deciding final Test at The Oval, but yet another double hundred by Bradman, and 7/92 by [[Percy Hornibrook]] in England's second innings, enabled Australia to win by an innings and take the series 2\u20131. [[Clarrie Grimmett]]'s 29 wickets at 31.89 for Australia in this high-scoring series were also important.\n\nAustralia had one of the strongest batting line-ups ever in the early 1930s, with Bradman, [[Archie Jackson]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Bill Woodfull]] and [[Bill Ponsford]]. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England's 1932\u201333 captain [[Douglas Jardine]] to adopt the tactic of fast [[leg theory]], better known as [[Bodyline]].\n\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a ball from [[Harold Larwood]] with [[Bodyline]] field settings.]]\n\nJardine instructed his [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]], most notably [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked [[leg side|leg-side]] field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it \"leg theory\" but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it \"Bodyline\" (from \"on the line of the body\"). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4\u20131, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] eventually changed the [[Laws of cricket]] to curtail the number of leg side fielders.\n\nJardine's comment was: \"I've not travelled 6,000 miles to make friends.

It should be borne in mind that Tests in Australia prior to the war were all played to a finish. Many batting records were set in this period.\n\nThe 1934 Ashes series began with the notable absence of Larwood, Voce and Jardine. The MCC had made it clear, in light of the revelations of the bodyline series, that these players would not face Australia. The MCC, although it had earlier condoned and encouraged {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} bodyline tactics in the 1932\u201333 series, laid the blame on Larwood when relations turned sour. Larwood was forced by the MCC to either apologise or be removed from the Test side. He went for the latter.\n\nAustralia recovered the Ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953, though no Test cricket was played during the Second World War.\n\nAs in 1930, the 1934 series was decided in the final Test at The Oval. Australia, batting first, posted a massive 701 in the first innings. Bradman (244) and Ponsford (266) were in record-breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket. England eventually faced a massive 707-run target for victory and failed, Australia winning the series 2\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 356\u2013357.</ref> This made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes and he retired upon his return to Australia.\n\nIn 1936\u201337 Bradman succeeded Woodfull as Australian captain. He started badly, losing the first two Tests heavily after Australia were caught on [[sticky wicket]]s. However, the Australians fought back and Bradman won his first series in charge 3\u20132.\n\nThe 1938 series was a high-scoring affair with two high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1\u20131 result, Australia retaining the Ashes. After the first two matches ended in stalemate and the Third Test at Old Trafford never started due to rain. Australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low-scoring match at Headingley to retain the urn. In the timeless Fifth Test at The Oval, the highlight was [[Len Hutton]]'s then world-record score of 364 as England made 903-7 declared. Bradman and [[Jack Fingleton]] injured themselves during Hutton's marathon effort, and with only nine men, Australia fell to defeat by an innings and 579 runs,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/6109836.stm Classic Ashes clashes \u2013 1938, The Oval] at [[BBC Sport]], 5 November 2006. Accessed 4 March 2006</ref> the heaviest in Test history.\n\nThe Ashes resumed after the war when England toured in 1946\u201347 and, as in 1920\u201321, found that Australia had made the better post-war recovery. Still captained by Bradman and now featuring the potent new-ball partnership of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], Australia was convincing 3\u20130 winners.\n\nAged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to [[Jack Ikin]]; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain's favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era.\n\nIn 1948 Australia set new standards, completely outplaying its hosts to win 4\u20130 with one draw. This [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team]], led by Bradman, who turned 40 during his final tour of England, has gone down in history as ''The Invincibles''. Playing 34 matches on tour\u2014three of which were not first-class\u2014and including the five Tests, they remained unbeaten, winning 27 and drawing 7.\n\nBradman's men were greeted by packed crowds across the country, and records for Test attendances in England were set in the [[Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Second]] and [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Tests]] at Lord's and Headingley respectively. Before a record attendance of spectators at Headingley, Australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven-wicket victory.\n\nThe 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman played his final innings for Australia in the [[Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fifth Test]] at The Oval, needing to score only four runs to end with a career [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of exactly 100. However, Bradman made a second-ball duck, bowled by an [[Eric Hollies]] googly<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/8036237.stm 1948 \u2013 Bradman's final innings duck] at [[BBC Sport]], 27 May 2009. Accessed 4 March 2015</ref> that sent him into retirement with a career average of 99.94.\n\nBradman was succeeded as Australian captain by [[Lindsay Hassett]], who led the team to a 4\u20131 series victory in 1950\u201351. The series was not as one-sided as the number of wins suggest, with several tight matches.\n\nThe tide finally turned in 1953 when England won the final Test at The Oval to take the series 1\u20130, having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding Test at Headingley. This was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in English cricket history with players such as captain Len Hutton, batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Tom Graveney]], [[Colin Cowdrey]], bowlers [[Fred Trueman]], [[Brian Statham]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Tony Lock]], wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] and all-rounder [[Trevor Bailey]].\n\n===1954 to 1971===\n[[File:Peter May.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] driving [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] on his way to a century at Sydney.]]\nIn [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|1954\u201355]], Australia's batsmen had no answer to the pace of [[Frank Tyson]] and Statham. After winning the First Test by an innings after being controversially sent in by Hutton, Australia lost its way and England took a hat-trick of victories to win the series 3\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 435\u2013437.</ref>\n\nA dramatic series in 1956 saw a record that will probably never be beaten: off-spinner [[Jim Laker]]'s monumental effort at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take 19 out of 20 possible Australian wickets in the Fourth Test.<ref>Harte, pp. 444\u2013446.</ref> It was Australia's second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer, and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn Tests, in which half the playing time was washed out. Bradman rated the team that won the series 2\u20131 as England's best ever.\n\nEngland's dominance was not to last. Australia won 4\u20130 in 1958\u201359, having found a high-quality spinner of their own in new skipper [[Richie Benaud]], who took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, and paceman [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]], who took 24 wickets at 19.00. The series was overshadowed by the furore over various Australian bowlers, most notably [[Ian Meckiff]], whom the English management and media accused of [[throwing (cricket)|illegally throwing]] Australia to victory.\n\nIn 1961 Australia won a hard-fought series 2\u20131, their first Ashes series win in England for 13 years.  After narrowly winning the Second Test at Lord's, dubbed \"The Battle of the Ridge\" because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series with [[Richie Benaud]] taking 6-70 during the English runchase.\n\nThe tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962\u201363, 1964, 1965\u201366 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing. Of the 20 Tests played during the four series, Australia won four and England three. As they held the Ashes, Australia's captains [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] and [[Bill Lawry]] were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. During this period, spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased, but Simpson and Lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction.\n\nIt was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. West Indies defeated England twice in the mid-1960s and South Africa, in two series before they were banned for [[apartheid]], completely outplayed Australia 3\u20131 and 4\u20130. Australia had lost 2\u20131 during a tour of the West Indies in 1964\u201365, the first time it had lost a series to any team other than England.\n\nIn 1970\u201371, [[Ray Illingworth]] led England to a 2\u20130 win in Australia, mainly due to [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]]'s fast bowling, and the prolific batting of [[Geoffrey Boycott]] and [[John Edrich]]. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.<ref>Harte, pp. 526\u2013530.</ref>\n\n===1972 to 1987===\nThe 1972 series finished 2\u20132, with England under Illingworth retaining the Ashes.<ref>Harte, pp. 538\u2013540.</ref>\n\nIn the 1974\u201375 series, with the England team breaking up and their best batsman Geoff Boycott refusing to play, Australian pace bowlers [[Jeff Thomson]] and [[Dennis Lillee]] wreaked havoc. A 4\u20131 result was a fair reflection as England were left shell shocked.<ref>Harte, pp. 557\u2013559.</ref> England then lost the 1975 series 0\u20131, but at least restored some pride under new captain [[Tony Greig]].<ref>Harte, pp. 561\u2013563.</ref>\n\nAustralia won the 1977 Centenary Test<ref>Harte, pp. 580\u2013581.</ref> which was not an Ashes contest, but then a storm broke as [[Kerry Packer]] announced his intention to form [[World Series Cricket]].<ref>Harte, pp. 579\u2013590</ref> WSC affected all Test-playing nations but it weakened Australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with Packer; the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would not select WSC-contracted players and an almost completely new Test team had to be formed. WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view. The West Indies would go on to record resounding Test series wins over Australia and England and dominated world cricket until the 1990s.\n\nWith Greig having joined WSC, England appointed [[Mike Brearley]] as its captain and he enjoyed great success against Australia. Largely assisted by the return of Boycott, Brearley's men won the 1977 series 3\u20130 and then completed an overwhelming 5\u20131 series win against an Australian side missing its WSC players in 1978\u201379. [[Allan Border]] made his Test debut for Australia in 1978\u201379.\n\nBrearley retired from Test cricket in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Ian Botham]], who started the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1981|1981 series]] as England captain, by which time the WSC split had ended. After Australia took a 1\u20130 lead in the first two Tests, Botham was forced to resign or was sacked (depending on the source). Brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the Third Test at Headingley. This was a remarkable match in which Australia looked certain to take a 2\u20130 series lead after it had forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. England, despite being 135 for 7, produced a second innings total of 356, Botham scoring 149*. Chasing just 130, Australia were sensationally dismissed for 111, [[Bob Willis]] taking 8\u201343. It was the first time since 1894\u201395 that a team following on had won a Test match. Under Brearley's leadership, England went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at The Oval.<ref>Harte, pp. 627\u2013628.</ref>\n\nIn 1982\u201383 Australia had [[Greg Chappell]] back from WSC as captain, while the England team was weakened by the enforced omission of their [[South African rebel tours|South African tour rebels]], particularly [[Graham Gooch]] and [[John Emburey]]. Australia went 2\u20130 up after three Tests, but England won the Fourth Test by 3 runs (after a 70-run last wicket stand) to set up the final decider, which was drawn.<ref>Harte, pp. 636\u2013637.</ref>\n\nIn 1985 [[David Gower]]'s England team was strengthened by the return of Gooch and Emburey as well as the emergence at international level of [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]] and [[Mike Gatting]]. Australia, now captained by [[Allan Border]], had itself been weakened by a rebel South African tour, the loss of [[Terry Alderman]] being a particular factor. England won 3\u20131.\n\nDespite suffering heavy defeats against the West Indies during the 1980s, England continued to do well in the Ashes. Mike Gatting was the captain in 1986\u201387 but his team started badly and attracted some criticism.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/268042.html | title=Can't bat, can't bowl, can't field | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | last=Miller | first=Andrew |author2=Martin Williamson  | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}</ref> Then [[Chris Broad]] scored three hundreds in successive Tests and bowling successes from [[Graham Dilley]] and [[Gladstone Small]] meant England won the series 2\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 662\u2013664.</ref>\n\n===1989 to 2003===\n[[File:MCG99.jpg|right|thumb|[[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] Boxing Day Test 1998]]\nThe Australian team of 1989 was comparable to the great Australian teams of the past, and resoundingly defeated England 4\u20130.<ref>Harte, pp. 679\u2013682.</ref> Well led by [[Allan Border]], the team included the young cricketers [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Merv Hughes]], [[David Boon]], [[Ian Healy]] and [[Steve Waugh]], who were all to prove long-serving and successful Ashes competitors.

During the Fourth Test news broke that prominent England players had agreed to take part in a \"rebel tour\" of South Africa the following winter; three of them ([[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]], [[Neil Foster]] and [[John Emburey]]) were playing in the match, and were subsequently dropped from the England side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/139086.html|title=Rebels take a step too far (English rebel tour to South Africa, 1989)|first=Nick|last=Hoult|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=July 2004|accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nAustralia reached a cricketing peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, coupled with a general decline in England's fortunes. After re-establishing its credibility in 1989, Australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990\u201391, 1993, 1994\u201395, 1997, 1998\u201399, 2001 and 2002\u201303 series, all by convincing margins.\n\nGreat Australian players in the early years included batsmen Border, Boon, Taylor and Steve Waugh. The captaincy passed from Border to Taylor in the mid-1990s and then to Steve Waugh before the 2001 series. In the latter part of the 1990s Waugh himself, along with his twin brother [[Mark Waugh|Mark]], scored heavily for Australia and fast bowlers [[Glenn McGrath]] and [[Jason Gillespie]] made a serious impact, especially the former. The wicketkeeper-batsman position was held by [[Ian Healy]] for most of the 1990s and by [[Adam Gilchrist]] from 2001 to 2006\u201307. In the 2000s, batsmen [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] became noted players for Australia. But the most dominant Australian player was leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]], whose first delivery in Ashes cricket in 1993, to dismiss Mike Gatting, became known as the [[Ball of the Century]].\n\nAustralia's record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 test wins for Australia to England's 86, 74 tests having been drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+1989;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> By the 2005 series Australia's test wins had increased to 115 whereas England's had increased to only 93 (with 82 draws).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+2005;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times; Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws.

England then achieved its first Ashes win at Lord's since 1934 to go 1\u20130 up. After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, the fourth match at Headingley was convincingly won by Australia by an innings and 80 runs to level the series. Finally, England won the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] by a margin of 197 runs to regain the Ashes. [[Andrew Flintoff]] retired from Test cricket soon afterwards.\n\nThe [[2010\u201311 Ashes series|2010\u201311 series]] was played in Australia. The First Test at Brisbane ended in a draw, but England won the Second Test, at Adelaide, by an innings and 71 runs. Australia came back with a victory at Perth in the Third Test. In the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, England batting second scored 513 to defeat Australia (98 and 258) by an innings and 157 runs. This gave England an unbeatable 2\u20131 lead in the series and so it retained the Ashes. England went on to win the series 3\u20131, beating Australia by an innings and 83 runs at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia, captained by Michael Clarke, batted first on a cloudy day after winning the toss and were bowled out for 280. England made 644, their highest innings total since 1938. England then bowled Australia out again for 281. England's series victory was its most convincing for decades and its first on Australian soil for 24 years. The 2010\u201311 Ashes series was the only one in which a team had won three Tests by innings margins and it was the first time England had scored 500 or more four times in a single series.\n\nAustralia's build-up to the [[2013 Ashes series]] was far from ideal.

In the face of high-class swing bowling from [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]], who ended with 10 wickets in the match, Australia collapsed to 117\u20139. However, debutant 19-year-old [[Ashton Agar]] made a world-record 98 for a number 11 and [[Phillip Hughes|Phil Hughes]] an unbeaten 81 to secure a lead of 65. England's second-innings total of 375 set Australia a target of 311, against which it fell short by only 14 runs in a tense finish. In the Second Test, England beat Australia by 347 runs in a very one-sided contest. In the Third Test, held at a newly refurbished Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. It amassed a commanding score of 527\u20137, led by captain Michael Clarke's 187. The pressure was then on the home side to avoid the follow-on. England scored 368 with a century for Kevin Pietersen. Australia's second innings score was 172\u20137 at the end of Day 4, characterised by batting order changes to achieve a fast run rate to allow enough time to bowl England out amid inclement weather forecasts. Australia declared overnight to post England a target of 332 to win. Contrary to expectations, play resumed with only a minor delay on Day 5, and with captain Alastair Cook being bowled out for 0 (his first duck in 26 innings as captain), Australia looked to be in with a significant chance of a win, keeping its series hopes alive. By lunch England were 37\u20133, but on resumption of play only 3 balls were bowled before rain stopped play. This rain persisted and, at 16:40, the captains shook hands and the match was declared a draw.

In the second innings England scored 330, Ian Bell top-scoring with 113. Needing only 298 runs to win Australia was in a strong position at 138/2, only 160 short with eight wickets in hand. Following a rain delay, Australia crashed to a 74-run defeat, losing all eight wickets for only 86 runs. England had taken 9 wickets in the final session of the fourth day. Stuart Broad was England's top wicket-taker in the match with 11 wickets. England held a 3\u20130 lead going into the final Fifth Test at The Oval.\n\nThe final Test was drawn. On the fourth day no play was possible due to rain, but on the final day after an aggressive Australian declaration, England came close to achieving its first 4\u20130 victory in an Ashes series. Play was abandoned, owing to bad light, denying a thrilling finish to the large crowd of spectators. There was media criticism of the new ICC rules requiring umpires to stop play when failing light was measured at a specified level.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/23836394 |title=Ashes 2013: Ashes 2013: England win series 3\u20130 after bad light ends Oval Test |work=BBC Sport |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Australia won the Ashes 5-0.jpg|thumb|240px|Celebrations at the SCG after Australia won the Ashes 5\u20130 in 2014]]\nIn the second of two Ashes series held in [[2013\u201314 Ashes series|2013 (the series ended in 2014)]], this time hosted by Australia, the home team won the series five test matches to nil.

All six Australian specialist batsmen scored more runs than any Englishman with 10 centuries among them, with only debutant Ben Stokes scoring a century for England.

Although England won the first Test in Cardiff, Australia won comfortably in the second Test at Lords. In the next two Tests, the Australian batsmen struggled, being bowled out for 136 in the first innings at [[Edgbaston]], with England proceeding to win by eight wickets.

Despite losing [[Alastair Cook]] early they thrived on the unusually slow pitch and were well placed before [[Pat Cummins|Patrick Cummins]] removed opener [[Mark Stoneman]] and [[Nathan Lyon]] abruptly ended James Vince's innings with a run out. England eventually went on to make 302. Australia, however, lost four wickets early. A partnership between Steve Smith and [[Shaun Marsh]] ensured Australia would not be blown away, before Smith then paired with Patrick Cummins to see Australia pass England's score. Facing a first-innings deficit, England again lost Alastair Cook early, but Joe Root was able to steady the ship. After he was removed by [[Josh Hazlewood]], little resistance was provided, and the Australians only required 170 to win from tea on day four. Openers Warner and Bancroft easily saw Australia through to a 10 wicket win over the next two sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/42132855|title=Ashes: Australia beat England by 10 wickets in first Test|author=|date=27 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\nAustralia won the second Test at Adelaide by 120 runs, which was the first ever day-night Ashes test match.

A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes. Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four-match series (1938; 1975) and six-match series (1970\u201371; 1974\u201375; 1978\u201379; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997). Australians have made 264 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] in Ashes Tests, of which 23 have been scores over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which 10 have been over 200. Australians have taken 10 [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] in a match on 41 occasions, Englishmen 38 times.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Match venues==\nThe series alternates between the United Kingdom and Australia, and within each country each of the usually five matches is held at different grounds.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the grounds currently used are [[the Gabba]] in Brisbane (first staged an England\u2013Australia Test in the 1932\u201333 season), [[Adelaide Oval]] (1884\u201385), the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) (1876\u201377), and the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] (SCG) (1881\u201382). A single Test was held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] in 1928\u201329. Traditionally, Melbourne hosts the [[Boxing Day Test]] and Sydney hosts the New Year Test. Additionally [[WACA Ground|the WACA]] in Perth (1970\u201371) hosted its [[2017\u201318 Ashes series#3rd Test|final Ashes Test]] in 2017\u201318 and is due to be replaced by [[Perth Stadium]] for the [[2021\u201322 Ashes series|2021\u201322 series]].\n\nCricket Australia proposed that the 2010\u201311 series consist of six Tests, with the additional game to be played at [[Bellerive Oval]] in Hobart. The England and Wales Cricket Board declined and the series was played over five Tests.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], the grounds currently used are: [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] in Manchester (1884), [[The Oval]] in [[Kennington]], [[South London]] (1884); [[Lord's]] in [[St John's Wood]], [[North London]] (1884); [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] (1899) and [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in [[Birmingham]] (1902). Additionally [[Sophia Gardens]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] (2009); the [[Riverside Ground]] in [[Chester-le-Street]], [[County Durham]] (2013) and [[Trent Bridge]] at [[West Bridgford]], Nottinghamshire (1899), have been used and one Test was also held at [[Bramall Lane]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1902. Traditionally the final Test of the series is played at the Oval. Sophia Gardens and the Riverside were excluded as Test grounds between the years of 2020 and 2024 and therefore will not host an Ashes Test until at least 2027. Trent Bridge is also not due to host an Ashes Test in 2019 or 2023.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:The Ashes Urn Replica (2016).jpg|150px|thumb|right|A modern-day replica of [[The Ashes urn]]]]\n\nThe popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to other sports and games using the name \"Ashes\" for contests between England and Australia. The best-known and longest-running of these events is the [[rugby league]] rivalry between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] (see [[The Ashes (rugby league)|rugby league \"Ashes\"]]). Use of the name \"Ashes\" was suggested by the Australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in 1908. Other examples included the television game shows ''[[Gladiators (TV series)|Gladiators]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (Australian game show)|Sale of the Century]]'', both of which broadcast special editions containing contestants from the Australian and English versions of the shows competing against each other.\n\nThe term became further genericised in Australia in the first half of the twentieth century, and was used to describe many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of Australia vs England.

It stars [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] as an England cricketer playing the last Test of his career, which is the last of an Ashes series; the film includes cameo appearances of English captain [[Len Hutton]] and other players<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045769/|title=The Final Test (1953)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> who were part of England's 1953 triumph.\n\n[[Douglas Adams]]'s 1982 science fiction comedy novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' \u2013 the third part of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series \u2013 features the urn containing the Ashes as a significant element of its plot.

It was produced by Sam Shaw, directed by [[Martin Ritt]] from a screenplay by [[Walter Bernstein]], and with cinematography by [[Christian Matras (cinematographer)|Christian Matras]]. ''Paris Blues'' was released in the U.S. on September 27, 1961.\n\n==Plot==\nOn his way to see Wild Man Moore ([[Louis Armstrong]]) at the train station, Ram Bowen ([[Paul Newman]]), a jazz musician living in Paris, encounters a newly arrived tourist named Connie Lampson ([[Diahann Carroll]]) and invites her to see him perform that night at Club 33. Connie isn't interested, but her friend Lillian ([[Joanne Woodward]]) insists they go see him. After Ram finishes performing with Eddie ([[Sidney Poitier]]), a fellow American [[expatriate]], the four of them leave the club in the early morning. When Ram suggests that he and Connie go off to have a private breakfast together, she becomes offended, and Ram is angered at being rejected. However, Lillian, undeterred by Ram's attraction to her friend, convinces him to apologize before pursuing him. The two sleep together while Connie and Eddie continue to walk around [[Paris]].\n\nOver the following weeks the couples grow closer, but Connie is angry that Eddie has abandoned America for France, insisting that the only way race relations can improve in the U.S. is if people stay and work together in order to change things. Eddie says he is content to stay in Paris, where he experiences less bigotry and is able to carve out a career as a talented musician. Lillian tries to convince Ram to enter into a more committed relationship and move back to the U.S. with her. Ram, aware that she has two children from a previous relationship and lives in a small town, breaks off their relationship, telling her he is dedicated to his music. Meanwhile, Eddie and Connie declare their love for one another. They discuss getting married, but this falls through when Eddie states his refusal to live in the United States for a full year. Their hearts broken by their respective lovers, Connie and Lillian make plans to return home early.\n\nConnie, in a desperate last attempt to reach out to Eddie, follows him to a party where she tells him she is leaving Paris for good. Unwilling to lose her, Eddie decides to return to America to join Connie, but will follow in a few weeks as he needs to wrap up his affairs in Paris before leaving. Ram attends a meeting with a record producer, Bernard, who dismisses a composition Ram has been working on, dashing his hopes of a more prominent and respected music career. However, he tells Ram that he has the potential to become a serious composer, if he works hard and truly studies music. Crushed, he tracks down Lillian, and agrees to leave for America with her.

The film also deals with American racism of the time contrasted with Paris's open acceptance of [[black people]]. The film was based on the 1957 novel of the same name by Harold Flender.<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/harold-flender/paris-blues/ \"Paris Blues by Harold Flender\" (review), ''Kirkus''.]</ref>\n\nThe film also features [[trumpeter]] [[Louis Armstrong]] (as Wild Man Moore) and jazz pianist [[Aaron Bridgers]]; both play music within the film. It was produced by Sam Shaw, directed by [[Martin Ritt]] from a screenplay by [[Walter Bernstein]], and with cinematography by [[Christian Matras (cinematographer)|Christian Matras]]. ''Paris Blues'' was released in the U.S. on September 27, 1961.\n\n==Plot==\nOn his way to see Wild Man Moore ([[Louis Armstrong]]) at the train station, Ram Bowen ([[Paul Newman]]), a jazz musician living in Paris, encounters a newly arrived tourist named Connie Lampson ([[Diahann Carroll]]) and invites her to see him perform that night at Club 33. Connie isn't interested, but her friend Lillian ([[Joanne Woodward]]) insists they go see him. After Ram finishes performing with Eddie ([[Sidney Poitier]]), a fellow American [[expatriate]], the four of them leave the club in the early morning. When Ram suggests that he and Connie go off to have a private breakfast together, she becomes offended, and Ram is angered at being rejected. However, Lillian, undeterred by Ram's attraction to her friend, convinces him to apologize before pursuing him. The two sleep together while Connie and Eddie continue to walk around [[Paris]].\n\nOver the following weeks the couples grow closer, but Connie is angry that Eddie has abandoned America for France, insisting that the only way race relations can improve in the U.S. is if people stay and work together in order to change things. Eddie says he is content to stay in Paris, where he experiences less bigotry and is able to carve out a career as a talented musician. Lillian tries to convince Ram to enter into a more committed relationship and move back to the U.S. with her. Ram, aware that she has two children from a previous relationship and lives in a small town, breaks off their relationship, telling her he is dedicated to his music. Meanwhile, Eddie and Connie declare their love for one another. They discuss getting married, but this falls through when Eddie states his refusal to live in the United States for a full year. Their hearts broken by their respective lovers, Connie and Lillian make plans to return home early.\n\nConnie, in a desperate last attempt to reach out to Eddie, follows him to a party where she tells him she is leaving Paris for good. Unwilling to lose her, Eddie decides to return to America to join Connie, but will follow in a few weeks. Ram attends a meeting with a record producer, Bernard, who dismisses a composition Ram has been working on, dashing his hopes of a more prominent music career. Heartbroken, he tracks down Lillian, and agrees to move back with her. However, Ram appears to rescind this offer at the train station before the woman depart, arriving late and telling Lillian that he has to stay in Paris because he is unwilling to give up on his music. As the train carrying Connie and Lillian leaves the station, Ram walks away with Eddie. In the final shot, French workers cover a billboard advertising Wild Man Moore's appearance with a promo for Larousse publishing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Ram Bowen\n* [[Joanne Woodward]] as Lillian Corning\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Eddie Cook\n* [[Louis Armstrong]] as Wild Man Moore\n* [[Diahann Carroll]] as Connie Lampson\n* [[Barbara Laage]] as Marie S\u00e9oul\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Luguet]] as Ren\u00e9 Bernard\n* [[Marie Versini]] as Nicole\n* [[Moustache (actor)|Moustache]] as Mustachio the drummer\n* [[Aaron Bridgers]] as Pianist\n* Guy Pedersen as Bass Player\n* [[Serge Reggiani]] as Michel \"Gypsy\" Devigne\n* Emilien Antille as Man with alto sax in jazz cave when Armstrong enters\n* [[Roger Blin]] as Fausto the moor\n* Charles Bouillaud as Luggage carrier in train\n* Michel Dacquin as Guest at Devigne's party\n* H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dieudonn\u00e9 as The Pusher\n* Michel Garland as Club 33 customer\n* Ren\u00e9 Hell as Man with dog in the park\n* Jo Labarr\u00e8re as Club 33 customer\n* Jack Lenoir as Club 33 waiter\n* Frank Maurice as Luggage carrier on the platform\n* Niko as Ricardo\n* [[Michel Portal]] as Musician\n* Claude Rollet as Club 33 customer\n* Albert Simono as Guest at Devigne's party\n* Andr\u00e9 Tomasi as Club 33 bartender\n* Mar\u00eda Velasco as Pianist\n* [[Dominique Zardi]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nWhile the original novel and first draft of the screenplay were primarily about interracial romance, [[United Artists]] demanded that aspect be changed, not believing the American public was ready for such a thing.

Navy]] and the [[lead ship]] of [[America-class amphibious assault ship|her class]]. The fourth U.S. warship to be named for the United States of America, she was delivered in spring of 2014, replacing {{USS|Peleliu|LHA-5|2}} of the {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|4}}. Her mission is to act as the [[flagship]] of an [[expeditionary strike group]] or [[amphibious ready group]], carrying part of a [[Marine expeditionary unit]] into battle and putting them ashore with helicopters and [[V-22 Osprey]] tilt-rotor aircraft, supported by [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35B Lightning II]] aircraft and helicopter gunships.\n\nThe ship's design is based on {{USS|Makin Island|LHD-8|6}}, but to allow more room for aviation facilities she does not have a [[well dock|well deck]], and has smaller medical spaces. With a displacement of 45,000&nbsp;tons, she is as large as many other countries' aircraft carriers and can fulfill similar missions when configured with 20 F-35B strike fighters.\n\n==Design==\n{{main|America-class amphibious assault ship}}\n\nThe design is based on that of {{USS|Makin Island|LHD-8}}, itself an improved version of the {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|1}}. Approximately 45% of the Flight&nbsp;0 design is based on ''Makin Island'', with the well deck removed to allow more room for aircraft and aviation fuel.<ref name=gao09>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09326sp.pdf |title=Defense Acquisitions: Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs |id=GAO-09-326SP |publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office |date=30 March 2009 |format=PDF}}</ref> The removal of the well deck for landing craft allows for an extended hangar deck with two significantly wider high bay areas, each fitted with an overhead crane for aircraft maintenance.\n\nThese changes were required in order to operate the F-35B and MV-22, which are considerably larger than the aircraft they replace.<ref name=\"Work\">{{cite news|last1=Jean|first1=Grace V.|title=Marines Question the Utility of Their New Amphibious Warship|url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2008/9/1/2008september-marines-question-the-utility-of-their-new-amphibious-warship|work=National Defense|publisher=NDIA|date=1 September 2008|format=Navy News}}</ref>  The typical aircraft complement is expected to be 12 [[Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey|MV-22B]] transports, six [[STOVL]] F-35B attack aircraft, four [[Sikorsky CH-53K|CH-53K]] heavy transport helicopters, seven [[Bell AH-1Z Viper|AH-1Z]]/[[Bell UH-1Y Venom|UH-1Y]] attack/utility helicopters and two Navy [[SH-60 Seahawk#MH-60S \"Knighthawk\"|MH-60S]] for [[air-sea rescue]].<ref name=dote08>{{cite web | url=http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2008/pdf/navy/2008lha6.pdf | page=149 | title=LHA 6 (formerly LHA(R)) New Amphibious Assault Ship | work=FY2008 Annual Report for the Office of the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation | publisher=DOT&E | year=2008 | format=PDF | access-date=19 January 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030254/http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2008/pdf/navy/2008lha6.pdf | archive-date=4 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The exact makeup of the ship's aircraft complement will vary according to the mission.

Navy]] and the [[lead ship]] of [[America-class amphibious assault ship|her class]]. The fourth U.S. warship to be named for the United States of America, she was delivered in spring of 2014, replacing {{USS|Peleliu|LHA-5|2}} of the {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|4}}. Her mission is to act as the [[flagship]] of an [[expeditionary strike group]] or [[amphibious ready group]], carrying part of a [[Marine expeditionary unit]] into battle and putting them ashore with helicopters and [[V-22 Osprey]] tilt-rotor aircraft, supported by [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35B Lightning II]] aircraft and helicopter gunships.\n\nThe ship's design is based on {{USS|Makin Island|LHD-8|6}}, but to allow more room for aviation facilities. she does not have a [[well dock|well deck]], and has smaller medical spaces. With a displacement of 45,000&nbsp;tons, she is as large as the aircraft carriers of many other countries' navies, and can fulfill similar missions when configured with 20 F-35B strike fighters.\n\n==Design==\n{{main|America-class amphibious assault ship}}\n\nThe design is based on that of {{USS|Makin Island|LHD-8}}, itself an improved version of the {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship|1}}.
