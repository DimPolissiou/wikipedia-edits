In 1989 the [[Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency]] (CCTA) adopted a version of PROMPT II as a UK Government standard for information systems (IT) project management. They gave it the name 'PRINCE', which originally stood for \"'''PR'''OMPT II '''IN''' the '''C'''CTA '''E'''nvironment\". PRINCE was renamed in a [[Civil service]] competition as an acronym for \"'''PR'''ojects '''IN''' '''C'''ontrolled '''E'''nvironments\". PRINCE2 is the second edition of the earlier PRINCE method which was initially announced and developed in 1989 by [[Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency|CCTA]] ''(the'' ''central computer and Telecommunications Agency''), a UK government support agency.<ref>https://mymanagementguide.com/prince2-methodology-overview-history-definition-meaning-benefits-certification/</ref> PRINCE2 was released in 1996 as a generic project management method.<ref>{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.ogc.gov.uk/news_2005_4333.asp | title = OGC brings its shining quartet back into the limelight | date = 14 December 2005 | publisher = [[Office of Government Commerce]]}}</ref> PRINCE2 has become increasingly popular and is now a ''de facto'' standard for project management in many UK government departments and across the [[United Nations system]].\n\nThere have been two major revisions of PRINCE2 since its launch in 1996: \"PRINCE2:2009 Refresh\" in 2009, and \"PRINCE2 2017 Update\" in 2017. The justification for the 2017 update was the evolutions in practical business practices and feedback from PRINCE2 practitioners in the actual project environment.<ref>{{cite pressrelease | url = https://www.axelos.com/prince2-2017 | title =Introducing the PRINCE2 2017 Update | date = 11 December 2017 | publisher =Axelos}}</ref> The second edition was announced and released in 1996 as a generic ''[[Project management|PM]] methodology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mymanagementguide.com/prince2-methodology-overview-history-definition-meaning-benefits-certification/|title=PRINCE2 Methodology Overview: History, Definition & Meaning, Benefits, Certification|last=Lewinson|first=Mary|language=en-US|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>''\n\n==Overview of PRINCE2==\n\n===Six Aspects===\n\nThese aspects are also called '''tolerances''' or '''performance goals'''. They quantify the project tolerance and are considered during decision-making processes. In some organizations these can be [[Performance indicator|KPI]]s. In the following table project level tolerances are summarized:<ref name=\"PRINCE2 handbook 2017 Edition\">{{cite web |title=Managing Successful Projects with PRINCE2, 2017 Edition |url=https://www.axelos.com/store/book/managing-successful-projects-with-prince2-2017 |website=Axelos}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Tolerance Type !! Maintained in the project level !! Example\n|-\n| Scope || [[Project Plan]] || The printer should print the documents only in black/white\n|-\n| Timescale || Project Plan || The project/stage/team plan cannot last longer than 3 months\n|-\n| Risk || [[Risk Management Approach]] || Printer might not work if it is in water\n|-\n| Quality || [[Project Product Description]] || Printer should print at least 10 different standard page sizes \n|-\n| Benefits || [[Business Case]] || Printer should be set up by the customer 10% faster than the ones from the competitors, and it must be 10% cheaper\n|-\n| Cost || [[Project Plan]] || The cost of the project should not exceed \u00a3100,000\n|}\n\nBenefits can have as target the cost of the benefit, but the cost tolerance above is related to the cost of the project, not the cost of the benefit.\n\nEach management level is checked against these tolerances, coming from the upper level.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Management Level !! Tolerance type authorized to the lower level !! Exception type addressed to upper level !! plan type\n|-\n| Corporate/Programme || project tolerance || n/a || programme\n|-\n| Project Board || stage tolerance || project exception || project plan\n|-\n| Project Manager || work package tolerance || stage exception || stage plan\n|-\n| Team Manager || n/a || issue || team plan\n|}\n\n===Seven Principles===\nPRINCE2 is based on seven principles and these cannot be tailored. The PRINCE2 principles can be described as a [[mindset]] that keeps the project aligned with the PRINCE2 methodology. If a project does not adhere to these principles, it is not being managed using PRINCE2.\n# '''Continued Business Justification''': The business case is the most important document, and is updated at every stage of the project to ensure that the project is still viable.  Early termination can occur if this ceases to be the case.\n# '''Learn From Experience''': each project maintains a lessons log and projects should continually refer to their own and to previous and concurrent projects' lesson logs to avoid reinventing wheels. Unless lessons provoke change, they are only lessons identified (not learned).\n# '''Defined Roles and Responsibilities''': Roles are separated from individuals, who may take on multiple roles or share a role. Roles in PRINCE2 are structured in four levels (corporate or programme management, project board, project manager level and team level). Project Management Team contains the last three, where all primary stakeholders (business, user, supplier) need to be presented.\n# '''Manage by Stages''': the project is planned and controlled on a stage by stage basis. Moving between stages includes updating the business case, risks, overall plan, and detailed next-stage plan in the light of new evidence.\n# '''Manage by Exception''': A PRINCE2 project has defined tolerances (6 aspects above) for each project objective, to establish limits of delegated authority. If a management level forecasts that these tolerances are exceeded (e.g. time of a management stage will be longer than the estimated time in the current management stage). it is escalated to the next management level for a decision how to proceed.\n# '''Focus on Products''': A PRINCE2 project focuses on the definition and delivery of the products, in particular their '''quality requirements'''.\n# '''Tailor to Suit Project Environment''': PRINCE2 is tailored to suit the project environment, size, complexity, importance, time capability and risk. Tailoring is the first activity in the process '''Initiating A Project''' and reviewed for each stage.\nNot every aspect of PRINCE2 will be applicable to every project, thus every process has a note on [[scalability]]. This provides guidance to the project manager (and others involved in the project) as to ''how much'' of the process to apply. The positive aspect of this is that PRINCE2 can be tailored to the needs of a particular project. The negative aspect is that many of the essential elements of PRINCE2 can be omitted sometimes resulting in a PINO project \u2013 Prince in Name Only\n\n===Seven Themes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Theme !! Related to the Principle !! Explanation !! Management Products\n|-\n| 1. Business Case || Continued Business Justification || Establishes mechanisms to judge whether the project is desirable, viable and achievable. ||\n* Business Case\n* Benefits Management Approach\n|-\n| 2.

Starting Up A Project, in which the [[project team]] is appointed including an executive and a [[project manager]], and a project brief is produced <br/>\n2. Initiating A Project, in which the business case refined and [[Project Initiation Documentation]] assembled<br/>\n3. Directing A Project, which dictates the ways in which the Project Board oversees the project<br/>\n4. Controlling A Stage, which dictates how each individual stage should be controlled, including the way in which [[work package]]s are authorised and distributed<br/>\n5. Managing Product Delivery, which has the purpose of controlling the link between the Project Manager and the Team Manager(s) by placing formal requirements on accepting, executing and delivering [[Work (project management)|project work]].<ref>PRINCE2 manual</ref><br/>\n6. [[Managing stage boundaries|Managing Stage Boundaries]], which dictates how to transition from one stage to the next<br/>\n7. Closing A Project, which covers the formal decommissioning of the project, follow-on actions and evaluation of the benefits.\n\n==Management Products==\n\nThe PRINCE2 manual contains 26 suggested templates for documentation associated with the project, which it terms ''management products'' and which are divided into ''baselines'', ''records'' and ''reports''. Some examples of management products are:\n* '''Benefits Management Approach''' (In 2009 Edition it was called '''Benefits Review Plan'''): defines how and when a measurement of the project's benefits, expected by the Senior User, can be made.\n* '''Business Case''': used to capture financial justification for the project. It is a PRINCE2 principle that a project must have continued business justification. As soon as a Business Case fails to make sense, change or stop that project.\n* '''Checkpoint Report''': a progress report created by the Team Manager and sent to the Project Manager on a regular basis to report the status of the Work Package.\n* '''Communications Management Approach''' (In 2009 Edition it was called '''Communications Management Strategy'''): a description of the methods and frequency of communication to stakeholders, covering the flow of information in both directions to and from stakeholders (Information required to be provided from the project and information required to be provided to the project).\n* '''Configuration Item Record''': provides a record of the product History, Status, Version, Variant, Details of any relationships between items/products, and Product owner/Product copy holders.\n* '''Change Control Approach''' (In 2009 Edition it was called '''Configuration Management Strategy'''): used to identify how the project's products will be identified, controlled and protected, this document is created by the Project Manager in the Initiating a Project process.\n* '''Daily Log''': used to record informal issues.\n* '''End Project Report''': reviews how the project performed against the original Project Initiation Documentation (PID)\n* '''Issues Register''': an [[issue log]] of notes about change requests, problems and complaints sent by all project members.\n* '''Lessons Log''': a set of notes of lessons learned which may be useful to future projects\n* '''Project Brief''': used by the Project Board to authorize the Initiation Stage (1st stage of the project). In the Initiating a Project process, the contents of the Project Brief are extended and refined and the Project Brief evolves to form the Project Initiation Documentation ('''PID''')\n* '''Quality Register''': details of all planned [[quality control]] activities, dates, and personnel involved.\n* [[Risk register|'''Risk Register''']]: a record of identified risks (threats and opportunities) relating to the project\n\n==Integration with other techniques==\nThe 26 Management Products described by PRINCE2 are only used for the \"high-level\" management of the project. Within its [[Task (project management)|tasks]], task managers must still decide on their own project management framework.\nSome suggestions given in the PRINCE2 manual are [[product based planning]], [[change control]], quality review technique, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT chart]]s and [[critical path method|critical path]] analysis.\n\nPRINCE2 can also be used to manage projects that use [[agile software development]] methods.<ref name=\"PRINCE2 Agile\">{{cite web |title=PRINCE2 Agile\u00ae |url=https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/prince2/prince2-agile |website=www.axelos.com |publisher=Axelos |accessdate=6 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315054000/https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/prince2/prince2-agile |archive-date=15 March 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===Quality review technique===\n{{See also|Quality assurance}}\nThe quality review technique ensures a project's products are of the required standard (i.e. meet defined quality criteria). This takes place in a quality review meeting, which identifies errors in the product. The quality review meeting will not attempt to solve the problems it identifies. The meeting brings together people who have an interest in the project's outputs (or products) and people on the project team able to address issues identified.\n\n==Differences between 2009 and 2017 versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 2009 version !! 2017 version<ref name=\"PRINCE2 handbook 2017 Edition\" /> || type\n|-\n| Benefits Review Plan || Benefits Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Communication Management Strategy || Communication Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Risk Management Strategy || Risk Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Quality Management Strategy || Quality Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Configuration Management Strategy || Change Control Approach || management product\n|-\n|}\n\n==PRINCE2 Agile==\nPRINCE2 Agile is an extension to the original PRINCE2 how to adapt PRINCE2 so that it can be deployed when utilised with agile behaviours, [[Agile software development|frameworks]] and additional techniques. An [[Agile software development|agile framework]] (e.g. [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]]) is a project environment. This way an agile framework is made manageable by a project management method. Agile frameworks define neither decision-making governance, nor risk management. PRINCE2 on top of an agile framework fills this gap.<ref>{{cite web |title=PRINCE2 Agile\u00ae |url=https://www.axelos.com/store/book/prince2-agile |website=Axelos}}</ref>\n\nBasically it uses the following techniques:<ref name=\"PRINCE2 Agile\" />\n* [[Cynefin framework]] to understand the complexity of the project to find out whether classical, process-based PRINCE2 or agile framework based PRINCE2 shall be used. It is used during the Starting Up a Project and Initiating a Project process.\n* [http://prince2agile.wiki/The_Agilometer Agilometer] as a vehicle to understand how much tailoring and agility to be used in the PRINCE2 project, with focus on estimating the risk response performance of the project. It is reviewed, eventually updated during the Managing Stage Boundary process.\n* [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] for [[Timeboxing|timebox]]-based, [[Kanban]] for flow-based work package management.\n\n== Training and Certifications ==\nPRINCE2 certifications, awarded by AXELOS, require the user to undertake a training course with an Accredited Training Organization (ATO) followed by an exam. The training and exam may be online or in person.<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/qualifications/prince2-qualifications]</ref> AXELOS requires that any organisation providing official PRINCE2 training must go through an accreditation process in order to validate the quality of the course content and delivery. Once approved, the organisation can use the title ''Accredited Training Organisation'' (ATO).<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/find-a-training-provider Find an Accredited Provider]</ref> Trainers must be re-accredited every 3 years and undergo a surveillance check every 12 months.<ref>[http://www.prince-officialsite.com/accreditation/accreditationscheme.aspx \u2013 PRINCE2 accreditation scheme]</ref>\n\nThere are four levels of certifications for PRINCE2:<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/certifications/prince2 PRINCE2 2017 update from AXELOS]</ref> \n# '''PRINCE2\u00ae 2017 Foundation''': confirms the holder has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the PRINCE2 method to be able to work in a project management team working with this method.\n# '''PRINCE2\u00ae 2017 Practitioner''': confirms the holder has achieved sufficient understanding of how to apply PRINCE2 in a scenario situation and will, with suitable direction, be able to start applying the method to a real project. Qualified PRINCE2 Practitioners who go on to study for the APMP qualification of the ''[[Association for Project Management]]'' (APM) are exempt from certain topics of the syllabus that are covered in the PRINCE2 Practitioner qualification.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apm.org.uk/APMP2 |title=- APMP for PRINCE2 Practitioners |access-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101111918/http://www.apm.org.uk/APMP2 |archive-date=1 November 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In the exam 38 out of 68 questions must be answered correctly (55%). If the examinee takes the exam in his native language, the exam duration is 150 minutes. Otherwise it is 188 minutes. The weighting of the questions: 35 questions from the theme, 25 questions from the processes, 8 questions from the principles. The test exams offered by Axelos and test centers include all the aspects of the real exam. It is strongly advised to the examinees to read the book and go through the test exam many times.\n# '''PRINCE2 Agile\u00ae Foundation''': was released in June 2018 and confirms the holder has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the PRINCE2 method and agile way of working and how agile can be combined to PRINCE2.\n# '''PRINCE2 Agile\u00ae Practitioner''': confirms the holder is able to apply the project management principles of PRINCE2 whilst combining [[Agile software development|agile]] concepts such as [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]].\n\nThe PRINCE2 ''(Project in Controlled Environments'') certification is recongnized globally for its practice- driven approach to project management. AXELOS publishes a successful candidate register which can be searched on the web.<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/successful-candidates-register AXELOS Successful Candidates Register]</ref> In the PRINCE2 certification, there are different level that are necessary for the application to pass for becoming certified PRINCE2 professional.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/business/overview-of-prince2-project-management-methodology/|title=Overview of Prince2 project management methodology|last=Matters|first=Business|date=3 January 2019|website=Business Matters|language=en-GB|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages and criticisms==\nPRINCE2 provides a method for managing projects within a clearly defined framework, but project management is a complex discipline and using such a framework is no guarantee of a successful project.\n\nSome of the advertised benefits of PRINCE2 are: increased quality of the finished products, efficient control of resources, avoidance of either \"heroic\" (under-regulated) or \"mechanistic\" (over-regulated) working, and increased confidence among the project team.\n\nPRINCE2 is sometimes considered inappropriate for small projects or where requirements are expected to change, due to the work required in creating and maintaining documents, logs and lists. The deliverable structure may also lead to focus on producing deliverables for their own sake, to \"tick the boxes\" rather than do more useful work.\n\nThe general response of PRINCE2's authors to criticism has been to point out that the methodology is scalable and can be tailored to suit the specific requirements and constraints of the project and the environment.<ref>[http://www.best-management-practice.com/Knowledge-Centre/Best-Practice-Guidance/PRINCE2/ OGC Best Management Practice \u2013 PRINCE2]</ref> This strong emphasis on tailoring has led some users to complain that PRINCE2 is [[Falsifiable|unfalsifiable]], i.e. it is impossible to tell whether PRINCE2 \"works\" or constitutes \"best practice\" if any problems encountered with a project can be blamed on inappropriate application of PRINCE2 rather than on PRINCE2 itself.\n\nThe experiences of the [[Blair administration]] in the UK between 1997 and 2007 (and of subsequent UK governments) arguably undermine PRINCE2's claim to be \"best practice\", given the string of high-profile failed IT projects charged to the taxpayer during that time,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-blair-it-projects/|title=The Blair IT projects|website=ZDNet.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Blunders of our Governments|year=2013|isbn=978-1780742663}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/19/costly-trail-british-government-it-disasters-universal-credit|title=The costly trail of British government IT and 'big bang' project disasters|website=theguardian.com}}</ref> and the controversy surrounding the financial relationship between the Blair government and PRINCE2's co-owners [[Capita]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2935817/Blair-avoids-MPs-questions-on-Capita.html|title=Blair avoids MPs' questions on Capita|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/24/uk.partyfunding|title=Capita chairman quits after criticism of loans to Labour|website=theguardian.com}}</ref> PRINCE2's training material addresses these failures, blaming them on inappropriate tailoring of PRINCE2 to the project environment, and advocating for more PRINCE2 training for government project managers to solve the problem.\n\n== Differences from PMP ==\n[[Project Management Professional]] (PMP) may be seen as a competitor of PRINCE2. In general, UK, Australia and Europe prefer PRINCE2, and the US and American countries prefer PMP. Asia, Africa and the Middle East area have no strong preference for PMP or PRINCE2.\nThe important thing is that PMP (PMBOK) can be used with PRINCE2.\n\nPRINCE2 and PMP acknowledge each other's existence in their advertising material and attempt to position themselves as complementary products \u2013 PRINCE2 as a \"methodology\" and PMP as a \"standard\"<ref name=\"PMI_PMBOK\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pmi.org/certification/~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_pmphandbook.ashx\n |title=Project Management Professional (PMP) \u00ae Handbook\n |publisher=[[Project Management Institute]] \n |accessdate=18 September 2009\n}}</ref> \u2013 which can be used alongside each other.

PRINCE2 is the second edition of the earlier PRINCE method which was initially announced and developed in 1989 by [[Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency|CCTA]] ''(the'' ''central computer and Telecommunications Agency''), a UK government support agency.<ref>https://mymanagementguide.com/prince2-methodology-overview-history-definition-meaning-benefits-certification/</ref> PRINCE2 was released in 1996 as a generic project management method.<ref>{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.ogc.gov.uk/news_2005_4333.asp | title = OGC brings its shining quartet back into the limelight | date = 14 December 2005 | publisher = [[Office of Government Commerce]]}}</ref> PRINCE2 has become increasingly popular and is now a ''de facto'' standard for project management in many UK government departments and across the [[United Nations system]].\n\nThere have been two major revisions of PRINCE2 since its launch in 1996: \"PRINCE2:2009 Refresh\" in 2009, and \"PRINCE2 2017 Update\" in 2017. The justification for the 2017 update was the evolutions in practical business practices and feedback from PRINCE2 practitioners in the actual project environment.<ref>{{cite pressrelease | url = https://www.axelos.com/prince2-2017 | title =Introducing the PRINCE2 2017 Update | date = 11 December 2017 | publisher =Axelos}}</ref> The second edition was announced and released in 1996 as a generic ''[[Project management|PM]] methodology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mymanagementguide.com/prince2-methodology-overview-history-definition-meaning-benefits-certification/|title=PRINCE2 Methodology Overview: History, Definition & Meaning, Benefits, Certification|last=Lewinson|first=Mary|language=en-US|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>''\n\n==Overview of PRINCE2==\n\n===Six Aspects===\n\nThese aspects are also called '''tolerances''' or '''performance goals'''. They quantify the project tolerance and are considered during decision-making processes. In some organizations these can be [[Performance indicator|KPI]]s. In the following table project level tolerances are summarized:<ref name=\"PRINCE2 handbook 2017 Edition\">{{cite web |title=Managing Successful Projects with PRINCE2, 2017 Edition |url=https://www.axelos.com/store/book/managing-successful-projects-with-prince2-2017 |website=Axelos}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Tolerance Type !! Maintained in the project level !! Example\n|-\n| Scope || [[Project Plan]] || The printer should print the documents only in black/white\n|-\n| Timescale || Project Plan || The project/stage/team plan cannot last longer than 3 months\n|-\n| Risk || [[Risk Management Approach]] || Printer might not work if it is in water\n|-\n| Quality || [[Project Product Description]] || Printer should print at least 10 different standard page sizes \n|-\n| Benefits || [[Business Case]] || Printer should be set up by the customer 10% faster than the ones from the competitors, and it must be 10% cheaper\n|-\n| Cost || [[Project Plan]] || The cost of the project should not exceed \u00a3100,000\n|}\n\nBenefits can have as target the cost of the benefit, but the cost tolerance above is related to the cost of the project, not the cost of the benefit.\n\nEach management level is checked against these tolerances, coming from the upper level.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Management Level !! Tolerance type authorized to the lower level !! Exception type addressed to upper level !! plan type\n|-\n| Corporate/Programme || project tolerance || n/a || programme\n|-\n| Project Board || stage tolerance || project exception || project plan\n|-\n| Project Manager || work package tolerance || stage exception || stage plan\n|-\n| Team Manager || n/a || issue || team plan\n|}\n\n===Seven Principles===\nPRINCE2 is based on seven principles and these cannot be tailored. The PRINCE2 principles can be described as a [[mindset]] that keeps the project aligned with the PRINCE2 methodology. If a project does not adhere to these principles, it is not being managed using PRINCE2.\n# '''Continued Business Justification''': The business case is the most important document, and is updated at every stage of the project to ensure that the project is still viable.  Early termination can occur if this ceases to be the case.\n# '''Learn From Experience''': each project maintains a lessons log and projects should continually refer to their own and to previous and concurrent projects' lesson logs to avoid reinventing wheels. Unless lessons provoke change, they are only lessons identified (not learned).\n# '''Defined Roles and Responsibilities''': Roles are separated from individuals, who may take on multiple roles or share a role. Roles in PRINCE2 are structured in four levels (corporate or programme management, project board, project manager level and team level). Project Management Team contains the last three, where all primary stakeholders (business, user, supplier) need to be presented.\n# '''Manage by Stages''': the project is planned and controlled on a stage by stage basis. Moving between stages includes updating the business case, risks, overall plan, and detailed next-stage plan in the light of new evidence.\n# '''Manage by Exception''': A PRINCE2 project has defined tolerances (6 aspects above) for each project objective, to establish limits of delegated authority. If a management level forecasts that these tolerances are exceeded (e.g. time of a management stage will be longer than the estimated time in the current management stage). it is escalated to the next management level for a decision how to proceed.\n# '''Focus on Products''': A PRINCE2 project focuses on the definition and delivery of the products, in particular their '''quality requirements'''.\n# '''Tailor to Suit Project Environment''': PRINCE2 is tailored to suit the project environment, size, complexity, importance, time capability and risk. Tailoring is the first activity in the process '''Initiating A Project''' and reviewed for each stage.\nNot every aspect of PRINCE2 will be applicable to every project, thus every process has a note on [[scalability]]. This provides guidance to the project manager (and others involved in the project) as to ''how much'' of the process to apply. The positive aspect of this is that PRINCE2 can be tailored to the needs of a particular project. The negative aspect is that many of the essential elements of PRINCE2 can be omitted sometimes resulting in a PINO project \u2013 Prince in Name Only\n\n===Seven Themes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Starting Up A Project, in which the [[project team]] is appointed including an executive and a [[project manager]], and a project brief is produced <br/>\n2. Initiating A Project, in which the business case refined and [[Project Initiation Documentation]] assembled<br/>\n3. Directing A Project, which dictates the ways in which the Project Board oversees the project<br/>\n4. Controlling A Stage, which dictates how each individual stage should be controlled, including the way in which [[work package]]s are authorised and distributed<br/>\n5. Managing Product Delivery, which has the purpose of controlling the link between the Project Manager and the Team Manager(s) by placing formal requirements on accepting, executing and delivering [[Work (project management)|project work]].<ref>PRINCE2 manual</ref><br/>\n6. [[Managing stage boundaries|Managing Stage Boundaries]], which dictates how to transition from one stage to the next<br/>\n7. Closing A Project, which covers the formal decommissioning of the project, follow-on actions and evaluation of the benefits.\n\n==Management Products==\n\nThe PRINCE2 manual contains 26 suggested templates for documentation associated with the project, which it terms ''management products'' and which are divided into ''baselines'', ''records'' and ''reports''. Some examples of management products are:\n* '''Benefits Management Approach''' (In 2009 Edition it was called '''Benefits Review Plan'''): defines how and when a measurement of the project's benefits, expected by the Senior User, can be made.\n* '''Business Case''': used to capture financial justification for the project. It is a PRINCE2 principle that a project must have continued business justification. As soon as a Business Case fails to make sense, change or stop that project.\n* '''Checkpoint Report''': a progress report created by the Team Manager and sent to the Project Manager on a regular basis to report the status of the Work Package.\n* '''Communications Management Approach''' (In 2009 Edition it was called '''Communications Management Strategy'''): a description of the methods and frequency of communication to stakeholders, covering the flow of information in both directions to and from stakeholders (Information required to be provided from the project and information required to be provided to the project).\n* '''Configuration Item Record''': provides a record of the product History, Status, Version, Variant, Details of any relationships between items/products, and Product owner/Product copy holders.\n* '''Change Control Approach''' (In 2009 Edition it was called '''Configuration Management Strategy'''): used to identify how the project's products will be identified, controlled and protected, this document is created by the Project Manager in the Initiating a Project process.\n* '''Daily Log''': used to record informal issues.\n* '''End Project Report''': reviews how the project performed against the original Project Initiation Documentation (PID)\n* '''Issues Register''': an [[issue log]] of notes about change requests, problems and complaints sent by all project members.\n* '''Lessons Log''': a set of notes of lessons learned which may be useful to future projects\n* '''Project Brief''': used by the Project Board to authorize the Initiation Stage (1st stage of the project). In the Initiating a Project process, the contents of the Project Brief are extended and refined and the Project Brief evolves to form the Project Initiation Documentation ('''PID''')\n* '''Quality Register''': details of all planned [[quality control]] activities, dates, and personnel involved.\n* [[Risk register|'''Risk Register''']]: a record of identified risks (threats and opportunities) relating to the project\n\n==Integration with other techniques==\nThe 26 Management Products described by PRINCE2 are only used for the \"high-level\" management of the project. Within its [[Task (project management)|tasks]], task managers must still decide on their own project management framework.\nSome suggestions given in the PRINCE2 manual are [[product based planning]], [[change control]], quality review technique, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT chart]]s and [[critical path method|critical path]] analysis.\n\nPRINCE2 can also be used to manage projects that use [[agile software development]] methods.<ref name=\"PRINCE2 Agile\">{{cite web |title=PRINCE2\u00ae Agile |url=https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/prince2/prince2-agile |website=www.axelos.com |publisher=Axelos |accessdate=6 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315054000/https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/prince2/prince2-agile |archive-date=15 March 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===Quality review technique===\n{{See also|Quality assurance}}\nThe quality review technique ensures a project's products are of the required standard (i.e. meet defined quality criteria). This takes place in a quality review meeting, which identifies errors in the product. The quality review meeting will not attempt to solve the problems it identifies. The meeting brings together people who have an interest in the project's outputs (or products) and people on the project team able to address issues identified.\n\n==Differences between 2009 and 2017 versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 2009 version !! 2017 version<ref name=\"PRINCE2 handbook 2017 Edition\" /> || type\n|-\n| Benefits Review Plan || Benefits Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Communication Management Strategy || Communication Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Risk Management Strategy || Risk Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Quality Management Strategy || Quality Management Approach || management product\n|-\n| Configuration Management Strategy || Change Control Approach || management product\n|-\n|}\n\n==PRINCE2 Agile==\nPRINCE2 Agile is an extension to the original PRINCE2 how to adapt PRINCE2 so that it can be deployed when utilised with agile behaviours, [[Agile software development|frameworks]] and additional techniques. An [[Agile software development|agile framework]] (e.g. [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]]) is a project environment. This way an agile framework is made manageable by a project management method. Agile frameworks define neither decision-making governance, nor risk management. PRINCE2 on top of an agile framework fills this gap.<ref>{{cite web |title=PRINCE2 Agile\u00ae |url=https://www.axelos.com/store/book/prince2-agile |website=Axelos}}</ref>\n\nBasically it uses the following techniques:<ref name=\"PRINCE2 Agile\" />\n* [[Cynefin framework]] to understand the complexity of the project to find out whether classical, process-based PRINCE2 or agile framework based PRINCE2 shall be used. It is used during the Starting Up a Project and Initiating a Project process.\n* [http://prince2agile.wiki/The_Agilometer Agilometer] as a vehicle to understand how much tailoring and agility to be used in the PRINCE2 project, with focus on estimating the risk response performance of the project. It is reviewed, eventually updated during the Managing Stage Boundary process.\n* [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] for [[Timeboxing|timebox]]-based, [[Kanban]] for flow-based work package management.\n\n== Training and Certifications ==\nPRINCE2 certifications, awarded by AXELOS, require the user to undertake a training course with an Accredited Training Organization (ATO) followed by an exam. The training and exam may be online or in person.<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/qualifications/prince2-qualifications]</ref> AXELOS requires that any organisation providing official PRINCE2 training must go through an accreditation process in order to validate the quality of the course content and delivery. Once approved, the organisation can use the title ''Accredited Training Organisation'' (ATO).<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/find-a-training-provider Find an Accredited Provider]</ref> Trainers must be re-accredited every 3 years and undergo a surveillance check every 12 months.<ref>[http://www.prince-officialsite.com/accreditation/accreditationscheme.aspx \u2013 PRINCE2 accreditation scheme]</ref>\n\nThere are four levels of certifications for PRINCE2:<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/certifications/prince2 PRINCE2 2017 update from AXELOS]</ref> \n# '''PRINCE2\u00ae 2017 Foundation''': confirms the holder has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the PRINCE2 method to be able to work in a project management team working with this method.\n# '''PRINCE2\u00ae 2017 Practitioner''': confirms the holder has achieved sufficient understanding of how to apply PRINCE2 in a scenario situation and will, with suitable direction, be able to start applying the method to a real project. Qualified PRINCE2 Practitioners who go on to study for the APMP qualification of the ''[[Association for Project Management]]'' (APM) are exempt from certain topics of the syllabus that are covered in the PRINCE2 Practitioner qualification.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apm.org.uk/APMP2 |title=- APMP for PRINCE2 Practitioners |access-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101111918/http://www.apm.org.uk/APMP2 |archive-date=1 November 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In the exam 38 out of 68 questions must be answered correctly (55%). If the examinee takes the exam in his native language, the exam duration is 150 minutes. Otherwise it is 188 minutes. The weighting of the questions: 35 questions from the theme, 25 questions from the processes, 8 questions from the principles. The test exams offered by Axelos and test centers include all the aspects of the real exam. It is strongly advised to the examinees to read the book and go through the test exam many times.\n# '''PRINCE2\u00ae Agile Foundation''': was released in June 2018 and confirms the holder has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the PRINCE2 method and agile way of working and how agile can be combined to PRINCE2.\n# '''PRINCE2\u00ae Agile Practitioner''': confirms the holder is able to apply the project management principles of PRINCE2 whilst combining [[Agile software development|agile]] concepts such as [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]].\n\nThe PRINCE2 ''(Project in Controlled Environments'') certification is recongnized globally for its practice- driven approach to project management. AXELOS publishes a successful candidate register which can be searched on the web.<ref>[https://www.axelos.com/successful-candidates-register AXELOS Successful Candidates Register]</ref> In the PRINCE2 certification, there are different level that are necessary for the application to pass for becoming certified PRINCE2 professional.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/business/overview-of-prince2-project-management-methodology/|title=Overview of Prince2 project management methodology|last=Matters|first=Business|date=3 January 2019|website=Business Matters|language=en-GB|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages and criticisms==\nPRINCE2 provides a method for managing projects within a clearly defined framework, but project management is a complex discipline and using such a framework is no guarantee of a successful project.\n\nSome of the advertised benefits of PRINCE2 are: increased quality of the finished products, efficient control of resources, avoidance of either \"heroic\" (under-regulated) or \"mechanistic\" (over-regulated) working, and increased confidence among the project team.\n\nPRINCE2 is sometimes considered inappropriate for small projects or where requirements are expected to change, due to the work required in creating and maintaining documents, logs and lists. The deliverable structure may also lead to focus on producing deliverables for their own sake, to \"tick the boxes\" rather than do more useful work.\n\nThe general response of PRINCE2's authors to criticism has been to point out that the methodology is scalable and can be tailored to suit the specific requirements and constraints of the project and the environment.<ref>[http://www.best-management-practice.com/Knowledge-Centre/Best-Practice-Guidance/PRINCE2/ OGC Best Management Practice \u2013 PRINCE2]</ref> This strong emphasis on tailoring has led some users to complain that PRINCE2 is [[Falsifiable|unfalsifiable]], i.e. it is impossible to tell whether PRINCE2 \"works\" or constitutes \"best practice\" if any problems encountered with a project can be blamed on inappropriate application of PRINCE2 rather than on PRINCE2 itself.\n\nThe experiences of the [[Blair administration]] in the UK between 1997 and 2007 (and of subsequent UK governments) arguably undermine PRINCE2's claim to be \"best practice\", given the string of high-profile failed IT projects charged to the taxpayer during that time,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-blair-it-projects/|title=The Blair IT projects|website=ZDNet.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Blunders of our Governments|year=2013|isbn=978-1780742663}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/19/costly-trail-british-government-it-disasters-universal-credit|title=The costly trail of British government IT and 'big bang' project disasters|website=theguardian.com}}</ref> and the controversy surrounding the financial relationship between the Blair government and PRINCE2's co-owners [[Capita]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2935817/Blair-avoids-MPs-questions-on-Capita.html|title=Blair avoids MPs' questions on Capita|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/24/uk.partyfunding|title=Capita chairman quits after criticism of loans to Labour|website=theguardian.com}}</ref> PRINCE2's training material addresses these failures, blaming them on inappropriate tailoring of PRINCE2 to the project environment, and advocating for more PRINCE2 training for government project managers to solve the problem.\n\n== Differences from PMP ==\n[[Project Management Professional]] (PMP) may be seen as a competitor of PRINCE2. In general, UK, Australia and Europe prefer PRINCE2, and the US and American countries prefer PMP. Asia, Africa and the Middle East area have no strong preference for PMP or PRINCE2.\nThe important thing is that PMP (PMBOK) can be used with PRINCE2.\n\nPRINCE2 and PMP acknowledge each other's existence in their advertising material and attempt to position themselves as complementary products \u2013 PRINCE2 as a \"methodology\" and PMP as a \"standard\"<ref name=\"PMI_PMBOK\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pmi.org/certification/~/media/pdf/certifications/pdc_pmphandbook.ashx\n |title=Project Management Professional (PMP) \u00ae Handbook\n |publisher=[[Project Management Institute]] \n |accessdate=18 September 2009\n}}</ref> \u2013 which can be used alongside each other.

With Saosin, Reber recorded The Grey EP, [[Saosin (EP)|Saosin EP]] and notably ''[[Saosin (album)|Saosin]]'' (2006) and ''[[In Search of Solid Ground]]'' (2009) with the inclusion of the live album and DVD [[Come Close (album)|Come Close]] at The Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on  November 3, 2007.\n\nReber was asked to leave Saosin in early 2010.

In 2004, the members of that very band that I was madly in love with took a giant risk and gave me, the worlds biggest Saosin fan, a shot. I got to play and make music with my heroes. Even now, Justin, Alex, Beau and Chris are living legends in my mind. It\u2019s not very often that you hear someone say that they had the amazing privilege of working with people they so highly admire and respect.\n\nBut all bands have their problems and we were no exception. It all started with one comment directed towards me. That seemingly small comment completely drained every ounce of confidence I had worked so hard to build up. Not only did it completely catch me off guard, but not one of my heroes stood up for me, let alone acknowledged that the comment made was truly uncalled for. Thinking you\u2019ve let your heroes down in even the smallest way really freaking sucks.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if any of you feel ripped off from my live performances- I take that to heart because every night that I get up on stage, I\u2019m doing it for you guys- for the fans who come to our shows and show us support. As far as smoking goes, it\u2019s not something I intentionally hid but it\u2019s definitely not a habit I wanted to broadcast or promote. Let me make this crystal clear, it\u2019s not a cool thing to do. Anyone who says it is \u201ccool\u201d is flat out lying to you. We all have our demons and this is one I struggle with.\n\nFor a while now, I had been feeling like it was only a matter of time until my end with Saosin was going to come. I\u2019m just glad I got to sing, write, and record songs with my heroes. For those of you who feel like my role in Saosin was a dominant one, for better or for worse, it wasn\u2019t; every decision we made, we made together. Whether you feel like my departure is positive or negative, I really do wish Justin, Beau, Chris and Alex the best of luck and I will always support them in all that they do.\n\nNow that that\u2019s off my chest, life has been treating me awesome these days. The passion and love for music I felt I had lost is back, my confidence is growing daily, and I really can\u2019t wait to show you all what I\u2019ve been working on. Thank you all for giving me the wonderful opportunity to live out my dream over the last 6 years. It was one hell of a ride, but I truly believe that the best is yet to come.\".\n|author=thealterpress.com |title=\"Cove Reber Addresses Departure\" |source=''http://www.alterthepress.com/2010/08/cove-reber-addresses-saosin-departure.html'' (2010)\n}}\n\n===Patriot (2011-2016)===\n\nAfter leaving Saosin in 2010, Reber started a project titled Patriot with Joey Bradford and Kyle Rosa.

With Saosin, Reber recorded The Grey EP, [[Saosin (EP)|Saosin EP]] and notably ''[[Saosin (album)|Saosin]]'' (2006) and ''[[In Search of Solid Ground]]'' (2009) with the inclusion of the live album and DVD [[Come Close (album)|Come Close]] at The Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on  November 3, 2007.\n\nReber was asked to leave Saosin in early 2010. Later reports from the band cited that Reber was asked to leave Saosin due to the deterioration of his stage and vocal performance and he could no longer perform.<ref>http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/saosin_speak_about_kicking_out_cove</ref> Reber later addressed his departure by saying the following:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"In 2003, I fell in love with a band that not only changed the way that I viewed music, but also inspired me to pursue my dreams. In 2004, the members of that very band that I was madly in love with took a giant risk and gave me, the worlds biggest Saosin fan, a shot. I got to play and make music with my heroes. Even now, Justin, Alex, Beau and Chris are living legends in my mind. It\u2019s not very often that you hear someone say that they had the amazing privilege of working with people they so highly admire and respect.\n\nBut all bands have their problems and we were no exception. It all started with one comment directed towards me. That seemingly small comment completely drained every ounce of confidence I had worked so hard to build up. Not only did it completely catch me off guard, but not one of my heroes stood up for me, let alone acknowledged that the comment made was truly uncalled for. Thinking you\u2019ve let your heroes down in even the smallest way really freaking sucks.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if any of you feel ripped off from my live performances- I take that to heart because every night that I get up on stage, I\u2019m doing it for you guys- for the fans who come to our shows and show us support. As far as smoking goes, it\u2019s not something I intentionally hid but it\u2019s definitely not a habit I wanted to broadcast or promote. Let me make this crystal clear, it\u2019s not a cool thing to do. Anyone who says it is \u201ccool\u201d is flat out lying to you. We all have our demons and this is one I struggle with.\n\nFor a while now, I had been feeling like it was only a matter of time until my end with Saosin was going to come. I\u2019m just glad I got to sing, write, and record songs with my heroes. For those of you who feel like my role in Saosin was a dominant one, for better or for worse, it wasn\u2019t; every decision we made, we made together. Whether you feel like my departure is positive or negative, I really do wish Justin, Beau, Chris and Alex the best of luck and I will always support them in all that they do.\n\nNow that that\u2019s off my chest, life has been treating me awesome these days. The passion and love for music I felt I had lost is back, my confidence is growing daily, and I really can\u2019t wait to show you all what I\u2019ve been working on. Thank you all for giving me the wonderful opportunity to live out my dream over the last 6 years. It was one hell of a ride, but I truly believe that the best is yet to come.\".\n|author=thealterpress.com |title=\"Cove Reber Addresses Departure\" |source=''http://www.alterthepress.com/2010/08/cove-reber-addresses-saosin-departure.html'' (2010)\n}}\n\n===Patriot (2011-2016)===\n\nAfter leaving Saosin in 2010, Reber started a project titled Patriot with Joey Bradford and Kyle Rosa.

The [[tughra]]s were the calligraphic seals or signatures used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The \"Notes\" column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between the moment a sultan's reign ended and the moment his successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as \"[[survival of the fittest]], not eldest, son\": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous [[fratricide]]s that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the accession date of his successor.<ref>[[#Qua05|Quataert 2005]], p. 91</ref> In 1617, the [[Line of succession to the Ottoman throne|law of succession]] changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on [[agnatic seniority]] ({{lang|ota-Arab|\u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062a}} ''ekberiyet''), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother.<ref>[[#Qua05|Quataert 2005]], p. 92</ref> Agnatic seniority was retained until the [[Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate|abolition of the sultanate]], despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with [[primogeniture]].<ref>[[#Kar05|Karateke 2005]], pp. 37\u201354</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | \u2116\n! width=\"20%\" |

The title of [[sultan]] was used continuously by all rulers almost from the beginning. However, because it was widespread in the Muslim world, the Ottomans quickly adopted variations of it to dissociate themselves from other Muslim rulers of lesser status. [[Murad I]], the third Ottoman monarch, styled himself ''sult\u00e2n-\u0131 \u00e2zam'' ({{lang|ota|\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645}}, the most exalted sultan) and ''h\u00fcdavendigar'' ({{lang|ota|\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0631}}, emperor), titles used by the Anatolian [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and the Mongol [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] respectively. His son [[Bayezid I]] adopted the style ''Sultan of R\u00fbm'', [[R\u00fbm]] being an old Islamic name for the Roman Empire. The combining of the Islamic and Central Asian heritages of the Ottomans led to the adoption of the title that became the standard designation of the Ottoman ruler: ''Sultan [Name] Khan''.<ref>[[#Pei93|Peirce 1993]], pp. 158\u2013159</ref> Ironically, although the title of sultan is most often associated in the [[Western world]] with the Ottomans, people within Turkey generally use the title of ''[[padishah]]'' far more frequently when referring to rulers of the Ottoman Dynasty.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = M'Gregor | first = J. |date=July 1854 | title = The Race, Religions, and Government of the Ottoman Empire |magazine=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art | volume = 32 |page=376 | publisher = Leavitt, Trow, & Co. | location = New York | oclc = 6298914 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1MYRAAAAYAAJ&printsec=toc#PPA376,M1 | accessdate = 2009-04-25}}</ref>\n:'''b'''{{note label|Caliphate||1}}{{note label|Caliphate||2}}{{note label|Caliphate||3}}: The [[Ottoman Caliphate]] was one of the most important positions held by rulers of the Ottoman Dynasty.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The caliphate symbolized their spiritual power, whereas the sultanate represented their temporal power. According to Ottoman [[historiography]], [[Murad I]] adopted the title of caliph during his reign (1362 to 1389), and [[Selim I]] later strengthened the caliphal authority during his [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|conquest of Egypt]] in 1516-1517. However, the general consensus among modern scholars is that Ottoman rulers had used the title of caliph before the conquest of Egypt, as early as during the reign of [[Murad I]] (1362\u20131389), who brought most of the Balkans under Ottoman rule and established the title of sultan in 1383. It is currently agreed that the caliphate \"disappeared\" for two-and-a-half centuries, before being revived with the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]], signed between the Ottoman Empire and [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1774. The treaty was highly symbolic, since it marked the first international recognition of the Ottomans' claim to the caliphate. Although the treaty made official the Ottoman Empire's loss of the [[Crimean Khanate]], it acknowledged the Ottoman caliph's continuing religious authority over [[Islam in Russia|Muslims in Russia]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Glass\u00e9, Cyril | encyclopedia = The New Encyclopedia of Islam | title = Ottomans | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&printsec=frontcover#PPA349,M1 | accessdate = 2009-05-02 | year = 2003 | publisher = AltaMira Press | location = Walnut Creek, CA | isbn = 978-0-7591-0190-6 | oclc = 52611080 | pages = 349\u2013351}}</ref> From the 18th century onwards, Ottoman sultans increasingly emphasized their status as caliphs in order to stir [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] sentiments among the empire's Muslims in the face of encroaching European imperialism.

Some of these works were used to commemorate individuals, while others were formed to advance the needs of the state through infrastructure such as schools, dams, or libraries<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

Others, like Selim I, spent much of their time out on campaign, and had less of a focus on architectural feats. Some Sultans, such as Ahmed III, were coerced by epidemics and other societal developments into pursuing architectural improvement projects in order to serve the needs of the Empire<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

Some examples of this include the changes in the number and size of cupolas, the style of courtyards, the eventual introduction of free-standing libraries, and the advancement of aqua-duct and dam work.\n\n'''Notable Mosques'''\n\nFatih Mosque and the Blue Mosque are among the more famous mosques constructed by Sultans. The Fatih Mosque was originally built under \u201cThe Conqueror\u201d, Mehmed II, in the mid-1400s AD in hopes of rivaling the greatness of the Hagia Sofia<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

This act was a significant show of power following the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. Due to severe earthquakes in the region in 1766, the Fatih Mosque was damaged and had to undergo reconstruction in the early 1770s under Mustafa III\u2019s Sultanate<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

The mosque in part gains its name from its stunning interior and exterior blue attributes, and placement near the seashore of Istanbul. To this day, the mosque dominates the sea-side view of Istanbul.\n\nThe Blue Mosque was notably constructed on the opposite hill of the Hagia Sofia, and both mosques played a part in the political developments of the Kadizadeli movement spanning much of the 17th century. While the Hagia Sofia preached towards a puritanical movement, the Blue Mosque preached the Sufi order<ref>Zilfi, Madeline C. \u201cThe Kadizadelis: Discordant Revivalism in Seventeenth-Century Istanbul\u201d.

The power of two mosques in the same relative neighborhood preaching different interpretations of muslim faith invited political, religious, and social discourse in Istanbul that at times served as a threat to the power of the Sultan<ref>Zilfi, Madeline C. \u201cThe Kadizadelis: Discordant Revivalism in Seventeenth-Century Istanbul\u201d. Journal of Near Eastern Studies Vol. 45, No.4, (October, 1986): 251-269.</ref>.\n\nAn important thing to note is that while the Hagia Sofia was an influential mosque in Ottoman history, and is well-known to this day, the mosque was actually not built by the Ottomans themselves. The Hagia Sofia was converted into a mosque from a church following the capture of Constantinople in 1453, when control of the area moved from the hands of the Byzantines to the Ottomans.\n\n\n'''Major Architectural Works of Sultanates'''\n\nBelow is a chart of several major architectural projects, listed by sultanate<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

The [[tughra]]s were the calligraphic seals or signatures used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The \"Notes\" column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between the moment a sultan's reign ended and the moment his successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as \"[[survival of the fittest]], not eldest, son\": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous [[fratricide]]s that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the accession date of his successor.<ref>[[#Qua05|Quataert 2005]], p. 91</ref> In 1617, the [[Line of succession to the Ottoman throne|law of succession]] changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on [[agnatic seniority]] ({{lang|ota-Arab|\u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062a}} ''ekberiyet''), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother.<ref>[[#Qua05|Quataert 2005]], p. 92</ref> Agnatic seniority was retained until the [[Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate|abolition of the sultanate]], despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with

The title of [[sultan]] was used continuously by all rulers almost from the beginning. However, because it was widespread in the Muslim world, the Ottomans quickly adopted variations of it to dissociate themselves from other Muslim rulers of lesser status. [[Murad I]], the third Ottoman monarch, styled himself ''sult\u00e2n-\u0131 \u00e2zam'' ({{lang|ota|\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645}}, the most exalted sultan) and ''h\u00fcdavendigar'' ({{lang|ota|\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0631}}, emperor), titles used by the Anatolian [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and the Mongol [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] respectively. His son [[Bayezid I]] adopted the style ''Sultan of R\u00fbm'', [[R\u00fbm]] being an old Islamic name for the Roman Empire. The combining of the Islamic and Central Asian heritages of the Ottomans led to the adoption of the title that became the standard designation of the Ottoman ruler: ''Sultan [Name] Khan''.<ref>[[#Pei93|Peirce 1993]], pp. 158\u2013159</ref> Ironically, although the title of sultan is most often associated in the [[Western world]] with the Ottomans, people within Turkey generally use the title of ''[[padishah]]'' far more frequently when referring to rulers of the Ottoman Dynasty.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = M'Gregor | first = J. |date=July 1854 | title = The Race, Religions, and Government of the Ottoman Empire |magazine=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art | volume = 32 |page=376 | publisher = Leavitt, Trow, & Co. | location = New York | oclc = 6298914 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1MYRAAAAYAAJ&printsec=toc#PPA376,M1 | accessdate = 2009-04-25}}</ref>\n:'''b'''{{note label|Caliphate||1}}{{note label|Caliphate||2}}{{note label|Caliphate||3}}: The [[Ottoman Caliphate]] was one of the most important positions held by rulers of the Ottoman Dynasty.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The caliphate symbolized their spiritual power, whereas the sultanate represented their temporal power. According to Ottoman [[historiography]], [[Murad I]] adopted the title of caliph during his reign (1362 to 1389), and [[Selim I]] later strengthened the caliphal authority during his [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|conquest of Egypt]] in 1516-1517. However, the general consensus among modern scholars is that Ottoman rulers had used the title of caliph before the conquest of Egypt, as early as during the reign of [[Murad I]] (1362\u20131389), who brought most of the Balkans under Ottoman rule and established the title of sultan in 1383. It is currently agreed that the caliphate \"disappeared\" for two-and-a-half centuries, before being revived with the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]], signed between the Ottoman Empire and [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1774. The treaty was highly symbolic, since it marked the first international recognition of the Ottomans' claim to the caliphate. Although the treaty made official the Ottoman Empire's loss of the [[Crimean Khanate]], it acknowledged the Ottoman caliph's continuing religious authority over [[Islam in Russia|Muslims in Russia]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Glass\u00e9, Cyril | encyclopedia = The New Encyclopedia of Islam | title = Ottomans | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&printsec=frontcover#PPA349,M1 | accessdate = 2009-05-02 | year = 2003 | publisher = AltaMira Press | location = Walnut Creek, CA | isbn = 978-0-7591-0190-6 | oclc = 52611080 | pages = 349\u2013351}}</ref> From the 18th century onwards, Ottoman sultans increasingly emphasized their status as caliphs in order to stir [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] sentiments among the empire's Muslims in the face of encroaching European imperialism.

Some of these works were used to commemorate individuals, while others were formed to advance the needs of the state through infrastructure such as schools, dams, or libraries<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

Others, like Selim I, spent much of their time out on campaign, and had less of a focus on architectural feats. Some Sultans, such as Ahmed III, were coerced by epidemics and other societal developments into pursuing architectural improvement projects in order to serve the needs of the Empire<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

Some examples of this include the changes in the number and size of cupolas, the style of courtyards, the eventual introduction of free-standing libraries, and the advancement of aqua-duct and dam work.\n\n'''Notable Mosques'''\n\nFatih Mosque and the Blue Mosque are among the more famous mosques constructed by Sultans. The Fatih Mosque was originally built under \u201cThe Conqueror\u201d, Mehmed II, in the mid-1400s AD in hopes of rivaling the greatness of the Hagia Sofia<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019. In Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, edited by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs, P.J. Bearman (Volumes X, XI, XII), Th.

This act was a significant show of power following the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. Due to severe earthquakes in the region in 1766, the Fatih Mosque was damaged and had to undergo reconstruction in the early 1770s under Mustafa III\u2019s Sultanate<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

The mosque in part gains its name from its stunning interior and exterior blue attributes, and placement near the seashore of Istanbul. To this day, the mosque dominates the sea-side view of Istanbul.\n\nThe Blue Mosque was notably constructed on the opposite hill of the Hagia Sofia, and both mosques played a part in the political developments of the Kadizadeli movement spanning much of the 17th century. While the Hagia Sofia preached towards a puritanical movement, the Blue Mosque preached the Sufi order<ref>Zilfi, Madeline C. \u201cThe Kadizadelis: Discordant Revivalism in Seventeenth-Century Istanbul\u201d.

The power of two mosques in the same relative neighborhood preaching different interpretations of muslim faith invited political, religious, and social discourse in Istanbul that at times served as a threat to the power of the Sultan<ref>Zilfi, Madeline C. \u201cThe Kadizadelis: Discordant Revivalism in Seventeenth-Century Istanbul\u201d. Journal of Near Eastern Studies Vol. 45, No.4, (October, 1986): 251-269.</ref>.\n\nAn important thing to note is that while the Hagia Sofia was an influential mosque in Ottoman history, and is well-known to this day, the mosque was actually not built by the Ottomans themselves. The Hagia Sofia was converted into a mosque from a church following the capture of Constantinople in 1453, when control of the area moved from the hands of the Byzantines to the Ottomans.\n\n\n'''Major Architectural Works of Sultanates'''\n\nBelow is a chart of several major architectural projects, listed by sultanate<ref>Yerasimos, S. \u2018Istanbul\u2019.

''Helios-A'' has a mass of {{convert|370|kg}}, and ''Helios-B'' has a mass of {{convert|376.5|kg}}. Their scientific payloads have a mass of {{convert|73.2|kg}} on ''Helios-A'' and {{convert|76.5|kg}} on ''Helios-B''. The central body is a sixteen-sided prism {{convert|1.75|m}} in diameter and {{convert|0.55|m}} high. Most of the equipment and instrumentation is mounted in this central body. The exceptions are the masts and antennae used during experiments and small telescopes that measure the [[zodiacal light]] and which emerge from the central body. Two conical solar panels extend above and below the central body, giving the assembly the appearance of a [[diabolo]] or spool of thread.\n\nAt launch, each probe was {{convert|2.12|m}} tall with a maximum diameter of {{convert|2.77|m}}. Once in orbit, a telecommunications antenna unfolded on top of the probe and increased the total height to {{convert|4.2|m}}. Also deployed on orbit were two rigid booms carrying sensors and magnetometers, attached on both sides of the central body, and two flexible antennae used for the detection of radio waves, which extended perpendicular to the axis of the spacecraft for a design length of {{convert|16|m}} each.<ref>[http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/helios.shtml Helios]. Bernd Leitenberger. Retrieved May 20, 2016.</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft spins around its axis, which is perpendicular to the [[ecliptic]], at 60{{nbsp}}[[rpm]].\n\n==Power==\n\n[[Electric energy|Electrical power]] is provided by [[solar cell]]s attached to the two truncated cones. To keep the solar panels at a temperature below {{convert|165|C}} in the proximity of the Sun, the solar cells are interspersed with mirrors, covering 50% of the surface and reflecting part of the incident sunlight while dissipating the excess heat. The energy supplied by the solar panels is a minimum of 240{{nbsp}}[[watt]]s when the probe is in the farthest part of its orbit from the Sun. The power whose voltage is regulated to 28{{nbsp}}[[volts]] [[Direct current|DC]] is stored on a silver\u2013zinc battery of 8{{nbsp}}[[Ampere-hour|Ah]].The battery was only used during launch.\n\n==Thermal control==\n[[File:Helios - launch configuration diagram.png|thumb|Launch configuration diagram]]\n[[File:Helios - testing.png|thumb|left|upright|A technician stands next to one of the twin ''Helios'' spacecraft]]\n\nThe biggest technical challenge faced by the designers was the heat to which the probe is subject when it is near the Sun. At {{convert|0.3|AU}} from the Sun, approximate heat flow is 11 solar constants (11 times the amount of received heat in Earth orbit), or 22.4&nbsp;[[Watt (unit)|kW]] per square meter exposed. Under these conditions, the temperature of the probe can then reach {{convert|370|C}}. The [[solar cells]] and the central compartment of instruments must be maintained at much lower temperatures. The temperature of the solar cells should not exceed {{convert|165|C}}, while the central compartment should be maintained between {{convert|-10|and|20|C}}. These restrictions require the rejection of 96 percent of the heat received from the Sun. The conical shape of the solar panels is one of the measures taken to reduce the flow of heat. By tilting the solar panels with respect to sunlight arriving perpendicularly to the axis of the probe, a greater proportion of the [[solar radiation]] is reflected. Furthermore, \"second surface mirrors\" specially developed by [[NASA]] cover the entire central body and 50 percent of the solar generators. These are made of fused quartz, with a silver film on the inner face, which is itself covered with a dielectric material. For additional protection, [[multi-layer insulation]], consisting of 18 layers of {{convert|0.25|mm}} [[Mylar]] or [[Kapton]] (depending on location) held apart from each other by small plastic pins intended to prevent the formation of [[Thermal bridge|thermal bridges]], was used to partially cover the core compartment. In addition to these passive devices, the probe uses an active system of movable louvers arranged in a shutter-like pattern along the bottom and top side of the compartment. The opening thereof is controlled separately by a bimetal spring whose length varies with temperature and causes the opening or closing of the shutter. Resistors are also used to maintain a temperature sufficient for certain equipment.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khzDRYfj97AC&pg=PA918 | title=The trip to hot space | journal=[[New Scientist]] | first=G\u00fcnter | last=Sandscheper | volume=64 | issue=929 | page=918 | date=December 26, 1974}}</ref>\n\n==Telecommunications system==\n\nThe telecommunication system uses a radio transceiver, whose power can be adjusted between 0.5 and 20&nbsp;watts. Three antennas are overlaid on top of the probes: A high-gain antenna (23&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]]) emits a top brush of 5.5\u00b0 on either side of elliptical <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://nasa.fandom.com/wiki/Helios_(spacecraft)|title=Helios (spacecrafts)|last=|first=|date=|website=Fandom|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>and 14\u00b0 wide, a medium-gain antenna (3&nbsp;dB for transmission and 6.3&nbsp;dB for reception) emits a signal in all directions of the ecliptic plane at a height of 15\u00b0, and a dipole omnidirectional antenna (0.3&nbsp;dB transmission and 0.8&nbsp;dB for reception). The low-gain horn antenna is located under the center of the probe because of an adapter that connected the probe to the launch vehicle. To be constantly pointed toward [[Earth]], the high-gain antenna is kept in rotation by a motor at a speed that counterbalances exactly the body of the probes. Synchronizing the speed is performed using data supplied by a [[Sun sensor]]. The maximum data rate obtained with the large antenna gain is 4096 bits per second upstream. The reception and transmission of signals are supported by the [[Deep Space Network]] network antennas on Earth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Attitude control==\n{{Rewrite section|date=February 2020}}\nTo maintain its orientation during the mission, the spacecraft rotates continuously at 60&nbsp;rpm around its main axis. The orientation control system eventually makes corrections to the speed and orientation of the probe shaft. To determine its orientation using a crude Sun sensor, a Sun sensor and the end of a star seen that latch to the star [[Canopus]]. Guidance corrections are performed using cold gas thrusters 3 (7.7&nbsp;kg [[nitrogen]]) with a boost of 1{{nbsp}}[[Newton (unit)|Newton]]. The axis of the probe is permanently maintained, both perpendicular to the direction of the Sun and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.\n\n==On-board computer and data storage==\nThe on-board controller is capable of handling 256 commands. The mass memory can store 500&nbsp;[[kilobits|kb]] and is mainly used when the probe is in superior conjunction relative to the [[Earth]] (i.e. the Sun comes between the Earth and the spacecraft). The conjunction may last up to 65 days. This was a very large memory for space probes of the time.\n\n==Experiments and instruments==\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit section|for=grammar|date=February 2020}}\n{{confusing|section|date=March 2020|reason=the intended meanings of some sentences and phrases may not be understood by copy-editors due to poor grammar, making it difficult to correct ambiguous or nonsensical statements}}\n|section=yes}}\nBoth ''Helios'' probes had ten scientific instruments:<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760019169_1976019169.pdf |title=Tracking and Data Systems Support for the Helios Project|publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Experiments===\n* '''[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] Experiment Investigation''': developed by the [[Max Planck Institute]] for the study of low-energy particles.

This was the first operational flight of the [[Titan IIIE]] rocket. The rocket's test flight had failed when the engine on the upper [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur stage]] did not light, but the launch of ''Helios-A'' was uneventful.\n\nThe probe was placed in a heliocentric orbit of 192 days with a perihelion of {{convert|46500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}} from the Sun. Several problems affected operations. It was one of the two antennas that did not deploy correctly, reducing the sensitivity of the radio plasma apparatus to low-frequency waves. When the high-gain antenna was connected, the mission team realized that their emissions interfered with the analyzer particles and the radio receiver. To reduce the interference, communications were carried out using reduced power, but this required using the large diameter terrestrial receivers already stretched by other space missions in progress.\n\nDuring the first [[perihelion]] in late February 1975, the spacecraft came closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft. The temperature of some components reached more than {{convert|100|C}}, while the solar panels reached {{convert|127|C}}, without affecting probe operations. During the second pass on September 21, however, temperatures reached {{convert|132|C}}, which affected the operation of certain instruments.\n\n===''Helios-B''===\nBefore ''Helios-B'' was launched, some changes were made to the spacecraft based on the lessons learned from the operations of ''Helios-A''. The small engines used for attitude control were improved. Changes were made to the implementation mechanism of the flexible antenna and high gain antenna emissions. The [[X-ray]] detectors were improved so that they could detect [[gamma ray burst]]s and be used in conjunction with Earth-orbiting satellites to triangulate the location of the bursts. Because temperatures on ''Helios-A'' were always more than {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} below the design maximum at perihelion, it was decided that ''Helios-B'' would orbit even closer to the Sun. The thermal insulation was enhanced so that the satellite could support 15 percent greater heat flux.\n\nTight schedule constraints pressed on the ''Helios-B'' launch in early 1976. Facilities damaged during the launch of the ''[[Viking 2]]'' spacecraft in September 1975 had to be rehabilitated, while the [[Viking program|Viking]] landing on [[Mars]] in summer 1976 would make unavailable the [[Deep Space Network]] antennas that ''Helios-B'' would need to conduct its perihelion science. ''Helios-B'' was launched on January 10, 1976, by a Titan IIIE rocket. The probe was placed in an orbit with a 187-day period and a perihelion of {{convert|43500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}}. The orientation of ''Helios-B'' with respect to the ecliptic was reversed 180 degrees compared to ''Helios-A'' so that the micrometeorite detectors could have 360 degree coverage. On April 17, 1976, ''Helios-B'' made its closest pass of the Sun at a record heliocentric speed of {{convert|70|km/s|km/h mi/h}}. The maximum recorded temperature was {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} higher than measured by ''Helios-A''.\n\n===End of operations===\nThe primary mission of each probe spanned 18 months, but they operated much longer. On March{{nbsp}}3, 1980, four years after its launch, the radio transceiver on ''Helios-B'' failed. On January{{nbsp}}7, 1981, a stop command was sent to prevent possible radio interference during future missions. ''Helios-A'' continued to function normally, but with the large-diameter DSN antennae not available, data was collected by small diameter antennae at a lower rate. By its 14th orbit, its degraded solar cells could no longer provide enough power for the simultaneous collection and transmission of data unless the probe was close to its perihelion. In 1984, the main and backup radio receivers failed, indicating that the high-gain antenna was no longer pointed towards Earth. The last [[telemetry]] data was received on February{{nbsp}}10, 1986.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Helios spacecraft 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''Helios'' probe being encapsulated for launch]]{{Multiple issues|{{cleanup|section|reason=incomprehensible prose|date=June 2018}}\n{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}|section=yes}}\nBoth probes collected important data about cause processes of \n\nthe [[solar wind]] ane acceleration of the particles that make up the interplanetary medium and [[cosmic rays]]. These observations were made over a ten-year period from [[solar minimum]] in 1976 to a [[solar maximum]] in the early 1980s.\n\nThe observation of the [[zodiacal light]] has established some of the properties of [[interplanetary dust]] present between 0.1{{nbsp}}AU and 1{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun, such as their spatial distribution, color and [[polarization]]{{disambiguate|date=March 2020}}. It has been established that the powder was more sensitive <!-- more sensitive than what? --> to [[gravitational force]]s and [[electromagnetic force]]s. The amount of dust was observed up to 10 times around the Earth.<!-- was the dust observed 10 times, or was it observed to be a specific amount 10 times? or was the amount 10 times as large as some other amount? --> [[Heterogeneous]] distribution was generally expected due to the passage of comets, but observations have not confirmed this. The probe instruments detected dust near the Sun showing that, despite the sunshine is still present in distance 0.09 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].\n\n''Helios'' also allowed interesting data to be collected on comets, observing the passage of [[C/1975 V1|C/1975 V1 (West)]] in 1976, [[C/1978 H1]] (Meir) in November 1978 and [[C/1979 Y1]] (Bradfield) in February 1980. During the last probe, instruments observed a disturbance wind solar which translated later by a break in the comet's tail. The plasma analyzer showed that the acceleration phenomena of the high-speed solar wind were associated with the presence of coronal holes. This instrument also detected for the first time, the helium ions isolated in the solar wind. In 1981, during the peak of solar activity, the data collected by ''Helios-A'' at a short distance from the Sun helped complete visual observations of coronal mass ejections performed from the Earth's orbit. Data collected by magnetometers two probes ''Helios'' supplemented with interplanetary probes ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' and ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' were used to determine the direction of the magnetic field at staggered distances from the Sun.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/helios-2/in-depth/|title=Result of Helios 2 and Helios 1|last=|first=|date=|website=Solar system Nasa|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe radio and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] wave detectors were used to detect radio explosions and shock waves associated with solar flares, usually during solar maximum. The cosmic ray detectors studied how the Sun and interplanetary medium influenced the spread of the same rays, of solar or galactic origin. The gradient of cosmic rays, as a function of distance from the Sun, was measured. These observations, combined with those made by ''Pioneer{{nbsp}}11'' between 1977 and 1980 on the outside of the [[solar system]] (12\u201323{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun) produced good modelling of this [[gradient]]. The GRBs ''Helios-B'' detector identified 18 events during the first three years of operation of the instrument, whose source can, for some, be identified with the help of searches made by satellites orbiting the Earth. Some features of the inner solar corona were measured during occultations. For this purpose, either a radio signal was sent from the spacecraft to Earth or the ground station sent a signal that was returned by the probe. Changes in signal propagation resulting from the solar [[corona]] crossing provided information on density fluctuations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Mission profile==\n[[Image:Titan 3E Centaur with Helios 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A Titan 3E rocket sitting on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.|''Helios-A'' sitting atop the [[Titan IIIE]]/[[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] launch vehicle]]\n\n===Launch and trajectory===\n[[Image:Helios - Trajectory.png|thumb|left|200px|Trajectory of the ''Helios'' space probes]]\n{{clear-left}}\n\n===Timeline of travel===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100\" | Date\n!

'''''Helios-B''''' (also known as '''''{{nowrap|Helios 1}}''''' and '''''{{nowrap|Helios 2}}''''') are a pair of probes launched into [[heliocentric orbit]] for the purpose of studying [[Solar phenomena|solar]] processes. A joint venture of [[West Germany]]'s space agency [[German Aerospace Center|DFVLR]] (70 percent share) and [[NASA]] (30 percent), both probes were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], on December{{nbsp}}10, 1974, and January{{nbsp}}15, 1976, respectively. These probes built by the main contractor [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]], they were the first spaceprobes built outside both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] to leave Earth's orbit. \n\nThe probes set a maximum speed record for spacecraft of {{convert|252792|km/h|mph m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=wilkinson2012/> ''Helios-B'' flew {{convert|3000000|km}} closer to the Sun than ''Helios-A'', achieving [[perihelion]] on April{{nbsp}}17, 1976, at a record distance of {{convert|43.432|e6km|mi AU|abbr=unit}},<ref name='by target'>{{Cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Helios_02&Display=ReadMore|title=Solar System Exploration: Missions: By Target: Our Solar System: Past: Helios 2|access-date=November 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005103307/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Helios_02&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=October 5, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> closer than the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. ''Helios-B'' was sent into orbit 13 months after the launch of ''Helios-A''.

''Helios-A'' has a mass of {{convert|370|kg}}, and ''Helios-B'' has a mass of {{convert|376.5|kg}}. Their scientific payloads have a mass of {{convert|73.2|kg}} on ''Helios-A'' and {{convert|76.5|kg}} on ''Helios-B''. The central body is a sixteen-sided prism {{convert|1.75|m}} in diameter and {{convert|0.55|m}} high. Most of the equipment and instrumentation is mounted in this central body. The exceptions are the masts and antennae used during experiments and small telescopes that measure the [[zodiacal light]] and which emerge from the central body. Two conical solar panels extend above and below the central body, giving the assembly the appearance of a [[diabolo]] or spool of thread.\n\nAt launch, each probe was {{convert|2.12|m}} tall with a maximum diameter of {{convert|2.77|m}}. Once in orbit, a telecommunications antenna unfolded on top of the probe and increased the total height to {{convert|4.2|m}}. Also deployed on orbit were two rigid booms carrying sensors and magnetometers, attached on both sides of the central body, and two flexible antennae used for the detection of radio waves, which extended perpendicular to the axis of the spacecraft for a design length of {{convert|16|m}} each.<ref>[http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/helios.shtml Helios]. Bernd Leitenberger. Retrieved May 20, 2016.</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft spins around its axis, which is perpendicular to the [[ecliptic]], at 60{{nbsp}}[[rpm]].\n\n==Power==\n\n[[Electric energy|Electrical power]] is provided by [[solar cell]]s attached to the two truncated cones. To keep the solar panels at a temperature below {{convert|165|C}} in the proximity of the Sun, the solar cells are interspersed with mirrors, covering 50% of the surface and reflecting part of the incident sunlight while dissipating the excess heat. The energy supplied by the solar panels is a minimum of 240{{nbsp}}[[watt]]s when the probe is in the farthest part of its orbit from the Sun. The power whose voltage is regulated to 28{{nbsp}}[[volts]] [[Direct current|DC]] is stored on a silver\u2013zinc battery of 8{{nbsp}}[[Ampere-hour|Ah]].The battery was only used during launch.\n\n==Thermal control==\n[[File:Helios - launch configuration diagram.png|thumb|Launch configuration diagram]]\n[[File:Helios - testing.png|thumb|left|upright|A technician stands next to one of the twin ''Helios'' spacecraft]]\n\nThe biggest technical challenge faced by the designers was the heat to which the probe is subject when it is near the Sun. At {{convert|0.3|AU}} from the Sun, approximate heat flow is 11 solar constants (11 times the amount of received heat in Earth orbit), or 22.4&nbsp;[[Watt (unit)|kW]] per square meter exposed. Under these conditions, the temperature of the probe can then reach {{convert|370|C}}. The [[solar cells]] and the central compartment of instruments must be maintained at much lower temperatures. The temperature of the solar cells should not exceed {{convert|165|C}}, while the central compartment should be maintained between {{convert|-10|and|20|C}}. These restrictions require the rejection of 96 percent of the heat received from the Sun. The conical shape of the solar panels is one of the measures taken to reduce the flow of heat. By tilting the solar panels with respect to sunlight arriving perpendicularly to the axis of the probe, a greater proportion of the [[solar radiation]] is reflected. Furthermore, \"second surface mirrors\" specially developed by [[NASA]] cover the entire central body and 50 percent of the solar generators. These are made of fused quartz, with a silver film on the inner face, which is itself covered with a dielectric material. For additional protection, [[multi-layer insulation]], consisting of 18 layers of {{convert|0.25|mm}} [[Mylar]] or [[Kapton]] (depending on location) held apart from each other by small plastic pins intended to prevent the formation of [[Thermal bridge|thermal bridges]], was used to partially cover the core compartment. In addition to these passive devices, the probe uses an active system of movable louvers arranged in a shutter-like pattern along the bottom and top side of the compartment. The opening thereof is controlled separately by a bimetal spring whose length varies with temperature and causes the opening or closing of the shutter. Resistors are also used to maintain a temperature sufficient for certain equipment.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khzDRYfj97AC&pg=PA918 | title=The trip to hot space | journal=[[New Scientist]] | first=G\u00fcnter | last=Sandscheper | volume=64 | issue=929 | page=918 | date=December 26, 1974}}</ref>\n\n==Telecommunications system==\n\nThe telecommunication system uses a radio transceiver, whose power can be adjusted between 0.5 and 20&nbsp;watts. Three antennas are overlaid on top of the probes: A high-gain antenna (23&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]]) emits a top brush of 5.5\u00b0 on either side of elliptical <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://nasa.fandom.com/wiki/Helios_(spacecraft)|title=Helios (spacecrafts)|last=|first=|date=|website=Fandom|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>and 14\u00b0 wide, a medium-gain antenna (3&nbsp;dB for transmission and 6.3&nbsp;dB for reception) emits a signal in all directions of the ecliptic plane at a height of 15\u00b0, and a dipole omnidirectional antenna (0.3&nbsp;dB transmission and 0.8&nbsp;dB for reception). The low-gain horn antenna is located under the center of the probe because of an adapter that connected the probe to the launch vehicle. To be constantly pointed toward [[Earth]], the high-gain antenna is kept in rotation by a motor at a speed that counterbalances exactly the body of the probes. Synchronizing the speed is performed using data supplied by a [[Sun sensor]]. The maximum data rate obtained with the large antenna gain is 4096 bits per second upstream. The reception and transmission of signals are supported by the [[Deep Space Network]] network antennas on Earth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Attitude control==\n{{Rewrite section|date=February 2020}}\nTo maintain its orientation during the mission, the spacecraft rotates continuously at 60&nbsp;rpm around its main axis. The orientation control system eventually makes corrections to the speed and orientation of the probe shaft. To determine its orientation using a crude Sun sensor, a Sun sensor and the end of a star seen that latch to the star [[Canopus]]. Guidance corrections are performed using cold gas thrusters 3 (7.7&nbsp;kg [[nitrogen]]) with a boost of 1{{nbsp}}[[Newton (unit)|Newton]]. The axis of the probe is permanently maintained, both perpendicular to the direction of the Sun and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.\n\n==On-board computer and data storage==\nThe on-board controller is capable of handling 256 commands. The mass memory can store 500&nbsp;[[kilobits|kb]] and is mainly used when the probe is in superior conjunction relative to the [[Earth]] (i.e. the Sun comes between the Earth and the spacecraft). The conjunction may last up to 65 days. This was a very large memory for space probes of the time.\n\n==Experiments and instruments==\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit section|for=grammar|date=February 2020}}\n{{confusing|section|date=March 2020|reason=the intended meanings of some sentences and phrases may not be understood by copy-editors due to poor grammar, making it difficult to correct ambiguous or nonsensical statements}}\n|section=yes}}\nBoth ''Helios'' probes had ten scientific instruments:<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760019169_1976019169.pdf |title=Tracking and Data Systems Support for the Helios Project|publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Experiments===\n* '''[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] Experiment Investigation''': developed by the [[Max Planck Institute]] for the study of low-energy particles.

This was the first operational flight of the [[Titan IIIE]] rocket. The rocket's test flight had failed when the engine on the upper [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur stage]] did not light, but the launch of ''Helios-A'' was uneventful.\n\nThe probe was placed in a heliocentric orbit of 192 days with a perihelion of {{convert|46500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}} from the Sun. Several problems affected operations. It was one of the two antennas that did not deploy correctly, reducing the sensitivity of the radio plasma apparatus to low-frequency waves. When the high-gain antenna was connected, the mission team realized that their emissions interfered with the analyzer particles and the radio receiver. To reduce the interference, communications were carried out using reduced power, but this required using the large diameter terrestrial receivers already stretched by other space missions in progress.\n\nDuring the first [[perihelion]] in late February 1975, the spacecraft came closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft. The temperature of some components reached more than {{convert|100|C}}, while the solar panels reached {{convert|127|C}}, without affecting probe operations. During the second pass on September 21, however, temperatures reached {{convert|132|C}}, which affected the operation of certain instruments.\n\n===''Helios-B''===\nBefore ''Helios-B'' was launched, some changes were made to the spacecraft based on the lessons learned from the operations of ''Helios-A''. The small engines used for attitude control were improved. Changes were made to the implementation mechanism of the flexible antenna and high gain antenna emissions. The [[X-ray]] detectors were improved so that they could detect [[gamma ray burst]]s and be used in conjunction with Earth-orbiting satellites to triangulate the location of the bursts. Because temperatures on ''Helios-A'' were always more than {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} below the design maximum at perihelion, it was decided that ''Helios-B'' would orbit even closer to the Sun. The thermal insulation was enhanced so that the satellite could support 15 percent greater heat flux.\n\nTight schedule constraints pressed on the ''Helios-B'' launch in early 1976. Facilities damaged during the launch of the ''[[Viking 2]]'' spacecraft in September 1975 had to be rehabilitated, while the [[Viking program|Viking]] landing on [[Mars]] in summer 1976 would make unavailable the [[Deep Space Network]] antennas that ''Helios-B'' would need to conduct its perihelion science. ''Helios-B'' was launched on January 10, 1976, by a Titan IIIE rocket. The probe was placed in an orbit with a 187-day period and a perihelion of {{convert|43500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}}. The orientation of ''Helios-B'' with respect to the ecliptic was reversed 180 degrees compared to ''Helios-A'' so that the micrometeorite detectors could have 360 degree coverage. On April 17, 1976, ''Helios-B'' made its closest pass of the Sun at a record heliocentric speed of {{convert|70|km/s|km/h mi/h}}. The maximum recorded temperature was {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} higher than measured by ''Helios-A''.\n\n===End of operations===\nThe primary mission of each probe spanned 18 months, but they operated much longer. On March{{nbsp}}3, 1980, four years after its launch, the radio transceiver on ''Helios-B'' failed. On January{{nbsp}}7, 1981, a stop command was sent to prevent possible radio interference during future missions. ''Helios-A'' continued to function normally, but with the large-diameter DSN antennae not available, data was collected by small diameter antennae at a lower rate. By its 14th orbit, its degraded solar cells could no longer provide enough power for the simultaneous collection and transmission of data unless the probe was close to its perihelion. In 1984, the main and backup radio receivers failed, indicating that the high-gain antenna was no longer pointed towards Earth. The last [[telemetry]] data was received on February{{nbsp}}10, 1986.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Helios spacecraft 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''Helios'' probe being encapsulated for launch]]{{Multiple issues|{{cleanup|section|reason=incomprehensible prose|date=June 2018}}\n{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}|section=yes}}\nBoth probes collected important data about cause processes of \n\nthe [[solar wind]] ane acceleration of the particles that make up the interplanetary medium and [[cosmic rays]]. These observations were made over a ten-year period from [[solar minimum]] in 1976 to a [[solar maximum]] in the early 1980s.\n\nThe observation of the [[zodiacal light]] has established some of the properties of [[interplanetary dust]] present between 0.1{{nbsp}}AU and 1{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun, such as their spatial distribution, color and [[polarization]]{{disambiguate|date=March 2020}}. It has been established that the powder was more sensitive <!-- more sensitive than what? --> to [[gravitational force]]s and [[electromagnetic force]]s. The amount of dust was observed up to 10 times around the Earth.<!-- was the dust observed 10 times, or was it observed to be a specific amount 10 times? or was the amount 10 times as large as some other amount? --> [[Heterogeneous]] distribution was generally expected due to the passage of comets, but observations have not confirmed this. The probe instruments detected dust near the Sun showing that, despite the sunshine is still present in distance 0.09 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].\n\n''Helios'' also allowed interesting data to be collected on comets, observing the passage of [[C/1975 V1|C/1975 V1 (West)]] in 1976, [[C/1978 H1]] (Meir) in November 1978 and [[C/1979 Y1]] (Bradfield) in February 1980. During the last probe, instruments observed a disturbance wind solar which translated later by a break in the comet's tail. The plasma analyzer showed that the acceleration phenomena of the high-speed solar wind were associated with the presence of coronal holes. This instrument also detected for the first time, the helium ions isolated in the solar wind. In 1981, during the peak of solar activity, the data collected by ''Helios-A'' at a short distance from the Sun helped complete visual observations of coronal mass ejections performed from the Earth's orbit. Data collected by magnetometers two probes ''Helios'' supplemented with interplanetary probes ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' and ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' were used to determine the direction of the magnetic field at staggered distances from the Sun.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/helios-2/in-depth/|title=Result of Helios 2 and Helios 1|last=|first=|date=|website=Solar system Nasa|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe radio and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] wave detectors were used to detect radio explosions and shock waves associated with solar flares, usually during solar maximum. The cosmic ray detectors studied how the Sun and interplanetary medium influenced the spread of the same rays, of solar or galactic origin. The gradient of cosmic rays, as a function of distance from the Sun, was measured. These observations, combined with those made by ''Pioneer{{nbsp}}11'' between 1977 and 1980 on the outside of the [[solar system]] (12\u201323{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun) produced good modelling of this [[gradient]]. The GRBs ''Helios-B'' detector identified 18 events during the first three years of operation of the instrument, whose source can, for some, be identified with the help of searches made by satellites orbiting the Earth. Some features of the inner solar corona were measured during occultations. For this purpose, either a radio signal was sent from the spacecraft to Earth or the ground station sent a signal that was returned by the probe. Changes in signal propagation resulting from the solar [[corona]] crossing provided information on density fluctuations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Mission profile==\n[[Image:Titan 3E Centaur with Helios 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A Titan 3E rocket sitting on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.|''Helios-A'' sitting atop the [[Titan IIIE]]/[[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] launch vehicle]]\n\n===Launch and trajectory===\n[[Image:Helios - Trajectory.png|thumb|left|200px|Trajectory of the ''Helios'' space probes]]\n{{clear-left}}\n\n===Timeline of travel===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100\" | Date\n!
