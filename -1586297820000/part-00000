The ancient Vietnamese nation was annexed by [[Imperial China|China]] in the 2nd century BC, which subsequently made Vietnam a division of China for over a millennium. The first independent [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|monarchy]] emerged in the 10th century AD. This paved the way for successive [[List of monarchs of Vietnam|imperial dynasties]] as the nation expanded geographically southward until [[European colonisation of Southeast Asia|European colonialism]] in the mid-19th century. Modern Vietnam was born upon the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Proclamation of Independence]] from France in 1945. Following Vietnamese victory against the French in the [[First Indochina War]], which ended in 1954, the nation was divided into two rival states: communist [[North Vietnam|North]] and anti-communist [[South Vietnam|South]]. Conflicts intensified in the [[Vietnam War]], which saw [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|extensive US intervention]] in support of South Vietnam and ended with [[fall of Saigon|North Vietnamese victory]] in 1975.\n\nAfter North and South Vietnam were reunified under a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[socialist state|socialist]] government in 1976, the country became economically and politically isolated until 1986, when the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] initiated a series of [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi|economic and political reforms]] that facilitated Vietnamese integration into world politics and the global economy. As a result of the successful reforms, Vietnam has enjoyed a high GDP growth rate, consistently ranked among the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing countries in the world]]. It nevertheless faces challenges including [[poverty]], [[corruption]] and inadequate social welfare. By 2010, Vietnam had established [[Foreign relations of Vietnam|diplomatic relations]] with 178 countries. It is a member of such international organisations as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum, and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{main|Names of Vietnam}}\nThe name {{lang|vi|Vi\u1ec7t Nam}} ({{IPA-vi|vi\u0259\u0300t na\u02d0m}}) is a variation of {{lang|vi|[[Nanyue|Nam Vi\u1ec7t]]}} ({{zh|c=[[wikt:\u5357\u8d8a|\u5357\u8d8a]]|p=N\u00e1nyu\u00e8}}; literally \"Southern ''Vi\u1ec7t''\"), a name that can be traced back to the [[Tri\u1ec7u dynasty]] of the 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Woods|2002|p=38}} The word ''Vi\u1ec7t'' originated as a shortened form of [[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]] ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:\u767e\u8d8a|\u767e\u8d8a]]|p=B\u01ceiyu\u00e8}}), the name of a group of people then living in southern China and Vietnam.{{sfn|Yue Hashimoto|1972|p=1}} The form \"Vietnam\" ({{Vi-nom|{{linktext|\u8d8a\u5357}}}}) is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem ''[[S\u1ea5m Tr\u1ea1ng Tr\u00ecnh]]''.

As a majority ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=21}} Despite this, Vietnam is also home to 54 other ethnic minority groups, including the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Yao people|Dao]], [[Tay people|T\u00e0y]], [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[N\u00f9ng people|N\u00f9ng]].{{sfn|Canada Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration|2013|p=1}} Many ethnic minorities such as the [[Muong people|Muong]], who are closely related to the Kinh, dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.{{sfn|Government of Vietnam  (I)}}\n\nOther uplanders in the north migrated from southern China between the 1300s and 1800s.{{sfn|Koskoff|2008|p=1316}} Since the partition of Vietnam, the population of the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] was almost exclusively [[Degar]] (including over 40 tribal groups); however, the South Vietnamese government at the time enacted a program of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas.{{sfn|Cultural Orientation Resource Centre|p=7}}{{sfn|Montagnard Human Rights Organisation}} The [[Hoa people|Hoa]] (ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]) and [[Khmer Krom]] people are mainly lowlanders.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=21}}{{sfn|Koskoff|2008|p=1316}} Throughout Vietnam's history, many Chinese people, largely from [[South China]], migrated to the country as administrators, merchants and even refugees.{{sfn|Dodd|Lewis|2003|p=531}} Since the reunification in 1976 an increase of communist policies nationwide resulted in the nationalisation and confiscation of property especially from the Hoa in the south and the wealthy in cities. This led many of them to leave Vietnam.{{sfn|Amer|1996}}{{sfn|Feinberg|2016}} Furthermore, with the deterioration of [[Sino-Vietnamese relations]] after the [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border invasion]] by Chinese government in 1979 many Vietnamese were wary of Chinese government's intentions.

As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively.{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2009b|p=117}} The Vietnamese government, through its [[Ministry of Construction (Vietnam)|construction ministry]], forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020. Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate.{{sfn|World Bank|2002}} Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities.{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2009b|p=102}}\n\n[[File:West Hanoi.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph showing the large number of high-rise buildings in west Hanoi | Urbanisation in west Hanoi]]\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}}\n\nMany Vietnamese use [[moped]]s for transportation since they are relatively cheap and easy to operate. Their large numbers have been known to cause traffic congestion and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the number of mopeds increased from 0.5 million in 2001 to 4.7 million in 2013.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} With rapid development, factories have sprung up which indirectly pollute the air and water. An example is the [[2016 Vietnam marine life disaster]] caused by the [[Formosa Ha Tinh Steel|Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Company]] illegally discharging toxic industrial waste into the ocean. This killed many fish and destroyed marine habitats in Vietnamese waters resulting in major losses to the country's economy.{{sfn|Tiezzi|2016}} The government is intervening and attempting solutions to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation. It has introduced more regulations for [[waste]] handling by factories. Although the authorities also have schedules for collecting different types of waste, waste disposal is another problem caused by urbanisation. The amount of solid waste generated in urban areas of Vietnam has increased by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste accounted for 181% of that increase. One of the government's efforts includes attempting to promote campaigns that encourage locals to sort [[municipal solid waste|household waste]] since [[waste sorting]] is still not practised by most of Vietnamese society.{{sfn|Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng|2018|p=19}}\n{{Largest cities of Vietnam}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{main|Religion in Vietnam}}\n{{Pie chart\n| caption = Religion in Vietnam (2014){{sfn|Bielefeldt|2014}}\n| label1  = [[Vietnamese folk religion]] or not religious population\n| value1  = 73.2\n| color1  = #E0FFFF\n| label2  = [[Buddhism]]\n| value2  = 12.2\n| color2  = #FFDEAD\n| label3  = [[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Catholicism]]\n| value3  = 6.8\n| color3  = #DDA0DD\n| label4  = [[Caodaism]]\n| value4  = 4.8\n| color4  = #FF69B4\n| label5  = [[Protestantism]]\n| value5  = 1.5\n| color5  = #87CEFA\n| label6  = [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o|Hoahaoism]]\n| value6  = 1.4\n| color6  = #FFF8DC\n| label7  = Others\n| value7  = 0.1\n| color7  = #F0FFF0\n}}\n\nUnder Article 70 of the 1992 Constitution of Vietnam, all citizens enjoy [[freedom of religion|freedom of belief and religion]].{{sfn|Constitution of Vietnam|1992}} All religions are equal before the law and each [[place of worship]] is protected under Vietnamese state law.

''[[Nh\u1ea1c d\u00e2n t\u1ed9c c\u1ea3i bi\u00ean]]'' is a modern form of Vietnamese [[folk music]] which arose in the 1950s, while ''[[ca tr\u00f9]]'' (also known as ''h\u00e1t \u1ea3 \u0111\u00e0o'') is a popular folk music. ''H\u00f2'' can be thought of as the southern style of ''Quan h\u1ecd''. There is a range of traditional instruments, including the ''[[\u0111\u00e0n b\u1ea7u]]'' (a monochord [[zither]]), the ''[[\u0111\u00e0n g\u00e1o]]'' (a two-stringed [[fiddle]] with coconut body), and the ''[[\u0111\u00e0n nguy\u1ec7t]]'' (a two-stringed fretted moon [[lute]]). In recent times, there have been some efforts at mixing Vietnamese traditional music\u2014especially folk music\u2014with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educate the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles.{{sfn|Voice of Vietnam|2018d}}\n\n[[Bolero#Vietnam|Bolero]] music has gained popularity in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style\u2014a combination of traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements.{{sfn|Duy|2016}} However, the modern Vietnamese music industry, known as [[V-pop]], is making its mark in the entertainment field. Many Vietnamese artists have started to collaborate with foreign artists and producers, especially South Korean, to facilitate the entrance of [[K-pop]] into the Vietnamese market while also promoting V-pop overseas.{{sfn|Chen|2018|p=194}} For example, in 2014, the South Korean seven-member [[boy band]] [[BTS (band)|BTS]] (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) collaborated with Vietnamese singer [[North (band)|Thanh B\u00f9i]] on the single called \"[[Dark & Wild#Track listing|Danger]]\".{{sfn|Chen|2018|p=194}}{{sfn|''Yan News''|2014}} In 2018, South Korean artist and idol [[Park Ji-yeon]] (\ubc15\uc9c0\uc5f0) collaborated with [[:vi:Soobin Ho\u00e0ng S\u01a1n|Soobin Ho\u00e0ng S\u01a1n]] on two versions of the title track called \"Between Us\" ({{lang-vi|\u0110\u1eb9p Nh\u1ea5t L\u00e0 Em}}; {{lang-ko|\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774}}) to promote the two countries\u2019 partnership in terms of the music industry.{{sfn|Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng|2018}} [[V Live (website)|V Live]], which is a South Korean live video streaming service, also collaborated with RBW Entertainment Vietnam (a subsidiary of [[RBW (company)|the Korean entertainment company]]) to produce Vietnamese-based shows. V Live also launched special monthly mini-concerts called \"V Heartbeat Live\" to connect V-pop and K-pop idols.{{sfn|Qu\u1ed1c Ho\u00e0ng|2018}} South Korean entertainment company [[SM Entertainment]] signed an agreement with IPP Group to move into the country's market and promote joint business.{{sfn|SM Entertainment Group|2018}} The company held its 2018 Global Audition in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in search for new talents among the Vietnamese youth.{{sfn|Dam-young|2018}}\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main|Vietnamese cuisine}}\n[[File:Cuisine of Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photographs of a ph\u1edf noodle dish, a ch\u00e8 th\u00e1i fruit dessert, a ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2 spring roll and a b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwich | Some of the notable Vietnamese cuisine, clockwise from top-right: [[ph\u1edf|ph\u1edf noodle]], ch\u00e8 th\u00e1i fruit dessert, [[ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2|ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2 spring roll]] and [[b\u00e1nh m\u00ec|b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwich]].]]\nTraditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste \"elements\" ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''ng\u0169 v\u1ecb''): spicy (metal), sour (wood), bitter (fire), salty (water) and sweet (earth).{{sfn|Vietnam Culture Information Network|2014}} Common ingredients include: [[fish sauce]], [[shrimp paste]], [[soy sauce]], rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use: [[cymbopogon|lemongrass]], [[ginger]], [[mentha|mint]], [[Vietnamese mint]], [[eryngium foetidum|long coriander]], [[Saigon cinnamon]], [[bird's eye chilli]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[basil]] leaves.{{sfn|Australia Special Broadcasting Service|2013}} Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide.{{sfn|Corapi|2010}} The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past. Instead freshwater fish, [[crustacean]]s (particularly [[crab]]s), and [[mollusc]]s became widely used. Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients. Vietnam has a strong [[street food]] culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country.{{sfn|Clark|Miller|2017}} Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as ''[[g\u1ecfi cu\u1ed1n]]'' (salad roll), ''[[b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n]]'' (rice noodle roll), ''[[b\u00fan ri\u00eau]]'' (rice vermicelli soup) and ''[[ph\u1edf]]'' noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants.{{sfn|Nguyen|2011}}{{sfn|Thaker|Barton|2012|p=170}} Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices.{{sfn|Williams|2017}} [[Black pepper]] is frequently used in place of [[Chilli pepper|chillis]] to produce spicy flavours. Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with [[ice cube|ice cubes,]] especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate. Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include: ''[[Vietnamese iced coffee|c\u00e0 ph\u00ea \u0111\u00e1]]'' (Vietnamese iced coffee), ''[[egg coffee|c\u00e0 ph\u00ea tr\u1ee9ng]]'' (egg coffee), ''[[chanh mu\u1ed1i]]'' (salted pickled lime juice), ''[[c\u01a1m r\u01b0\u1ee3u]]'' (glutinous rice wine), ''[[n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u00eda]]'' (sugarcane juice) and ''[[Vietnamese lotus tea|tr\u00e0 sen]]'' (Vietnamese lotus tea).{{sfn|Batruny|2014}}\n\n=== Media ===\n{{main|Media of Vietnam}}\n[[File:Vietnam Television logo from 2013.svg|thumb|left|alt=Shown is the logo of the state broadcaster Vietnam Television. | [[Vietnam Television]] (VTV), the main [[state television]]]]\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication.{{sfn|Vietnam National Assembly|2004}} It is generally perceived that the country media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken.{{sfn|Xuan Dinh|2000}}{{sfn|Datta|Mendizabal|2018}} The [[Voice of Vietnam]] (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while [[Vietnam Television]] (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company. Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public [[internet]] access extensively using both legal and technical means. The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the \"[[Internet censorship in Vietnam|Bamboo Firewall]]\".{{sfn|Wilkey|2002}} The collaborative project [[OpenNet Initiative]] classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be \"pervasive\",{{sfn|OpenNet Initiative|2012}} while [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global \"internet enemies\".{{sfn|Reporters Without Borders}} Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked.{{sfn|Berkman Klein Center|2006}}\n\n=== Holidays and festivals ===\n{{main|Public holidays in Vietnam|List of festivals in Vietnam}}\n[[File:\u0110\u00e8n k\u00e9o qu\u00e2n.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large round white fabric band decorated with red figures and images for T\u1ebft | Special [[T\u1ebft]] decoration in the country seen during the holiday]]\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays.

Vietnam shares its land borders with [[China]] to the north, and [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] to the west. It shares its maritime borders with [[Thailand]] through the [[Gulf of Thailand]], and the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] through the [[South China Sea]].{{#tag:ref|The South China Sea is referred to in Vietnam as the East Sea ({{lang|vi|Bi\u1ec3n \u0110\u00f4ng}}).{{sfn|Cham|2012}}|group=\"n\"}} Its [[capital city]] is [[Hanoi]], while its most populous city is [[Ho Chi Minh City]], also known by its former name of Saigon.\n\nArchaeological excavations indicate that Vietnam was inhabited as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age. The ancient Vietnamese nation was annexed by [[Imperial China|China]] in the 2nd century BC, which subsequently made Vietnam a division of China for over a millennium. The first independent [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|monarchy]] emerged in the 10th century AD. This paved the way for successive [[List of monarchs of Vietnam|imperial dynasties]] as the nation expanded geographically southward until [[European colonisation of Southeast Asia|European colonialism]] in the mid-19th century. Modern Vietnam was born upon the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Proclamation of Independence]] from France in 1945. Following Vietnamese victory against the French in the [[First Indochina War]], which ended in 1954, the nation was divided into two rival states: communist [[North Vietnam|North]] and anti-communist [[South Vietnam|South]]. Conflicts intensified in the [[Vietnam War]], which saw [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|extensive US intervention]] in support of South Vietnam and ended with [[fall of Saigon|North Vietnamese victory]] in 1975.\n\nAfter North and South Vietnam were reunified under a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[socialist state|socialist]] government in 1976, the country became economically and politically isolated until 1986, when the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] initiated a series of [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi|economic and political reforms]] that facilitated Vietnamese integration into world politics and the global economy. As a result of the successful reforms, Vietnam has enjoyed a high GDP growth rate, consistently ranked among the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing countries in the world]]. It nevertheless faces challenges including [[poverty]], [[corruption]] and inadequate social welfare.

As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively.{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2009b|p=117}} The Vietnamese government, through its [[Ministry of Construction (Vietnam)|construction ministry]], forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020. Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate.{{sfn|World Bank|2002}} Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities.{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2009b|p=102}}\n\n[[File:West Hanoi.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph showing the large number of high-rise buildings in west Hanoi | Urbanisation in west Hanoi]]\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}}\n\nMany Vietnamese use [[moped]]s for transportation since they are relatively cheap and easy to operate. Their large numbers have been known to cause traffic congestion and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the number of mopeds increased from 0.5 million in 2001 to 4.7 million in 2013.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} With rapid development, factories have sprung up which indirectly pollute the air and water. An example is the [[2016 Vietnam marine life disaster]] caused by the [[Formosa Ha Tinh Steel|Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Company]] illegally discharging toxic industrial waste into the ocean. This killed many fish and destroyed marine habitats in Vietnamese waters resulting in major losses to the country's economy.{{sfn|Tiezzi|2016}} The government is intervening and attempting solutions to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation. It has introduced more regulations for [[waste]] handling by factories. Although the authorities also have schedules for collecting different types of waste, waste disposal is another problem caused by urbanisation. The amount of solid waste generated in urban areas of Vietnam has increased by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste accounted for 181% of that increase. One of the government's efforts includes attempting to promote campaigns that encourage locals to sort [[municipal solid waste|household waste]] since [[waste sorting]] is still not practised by most of Vietnamese society.{{sfn|Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng|2018|p=19}}\n{{Largest cities of Vietnam}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{main|Religion in Vietnam}}\n{{Pie chart\n| caption = Religion in Vietnam (2014){{sfn|Bielefeldt|2014}}\n| label1  = [[Vietnamese folk religion]] or not religious population\n| value1  = 73.2\n| color1  = #E0FFFF\n| label2  = [[Buddhism]]\n| value2  = 12.2\n| color2  = #FFDEAD\n| label3  = [[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Catholicism]]\n| value3  = 6.8\n| color3  = #DDA0DD\n| label4  = [[Caodaism]]\n| value4  = 4.8\n| color4  = #FF69B4\n| label5  = [[Protestantism]]\n| value5  = 1.5\n| color5  = #87CEFA\n| label6  = [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o|Hoahaoism]]\n| value6  = 1.4\n| color6  = #FFF8DC\n| label7  = Others\n| value7  = 0.1\n| color7  = #F0FFF0\n}}\n\nUnder Article 70 of the 1992 Constitution of Vietnam, all citizens enjoy [[freedom of religion|freedom of belief and religion]].{{sfn|Constitution of Vietnam|1992}} All religions are equal before the law and each [[place of worship]] is protected under Vietnamese state law.

Actor [[Daniel Dae Kim]] first noticed the series and bought the rights for his production company. He began adapting the series and in 2015 eventually shopped it to CBS, his home network. CBS decided against creating a pilot. Because Kim felt so strongly about the series, he bought back the rights from CBS. Eventually, [[Sony Pictures Television]] and Kim worked out a deal and brought on [[David Shore]], creator of the Fox medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', to develop the series.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |title=How ABC Found a surprise Hit in 'The Good Doctor' |last=Koblin |first=John |date=November 19, 2017 |access-date=December 12, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015955/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |archive-date=December 14, 2017 |website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe show is produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[ABC Studios]], in association with production companies Shore Z Productions, [[3AD]], and Entermedia.

Actor [[Daniel Dae Kim]] first noticed the series and bought the rights for his production company. He began adapting the series and in 2015 eventually shopped it to CBS, his home network. CBS decided against creating a pilot. Because Kim felt so strongly about the series, he bought back the rights from CBS. Eventually, [[Sony Pictures Television]] and Kim worked out a deal and brought on [[David Shore]], creator of the Fox medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', to develop the series.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |title=How ABC Found a surprise Hit in 'The Good Doctor' |last=Koblin |first=John |date=November 19, 2017 |access-date=December 12, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015955/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html |archive-date=December 14, 2017 |website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe show is produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[ABC Studios]], in association with production companies Shore Z Productions, [[3AD]], and Entermedia. David Shore serves as [[showrunner]] and Daniel Dae Kim is an executive producer for the show.\n\nThe series stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as Shaun Murphy, a young [[autism|autistic]] [[savant syndrome|savant]] surgical resident at the fictional San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. [[Antonia Thomas]], [[Hill Harper]], [[Christina Chang]], [[Richard Schiff]], [[Will Yun Lee]], [[Paige Spara]], and [[Tamlyn Tomita]] also star in the show. [[Nicholas Gonzalez]], [[Beau Garrett]], and [[Jasika Nicole]] used to also star in the show, but their characters were written off. The series received a [[put pilot]] commitment at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] after a previous attempted series did not move forward at [[CBS Television Studios]] in 2015; ''The Good Doctor'' was ordered to series in May 2017. On October 3, 2017, ABC picked up the series for a full season of 18 episodes. The series is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].\n\nThe series debuted on September 25, 2017. ''The Good Doctor'' has received mixed reviews from critics, with particular praise given to Highmore's performance, and strong television ratings but criticism for the storylines while the portrayal of autism divided critics. In March 2018, ABC renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on September 24, 2018. In February 2019, ABC renewed the series for a third season, which premiered on September 23, 2019.

{"title_page": "Hindu mythological wars", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n'''Ancient Hindu wars''' are the [[battle]]s described in the [[Hindu texts]] of ancient [[India]]. These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light). While this battle does reinforce the timeless good v/s evil theme, close examination of various hymns and verses in the [[Rigveda]] suggest this might have been an allegorical account of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system.<ref>[http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/vrtra-myth-the-bharadvaja-version/ A record of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system?]</ref>\n\nAnother important battle is the historic [[Battle of the Ten Kings]], alluded to in the [[Rigveda]], in which the [[Tritsu]] clan, led by [[Sudas]], defeat the [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]] confederation of ten [[Indo Aryan]] clans.<ref name=\"schmidt1980\">Schmidt, H.P.

Both races are technically equal, possessors of great religious and martial powers, but the Devas are committed to the worship of the [[Supreme Being]] and the practice of [[virtue]]. The Asuras have atheistic and devious tendencies that grow over time.

The king whose authority is contested must prove himself in battle or accept the imperial supremacy of the challenging king. When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse. In the [[Mahabharata|Mahabharat]] era, [[Arjuna]] alone had conquered the whole world for the sake of ''Ashwamedha Yagya'' of his brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14085.htm|title=Digivijaya of Arjuna}}</ref>\n*''[[Rajasuya]]'': Considered the ultimate sacrifice, the king performing the sacrifice must openly challenge every king in the world to accept his supremacy or defeat him in battle. If and when the king returns successfully, having beaten all other known rulers, the performance of the sacrifice will send him to the abode of [[Indra]].

In the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], he is called Paramatman or Parameshwara (the highest form of God), and is periodically reborn as an [[Avatar]] upon earth in order to destroy evil and bring deliverance to the pious. He is also the refuge of the Devas in their battles against Asuras. The most martial Avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parshurama|Parshuram]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]]. He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is beyond all. In battle, the avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama, were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata. These include:\n\n*''[[Kaumodaki]]'': The divine [[Gada (mace)|mace]] weapon of Vishnu; invincible and without parallel; Krishna slayed demon Dantavakra with it.\n*''Kodandam'': The bow of [[Rama]], 7th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Nandaka]]'': The sword of Vishnu\n*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Narayanastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Vaishnavastra. The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.\n*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].\n*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The celestial bow of Vishnu. \n*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears. It is the most powerful Shastra in the universe, and without any parallel. The Chakra was famously designed by Vishwakarma for Vishnu. The Sudarshan flies at the command of Krishna, spinning away to tear off the heads of his opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself. [[Krishna]] gave this astra to his cousin [[Arjuna]].\n[[File:Shiva as the Lord of Dance LACMA.jpg|thumb|250px|11th-century statue of Shiva performing the dance of destruction.]]\n\n===Shiva===\n{{Main|Shiva}}\nMahadeva literally means \"Highest of all gods\".

Assigned with destroying all of the universe at the end of time, Shiva is one of the most fearsome warriors and unconquerable. [[Tandava]] is the dance of the destroyer, which he performs over the body of a demon. Shiva employs his power to kill the [[Asura]] Tripura, destroying the flying three cities of Tripura. In battle, Shiva and his Avatars deploy formidable weapons controlled by him. Some of these are:\n\n*''Arrow of Shiva'': It can destroy creation.

Examples include arrows from bows. A ''[[shastra]]'' is a personal weapon, like swords and maces, that must be constantly operated by the warrior.\n\n*''[[Brahmastra]]'': Embedded with the mystical force of [[Brahma]], this weapon releases millions of missiles, great fires and a destructive potential capable of extinguishing all creation, if not used by and aimed only at a celestial fighter. Modern speculation has equated its destructive nature to be similar to that of a [[nuclear weapon]], it has been used multiple times in Ramayana, Indrajit used it against Hanuman, Lakshmana asked permission to use it against Indrajit, which Rama declined, Lakshmana used it to kill Atikaya,  Rama used it as final arrow to kill Ravana. In the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the weapon manifest with the single head of Brahma as its tip. In Mahabharata era Parasurama, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Arjuna, Yudhishtir and several Maharathi's possessed the knowledge to invoke this weapon.\n*''[[Brahmashirsha astra]]'': A weapon capable of greater destruction than the ''Brahmastra''. It can burn all creation to ashes once discharged, Arjuna and Ashwathama both used it against each other after the Mahabharata war. Capable of killing even heavens. Was used by Ashwatthama on Parikshit. It is thought that the Brahmashirsha is the evolution of the Brahmastra, 4 times stronger than Brahmastra. \"It blazes up with terrible flames within a huge sphere of fire. Numerous peals of thunder were heard, thousands of meteors fell and all living creatures became terrified with great dread. The entire sky seemed to be filled with noise and assumed a terrible aspect with flames of fire. The whole earth with her mountains and waters and trees trembled.\" When it strikes an area it will cause complete destruction and nothing will ever grow, not even a blade of grass for the next 12 years.

In some texts it is called Brahma-dhanda astra, the weapon created by [[Saptarishi]]'s to counter any weapon ever created, even that of [[Trimurti]]'s. The rishi of this weapon is [[Para Brahman]]. It is said to be the most difficult astra to obtain. Capable of destroying entire universe in a blink of an eye. [[Vishvamitra]] used all kinds of divine weapons against sage [[Vashistha]], even [[Pashupatastra]], but the Brahma-dhanda astra of [[Vashistha]] neutralized and swallowed all [[astra (weapon)]] of Vishwamitra proving that Brahma-dhanda astra is the most powerful of all astras.<ref name=\"Bala Khanda Sarga 56\">{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1093926-bala-kanda-sarga-56/ | title=Brahmadhanda astra | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n*''[[Pashupatastra]]'': In Hinduism, it is believed that Pashupatastra is the most devastating weapon, as it is the weapon of the consort of the God head Mahadeva, i.e. Mahakali. Mahadeva literally means \"Highest of all gods\" and Mahakali means \"Goddess who is beyond time\". This weapon was granted to [[Arjuna]] by Shiva. It is the most destructive and foreboding weapon in ''Mahabharata''. It was first used by Shiva for the destruction of tripura.  It is capable of destroying entire multiverse.

These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light).

When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse.

He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is beyond all. In battle, the avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama, were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata.

The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.\n*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].\n*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The celestial bow of Vishnu. \n*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears.

It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself. [[Krishna]] gave this astra to his cousin [[Arjuna]].\n[[File:Shiva as the Lord of Dance LACMA.jpg|thumb|250px|11th-century statue of Shiva performing the dance of destruction.]]\n\n===Shiva===\n{{Main|Shiva}}\nMahadeva literally means \"Highest of all gods\".

Modern speculation has equated its destructive nature to be similar to that of a [[nuclear weapon]], it has been used multiple times in Ramayana, Indrajit used it against Hanuman, Lakshmana asked permission to use it against Indrajit, which Rama declined, Lakshmana used it to kill Atikaya,  Rama used it as final arrow to kill Ravana.

In 1977, she released her debut, [[Reba McEntire (album)|self-titled album]], which yielded four singles that failed to become major hits on the country chart. It was her next album, released in 1979, titled ''[[Out of a Dream (Reba McEntire album)|Out of a Dream]]'' that produced her first Top 40 hits and her first major hit, a remake of [[Patsy Cline]]'s \"[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]\". Between 1980 and 1984, McEntire had a series of Top 10 and 20 country hits, including \"(You Lift Me Up) To Heaven\", \"Today All Over Again\", \"[[Only You (And You Alone)]]\", and her first number one country hit, \"Can't Even Get the Blues\". However, she was not pleased with the music she was recording under the label ([[country pop]]-styled ballads) and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1984, where McEntire had more control over what she recorded and how she recorded it.\n\nUnder MCA, McEntire began to have her biggest success with the release of her 1984 album, ''[[My Kind of Country (Reba McEntire album)|My Kind of Country]]'', which celebrated traditional country music. The album spawned two number one hits, \"How Blue\" and \"Somebody Should Leave\", setting the trend for a string of number one hits McEntire would have in the late 1980s and into the early 1990s, including songs like \"[[Whoever's in New England]]\", \"[[Little Rock (Reba McEntire song)|Little Rock]]\", \"The Last One to Know\", \"One Promise Too Late\", \"Love Will Find Its Way to You\", \"Rumor Has It\", and \"For My Broken Heart\". Her success in the late 1980s helped revitalize traditional country music, and McEntire was considered one of the leaders in the traditional country sound of the late 1980s and 1990s, along with [[George Strait]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Patty Loveless]], and [[Randy Travis]].\n\nMcEntire's success continued into the late 1990s, especially after the release of 1996's ''[[What If It's You]]'', which yielded her first number one single in almost two years and three additional major hits. After the release of 1999's ''[[So Good Together]]'', McEntire branched out into acting and created her own television sitcom, ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'' (2001\u20132007), and didn't record or tour for nearly three years. In 2004, she returned to music with her 24th studio album, ''[[Room to Breathe (Reba McEntire album)|Room to Breathe]]''. The album produced her first number one hit since 1998 and three additional major hits between 2004 and 2005. In 2007, she released her 25th and final album for MCA, ''[[Reba: Duets]]'', a collection of duets with other recording artists, including [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Kenny Chesney]], and [[Justin Timberlake]]. In 2008, she signed with the [[Valory Music Group]], which released her first single, \"Strange\", to radio in early April 2009.\n\nIn her 35-year career, McEntire has garnered 32 number one singles, she now holds the record for the most number one singles by a female country artist. In addition, McEntire holds the record for the most Top 10 hits by a female country artist, surpassing [[Dolly Parton]]'s record in 2009 with her 56th Top 10 hit, \"[[Cowgirls Don't Cry]]\", a duet with [[Brooks & Dunn]].\n\n== As lead artist ==\n=== 1970s ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of singles, with selected chart positions, showing year released and album name\n!

In 1977, she released her debut, [[Reba McEntire (album)|self-titled album]], which yielded four singles that failed to become major hits on the country chart. It was her next album, released in 1979, titled ''[[Out of a Dream (Reba McEntire album)|Out of a Dream]]'' that produced her first Top 40 hits and her first major hit, a remake of [[Patsy Cline]]'s \"[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]\". Between 1980 and 1984, McEntire had a series of Top 10 and 20 country hits, including \"(You Lift Me Up) To Heaven\", \"Today All Over Again\", \"[[Only You (And You Alone)]]\", and her first number one country hit, \"Can't Even Get the Blues\". However, she was not pleased with the music she was recording under the label ([[country pop]]-styled ballads) and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1984, where McEntire had more control over what she recorded and how she recorded it.\n\nUnder MCA, McEntire began to have her biggest success with the release of her 1984 album, ''[[My Kind of Country (Reba McEntire album)|My Kind of Country]]'', which celebrated traditional country music. The album spawned two number one hits, \"How Blue\" and \"Somebody Should Leave\", setting the trend for a string of number one hits McEntire would have in the late 1980s and into the early 1990s, including songs like \"[[Whoever's in New England]]\", \"[[Little Rock (Reba McEntire song)|Little Rock]]\", \"The Last One to Know\", \"One Promise Too Late\", \"Love Will Find Its Way to You\", \"Rumor Has It\", and \"For My Broken Heart\". Her success in the late 1980s helped revitalize traditional country music, and McEntire was considered one of the leaders in the traditional country sound of the late 1980s and 1990s, along with [[George Strait]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Patty Loveless]], and [[Randy Travis]].\n\nMcEntire's success continued into the late 1990s, especially after the release of 1996's ''[[What If It's You]]'', which yielded her first number one single in almost two years and three additional major hits. After the release of 1999's ''[[So Good Together]]'', McEntire branched out into acting and created her own television sitcom, ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'' (2001\u20132007), and didn't record or tour for nearly three years. In 2004, she returned to music with her 24th studio album, ''[[Room to Breathe (Reba McEntire album)|Room to Breathe]]''. The album produced her first number one hit since 1998 and three additional major hits between 2004 and 2005. In 2007, she released her 25th and final album for MCA, ''[[Reba: Duets]]'', a collection of duets with other recording artists, including [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Kenny Chesney]], and [[Justin Timberlake]].

It was founded in 1993 and currently there are over 220 students<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. It is known for its high level of learning and for being one of the most serious hesder yeshivas in Israel. \n==History==\nIn the early 1970s, a group of [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]] settled in Yeruham with the goal of imporving the south of Israel, and helping to increase the quality of life for the residents of Yerucham.

The project revolves around a group of nine schoolgirl friends who become [[Japanese idol|idols]] in order to save their school from shutting down. It launched in the August 2010 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'', and went on to produce music CDs, anime music videos, two [[manga]] adaptations, and video games.\n\nA 13-episode [[anime]] television series produced by Sunrise, directed by Takahiko Ky\u014dgoku, and written by [[Jukki Hanada]] aired in Japan between January and March 2013, with a second season airing between April and June 2014. Both anime series and film are licensed in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand by [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]], [[MVM Entertainment]] and [[Madman Entertainment]], respectively. An animated film titled ''[[Love Live! The School Idol Movie]]'' was distributed by [[Shochiku]] and released in June 2015. A follow-up project focusing on a new set of idols, titled ''[[Love Live! Sunshine!!]]'', launched in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nHonoka K\u014dsaka is a girl who attends Otonokizaka Academy (\u97f3\u30ce\u6728\u5742\u5b66\u9662, Otonokizaka Gakuin). When the school is scheduled to be closed due to a lack of applicants, Honoka becomes determined to save it. Honoka goes to UTX, where her little sister planned to go for high school, and sees a crowd watching a music video of A-Rise, UTX's school idol group. Learning that school idols are popular, Honoka and her friends follow A-Rise's footsteps and start their own school idol group called \u03bc's (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba, My\u016bzu, pronounced \"muse\") to attract new students. Once they successfully prevent Otonokizaka Academy from closing, the girls from \u03bc's set their sights higher. They participate in Love Live, the ultimate school idol competition featuring the best groups in the country. Despite winning the competition, the girls from \u03bc's disband soon after for their own personal reasons, and because the third-years are graduating.\n\n==Characters==\nWhere appropriate, plot descriptions mentioned below refer to the anime television series.

The project revolves around a group of nine schoolgirl friends who become [[Japanese idol|idols]] in order to save their school from shutting down. It launched in the August 2010 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'', and went on to produce music CDs, anime music videos, two [[manga]] adaptations, and video games.\n\nA 13-episode [[anime]] television series produced by Sunrise, directed by Takahiko Ky\u014dgoku, and written by [[Jukki Hanada]] aired in Japan between January and March 2013, with a second season airing between April and June 2014. Both anime series and film are licensed in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand by [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]], [[MVM Entertainment]] and [[Madman Entertainment]], respectively. An animated film titled ''[[Love Live! The School Idol Movie]]'' was distributed by [[Shochiku]] and released in June 2015. A follow-up project focusing on a new set of idols, titled ''[[Love Live! Sunshine!!]]'', launched in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nHonoka K\u014dsaka is a girl who attends {{Nihongo|Otonokizaka Academy|\u97f3\u30ce\u6728\u5742\u5b66\u9662|Otonokizaka Gakuin}}. When the school is scheduled to be closed due to a lack of applicants, Honoka becomes determined to save it. Honoka goes to UTX, where her little sister planned to go for high school, and sees a crowd watching a music video of A-Rise, UTX's school idol group. Learning that school idols are popular, Honoka and her friends follow A-Rise's footsteps and start their own school idol group called {{nihongo|\u03bc's|\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba|My\u016bzu|pronounced \"muse\"}} to attract new students. Once they successfully prevent Otonokizaka Academy from closing, the girls from \u03bc's set their sights higher. They participate in Love Live, the ultimate school idol competition featuring the best groups in the country. Despite winning the competition, the girls from \u03bc's disband soon after for their own personal reasons, and because the third-years are graduating.\n\n==Characters==\nWhere appropriate, plot descriptions mentioned below refer to the anime television series.

He was also instrumental in the beginnings of international efforts to establish international accounting standards. A professorship at the Harvard Business School is named after him.\n\n== Life ==\n\nDickinson was the eldest son of [[Lowes Cato Dickinson]], a Victorian portrait painter, and Margaret Ellen Williams, whose father had discovered [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] as reader for Smith, Elder, and Company. His younger brother, [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson]] was a distinguished political scientist and philosopher. He also had five sisters.\n\nHe was educated at [[Charterhouse School]], and at [[King's College Cambridge]], where he studied mathematics and graduated in 1882.

The episode aired on April 6, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|The Cousins]] arrive at a cartel site in Mexico to pick up Lalo's bail money. As they depart, an informant inside the building makes a telephone call to report their presence.<ref name=\"variety gilligan\" />\n\nLalo gives Jimmy directions to a remote desert pickup site. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go but asks for $100,000 as his fee, and Lalo agrees. Kim tries to persuade Jimmy not to do it, and says she does not want him to go, but he says he intends to do it because it will be an easy job and no one will suspect him of being the courier.\n\nJimmy is waiting at the pickup site when The Cousins arrive. They deliver two bags of cash to Jimmy, then immediately depart. As Jimmy starts his return trip, one truck begins following him and several others cut him off. Several gunmen exit the vehicles, take the money, and prepare to kill Jimmy. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed and their vehicles are disabled. The surviving gunman escapes in the only truck that is still drivable.\n\nThe shooter is Mike, whose truck was also disabled in the shootout. He places the cash back in Jimmy's car, and Jimmy and he start the drive back to Albuquerque. Jimmy's car breaks down, so they remove the money, push the car over the edge of the road, then begin walking cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. As they camp overnight, Jimmy tells Mike that Kim knows some details of his work for Lalo, and Mike tells Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". Jimmy and Mike resume their trek the following morning.\n\nWhen Jimmy fails to return, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney to see him in jail and ask for Jimmy's location so she can search for him. Lalo refuses, telling her that Jimmy will be fine because he is a survivor.\n\nA dehydrated and sunburned Jimmy reaches his limit, and Mike's attempts to motivate him fail. Mike sees the surviving gunman is still searching for them. Rather than hide as Mike intends, Jimmy runs to the side of the road to attract the gunman's attention and draw him in. When he is close enough, Mike shoots him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed.
