A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

She was raised by her maternal uncle Asad Niazi and his wife Nafeesa. Asad and Nafeesa have a daughter and a son of their own Nishaal ([[Areeba Habib]]) and Umair ([[Muneeb Butt]]). Rabail, being much elder than Umair, always took care of him like an elder sister, but she was not aware that little Umair has developed feelings for her. When he reveals his feelings to her, Rabail is horrified as she always took him as a younger brother. Umair's mother overhears the conversation and decides that the best solution is to get Rabail married off to someone as soon as possible.\n\nA parallel story is that of Zain ([[Imran Abbas Naqvi|Imran Abbas]]), the son of a wealthy business man. Zain is a carefree man who is obsessed with beauty. He once sees Nishaal and falls madly in love with her beauty and tries to approach her. A misunderstanding leads him to believe that the name of the girl he loves is Rabail. He thinks that Nishaal is Rabail. He meets Nishaal on numerous occasions, first Nishaal ignores him but then grows a liking for him too. Zain discovers that the girl he loves is the daughter of his father's friend Asad Niazi, and sends a proposal for Rabail. Rabail, under pressure from Nishal, tricks Umair into going college to study and promises that she'd wait for him and would not marry anyone else. Umair is satisfied and he happily leaves. But the original plan of Rabail, Nafeesa and Nishaal is to get Rabail married.\n\nNishaal finally finds out that the proposal that has come for Rabail is of Zain. Both Zain and Nishaal are heartbroken because they had fallen in love, even though they had not spent much time together. Nishaal tells Zain about her newly developed feelings for him because she had come  to see him as her \"ideal\" man, but Zain refuses because for the first time in his life, he had made his father proud and happy and Zain does not want to spoil this new, sweet relationship with his father, so he sacifices his love and gets married to Rabail. Umair gets to know about the betrayal and he reaches the Nikkaah ceremony, but Rabail is already married to Zain. Umair has a nervous breakdown.\n\nZain tries to make Nishaal jealous by pretending to get close to his fianc\u00e9e Rabail, but Nishaal backfires by flirting with Zain's best friend Zia. Rabail and Zain are finally married, but Zain leaves Rabail alone on the wedding night because he cannot have a relationship with her. Zain and Nishaal leave their egoes and rekindle their relationship. However, their relationship is discovered by Zain's father Ibrar, who has a heart attack and dies after making Zain promise that he would never divorce Rabail. Zain agrees to fulfil his father's last wish despite being in love with Nishaal. Zain and Rabail agree to continue their relationship for the sake of Zain's dead father, but Nishal can't tolerate seeing them together. She instigates Zain against Rabail by telling him about Umair's feelings for Rabail and make her look like a culprit who was responsible for developing those feelings and left after she got bored of Umair.\n\nAfter patching up with Zain, Nishaal starts to ignore Zia totally and he keeps on trying to contact her by calling and messaging her. Zia knows that Zain's sister Sobia has a crush on Zia so Zia uses this to take revenge from Zain by getting engaged to Sobia and disappearing on the wedding day. Because of Rabail, Zia finally realizes his mistake and Rabail gets Zia and Sobia married. Zain and Nishaal get a nikkahfied and Zain leaves his house to settle with Nishaal in a new one. Rabail finds out she is pregnant. She receives tremdous support from Zain's mother Gulshan in every aspect of her life. Gulshan tries her best to bring Rabail and Zain together. Nishal tries to persuade Zain to divorce Rabail but for some reason Zain avoids this. Rabail gives birth to Zain's daughter Ujala. A year later, Zain realizes that he doesn't truly love Nishaal, he was just attracted to her beauty. In fact, she is a horrible girl who knows nothing about love, family values and respects. He realizes that he has never been truly happy with Nishaal as she is shallow. He realizes that beauty isn't everything someone needs in life. On the other hand, he looks towards Rabail's moral and cultural values and regrets for not valuing her deep sense of existence. He goes back to Rabail, apologises for everything he has done. But it is just not easy to forgive so easily when the wounds are deep. The innocent Rabail turns into a cold-hearted lady. Meanwhile, Gulshan dies due to the trauma of the separation from her son. Zain is full of guilt and regret. Zain, is guilty about what he did and asks Rabail to forgive him. Meanwhile, Nishaal is furious on Zain who starts having feelings for Rabail. She gets to know that she is expecting. She waits for a whole day for Zain to come home, but unfortunately he doesn't. She goes to his house and gets a slap from Zain. In fury, she leaves her report there and leaves. Zain who reads it now goes after her. Nishaal tries to commit suicide but is saved by Rabail's friend. Nishaal blames Rabail for being responsible for the death of her child. But Rabail's friend tells her that Rabail didn't even touch her and instead she did her treatment. Rabail gets really hurt and leaves.\n \nUmair comes to her house later that day and brings flowers for her as it is her birthday. Zain, comes the very moment but knowing the truth he doesn't say anything. He rather asks Umair to request Rabail to forgive him for his mistakes. Umair ensures him that he will talk to Rabail.\n\nZain comes to Umair's house to take her back home but she refuses. Later Rabail accepts Umair. They are shown enjoying rain which indicates happily ever after for the two. The show ends with Zain regretting with no loved one left in life.\n\n==Cast== \n{| class=\"wikitable\n! Actor !!

However, Latham stated neither body showed signs of compressive neck injuries, knife wounds, drugging or poisoning, and that both girls had most likely died of asphyxiation.<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/>\n\nIn a direct reference to Huntley's claims both girls' deaths had been [[Accidental death|accidental]], Latham stated that \"only one person knows what happened\" after the friends entered his home.<ref name=\"Last Hours of Holly and Jessica\"/> However, he further stressed the cause of death was undoubtedly murder, adding: \"Ten-year-old girls don't just drop dead.\"<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/> In reference to Carr's attempts to pervert the course of justice, Latham stated that \"as surely as night follows day\" the two had conspired to concoct a false [[alibi]] to divert suspicion from Huntley,<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/> although he warned the jury Carr could only be convicted of assisting an offender if they believed she had known Huntley had murdered the girls, adding her actual motive for providing lies to police with reference to the charge of perverting the course of justice was irrelevant.<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/>\n\nOver the course of three days, Latham outlined the efforts of both defendants to divert suspicion away from Huntley, and Huntley's own efforts to destroy all physical and [[circumstantial evidence]] linking him to the crime,<ref name=\"How Huntley's Charade Crumbled\"/> although despite these efforts, investigators had retrieved enough evidence to prove the children had been murdered within his home and\u2014within approximately twelve hours of their deaths\u2014transported in his vehicle to the location where their bodies would be discovered on 17 August.

She further explained the reason for the lack of any definitive traces of semen being discovered could have been a result of the charred and melted condition of the articles she had inspected. A scenes of crime officer also testified on this date that, despite Huntley's exhaustive efforts to remove any physical evidence of his crime from his home, a forensic examination had revealed several traces of [[blood spatter]]ing about the hallway and main entrance to the master bedroom.<ref>{{cite news|title=Huntley: 'I Hid Clothes'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/huntley-i-hid-clothes-7224896.html|accessdate=19 December 2019|work=Evening Standard|date=24 November 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Defendants' testimony===\nOn 1 December, Huntley testified before the court in his own [[defense (law)|defence]].

According to Huntley, he, Wells and Chapman had entered his bathroom to stem a mild nosebleed Wells had been suffering when the girls had walked by his home. The bath was already filled with water as he had been cleaning his dog that afternoon. In the bathroom, he had slipped and accidentally knocked Wells into his bath while helping her [[wikt:stanch|stanch]] her nosebleed, and this unintentional act had caused her to drown as he himself had simply \"panicked and froze\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Huntley 'Just Panicked and Froze'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3252382.stm|accessdate=28 December 2019|work=BBC News|date=1 December 2003}}</ref> He further claimed Chapman had witnessed this accident and began repeatedly screaming, \"You pushed her!\"<ref>{{cite news|title='You Pushed Her,' Jessica Screamed, then Huntley Moved to Silence Her|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1447732/You-pushed-her-Jessica-screamed-then-Huntley-moved-to-silence-her.html|accessdate=26 January 2020|work=The Telegraph|date=26 November 2003}}</ref> and that he had then accidentally [[Asphyxia|suffocated]] her while attempting to stifle her screaming, which had preoccupied his attention as opposed to ensuring Wells did not drown.

He further tearfully claimed he had not attempted to feign insanity upon his arrest; insisting the trauma of the children's deaths had temporarily erased his memory and his being in the presence of police had caused his mind to temporarily seize.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n\nOn 3 December, Carr took the stand to testify in her own defence. Responding to questioning from her own defence counsel, Michael Hubbard QC, Carr briefly discussed her initial acquaintance with Huntley, their subsequent relationship and plans to start a family once they both obtained financial stability before Hubbard directed his questioning toward her return to Soham on 6 August and her discovering Huntley had recently washed their bedding and had evidently cleaned sections of the house. To these questions, Carr explained that her first impression had been that Huntley had \"had a woman in the house\", adding their bedding had been washed shortly before 4 August. Carr further testified to having noted a crack in the [[enamel paint|enamel]] of the bathtub which had not been there when she had travelled to Grimsby four days previously.<ref>{{cite news|title='I Thought He'd Had a Woman in the House|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1448464/I-thought-hed-had-a-woman-in-the-house.html|accessdate=15 November 2019|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2003}}</ref> When questioned as to why she had then assisted Huntley in extensively cleaning their home in the days following the children's murder, Carr claimed she had done so as she had always been \"obsessive about tidiness.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceG\">''Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54142-3}} p. 278</ref>\n\nQuestioned as to the efforts she had subsequently made to mislead both police and the media to divert suspicion from her partner, Carr emphasised she had only lied to police, the media and \"anyone who asks\" to protect Huntley, who had repeatedly assured her of his innocence of any wrongdoing and his fear or being \"fitted up\"<ref>{{cite news|title=A 'Charmer' Drawn to Schoolgirls|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3301527.stm|accessdate=22 December 2019|work=BBC News|date=17 December 2003}}</ref> by police for the girls' disappearance should they discover the 1998 rape allegation made against him.<ref>{{cite news|title='If, For a Minute, I Knew or Believed He Had Murdered Those Girls I Would be Horrified'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/if-for-a-minute-i-knew-or-believed-he-had-murdered-those-girls-i-would-be-horrified-81071.html|accessdate=13 November 2019|work=The Independent|date=4 December 2003}}</ref> She further claimed to have referred to Wells and Chapman using past tense merely because had worked with the children in the past.<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/>\n\nCarr further claimed she had initially attempted to persuade Huntley to contact police and \"be open\" as to his claims to have invited the children into his home in order that Wells could stanch her nosebleed, but that he had refused to do so, as inviting children into their home had been a violation of the rules imposed by St Andrew's Primary School. She further explained her focus had therefore been to protect Huntley's job and reputation, adding that had she known of Huntley's actual guilt, she would never have attempted to provide him with a false alibi, stating to her counsel: \"If, for a minute, I [had known] or believed he'd murdered either of those girls I would have been horrified.\"<ref name=\"biography.com\"/>\n\nConcluding his questioning, Hubbard cautioned the jury not to succumb to the temptation of judging Carr's [[morality]], but to consider her state of mind prior to her arrest when considering whether the lies she had told warranted any criminal liability, stating she had \"done no wrong\" on the date of the children's murder, and had not returned to Soham until 6 August.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maxine Carr Takes the Stand to Tell the Court Why She Stood by Huntley|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/maxine-carr-takes-the-stand-to-tell-the-court-why-she-stood-by-huntley-1.397193|accessdate=14 November 2019|work=The Irish Times|date=4 December 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Closing arguments==\nOn 10 December, counsels for both prosecution and defence delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury.

We suggest that this whole business in the house was motivated by something sexual. But, whatever he initiated, plainly went wrong. Therefore, in this ruthless man's mind, both girls had to die in his own selfish self-interest.\" Referencing Carr's conscious efforts to deceive the police and media alike, Latham simply stated: \"She had the prospect of marriage, a baby, a nice home and a new start.

He conceded his client was indeed guilty of physical responsibility for the girls' actual deaths\u2014as Huntley had admitted\u2014and therefore deserved punishment, although he argued the prosecution had failed to provide definitive [[Evidence (law)|proof]] Huntley had actually intended to actually murder the children or cause them actual [[bodily harm]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Find Him Guilty of Manslaughter, QC Tells Jury|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/11/soham.ukcrime2|accessdate=14 November 2019|work=The Guardian]|date=11 December 2003}}</ref> Furthermore, Coward contended the prosecution had failed to provide conclusive evidence to support their claim that Huntley's actual motive for the murders had been sexual.

Following a heated argument in the summer of 1979, Shirley ordered her husband to leave the household. Shortly thereafter, she and her daughters relocated to the village of [[Keelby]]. Alfred seldom maintained contact with his wife and children, and refused to provide any financial support for his daughters. Capp and her older sister, Hayley (born 1967), were largely raised by their mother and grandparents. The family regularly experienced severe financial difficulties, although Shirley would later state she \"spoiled\" her daughters to the best of her financial ability.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\">''Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54142-3}} p. 53</ref>\n\nAs a child and adolescent, Capp was viewed by her peers as something of a timid outcast, with few friends.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maxine is Another of His Victims|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/maxine-is-another-one-of-his-victims-7224619.html|accessdate=3 December 2019|work=Evening Standard|date=17 December 2003}}</ref> She performed poorly academically, although she always held aspirations to become a teacher.<ref>''Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54142-3}} p. 83</ref>\n\nBy the time Capp entered adolescence, she was slightly overweight, leading her to become insecure about her physical appearance.

She briefly worked alongside her mother in a fish processing plant as she considered which career path she should choose before enrolling at the [[Grimsby Institute of Further & Higher Education]], having chosen to study general care. Capp obtained her diploma in 1996. The same year, she and her mother moved from Keelby back to Grimsby.

Carr only replied to his missed call at 6:23&nbsp;p.m. This four-minute phone call escalated into a heated argument, culminating in Huntley angrily terminating the phone call after she informed him of her intentions to again socialise in Grimsby that evening. Four minutes later, Carr sent Huntley a text message which read: \"Don't make me feel bad because I'm with my family.\"<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> Huntley did not reply to this message.<ref name=\"The Maxine Question\"/>\n\n==Bichard enquiry==\nImmediately following Huntley's conviction, his previous criminal history was disclosed to the public. These disclosures revealed that, despite his extensive record of sexual offences against underage girls and young women and evident criminal recidivism, not only had police failed to pursue these previous criminal complaints and allegations, but Huntley had secured a position of employment facilitating his access to children.<ref>{{cite news|title=Huntley Investigated Eight Times|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/17/soham.ukcrime6|accessdate=21 October 2019|work=The Guardian|date=17 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nUpon learning of these public disclosures, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] announced a [[public inquiry|public enquiry]] into the [[Criminal Records Bureau|intelligence-based record keeping]] and [[Vetting|vetting system]] which had allowed Huntley to obtain employment as a school caretaker despite these previous criminal complaints, which had been reported to both police and social services. Chaired by [[Michael Bichard, Baron Bichard|Sir Michael Bichard]], the [[Bichard report|Bichard enquiry]] opened on 13 January 2004.<ref name=\"The Legacy of Holly and Jessica\"/> The results of this enquiry were published in June that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/bichard-inquiry-report|title=The Bichard Report|date=17 June 2009|publisher=|work=homeoffice.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe stated purpose of the Bichard enquiry was:\n{{cquote|Urgently to enquire into child protection procedures in [[Humberside Police]] and [[Cambridgeshire Constabulary]] in the light of the recent trial and conviction of Ian Huntley for the murder of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.\n\nIn particular to assess the effectiveness of the relevant intelligence-based record keeping, the vetting practices in those forces since 1995 and information sharing with other agencies, and to report to the Home Secretary on matters of local and national relevance and make recommendations as appropriate.}}\n\nOne of the pertinent issues of concern to be scrutinised by the Bichard report surfaced almost immediately when Humberside Police stated their belief in it being unlawful under the [[Data Protection Act 1984|Data Protection Act]] to hold data regarding criminal allegations which had not lead to a conviction; this claim was criticised by other police forces who thought this too strict an interpretation of the Act. The enquiry severely scrutinised the actual investigation by Cambridgeshire Police into the children's disappearance and murder, as almost two weeks had elapsed following the disappearance of Wells and Chapman before Cambridgeshire Police became aware of Huntley's previous criminal background, despite his claims to be the last individual to see the children alive.<ref name=\"Blunder After Blunder\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/18/children.soham | title=Blunder After Blunder| work=The Guardian |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> Further criticism was directed at the force for their initial failure to scrutinise Carr's claims to have been in Soham on the date of the children's disappearance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Poor Intelligence, Poor Data System and Poor Media Strategy: Police Own Up to Failures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/18/soham.ukcrime6|accessdate=9 January 2020|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe enquiry also severely criticised Humberside Police for deleting information relating to the previous criminal allegations against Huntley and also criticised Cambridgeshire Police for not following standard vetting guidelines. Both the Humberside and Cambridgeshire Police were heavily criticised for their failings in maintaining criminal intelligence records on Huntley.<ref name=\"Blunder After Blunder\"/>\n\nBichard later ordered the suspension of the Chief of Humberside Police, [[David Westwood]], for ordering the destruction of criminal records pertaining to alleged child molesters which had not resulted in a conviction. (This suspension was later overturned.) Westwood retired from the position of Chief of Humberside Police in March 2005. The Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Tom Lloyd, was also subjected to severe criticism as his force had failed to contact Humberside Police during the investigation into Huntley's criminal background prior to his securing employment at Soham Village College.<ref>{{cite news|title=Profile: Cambridge Chief Tom Lloyd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3827459.stm|date=22 June 2004|accessdate=11 March 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nAn added complication in these criminal vetting procedures was the fact that Huntley had applied for the caretaker's job under the name of Ian Nixon, although he did divulge upon the application form for this position that he was previously known as Ian Huntley. It is believed that Cambridgeshire Police failed to perform a background check under the name Huntley. Had they actually done so, they would have discovered an outstanding burglary charge on file relating to his November 1995 arrest for this crime.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blunkett Orders Police Chief's Suspension |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/22/childrensservices.schools|accessdate=21 October 2019|work=The Guardian|date=22 June 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Recommendations===\nThe Bichard enquiry recommended the implementation of a mandatory registration scheme for people working with children and vulnerable adults such as the elderly and mentally handicapped.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/dec/17/childrensservices.soham | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=The CRB Explained: How the Criminal Records Bureau Operates| date=17 December 2003|accessdate=16 April 2011| location=London| first=Polly| last=Curtis}}</ref> This recommendation later led to the foundation of the [[Independent Safeguarding Authority]]. The findings also suggested a national system should be implemented for police forces to share intelligence information, and that all police forces should follow a clear code of practice on record-keeping.

However, Latham stated neither body showed signs of compressive neck injuries, knife wounds, drugging or poisoning, and that both girls had most likely died of asphyxiation.<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/>\n\nIn a direct reference to Huntley's claims both girls' deaths had been [[Accidental death|accidental]], Latham stated that \"only one person knows what happened\" after the friends entered his home.<ref name=\"Last Hours of Holly and Jessica\"/> However, he further stressed the cause of death was undoubtedly murder, adding: \"Ten-year-old girls don't just drop dead.\"<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/> In reference to Carr's attempts to pervert the course of justice, Latham stated that \"as surely as night follows day\" the two had conspired to concoct a false [[alibi]] to divert suspicion from Huntley,<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/> although he warned the jury Carr could only be convicted of assisting an offender if they believed she had known Huntley had murdered the girls, adding her actual motive for providing lies to police with reference to the charge of perverting the course of justice was irrelevant.<ref name=\"Asphyxia 'Likely Cause' of Soham Deaths\"/>\n\nOver the course of three days, Latham outlined the efforts of both defendants to divert suspicion away from Huntley, and Huntley's own efforts to destroy all physical and [[circumstantial evidence]] linking him to the crime,<ref name=\"How Huntley's Charade Crumbled\"/> although despite these efforts, investigators had retrieved enough evidence to prove the children had been murdered within his home and\u2014within approximately twelve hours of their deaths\u2014transported in his vehicle to the location where their bodies would be discovered on 17 August.

She further explained the reason for the lack of any definitive traces of semen being discovered could have been a result of the charred and melted condition of the articles she had inspected. A scenes of crime officer also testified on this date that, despite Huntley's exhaustive efforts to remove any physical evidence of his crime from his home, a forensic examination had revealed several traces of [[blood spatter]]ing about the hallway and main entrance to the master bedroom.<ref>{{cite news|title=Huntley: 'I Hid Clothes'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/huntley-i-hid-clothes-7224896.html|accessdate=19 December 2019|work=Evening Standard|date=24 November 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Defendants' testimony===\nOn 1 December, Huntley testified before the court in his own [[defense (law)|defence]].

According to Huntley, he, Wells and Chapman had entered his bathroom to stem a mild nosebleed Wells had been suffering when the girls had walked by his home. The bath was already filled with water as he had been cleaning his dog that afternoon. In the bathroom, he had slipped and accidentally knocked Wells into his bath while helping her [[wikt:stanch|stanch]] her nosebleed, and this unintentional act had caused her to drown as he himself had simply \"panicked and froze\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Huntley 'Just Panicked and Froze'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3252382.stm|accessdate=28 December 2019|work=BBC News|date=1 December 2003}}</ref> He further claimed Chapman had witnessed this accident and began repeatedly screaming, \"You pushed her!\"<ref>{{cite news|title='You Pushed Her,' Jessica Screamed, then Huntley Moved to Silence Her|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1447732/You-pushed-her-Jessica-screamed-then-Huntley-moved-to-silence-her.html|accessdate=26 January 2020|work=The Telegraph|date=26 November 2003}}</ref> and that he had then accidentally [[Asphyxia|suffocated]] her while attempting to stifle her screaming, which had preoccupied his attention as opposed to ensuring Wells did not drown.

He further tearfully claimed he had not attempted to feign insanity upon his arrest; insisting the trauma of the children's deaths had temporarily erased his memory and his being in the presence of police had caused his mind to temporarily seize.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n\nOn 3 December, Carr took the stand to testify in her own defence. Responding to questioning from her own defence counsel, Michael Hubbard QC, Carr briefly discussed her initial acquaintance with Huntley, their subsequent relationship and plans to start a family once they both obtained financial stability before Hubbard directed his questioning toward her return to Soham on 6 August and her discovering Huntley had recently washed their bedding and had evidently cleaned sections of the house. To these questions, Carr explained that her first impression had been that Huntley had \"had a woman in the house\", adding their bedding had been washed shortly before 4 August. Carr further testified to having noted a crack in the [[enamel]] of the bathtub which had not been there when she had travelled to Grimsby four days previously.<ref>{{cite news|title='I Thought He'd Had a Woman in the House|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1448464/I-thought-hed-had-a-woman-in-the-house.html|accessdate=15 November 2019|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2003}}</ref> When questioned as to why she had then assisted Huntley in extensively cleaning their home in the days following the children's murder, Carr claimed she had done so as she had always been \"obsessive about tidiness.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceG\">''Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54142-3}} p. 278</ref>\n\nQuestioned as to the efforts she had subsequently made to mislead both police and the media to divert suspicion from her partner, Carr emphasised she had only lied to police, the media and \"anyone who asks\" to protect Huntley, who had repeatedly assured her of his innocence of any wrongdoing and his fear or being \"fitted up\"<ref>{{cite news|title=A 'Charmer' Drawn to Schoolgirls|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3301527.stm|accessdate=22 December 2019|work=BBC News|date=17 December 2003}}</ref> by police for the girls' disappearance should they discover the 1998 rape allegation made against him.<ref>{{cite news|title='If, For a Minute, I Knew or Believed He Had Murdered Those Girls I Would be Horrified'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/if-for-a-minute-i-knew-or-believed-he-had-murdered-those-girls-i-would-be-horrified-81071.html|accessdate=13 November 2019|work=The Independent|date=4 December 2003}}</ref> She further claimed to have referred to Wells and Chapman using past tense merely because had worked with the children in the past.<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/>\n\nCarr further claimed she had initially attempted to persuade Huntley to contact police and \"be open\" as to his claims to have invited the children into his home in order that Wells could stanch her nosebleed, but that he had refused to do so, as inviting children into their home had been a violation of the rules imposed by St Andrew's Primary School. She further explained her focus had therefore been to protect Huntley's job and reputation, adding that had she known of Huntley's actual guilt, she would never have attempted to provide him with a false alibi, stating to her counsel: \"If, for a minute, I [had known] or believed he'd murdered either of those girls I would have been horrified.\"<ref name=\"biography.com\"/>\n\nConcluding his questioning, Hubbard cautioned the jury not to succumb to the temptation of judging Carr's [[morality]], but to consider her state of mind prior to her arrest when considering whether the lies she had told warranted any criminal liability, stating she had \"done no wrong\" on the date of the children's murder, and had not returned to Soham until 6 August.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maxine Carr Takes the Stand to Tell the Court Why She Stood by Huntley|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/maxine-carr-takes-the-stand-to-tell-the-court-why-she-stood-by-huntley-1.397193|accessdate=14 November 2019|work=The Irish Times|date=4 December 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Closing arguments==\nOn 10 December, counsels for both prosecution and defence delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. Latham delivered his closing argument on behalf of the prosecution by describing both Huntley and Carr as \"accomplished liars\"<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/> before outlining the prosecution's case both children had to die to satisfy Huntley's \"selfish self-interest\" before Huntley\u2014with Carr's support\u2014had embarked on twelve days of \"cynical deception\", with Carr only revealing the truth about her lies to police after being informed of the discovery of the children's bodies.<ref name=\"Soham Pair 'Convincing Liars'\">{{cite news|title=Soham Pair 'Convincing Liars'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3306221.stm|accessdate=13 November 2019|work=The Guardian|date=10 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nReferencing Huntley's likely motive for the murders and his claims at trial that both deaths had been accidental, Latham stated: \"We invite you to reject the accounts of both deaths [being accidental] as desperate lies; the only way out for him. We suggest that this whole business in the house was motivated by something sexual. But, whatever he initiated, plainly went wrong. Therefore, in this ruthless man's mind, both girls had to die in his own selfish self-interest.\" Referencing Carr's conscious efforts to deceive the police and media alike, Latham simply stated: \"She had the prospect of marriage, a baby, a nice home and a new start. She preferred to do what she could to make the best of the position she was in. That involved at all costs protecting Ian Huntley.\"<ref>''Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54142-3}} pp. 277-279</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the prosecution's closing argument, Coward delivered his argument on behalf of the defence. He conceded his client was indeed guilty of physical responsibility for the girls' actual deaths\u2014as Huntley had admitted\u2014and therefore deserved punishment, although he argued the prosecution had failed to provide definitive [[Evidence (law)|proof]] Huntley had actually intended to actually murder the children or cause them actual [[bodily harm]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Find Him Guilty of Manslaughter, QC Tells Jury|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/11/soham.ukcrime2|accessdate=14 November 2019|work=The Guardian]|date=11 December 2003}}</ref> Furthermore, Coward contended the prosecution had failed to provide conclusive evidence to support their claim that Huntley's actual motive for the murders had been sexual.

Huntley also developed a hobby of [[Aircraft spotting|plane spotting]].

Three of these girls were aged 15, and one 13. One of these girls would become pregnant,<ref name=\"Ian Huntley Biography\"/> and gave birth to a baby girl in 1998.<ref name=\"https\"/> Although reported to police on three occasions, Huntley was not charged for any of these offences as each of the girls denied having engaged in sex with Huntley.

In this instance, a woman was raped and Huntley\u2013by this stage suspected by police as being a serial sex offender\u2013was interviewed. Huntley supplied a DNA sample to assist in their enquiries, with Carr also providing an alibi to support his claims of innocence. The victim of this assault subsequently stated her belief that Huntley had not been the perpetrator of her assault.

Following a heated argument in the summer of 1979, Shirley ordered her husband to leave the household. Shortly thereafter, she and her daughters relocated to the village of [[Keelby]]. Alfred seldom maintained contact with his wife and children, and refused to provide any financial support for his daughters.

This card was made approximately two weeks before the child's murder.<ref>''Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54142-3}} p. 190</ref>]]\n\n===Summer 2002===\nBy the summer of 2002, the physical relationship between Huntley and Carr had begun to deteriorate. By Huntley's own later admission, he had become sexually frustrated, and he had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade a married colleague to date him on the weekend Carr visited her mother in Grimsby.<ref>''Beyond Evil: Inside the Twisted Mind of Ian Huntley'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54142-3}} p. 107</ref>\n\nAt 9:53&nbsp;a.m. on 4 August, Huntley attempted to phone Carr, although she did not answer her mobile phone. Carr only replied to his missed call at 6:23&nbsp;p.m. This four-minute phone call escalated into a heated argument, culminating in Huntley angrily terminating the phone call after she informed him of her intentions to again socialise in Grimsby that evening. Four minutes later, Carr sent Huntley a text message which read: \"Don't make me feel bad because I'm with my family.\"<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> Huntley did not reply to this message.<ref name=\"The Maxine Question\"/>\n\n==Bichard enquiry==\nImmediately following Huntley's conviction, his previous criminal history was disclosed to the public. These disclosures revealed that, despite his extensive record of sexual offences against underage girls and young women and evident criminal recidivism, not only had police failed to pursue these previous criminal complaints and allegations, but Huntley had secured a position of employment facilitating his access to children.<ref>{{cite news|title=Huntley Investigated Eight Times|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/17/soham.ukcrime6|accessdate=21 October 2019|work=The Guardian|date=17 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nUpon learning of these public disclosures, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] announced a [[public inquiry|public enquiry]] into the [[Criminal Records Bureau|intelligence-based record keeping]] and [[Vetting|vetting system]] which had allowed Huntley to obtain employment as a school caretaker despite these previous criminal complaints, which had been reported to both police and social services. Chaired by [[Michael Bichard, Baron Bichard|Sir Michael Bichard]], the [[Bichard report|Bichard enquiry]] opened on 13 January 2004.<ref name=\"The Legacy of Holly and Jessica\"/> The results of this enquiry were published in June that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/bichard-inquiry-report|title=The Bichard Report|date=17 June 2009|publisher=|work=homeoffice.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe stated purpose of the Bichard enquiry was:\n{{cquote|Urgently to enquire into child protection procedures in [[Humberside Police]] and [[Cambridgeshire Constabulary]] in the light of the recent trial and conviction of Ian Huntley for the murder of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.\n\nIn particular to assess the effectiveness of the relevant intelligence-based record keeping, the vetting practices in those forces since 1995 and information sharing with other agencies, and to report to the Home Secretary on matters of local and national relevance and make recommendations as appropriate.}}\n\nOne of the pertinent issues of concern to be scrutinised by the Bichard report surfaced almost immediately when Humberside Police stated their belief in it being unlawful under the [[Data Protection Act 1984|Data Protection Act]] to hold data regarding criminal allegations which had not lead to a conviction; this claim was criticised by other police forces who thought this too strict an interpretation of the Act. The enquiry severely scrutinised the actual investigation by Cambridgeshire Police into the children's disappearance and murder, as almost two weeks had elapsed following the disappearance of Wells and Chapman before Cambridgeshire Police became aware of Huntley's previous criminal background, despite his claims to be the last individual to see the children alive.<ref name=\"Blunder After Blunder\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/18/children.soham | title=Blunder After Blunder| work=The Guardian |date=18 December 2003 |accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> Further criticism was directed at the force for their initial failure to scrutinise Carr's claims to have been in Soham on the date of the children's disappearance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Poor Intelligence, Poor Data System and Poor Media Strategy: Police Own Up to Failures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/18/soham.ukcrime6|accessdate=9 January 2020|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe enquiry also severely criticised Humberside Police for deleting information relating to the previous criminal allegations against Huntley and also criticised Cambridgeshire Police for not following standard vetting guidelines. Both the Humberside and Cambridgeshire Police were heavily criticised for their failings in maintaining criminal intelligence records on Huntley.<ref name=\"Blunder After Blunder\"/>\n\nBichard later ordered the suspension of the Chief of Humberside Police, [[David Westwood]], for ordering the destruction of criminal records pertaining to alleged child molesters which had not resulted in a conviction. (This suspension was later overturned.) Westwood retired from the position of Chief of Humberside Police in March 2005. The Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Tom Lloyd, was also subjected to severe criticism as his force had failed to contact Humberside Police during the investigation into Huntley's criminal background prior to his securing employment at Soham Village College.<ref>{{cite news|title=Profile: Cambridge Chief Tom Lloyd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3827459.stm|date=22 June 2004|accessdate=11 March 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nAn added complication in these criminal vetting procedures was the fact that Huntley had applied for the caretaker's job under the name of Ian Nixon, although he did divulge upon the application form for this position that he was previously known as Ian Huntley. It is believed that Cambridgeshire Police failed to perform a background check under the name Huntley. Had they actually done so, they would have discovered an outstanding burglary charge on file relating to his November 1995 arrest for this crime.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blunkett Orders Police Chief's Suspension |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/22/childrensservices.schools|accessdate=21 October 2019|work=The Guardian|date=22 June 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Recommendations===\nThe Bichard enquiry recommended the implementation of a mandatory registration scheme for people working with children and vulnerable adults such as the elderly and mentally handicapped.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/dec/17/childrensservices.soham | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=The CRB Explained: How the Criminal Records Bureau Operates| date=17 December 2003|accessdate=16 April 2011| location=London| first=Polly| last=Curtis}}</ref> This recommendation later led to the foundation of the [[Independent Safeguarding Authority]]. The findings also suggested a national system should be implemented for police forces to share intelligence information, and that all police forces should follow a clear code of practice on record-keeping. These findings ultimately led to the tightening of various procedures within the Criminal Records Bureau system, including compulsory checks into potential criminal backgrounds of people who apply to work with children.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4612038.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Concerns About Teachers' List 99| date=14 January 2006|accessdate=16 April 2011| first=Gary| last=Eason}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAn orange-petalled rose, dedicated to the memory of Wells and Chapman, was unveiled by representatives of Soham Town Council at the 2003 [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. The inspiration for dedicating a flower to the children's memory sourced from a poem read aloud at the memorial service at Ely Cathedral on 30 August 2002 by the father of Wells, titled ''Soham's Rose''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Royals Flock to Flower Show|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3038061.stm|accessdate=18 January 2020|work=BBC News|date=19 May 2003}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 2004, the three-bedroomed house in College Close in which the murders occurred was demolished and the site levelled, with all rubble from the property being destroyed and later discarded in various, undisclosed locations.<ref name=\"housegone\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/3595801.stm|title=Soham Murder House is Demolished|accessdate=28 April 2017|agency=BBC News}}</ref> The site where 5 College Close once stood is now a vacant patch of grass.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nWithin days of Huntley's formal sentencing, he reflected to the media on the prospect of his spending the remainder of his life behind bars and of his fears for his security, exclaiming: \"I'm going to rot inside this place.

On 14 September 2005, he was [[Scalding|scalded]] with boiling water while incarcerated at [[HM Prison Wakefield]] by a fellow inmate. The injuries Huntley received in this attack resulted in his being unable to attend the hearing at which his minimum term of imprisonment was decided.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_yorkshire/4248052.stm|title=Huntley Scalded in Prison Attack|work=BBC News|date=15 September 2005|accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref> Following this attack, Huntley alleged that prison authorities had failed in their [[Duty of care in English law|duty of care]] towards him, and launched a claim for \u00a315,000 in compensation.

This cassette tape contains a markedly different account of the murders of Wells and Chapman than that Huntley had testified to at his trial. In what Huntley had believed would be his posthumous confession, he claims to have confessed to having murdered both girls to Carr prior to their arrest and his plans to confess to authorities, to which, Huntley alleged, Carr had slapped his face and informed him to \"pull [himself] together\" as she did not wish to lose the teaching position she had yearned for all her life.

Their friend Sherry ([[Humayun Saeed]]), a divorce lawyer, returns to Pakistan from the United States and finds that all his friends are in miserable marriages. Sherry treats the wives well so that they allow their husbands to accompany Sherry on a road trip to [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. Sherry actually plans to take the men to [[Bangkok]] to add excitement to their lives.\n\nIn Bangkok, Sherry meets a girl named Marina ([[Mehwish Hayat]]) and they fall in love. However, when Sherry learns that Marina is the daughter of a crime boss named Bichi Don ([[Ismail Tara]]), he wants to leave Bangkok to get away from Marina.\n\nThe men's wives, having learnt of the deception, arrive at the Bangkok hotel where the group are staying. Pervez tries to commit suicide by jumping off the hotel but is saved when he lands in a swimming pool. Sherry tells the wives that the trip was the men's idea and not his. The wives demand divorces from their husbands, saying they can no longer trust them.\n\nA few months pass and the three friends learn that Sherry is to marry Zoya ([[Sohai Ali Abro]]). She is the daughter of Mehboob Khan ([[Javed Sheikh]]), a billionaire in Lahore. Zoya is the quintessential nouveau riche kid, who insists on speaking with a strong American-English accent and abbreviates expressions like \"OMG\" (Oh my God) and \"MA\" ([[Mashallah|Masha'Allah]]). She enjoys spending her father's money carelessly. Zoya's mother ([[Bushra Ansari]]), worries about her daughter's attitude.\n\nWhen the three friends arrive at Sherry's wedding, he asks them not to tell Zoya and her family about Marina. Bichi Don arrives at the wedding and introduces himself as \"Ya Sheikh\", a friend of Mehboob Khan. Sherry tells everyone that his friend, Saif's nickname is also Sherry. The farce is that no one knows which Sherry anyone is talking about.\n\nTwo days before the marriage, Marina arrives. Sherry wants Marina's father to reject him as a potential son-in-law, so he pretends to be a homosexual. The ploy works and Marina and her father leave, only to return on the day of the wedding. Mehboob Khan and Marina's father, (Ya Sheikh) argue about Sherry and this results in both men rejecting Sherry as a potential son-in-law. The story ends when the three friends patch things up with their wives and Sherry asks for Marina's hand in marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Humayun Saeed]] as Shereyar a.k.a Sherry\n* [[Hamza Ali Abbasi]] as Saif Ahmed a.k.a Saif/Sherry\n* [[Ahmad Ali Butt]] as Parvez (Pipi)\n* [[Vasay Chaudhry]] as Sheikh\n* [[Ayesha Khan]] as Kubra (Saif's wife) \n* [[Sohai Ali Abro]] as Zoya \n* [[Mehwish Hayat]] as Marina \n* [[Sarwat Gillani]] as Gul (Sheikh's wife)\n* [[Uzma Khan]] as Lubna (Parvez's wife)\n* [[Jawed Sheikh]] as Mehboob Khan (Zoya's father)\n* [[Bushra Ansari]] as Jabbo (Zoya's mother)\n* [[Ismail Tara]] as Don / Yaa Sheikh (Marina's father)\n* Bashar Amir Shafi as Pipi's son (child artist)\n\n===Special Appearance===\n* [[Gohar Rasheed]] as XYZ (fashion designer)\n* [[Farhan Ally Agha]] as Sherry's father\n* [[Yasra Rizvi]] as Sherry's mother\n* Naveed Raza as Lawyer\n* [[Zainab Qayyum]] as Lawyer\n* [[Ali Kazmi]] as Dr. Aamir Liaquat Khan\n* [[Fahad Mustafa]] as Himself \n* Zainab Jamil as Charity\n* [[Bilal Lashari]] as Police officer\n* Wajid Khan as Stylist\n* [[Saife Hassan]] as Lawyer \n* [[Adnan Siddiqui]] as Himself (in picture) \n* [[Shakeel Hussain Khan]] as a caller \n* Viktor Krav as Gangster\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in various locations in [[Thailand]] including [[Bangkok]], [[Pattaya]] and [[Coral Island]].<ref name=\"pakistantoday.com.pk\"/> A few scenes were shot in [[Karachi]].

Their friend Sherry ([[Humayun Saeed]]), a divorce lawyer, returns to Pakistan from the United States and finds that all his friends are in miserable marriages. Sherry treats the wives well so that they allow their husbands to accompany Sherry on a road trip to [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. Sherry actually plans to take the men to [[Bangkok]] to add excitement to their lives.\n\nIn Bangkok, Sherry meets a girl named Marina ([[Mehwish Hayat]]) and they fall in love. However, when Sherry learns that Marina is the daughter of a crime boss named Bichi Don ([[Ismail Tara]]), he wants to leave Bangkok to get away from Marina.\n\nThe men's wives, having learnt of the deception, arrive at the Bangkok hotel where the group are staying. Pervez tries to commit suicide by jumping off the hotel but is saved when he lands in a swimming pool. Sherry tells the wives that the trip was the men's idea and not his. The wives demand divorces from their husbands, saying they can no longer trust them.\n\nA few months pass and the three friends learn that Sherry is to marry Zoya ([[Sohai Ali Abro]]). She is the daughter of Mehboob Khan ([[Javed Sheikh]]), a billionaire in Lahore. Zoya is the quintessential nouveau riche kid, who insists on speaking with a strong American-English accent and abbreviates expressions like \"OMG\" (Oh my God) and \"MA\" ([[Mashallah|Masha'Allah]]). She enjoys spending her father's money carelessly. Zoya's mother ([[Bushra Ansari]]), worries about her daughter's attitude.\n\nWhen the three friends arrive at Sherry's wedding, he asks them not to tell Zoya and her family about Marina. Bichi Don arrives at the wedding and introduces himself as \"Ya Sheikh\", a friend of Mehboob Khan. Sherry tells everyone that his friend, Saif's nickname is also Sherry. The farce is that no one knows which Sherry anyone is talking about.\n\nTwo days before the marriage, Marina arrives. Sherry wants Marina's father to reject him as a potential son-in-law, so he pretends to be a homosexual. The ploy works and Marina and her father leave, only to return on the day of the wedding. Mehboob Khan and Marina's father, (Ya Sheikh) argue about Sherry and this results in both men rejecting Sherry as a potential son-in-law. The story ends when the three friends patch things up with their wives and Sherry asks for Marina's hand in marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Humayun Saeed]] as Shereyar a.k.a Sherry\n* [[Hamza Ali Abbasi]] as Saif Ahmed a.k.a Saif/Sherry\n* [[Ahmad Ali Butt]] as Parvez (Pipi)\n* [[Vasay Chaudhry]] as Sheikh\n* [[Ayesha Khan]] as Kubra (Saif's wife) \n* [[Sohai Ali Abro]] as Zoya \n* [[Mehwish Hayat]] as Marina \n* [[Sarwat Gillani]] as Gul (Sheikh's wife)\n* [[Uzma Khan]] as Lubna (Parvez's wife)\n* [[Jawed Sheikh]] as Mehboob Khan (Zoya's father)\n* [[Bushra Ansari]] as Jabbo (Zoya's mother)\n* [[Ismail Tara]] as Don / Yaa Sheikh (Marina's father)\n* Bashar Amir Shafi as Pipi's son (child artist)\n\n===Special Appearance===\n* [[Gohar Rasheed]] as XYZ (fashion designer)\n* [[Farhan Ally Agha]] as Sherry's father\n* [[Yasra Rizvi]] as Sherry's mother\n* Naveed Raza as Lawyer\n* [[Zainab Qayyum]] as Lawyer\n* [[Ali Kazmi]] as Dr. Aamir Liaquat Khan\n* [[Fahad Mustafa]] as Himself \n* Zainab Jamil as Charity\n* [[Bilal Lashari]] as Police officer\n* Wajid Khan as Stylist\n* [[Saife Hassan]] as Lawyer \n* [[Adnan Siddiqui]] as Himself (in picture) \n* [[Shakeel Hussain Khan]] as a caller \n* Viktor Krav as Gangster\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in various locations in [[Thailand]] including [[Bangkok]], [[Pattaya]] and [[Coral Island]].<ref name=\"pakistantoday.com.pk\"/> A few scenes were shot in [[Karachi]].
