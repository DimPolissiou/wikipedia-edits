It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and another wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows, and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls, and other rare birds. Ashy Dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads.

It is situated on the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]], on the northern shores of [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]], four km northwest of [[Auckland CBD]]. The suburb includes the peninsula of '''Northcote Point''' and the northern approaches to the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1882, the St Heliers and Northcote Land Company was formed and some land in the area was subdivided. In 1889 a major subdivision was the result when the Bartley Estate was auctioned. Before the construction of the Harbour Bridge, the Northcote Wharf was heavily utilised by Auckland Harbour ferry services. After the bridge was opened in 1959, the number of ferry crossings fell and the Northcote Point peninsula became a quiet cul-de-sac. The wooden Northcote Tavern was once in the thick of things; it still stands but now surveys a quiet streetscape.\n\n==Local government==\nNorthcote had a local government just like other suburbs in [[Auckland]] at that time. The local government was called Northcote Borough Council, which started in 1908 and merged into [[North Shore City#Local government|North Shore City Council]] in 1989.

It is situated on the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]], on the northern shores of [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]], four km northwest of [[Auckland CBD]]. The suburb includes the peninsula of '''Northcote Point''' and the northern approaches to the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1882, the St Heliers and Northcote Land Company was formed and some land in the area was subdivided. In 1889 a major subdivision was the result when the Bartley Estate was auctioned. Before the construction of the Harbour Bridge, the Northcote Wharf was heavily utilised by Auckland Harbour ferry services. After the bridge was opened in 1959, the number of ferry crossings fell and the Northcote Point peninsula became a quiet cul-de-sac. The wooden Northcote Tavern was once in the thick of things; it still stands but now surveys a quiet streetscape.\n\n==Local government==\nNorthcote had a local government just like other suburbs in [[Auckland]] at that time. The local government was called Northcote Borough Council, which started in 1908 and merged into [[North Shore City#Local government|North Shore City Council]] in 1989. It then amalgamated into [[Auckland Council]] in November 2010. \n\n===Mayors of Northcote Borough Council===\n*1908 Alexander Bruce\n*1908\u20131912 Herbert Cadness\n*1912\u20131917 George Fraser\n*1917\u20131919 John Byrne Tonar\n*1919\u20131921 Arthur Edwin Greenslade\n*1921\u20131925 William Ernest Richardson\n*1925\u20131927 Charles Archibald Deuxberry \n*1927\u20131931 Arthur Edwin Greenslade\n*1931\u20131941 Robert Martin\n*1941\u20131944 Ernest Clyde Fowler \n*1944\u20131956 Frank Montagne Pearn\n*1956\u20131962 John Forsyth Potter \n*1962\u20131968 Albert Ernest James Holdaway\n*1968\u20131974 Alfred James Evans\n*1974\u20131979 Trevor Edwin La Roche\n*1979\u20131989 Jean Sampson\n\n==Features and landmarks==\nNorthcote is surrounded by the suburbs of [[Birkenhead, New Zealand|Birkenhead]], [[Hillcrest, Auckland|Hillcrest]] and [[Takapuna]] to the west and north, and the waters of Shoal Bay, an arm of the Waitemata, to the south and east.<ref>[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/Suburbs/PDFs/SuburbSearch/city_web_suburb.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}</ref> [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] stretches along the waterfront of Shoal Bay, heading north from the bridge towards [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]].\n\nTo the north of Northcote Point on one of the main routes leading to and from the Harbour Bridge is the Northcote Shopping Centre, which was developed in the early 1960s.

{"title_page": "Rare Book Preservation Society", "text_new": "[[File:Japanese Occupation 1940.PNG|thumb|right|Areas under Japanese Occupation in 1940]]\nThe '''Rare Book Preservation Society''' (\u6587\u732e\u4fdd\u5b58\u540c\u5fd7\u4f1a) was founded in 1940 by [[Zheng Zhenduo]] (\u90d1\u632f\u94ce), Zhang Shouyong (\u5f20\u5bff\u955b), He Bingsong (\u4f55\u70b3\u677e), Zhang Yuanji (\u5f20\u5143\u6d4e), and [[Zhang Dinghuang|Zhang Fengju (\u5f20\u51e4\u4e3e)]] for the purpose of secretly acquiring and preserving rare books and manuscripts in the Shanghai [[Jiangnan]] region.  These cultural assets have been accumulated by a number of famous private libraries some over 1,000 years.\n\nThey faced [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese looting]] and forced sale under duress.  In less than 2 years, the Society succeeded in saving over 130,000 volumes in the lands controlled by the Japanese.  One hundred thirty crates were sent to [[Hong Kong]] (then a [[British colony]]) for safekeeping.  Despite their best efforts the entire collection was looted anyway when the Japanese later overran Hong Kong.  Fortunately after WWII and the [[Japanese surrender]], Zhang Fengju \u5f20\u51e4\u4e3e (fluent in French, English and Japanese) was sent to Japan April 1946 and recovered the collection after working closely with the [[U.S. occupation of Japan|U.S. Occupation forces]] in Tokyo.  These were successively shipped back to Shanghai for the National Central Library \u4e2d\u592e\u56fe\u4e66\u9986.\n\n==Background and Events==\nAfter Pearl Harbor in 1940, the full scale [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] of China began.  They controlled the entire coast of China except technically for the [[French Concession]]s (under [[Vichy France|Vichy]] control).  \n[[File:Former Bank de l'Indichina, The Bund, Shanghai..jpg|thumb|left|Former Banque de l'Indochine building on The Bund, Shanghai]]\n(Background note:  \nThe great [[Jiangnan]] private libraries were formed over many generations.  These rare books and manuscripts were not only threatened by war time destruction; but owners of these libraries felt pressured to sell due to financial needs.  Agents for Japanese institutions and organizations such as Harvard Yenching had the goal of buying the cream of the crop.  In his memoires \u6c42\u4e66\u65e5\u5f55, Zheng Zhenduo wrote: \"I discussed the situation many times with those scholars still remaining in Shanghai such as Zhang Jusheng \u5f20\u83ca\u751f\u3001Zhang Yongni \u5f20\u548f\u9713\u3001He Bingsong \u4f55\u70b3\u677e\u3001[[Zhang Dinghuang|Zhang Fengju \u5f20\u51e4\u4e3e]] and others.  We felt that this  aggressive preservation \u62a2\u6551 activity must commence immediately. We could not stand to see these rare books and manuscripts acquired by the Japanese or be exported.  We jointly sent several telegrams to Chungking requesting government help to rescue and preserve this national cultural treasure.\"  \n[[File:ShanghaiBundCustomsHouse.jpg|Shanghai Customs House on The Bund|thumb|right]]\nAccording to [[Jiang Fucong|Jiang Fucong's]] memoires \u848b\u590d\u7481 \u73cd\u5e1a\u658b\u6587\u96c6, \"Joint telegrams from Shanghai scholars to the Education Ministry and the [[Boxer Indemnity|British Boxer Indemnity Fund]] directors requested prompt help to acquire and save these books and manuscripts.  [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Zhu Jiahua]] \u6731\u5bb6\u9a85 was Chairman of the Fund at the time.  He felt that the opportunity must not be lost and suggesting using the projected construction funds of the [[National Central Library]] supplemented by the Boxer Fund.  The Minister of Education Chen Lifu \u9648\u7acb\u592b wholeheartedly offered to help.   To avoid Japanese detection, the secret \"Rare Book Preservation Society\" was formed by 5 scholars: Zheng Zhenduo \u90d1\u632f\u94ce, Zhang Shouyong \u5f20\u5bff\u955b, He Bingsong \u4f55\u70b3\u677e, Zhang Yuanji \u5f20\u5143\u6d4e, and [[Zhang Dinghuang|Zhang Fengju \u5f20\u51e4\u4e3e]].  The Society's acquisitions took place from April 1940 to June 1941, south in [[Suzhou]]-[[Hangzhou]] to north in Beijing. In this time, Zheng Zheduo wrote 9 reports to Jiang Fucong.  Zhen was no doubt the leader of all this underground activity.  Others contributed according to their expertise.  For example, Zhang Fengju liaised with the [[Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Zhejiang)|Jiayetang]] \u5609\u4e1a\u5802 and Siyuan \u9002\u56ed libraries as well as part of the authentication efforts.  The Nationalist government gave this priority and the Education Ministry issued secret directive 18543 with the seal of Minister Chen empowering the Society's work.

These cultural assets have been accumulated by a number of famous private libraries some over 1,000 years.\n\nThey faced [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese looting]] and forced sale under duress.  In less than 2 years, the Society succeeded in saving over 130,000 volumes in the lands controlled by the Japanese.  One hundred thirty crates were sent to [[Hong Kong]] (then a [[British colony]]) for safekeeping.  Despite their best efforts the entire collection was looted anyway when the Japanese later overran Hong Kong.  Fortunately after WWII and the [[Japanese surrender]], Zhang Fengju \u5f20\u51e4\u4e3e (fluent in French, English and Japanese) was sent to Japan April 1946 and recovered the collection after working closely with the [[U.S. occupation of Japan|U.S. Occupation forces]] in Tokyo.  These were successively shipped back to Shanghai for the National Central Library \u4e2d\u592e\u56fe\u4e66\u9986.\n\n==Background and Events==\nAfter Pearl Harbor in 1940, the full scale [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] of China began.  They controlled the entire coast of China except technically for the [[French Concession]]s (under [[Vichy France|Vichy]] control).  \n[[File:Former Bank de l'Indichina, The Bund, Shanghai..jpg|thumb|left|Former Banque de l'Indochine building on The Bund, Shanghai]]\n(Background note:  \nThe great [[Jiangnan]] private libraries were formed over many generations.  These rare books and manuscripts were not only threatened by war time destruction; but owners of these libraries felt pressured to sell due to financial needs.  Agents for Japanese institutions and organizations such as Harvard Yenching had the goal of buying the cream of the crop.  In his memoires \u6c42\u4e66\u65e5\u5f55, Zheng Zhenduo wrote: \"I discussed the situation many times with those scholars still remaining in Shanghai such as Zhang Jusheng \u5f20\u83ca\u751f\u3001Zhang Yongni \u5f20\u548f\u9713\u3001He Bingsong \u4f55\u70b3\u677e\u3001[[Zhang Dinghuang|Zhang Fengju \u5f20\u51e4\u4e3e]] and others.  We felt that this  aggressive preservation \u62a2\u6551 activity must commence immediately. We could not stand to see these rare books and manuscripts acquired by the Japanese or be exported.  We jointly sent several telegrams to Chungking requesting government help to rescue and preserve this national cultural treasure.\"  \n[[File:ShanghaiBundCustomsHouse.jpg|Shanghai Customs House on The Bund|thumb|right]]\nAccording to [[Jiang Fucong|Jiang Fucong's]] memoires \u848b\u590d\u7481 \u73cd\u5e1a\u658b\u6587\u96c6, \"Joint telegrams from Shanghai scholars to the Education Ministry and the [[Boxer Indemnity|British Boxer Indemnity Fund]] directors requested prompt help to acquire and save these books and manuscripts.  [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Zhu Jiahua]] \u6731\u5bb6\u9a85 was Chairman of the Fund at the time.  He felt that the opportunity must not be lost and suggesting using the projected construction funds of the [[National Central Library]] supplemented by the Boxer Fund.  The Minister of Education Chen Lifu \u9648\u7acb\u592b wholeheartedly offered to help.   To avoid Japanese detection, the secret \"Rare Book Preservation Society\" was formed by 5 scholars: Zheng Zhenduo \u90d1\u632f\u94ce, Zhang Shouyong \u5f20\u5bff\u955b, He Bingsong \u4f55\u70b3\u677e, Zhang Yuanji \u5f20\u5143\u6d4e, and [[Zhang Dinghuang|Zhang Fengju \u5f20\u51e4\u4e3e]].  The Society's acquisitions took place from April 1940 to June 1941, south in [[Suzhou]]-[[Hangzhou]] to north in Beijing. In this time, Zheng Zheduo wrote 9 reports to Jiang Fucong.  Zhen was no doubt the leader of all this underground activity.  Others contributed according to their expertise.  For example, Zhang Fengju liaised with the [[Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Zhejiang)|Jiayetang]] \u5609\u4e1a\u5802 and Siyuan \u9002\u56ed libraries as well as part of the authentication efforts.  The Nationalist government gave this priority and the Education Ministry issued secret directive 18543 with the seal of Minister Chen empowering the Society's work.
