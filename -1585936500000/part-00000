Her manuscript, authenticated by Holocaust scholars and survivors, was published in the Polish language for the first time ever in early 2006. It has been compared to the [[The Diary of a Young Girl|diary]] of [[Anne Frank]].\n\n==Biography==\nRut Laskier was born in [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (Gda\u0144sk) to Dwojra Hampel, daughter of Abram Chil Hampel, and Jakub Laskier, who worked as a bank officer.<ref>https://www.geni.com/people/Rutka-Laskier/6000000011186025561</ref><ref name=\"AutoTZ-1\">[http://jri-poland.org/announcements.htm#rutka-laskier Rutka Laskier's Birth Record Finally Located]: Announcement by Jewish Records Poland-Indexing, Inc. and The  Bedzin-Sosnowiec-Zawiercie Area Research Society</ref> Her family was well off.

Rutka was deported from the [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|ghetto]] and was believed to have died in a [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chamber]], age 14, along with her mother and brother, upon arrival with her family at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in August 1943.<ref name=JerusalemPost/>\n\nHowever, when her diary appeared in a book, it was revealed in 2008 that she was not sent to the [[gas chamber]]s along with them. Zofia Minc (later Galler), a fellow prisoner who survived, revealed in a published account of her time at Auschwitz, that Laskier slept in the barrack next to her until falling victim to a [[cholera]] outbreak in December 1943. Another prisoner pushed Laskier, still alive, in a wheelbarrow to an underground gas chamber. According to Zahava Scherz, Israeli-born daughter of Rutka's father by his subsequent marriage,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gn734 The Secret Diary of the Holocaust], BBC.co.uk; accessed 20 December 2016.</ref> Rutka begged Zofia to take her to the [[electric fence]] so she could kill herself, but an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guard following them would not allow it. Rutka was then taken directly to the crematory.<ref name=\"Lib\u00e9ration\">\u00ab Dans notre block, je dormais \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de mon amie, Rutka Laskier, de Bedzin.

Scherz asked her father who they were, and he answered her truthfully, but never spoke of it again. She went on to explain that she only learned of the existence of Rutka's diary in 2006, and she expressed how much it has meant to her to be able to get to know the young woman she regarded as her half-sister.<ref name=YV2007/>\n\n==Diary==\nFrom 19 January to 24 April 1943, without her family's knowledge, Laskier kept a diary in an ordinary school notebook, writing in both ink and pencil, making entries sporadically. In it, she discussed atrocities she witnessed committed by the Nazis, and described daily life in the ghetto, as well as innocent teenage love interests. She also wrote about the gas chambers at the [[concentration camp]]s, indicating that the horrors of the camps had filtered back to those still living in the ghettos.\n\nThe diary begins on 19 January with the entry \"I cannot grasp that it is already 1943, four years since this hell began.\"<ref name=JerusalemPost/> One of the final entries says \"If only I could say, it's over, you die only once... But I can't, because despite all these atrocities, I want to live, and wait for the following day.\"<ref name=JerusalemPost/>\n\nLaskier describes how her faith in God \"has been completely shattered\" in the concentration camp. Laskier wrote: \"The little faith I used to have has been completely shattered. If God existed, He would have certainly not permitted that human beings be thrown alive into furnaces, and the heads of little toddlers be smashed with gun butts or shoved into sacks and gassed to death.\"<ref>Aron Heller, \"New Pages of Past Horror: Writings depict the innocence of a Jewish teen coming of age\u2014and Nazi brutality\", Associated Press, 6 June 2006.</ref>\n\n==Discovery of Laskier's diary==\nIn 1943, while writing the diary, Laskier shared it with Stanis\u0142awa Sapi\u0144ska (21 years old, at that time), whom she had befriended after Laskier's family moved into a home owned by Sapi\u0144ska's [[Roman Catholic]] family, which had been confiscated by the Nazis so that it could be included in the ghetto.<ref name=YV2007/>\n\nLaskier gradually came to realise she would not survive, and, realizing the importance of her diary as a document of what had happened to the Jewish population of B\u0119dzin, asked Sapi\u0144ska to help her hide the diary. Sapi\u0144ska showed Laskier how to hide the diary in her house under the double flooring in a staircase, between the first and second floors.<ref name=NaszeMiasto.pl>[http://katowice.naszemiasto.pl/pamietnik_rutki/specjalna_artykul/534151.html ''Pami\u0119tnik Rutki'' (''Rutka's Diary'')] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328234348/http://katowice.naszemiasto.pl/pamietnik_rutki/specjalna_artykul/534151.html |date=2008-03-28 }}, after ''[[Dziennik Zachodni]]'' (Polish); accessed 26 January 2018.</ref>\n\nAfter the ghetto was evacuated and all its inhabitants sent to the death camp, Sapi\u0144ska returned to the house and retrieved the diary.

That might be true. From Polish sources cited below, the chain of events is not that clear. It seems that Szydlowski, after learning about the diary from her niece, called Sapi\u0144ska (the niece gave him Sapinska's telephone number). After the phone call, the nephew conveyed the copy of the notebook to Szydlowski. Sapi\u0144ska mentioned that the nephew convinced her to make the diary public, but it is unclear whether it was before or after the conversation with Szydlowski.-->\n\nWith help from Sapi\u0144ska's nephew, he obtained a [[Photocopier|photocopy]] of the diary and was instrumental in the publishing of its Polish-language edition.

She was murdered at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1943 at the age of fourteen. Her manuscript, authenticated by Holocaust scholars and survivors, was published in the Polish language for the first time ever in early 2006. It has been compared to the [[The Diary of a Young Girl|diary]] of [[Anne Frank]].\n\n==Biography==\nRut Laskier was born in [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (Gda\u0144sk) to Dwojra Hampel, daughter of Abram Chil Hampel, and Jakub Laskier, who worked as a bank officer.<ref>https://www.geni.com/people/Rutka-Laskier/6000000011186025561</ref><ref name=\"AutoTZ-1\">[http://jri-poland.org/announcements.htm#rutka-laskier Rutka Laskier's Birth Record Finally Located]: Announcement by Jewish Records Poland-Indexing, Inc. and The  Bedzin-Sosnowiec-Zawiercie Area Research Society</ref> Her family was well off.

It quickly began to engage in anti-Semitic violence and state-sponsored discrimination. Many Jews were fired from their positions and fled Danzig.<ref name=shoa>{{cite web|url=http://www.zukunft-braucht-erinnerung.de/die-loesung-der-judenfrage-in-der-freien-stadt-danzig|title=Die \"L\u00f6sung der Judenfrage\" in der Freien Stadt Danzig|publisher=Zukunft braucht Erinnerung|first=Wolfgang|last=Gippert|language =German}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1a3lkHv9NZ0C&pg=PA103&dq=jewish+danzig&q=jewish%20danzig|title=Model Nazi: Arthur Greiser and the Occupation of Western Poland|first1=Catherine|last1=Epstein|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-954641-1|page=103}}</ref>\n\nRutka moved with her family to the southern [[Poland|Polish]] city of [[B\u0119dzin]], from whence her paternal grandparents hailed. Following the German [[invasion of Poland]], while in the [[B\u0119dzin Ghetto]], Rutka Laskier, age 14, wrote a 60-page diary in [[Polish language|Polish]], chronicling several months of her life under the [[Nazi]] rule in 1943.

Rutka was deported from the [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|ghetto]] and was believed to have died in a [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chamber]], age 14, along with her mother and brother, upon arrival with her family at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in August 1943.<ref name=JerusalemPost/>\n\nHowever, when her diary appeared in a book, it was revealed in 2008 that she was not sent to the [[gas chamber]]s along with them. Zofia Minc (later Galler), a fellow prisoner who survived, revealed in a published account of her time at Auschwitz, that Laskier slept in the barrack next to her until falling victim to a [[cholera]] outbreak in December 1943. Another prisoner pushed Laskier, still alive, in a wheelbarrow to an underground gas chamber. According to Zahava Scherz, Israeli-born daughter of Rutka's father by his subsequent marriage,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gn734 The Secret Diary of the Holocaust], BBC.co.uk; accessed 20 December 2016.</ref> Rutka begged Zofia to take her to the [[electric fence]] so she could kill herself, but an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guard following them would not allow it. Rutka was then taken directly to the crematory.<ref name=\"Lib\u00e9ration\">\u00ab Dans notre block, je dormais \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de mon amie, Rutka Laskier, de Bedzin.

Following World War II, he emigrated to [[Israel]], where he remarried and had another daughter, Zahava Scherz.

Scherz asked her father who they were, and he answered her truthfully, but never spoke of it again. She went on to explain that she only learned of the existence of Rutka's diary in 2006, and she expressed how much it has meant to her to be able to get to know the young woman she regarded as her half-sister.<ref name=YV2007/>\n\n==Diary==\nFrom 19 January to 24 April 1943, without her family's knowledge, Laskier kept a diary in an ordinary school notebook, writing in both ink and pencil, making entries sporadically. In it, she discussed atrocities she witnessed committed by the Nazis, and described daily life in the ghetto, as well as innocent teenage love interests. She also wrote about the gas chambers at the [[concentration camp]]s, indicating that the horrors of the camps had filtered back to those still living in the ghettos.\n\nThe diary begins on 19 January with the entry \"I cannot grasp that it is already 1943, four years since this hell began.\"<ref name=JerusalemPost/> One of the final entries says \"If only I could say, it's over, you die only once... But I can't, because despite all these atrocities, I want to live, and wait for the following day.\"<ref name=JerusalemPost/>\n\nLaskier describes how her faith in God \"has been completely shattered\" in the concentration camp. Laskier wrote: \"The little faith I used to have has been completely shattered. If God existed, He would have certainly not permitted that human beings be thrown alive into furnaces, and the heads of little toddlers be smashed with gun butts or shoved into sacks and gassed to death.\"<ref>Aron Heller, \"New Pages of Past Horror: Writings depict the innocence of a Jewish teen coming of age\u2014and Nazi brutality\", Associated Press, 6 June 2006.</ref>\n\n==Discovery of Laskier's diary==\nIn 1943, while writing the diary, Laskier shared it with Stanis\u0142awa Sapi\u0144ska (21 years old, at that time), whom she had befriended after Laskier's family moved into a home owned by Sapi\u0144ska's [[Roman Catholic]] family, which had been confiscated by the Nazis so that it could be included in the ghetto.<ref name=YV2007/>\n\nLaskier gradually came to realise she would not survive, and, realizing the importance of her diary as a document of what had happened to the Jewish population of B\u0119dzin, asked Sapi\u0144ska to help her hide the diary. Sapi\u0144ska showed Laskier how to hide the diary in her house under the double flooring in a staircase, between the first and second floors.<ref name=NaszeMiasto.pl>[http://katowice.naszemiasto.pl/pamietnik_rutki/specjalna_artykul/534151.html ''Pami\u0119tnik Rutki'' (''Rutka's Diary'')] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328234348/http://katowice.naszemiasto.pl/pamietnik_rutki/specjalna_artykul/534151.html |date=2008-03-28 }}, after ''[[Dziennik Zachodni]]'' (Polish); accessed 26 January 2018.</ref>\n\nAfter the ghetto was evacuated and all its inhabitants sent to the death camp, Sapi\u0144ska returned to the house and retrieved the diary. She kept it in her home library for 63 years and did not share it with anyone but members of her immediate family. In 2005, Adam Szyd\u0142owski, the chairman of the Center of Jewish Culture of the [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie|Zag\u0142\u0119bie]] Region of Poland, was told by one of Sapi\u0144ska's nieces about the existence of the diary.<ref name=NaszeMiasto1.pl>[http://katowice.naszemiasto.pl/pamietnik_rutki/specjalna_artykul/534152.html \"Rozmowa z Adamem Szyd\u0142owskim, prezesem Zag\u0142\u0119biowskiego Centrum Kultury \u017bydowskiej\" (Conversation with Adam Szyd\u0142owski, the chairman of the Center of Jewish Culture of the Zag\u0142\u0119bie Region)], by Marek Nycz, after [[Dziennik Zachodni]] (Polish) {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wUmuZenR?url=http://katowice.naszemiasto.pl/pamietnik_rutki/specjalna_artykul/534152.html|date=14 February 2011}}</ref><!--English sources, as well as the interview with Scherz linked below, state that Sapi\u0144ska showed her nephew the diary, and the nephew convinced her to make it public. That might be true. From Polish sources cited below, the chain of events is not that clear. It seems that Szydlowski, after learning about the diary from her niece, called Sapi\u0144ska (the niece gave him Sapinska's telephone number). After the phone call, the nephew conveyed the copy of the notebook to Szydlowski. Sapi\u0144ska mentioned that the nephew convinced her to make the diary public, but it is unclear whether it was before or after the conversation with Szydlowski.-->\n\nWith help from Sapi\u0144ska's nephew, he obtained a [[Photocopier|photocopy]] of the diary and was instrumental in the publishing of its Polish-language edition. Its publication by Yad Vashem Publications was commemorated with a ceremony in [[Jerusalem]] by [[Yad Vashem]] (the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority), [[Israel]]'s Holocaust museum, on 4 June 2007, in which Zahava Scherz took part. At this ceremony, Sapi\u0144ska also donated the original diary to Yad Vashem.<ref name=\"polskatimes.pl\">[http://www.polskatimes.pl/dziennikzachodni/stronaglowna/51078,biblioteka-narodowa-dziennik-rutki-laskier-wywieziono,id,t.html Biblioteka Narodowa: dziennik Rutki Laskier wywieziono nielegalnie&nbsp;(National Library: Rutka Laskier's diary was illegally exported)], after ''[[Dziennik Zachodni]]'' &nbsp;(5 October 2008)&nbsp;(Polish) {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wUmwjtWp?url=http://www.polskatimes.pl/dziennikzachodni/stronaglowna/51078%2Cbiblioteka-narodowa-dziennik-rutki-laskier-wywieziono%2Cid%2Ct.html|date=14 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe diary, which has been authenticated by Holocaust scholars and survivors, has been compared to the [[The Diary of a Young Girl|diary]] of [[Anne Frank]], the best known Holocaust-era diary.

She adds that \"the minimalist production, which features a lone, sullen piano and soft synths, exists purely to cushion Houston's moving vocal performance\". Lastly, she stated that it \"stands firmly in the tradition of her most emotive hits (\"Greatest Love of All,\" \"I Will Always Love You\") and signals the long-awaited return of a true diva\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1071004/whitney-houston-i-look-to-you |title=New Music Releases, Music Reviews, Album Releases & Song Releases |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Cover versions==\n* The song was covered on the television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' during the second-season episode ''[[Grilled Cheesus]]''.

Its body shape is ribbon-like.\n\nIn humans, this causes a disease called [[echinococcosis]]. The three types of echinococcosis are cystic echinococcosis caused by ''[[Echinococcus granulosus|E. granulosus]]'', alveolar echinococcosis caused by ''E. multilocularis'', and polycystic echinococcosis caused by ''E. vogeli'' or ''E. oligarthrus''.<ref>Thompson RCA, McManus DP.

[[Cystic echinococcosis]] is mostly found in South and Central America, [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[China]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Russia]], and the western [[United States]] ([[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[California]]).\n\nEchinococcosis is a [[zoonosis]]. The [[Host (biology)|definitive hosts]] are [[carnivorous]] predators \u2013 dogs, wolves, foxes, and lions. The adult tapeworm lives in their small intestines and delivers eggs to be excreted with the stool. The [[intermediate hosts]] are infected by ingesting eggs. Sheep, goats, cattle, camels, pigs, wild herbivores, and rodents are the usual intermediate hosts, but humans can also be infected. Humans are dead-end hosts, since their corpses are nowadays seldom eaten by carnivorous predators.\n\nThe egg hatches in the digestive system of the intermediate host, producing a planula larva. It penetrates the intestinal wall and is carried by bloodstream to liver, lung, brain, or another organ. It settles there and turns into a bladder-like structure called [[hydatid cyst]]. From the inner lining of its wall, protoscoleces (i.e. scoleces with invaginated tissue layers) bud and protrude into the fluid filling the cyst.\n\nAfter the death of the normal intermediate host, its body can be eaten by carnivores suitable as definitive hosts. In their small intestines, protoscoleces turn inside out, attach, and give rise to adult tapeworms, completing the lifecycle.  In humans, the cysts persist and grow for years. They are regularly found in the liver (and every possible organ: spleen, kidney, bone, brain, tongue and skin) and are asymptomatic until their growing size produces symptoms or are accidentally discovered. Disruption of the cysts (spontaneous or [[iatrogenic]] e.g. [[liver biopsy]]) can be life-threatening due to anaphylactic shock.\n\nCysts are detected with ultrasound, [[X-ray computed tomography]], or other imaging techniques. Antiechinococcus antibodies can be detected with serodiagnostic tests \u2013 [[indirect fluorescent antibody]], complement fixation, [[ELISA]], [[Western blot]], and other methods.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zhang Wenbao, Wen Hao, Li Jun, Lin Renyong, McManus Donald P | year = 2012| title = Immunology and Immunodiagnosis of Cystic Echinococcosis: An Update | url = | journal = Clinical and Developmental Immunology | volume =  2012| issue = | pages =  1\u201310| doi = 10.1155/2012/101895 }}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nA phylogenetic tree has been created for several species in this genus \u2013 ''[[Echinococcus oligarthrus]]'', ''[[Echinococcus vogeli]]'', ''[[Echinococcus multilocularis]]'', ''[[Echinococcus shiquicus]]'', ''[[Echinococcus equinus]]'', ''[[Echinococcus ortleppi]]'', and ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]''.<ref name=Nakao2007>{{cite journal | author = Nakao M, McManus DP, Schantz PM, Craig PS, Ito A | year = 2007 | title = A molecular phylogeny of the genus ''Echinococcus'' inferred from complete mitochondrial genomes | url = | journal = Parasitology | volume = 134 | issue = 5| pages = 713\u2013722 }}</ref> The first diverging species are the neotropical endemic species ''E. oligarthrus'' and ''E. vogeli''.

Disruption of the cysts (spontaneous or [[iatrogenic]] e.g. [[liver biopsy]]) can be life-threatening due to anaphylactic shock.\n\nCysts are detected with ultrasound, [[X-ray computed tomography]], or other imaging techniques. Antiechinococcus antibodies can be detected with serodiagnostic tests \u2013 [[indirect fluorescent antibody]], complement fixation, [[ELISA]], [[Western blot]], and other methods.<ref>Wenbao Zhang, Hao Wen,  Jun Li, Renyong Lin, and Donald P.

From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government.Kay Ivey (current governor) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n*Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham\n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Di[[Red panda|r]]<nowiki/>ector: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "AveryRedPandaGirl", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alabama"}
