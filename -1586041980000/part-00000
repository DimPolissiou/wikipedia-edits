[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEC Insignia.jpg|thumb|WWII Naval Officers from the Civil Engineer Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps and Supply Corps assigned to Naval Construction Battalions had a Silver Seabee on their Corps insignia. ]]\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, but with the distinctive letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.  The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps replacing the Old English letters C.E.  These were to be worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by enlisted, pay grades E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using iron beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, lead by  Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the [[invasion of Sicily]]. <ref name=\"Fane\"/><ref name=\"navysealmuseum.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare \u2013 WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> When the unit returned to [[Camp Peary]] most of the men were assigned to the new [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] being formed there.   \n\nNaval Combat Demolition Units were led by junior CEC officers.<ref>Seabee online magazine- this week in Seabee History[http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/09/12/this-week-in-seabee-history-week-of-sept-11/]</ref>  There were over 200 NCDUs formed with all but five being reqresitioned for the UDTs.\n\n===UDTs===\n[[File:80-G-244701 Lt Crist, Lt Cmdr.

Lt. Thomas C. Crist CEC, from NCB 10 was in [[Honolulu]] from [[Canton Island]] where he had been involved in a lagoon [[coral|coral head]] clearance project.<ref>Lt Crist, \"The MOCK-UP\", Fort Pierce Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Newspaper, 20 July 1945 , p. 4, Fort Pierce SEAL Archives, Fort Pierce,  FL.</ref> His being in Pearl Harbor turned out to be pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and staging qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit for that task.  Lt. Crist had staged 30 officers and 150  enlisted when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and Lt Crist was picked for UDT 2.  That did not last as Admiral Connelly wanted a commander with combat experience.  So, Lt. Crist was made ops officer for team 2.  Upon returning to Hawaii Lt. Crist was named as the first Training Officer of the UDT  program.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as commander of UDT 3.  For the Marianas operation (Kwajelein, Roi-Namur, Siapan, Tinian, [[Eniwetok]], and Guam) Admiral Turner recommended sixty silver stars and over three hundred [[bronze star]]s with Vs for the Seabees and others of UDTs 1-7<ref name= \"Frogman\">\"America's First Frogman\", Elizabeth K.

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEC Insignia.jpg|thumb|WWII Naval Officers from the Civil Engineer Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps and Supply Corps assigned to Naval Construction Battalions had a Silver Seabee on their Corps insignia. ]]\n[[File:U.S. Naval insignia per USMC regulation.jpg|thumb|U.S. Naval insignia, brass subdued per USMC regulation for officers in CBs transferred to the Corps.]]\n\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, but with the distinctive letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.  The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps replacing the Old English letters C.E.  These were to be worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by enlisted, pay grades E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using iron beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course.

He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and staging qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit for that task.  Lt. Crist had staged 30 officers and 150  enlisted when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and Lt Crist was picked for UDT 2.  That did not last as Admiral Connelly wanted a commander with combat experience.  So, Lt. Crist was made ops officer for team 2.  Upon returning to Hawaii Lt. Crist was named as the first Training Officer of the UDT  program.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as commander of UDT 3.

The basic premise of osteopathic medicine is that a physician's primary role is to facilitate the body's inherent ability to heal itself. While originally designed as an improvement on the traditional medicine of 19th century America, osteopathic medicine became a reformation within the U.S. healthcare system while remaining distinct from other forms of medicine.<ref name=\"About Osteopathic Medicine\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aacom.org/become-a-doctor/about-om|title=What is Osteopathic Medicine|website=www.aacom.org}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to a medical education, students at WVSOM also learn holistic techniques and are trained in [[Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine]] (OMM), manual-based therapies used to relieve pain, restore range of motion and foster the body's own ability to heal itself.<ref name=\"About Osteopathic Medicine\" />\nMedical school at WVSOM is a four-year program, with two years of training located at the Lewisburg-based campus and the final two years taking place off-campus during clinical rotations.<ref name=\"WVSOM at a Glance\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nWVSOM's current enrollment stands at 778 students, with out-of-state students composing the majority (557 out of state :221 in state).

Oba Esigie sent warriors in pursuit of men from Idah who had invaded [[Benin City]]. The Igala kingdom subsequently had to pay a yearly tribute to the Oba for this transgression.\n\nOn their way to Idah, these warriors camped at a spot for a number of days before setting out on the final leg. Some months later when they had successfully accomplished their mission, they were returning home when they passed the same camp spot again. Whilst resting there, they found that the remains of the yams they fed on during their outward journey had germinated and blossomed. Searching for food and water, they found lots of succulent fruit and vegetables as well as many animals to hunt. The water from the springs also tasted good. They were very impressed with the fertility of the soil in this area.\n\nA further survey of the place showed that the landscape was flat and had no rocks or mountains; this they thought would be good for farming. There were lots of palm, coconut, rubber and walnut trees together with a variety of fruit like mango, orange, lime, guava, lemon, grape, pineapple, cashew, tomatoes, avocado pear, wild berries, peppers, okra, melon, pumpkin, banana, and plantain. There were also a wide variety of vegetables like water-leaf which grew easily and quickly. They found that tubular root crops like yams, cassava and sweet potatoes germinated and matured quickly.\n\nThey knew that news of the discovery of this fertile land would please the king and decided that instead of going back to Benin, they would settle on the land and send their taxes back to him in the form of farm produce instead. They sent an emissary to the king of Benin to obtain permission to set up a new settlement in the area, ensuring that the king saw the advantages of a rich harvest and more crop taxes. After much deliberation, he granted them permission to settle and live there.\n\nTo reward these soldiers for their effort and retain their loyalty, the king granted them the patent to engage in bronze casting for added trade; so they joined the Benin Royal Guild of Bronze Casters as the only ones outside of Benin City allowed to engage in bronze casting in the kingdom. (Anyone else caught doing this was put to death or banished from the kingdom, his family disgraced for ever).\n\nThe new settlers perfected their craft of bronze casting and the production of the royal pestal{{typo help inline|reason=similar to septal|date=November 2019}} called [[Eben bronze|Eben]]. They cast and sent the Oba an Eben each year to show their gratitude and loyalty for this benevolence; this was accompanied by products from their harvest.\n\nThe settlers later named the place Igue-Eben which means a village or camp for producing Eben; and so Igueben was born. The little settlement soon started to grow, particularly with the influx of traders from Benin city. They did business with distant lands toward the north eastern axis from Benin city. Its trade with other areas began to thrive and it became prosperous.\n\n==The area today==\nThe village is governed by a traditional ruler called [[Onogie]]. The present Onogie is HRM Ehizogie Eluojerior. He, along with his council of chiefs and prominent traditional rulers, maintain law and order in an ever-changing westernized world. This governance system is the same as is used in the current monarchy of Benin and has been in existence since the earliest times in Benin's history.\n\nThe indigenous people of Igueben are very hard working, creative, industrious and fun-loving. They are a very literate population with most families educated to university level. They continue to maintain their cultural heritage from Benin, celebrating many festivals and ritualistic traditions.\n\nTheir language is a unique dialect of Edo and Esan. They also use Pidgin English, which is a mixture of Portuguese, English and Esan. The majority speak very good English due to their high levels of education.\n\nToday, Igueben is endowed with numerous sons and daughters in various professions e.g. doctors, lawyers, barristers, bank directors, businessmen and women, writers, poets, teachers, engineers, scientists, architects, nurses, technicians, politicians, advertising and marketing professionals, farmers and some self-made millionaires.\n\nIgueben consists of several towns whose suburbs conurbate seamlessly. Some of the popular towns are: Eguare, Oyomo, Afuda, Idumeka, Idumonka, Uhe, Egbiki, Ekekhen Idigun, Idumogbo, Idumedo, Idumotutu and Idumogo. A woman\u2019s town origin may be determined by the manner in which she greets her elders in the early morning; for example: 'Latuse', 'Lamogun, 'Lagiesan', 'Lani', 'Labheze' are peculiar to Uhe, Idigun, Idumonka, Idumeka and Afuda/ Ekekhen respectively.\n\nThe people of Igueben are very sociable, showing deep respect for other cultures; this is particularly evident in their ability to marry freely into other tribes and cultures from both within and outside Nigeria. They also possess deep sense of fidelity and social responsibility.\n\n==The Onogie Of Igueben Kingdom==\n[[File:HRH, E. Eluojierior.jpg|thumb|Onogie of Igueben]]\n\n'''HRM EHIZOGIE ELUOJIERIOR JP.'''\n\nOn 6 December 1956, a male child named Ehizogie, was born into the Royal family of His Royal Highness, Eluojierior Imadojemu II, the Onogie of Igueben, As the first male child with Royal blood, Ehizogie was therefore ordained by God to rule the people of Igueben KINGDOM.\n\nAt age one; the young Ehizogie was taken to his uncle, Chief Negbedion Aire of Opoji in the present [[Esan Central]] Local Government Area of [[Edo State]]. Ehizogie lived with Chief Aire from 1957 to 1968. During this period, he travelled to so many towns and places in the then Midwest as a Travel Teacher. They travelled to many towns such as Uromi, Ogwashikwu, Asaba, Abudu. He however, returned to Opoji in 1968 to complete his Primary School at St. John\u2019s Primary School; Okhore, Opoji.\n\nHe started a formal Secondary School Education at Ugbeka College, Evboehighae near Benin City. Here, he was a School Prefect as a new school. As one of the best students in the Bendel State, he won the Scholarship for three years, (after a rigorous exams) from 1975 \u2013 1978. He transferred to Eghosa Anglican Grammar School, Benin City in 1976 to complete his Secondary School Education. Here again, he became the school\u2019s Food Prefect in 1977. He sat for and passed his WASC with Grade one, in 1978. He also credited his eight papers at the GCE level that same year.\n \nIn 1979, he was admitted into the Federal Polytechnic, [[Auchi]], where he obtained an [[Ordinary National Diploma]] (OND) Upper Credit, [[Business Administration]] in 1981 and [[Higher National Diploma]] (HND), Business Management, 1983. Between 1983 and 1984, Ehizogie Participated in the [[National Youth Service Corps]] Program in Ogoni Area of Rivers State. At the orientation Camp he was made a platoon leader. His primary assignment was in Korokoro Tai, he came in close contact with HRM, G.N.K. Giniwa, a paramount first class ruler of Rivers State, who is currently the Chairman, Rivers State Traditional Council (2013). The relationship between HRM, the Onogie of Igueben and HRM, the paramount Ruler of Korokoro Tai Kingdom, (who is currently the chairman of Rivers State Traditional Council as at 2014) which was conjugated in 1984, had remained unhindered till date.\n\nOn completion of his NYSC in 1984, Ehizogie was employed by Vanni Holdings Limited, a Lagos-based Company, as the Budget/Finance Officer of the company. Within seven months of his employment, the young intelligent Ehizogie demonstrated his administrative acumen and prowess to the admiration of his colleagues and superiors. Unfortunately, his work career was short lived due to natural forces. The demise of his beloved father had made his home coming imminent.\n\nIn June 1985, a message was sent to the young and promising Ehizogie in Lagos that his attention was needed at home because his father, HRM, the then Onogie of Igueben was indisposed. He obtained permission from his Company\u2019s Director and travelled to Igueben with the intention to quickly see his father, and to return to Lagos after two or three days, to continue with his job. As the saying goes \u201cMan proposes, but God disposes\u201d. Young Ehizogie, NEVER returned to Lagos to continue with the job he cherished so much.\n\nHis ascension to the throne of his forefathers had been a remarkable blessing to the people and land of Igueben. Under his reign, Igueben Kingdom has witnessed tremendous development in terms if infrastructure and other facilities. For instance, there are relatively good network of roads, a Local Government Headquarters, re-opening of closed [[College of Education]] for over 30 years, sinking of Boreholes. Above all, peace and stability had flourished in this Kingdom in the past 30 years (2015) of his reign. It was this monumental growth in all sectors that later earn IGUEBEN the status of IGUEBEN L.G.A. in August 1996. Since the creation of this Local Government, IGUEBEN has never looked back. It was also in recognition of his innumerable achievements in Igueben Community and Society that the Federal Polytechnic, [[Auchi]], his almamater, conferred him with the FELLOWSHIP of the Institution in 2013.\n\nHRM Ehizogie Eluojierior I (JP) had contributed and served the Community and Society in different capacities since his enthronement. Summary of some of the positions held in the past 30 years include:\n\n*Chairman, Igueben Local Government Traditional Council 1996 \u2013 date\n*Vice Chairman of Edo State Traditional Council 2006-2010 (4 years)\n*Chairman.

The [[post code]] is 310.<ref>{{cite web|title=Post Offices- with map of LGA |publisher=NIPOST |url=http://www.nipost.gov.ng/PostCode.aspx |accessdate=2009-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007011423/http://www.nipost.gov.ng/PostCode.aspx |archivedate=2009-10-07 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIgueben was founded around 1516, during the reign of the Benin monarch, [[Oba Esigie]] (1504\u20131550), who was one of the warrior kings of the great kingdom.\n\nWar had broken out between the Kingdom of Benin and the Attah of the [[Igala Kingdom]] based at [[Idah]], a town on the banks of the [[Niger River]]. Oba Esigie sent warriors in pursuit of men from Idah who had invaded [[Benin City]]. The Igala kingdom subsequently had to pay a yearly tribute to the Oba for this transgression.\n\nOn their way to Idah, these warriors camped at a spot for a number of days before setting out on the final leg. Some months later when they had successfully accomplished their mission, they were returning home when they passed the same camp spot again. Whilst resting there, they found that the remains of the yams they fed on during their outward journey had germinated and blossomed. Searching for food and water, they found lots of succulent fruit and vegetables as well as many animals to hunt. The water from the springs also tasted good. They were very impressed with the fertility of the soil in this area.\n\nA further survey of the place showed that the landscape was flat and had no rocks or mountains; this they thought would be good for farming. There were lots of palm, coconut, rubber and walnut trees together with a variety of fruit like mango, orange, lime, guava, lemon, grape, pineapple, cashew, tomatoes, avocado pear, wild berries, peppers, okra, melon, pumpkin, banana, and plantain. There were also a wide variety of vegetables like water-leaf which grew easily and quickly. They found that tubular root crops like yams, cassava and sweet potatoes germinated and matured quickly.\n\nThey knew that news of the discovery of this fertile land would please the king and decided that instead of going back to Benin, they would settle on the land and send their taxes back to him in the form of farm produce instead. They sent an emissary to the king of Benin to obtain permission to set up a new settlement in the area, ensuring that the king saw the advantages of a rich harvest and more crop taxes. After much deliberation, he granted them permission to settle and live there.\n\nTo reward these soldiers for their effort and retain their loyalty, the king granted them the patent to engage in bronze casting for added trade; so they joined the Benin Royal Guild of Bronze Casters as the only ones outside of Benin City allowed to engage in bronze casting in the kingdom. (Anyone else caught doing this was put to death or banished from the kingdom, his family disgraced for ever).\n\nThe new settlers perfected their craft of bronze casting and the production of the royal pestal{{typo help inline|reason=similar to septal|date=November 2019}} called [[Eben bronze|Eben]]. They cast and sent the Oba an Eben each year to show their gratitude and loyalty for this benevolence; this was accompanied by products from their harvest.\n\nThe settlers later named the place Igue-Eben which means a village or camp for producing Eben; and so Igueben was born. The little settlement soon started to grow, particularly with the influx of traders from Benin city. They did business with distant lands toward the north eastern axis from Benin city. Its trade with other areas began to thrive and it became prosperous.\n\n==The area today==\nThe village is governed by a traditional ruler called [[Onogie]]. The present Onogie is HRM Ehizogie Eluojerior. He, along with his council of chiefs and prominent traditional rulers, maintain law and order in an ever-changing westernized world. This governance system is the same as is used in the current monarchy of Benin and has been in existence since the earliest times in Benin's history.\n\nThe indigenous people of Igueben are very hard working, creative, industrious and fun-loving. They are a very literate population with most families educated to university level. They continue to maintain their cultural heritage from Benin, celebrating many festivals and ritualistic traditions.\n\nTheir language is a unique dialect of Edo and Esan. They also use Pidgin English, which is a mixture of Portuguese, English and Esan. The majority speak very good English due to their high levels of education.\n\nToday, Igueben is endowed with numerous sons and daughters in various professions e.g. doctors, lawyers, barristers, bank directors, businessmen and women, writers, poets, teachers, engineers, scientists, architects, nurses, technicians, politicians, advertising and marketing professionals, farmers and some self-made millionaires.\n\nIgueben consists of several towns whose suburbs conurbate seamlessly. Some of the popular towns are: Eguare, Oyomo, Afuda, Idumeka, Idumonka, Uhe, Egbiki, Ekekhen Idigun, Idumogbo, Idumedo, Idumotutu and Idumogo. A woman\u2019s town origin may be determined by the manner in which she greets her elders in the early morning; for example: 'Latuse', 'Lamogun, 'Lagiesan', 'Lani', 'Labheze' are peculiar to Uhe, Idigun, Idumonka, Idumeka and Afuda/ Ekekhen respectively.\n\nThe people of Igueben are very sociable, showing deep respect for other cultures; this is particularly evident in their ability to marry freely into other tribes and cultures from both within and outside Nigeria. They also possess deep sense of fidelity and social responsibility.\n\n==The Onogie Of Igueben Kingdom==\n[[File:HRH, E. Eluojierior.jpg|thumb|Onogie of Igueben]]\n\n'''HRM EHIZOGIE ELUOJIERIOR JP.'''\n\nOn 6 December 1956, a male child named Ehizogie, was born into the Royal family of His Royal Highness, Eluojierior Imadojemu II, the Onogie of Igueben, As the first male child with Royal blood, Ehizogie was therefore ordained by God to rule the people of Igueben KINGDOM.\n\nAt age one; the young Ehizogie was taken to his uncle, Chief Negbedion Aire of Opoji in the present [[Esan Central]] Local Government Area of [[Edo State]]. Ehizogie lived with Chief Aire from 1957 to 1968. During this period, he travelled to so many towns and places in the then Midwest as a Travel Teacher. They travelled to many towns such as Uromi, Ogwashikwu, Asaba, Abudu. He however, returned to Opoji in 1968 to complete his Primary School at St. John\u2019s Primary School; Okhore, Opoji.\n\nHe started a formal Secondary School Education at Ugbeka College, Evboehighae near Benin City. Here, he was a School Prefect as a new school. As one of the best students in the Bendel State, he won the Scholarship for three years, (after a rigorous exams) from 1975 \u2013 1978. He transferred to Eghosa Anglican Grammar School, Benin City in 1976 to complete his Secondary School Education. Here again, he became the school\u2019s Food Prefect in 1977. He sat for and passed his WASC with Grade one, in 1978. He also credited his eight papers at the GCE level that same year.\n \nIn 1979, he was admitted into the Federal Polytechnic, [[Auchi]], where he obtained an [[Ordinary National Diploma]] (OND) Upper Credit, [[Business Administration]] in 1981 and [[Higher National Diploma]] (HND), Business Management, 1983. Between 1983 and 1984, Ehizogie Participated in the [[National Youth Service Corps]] Program in Ogoni Area of Rivers State. At the orientation Camp he was made a platoon leader. His primary assignment was in Korokoro Tai, he came in close contact with HRM, G.N.K. Giniwa, a paramount first class ruler of Rivers State, who is currently the Chairman, Rivers State Traditional Council (2013). The relationship between HRM, the Onogie of Igueben and HRM, the paramount Ruler of Korokoro Tai Kingdom, (who is currently the chairman of Rivers State Traditional Council as at 2014) which was conjugated in 1984, had remained unhindered till date.\n\nOn completion of his NYSC in 1984, Ehizogie was employed by Vanni Holdings Limited, a Lagos-based Company, as the Budget/Finance Officer of the company. Within seven months of his employment, the young intelligent Ehizogie demonstrated his administrative acumen and prowess to the admiration of his colleagues and superiors. Unfortunately, his work career was short lived due to natural forces. The demise of his beloved father had made his home coming imminent.\n\nIn June 1985, a message was sent to the young and promising Ehizogie in Lagos that his attention was needed at home because his father, HRM, the then Onogie of Igueben was indisposed. He obtained permission from his Company\u2019s Director and travelled to Igueben with the intention to quickly see his father, and to return to Lagos after two or three days, to continue with his job. As the saying goes \u201cMan proposes, but God disposes\u201d. Young Ehizogie, NEVER returned to Lagos to continue with the job he cherished so much.\n\nHis ascension to the throne of his forefathers had been a remarkable blessing to the people and land of Igueben. Under his reign, Igueben Kingdom has witnessed tremendous development in terms if infrastructure and other facilities. For instance, there are relatively good network of roads, a Local Government Headquarters, re-opening of closed [[College of Education]] for over 30 years, sinking of Boreholes. Above all, peace and stability had flourished in this Kingdom in the past 30 years (2015) of his reign. It was this monumental growth in all sectors that later earn IGUEBEN the status of IGUEBEN L.G.A. in August 1996. Since the creation of this Local Government, IGUEBEN has never looked back. It was also in recognition of his innumerable achievements in Igueben Community and Society that the Federal Polytechnic, [[Auchi]], his almamater, conferred him with the FELLOWSHIP of the Institution in 2013.\n\nHRM Ehizogie Eluojierior I (JP) had contributed and served the Community and Society in different capacities since his enthronement. Summary of some of the positions held in the past 30 years include:\n\n*Chairman, Igueben Local Government Traditional Council 1996 \u2013 date\n*Vice Chairman of Edo State Traditional Council 2006-2010 (4 years)\n*Chairman. MAMSER Implementation Committee, Defunct OKPEBHO Local Government Area.\n*Chairman of PCRC, Defunct Okpebho Local Govt. Area and the present Esan Central Local Government Area.\n*Member, National Consultative Group of Population Development (Federal Government Appointment) 1990\n*President Zone II Boys Scout of Nigeria Edo State 2000 \u2013 Date\n*Justice of Peace (JP) 1990\n*Fellowship of the Federal Polytechnic, Auchi 2013\n\n*Member \u2013 [[Rotary International]] 2016\n\n== Facilities ==\nMajor facilities include the Igueben General Hospital, the Igueben Grammar School, the Igueben College, the Igueben Mixed Secondary School, the College of Education Igueben, the Union Bank of Nigeria PLC, the Uda Community Bank PLC, numerous primary schools, two major markets and a Local Government Council Secretariat. Its rainforest remains largely untouched.\n\n== Economy ==\nIgueben has a growing economy. The indigenes engage in retail trade of manufactured goods which they buy from major cities like [[Port Harcourt]], [[Onitsha]], [[Lagos]], [[Sapele]] and [[Benin City]]. Goods traded include building materials, clothing, electronics, mechanical spare parts etc.\n\nThe primary occupation in Igueben is farming. Local produce are cross traded with Northern parts of Nigeria; they sell food products peculiar to the savannah vegetation such as tubular roots like [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]] (garri), [[banana]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] etc. and buy produce peculiar to arid areas such as [[beans]], [[onions]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[potatoes]] etc. Foreign export include palm produce, rubber and [[timber]].\n\nIgueben is highly affected by urban migration as young and educated sons and daughter migrate to larger cities and abroad for more lucrative job opportunities.\nThe many celebrations and festivals throughout the year provide occupation for many locals e.g. in advertising, catering, costume making, cultural dance and events organisation.\n\n== Tourists attractions ==\nCultural celebrations like the Ukpe Festival showcasing masquerades, traditional dances, family entertainment and visits; are well worth experiencing. The Onogie\u2019s New Year Festival - Ihuan, which is similar to the Ukpe Festival also affords further opportunity to engage with local traditional practices.\nThere are potentials for tourists attractions such as historical landmarks like the Onogie's palace and rainforest expeditions. These opportunities are yet to be exploited.\n\n<br />\n==See also==\n*[[Benin Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* P.

The series stars [[Gary Coleman]] and [[Todd Bridges]] as Arnold and Willis Jackson, respectively, two [[African Americans|African-American]] boys from [[Harlem]] taken in by a rich white [[Park Avenue]] businessman and widower named Phillip Drummond ([[Conrad Bain]]) and his daughter Kimberly ([[Dana Plato]]), for whom their deceased mother previously worked.<ref>{{cite news |title=Diff'rent Strokes: Complete First Season|work=DVD Talk|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/12268/diffrent-strokes-complete-first-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Diff'rent Strokes: The Complete Second Season|work=DVD Talk|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20017/diffrent-strokes-the-complete-second-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref> During the first season and first half of the second season, [[Charlotte Rae]] also starred as Mrs. Edna Garrett, the Drummonds' first housekeeper who ultimately spun off into her own sitcom, ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' as a housemother at the fictional Eastland School. The second housekeeper, Adelaide Brubaker, was played by [[Nedra Volz]]. The third housekeeper, Pearl Gallagher, was played by [[Mary Jo Catlett]], appearing first as a recurring character before eventually becoming a main cast member. The series made stars out of Coleman, Bridges and Plato and became known for the \"[[very special episode]]s\" in which serious issues such as [[racism]], [[illegal drug use]], [[alcoholism]], [[hitchhiking]], [[kidnapping]] and [[child sexual abuse]] were dramatically explored. The lives of these stars were later plagued by legal troubles and drug addiction, with Plato and Coleman suffering early deaths in 1999 and 2010, respectively.\n\n==History==\nThe series was originally devised jointly to serve as a vehicle for Bain (after ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' had abruptly finished production in 1978) and Coleman, a child actor who had caught producers' attentions after appearing in a number of commercials. An early rough outline for the series, featuring the characters created for Bain and Coleman, had the proposed title ''45 Minutes from Harlem'' (even though Harlem is only 10-15 minutes away from the Drummond residence by subway or taxi).<ref>{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein |url-access=registration |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein/page/174 174]}}</ref> As the pitch was developed, Coleman's character gained an older brother and the daughter of Bain's character and a housekeeper was added to the line-up. The title eventually became ''Diff'rent Strokes,'' inspired by the quote \"Different strokes for different folks\" popularized by boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1966 (Ali himself makes a guest appearance in the second season).<ref>{{cite news |title=10 things you never knew about 'Diff'rent Strokes' |url=https://www.metv.com/lists/10-things-you-never-knew-about-diffrent-strokes |agency=[[MeTV]] |date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> The sitcom starred Coleman as Arnold Jackson and Bridges as his older brother, Willis. They played two children from a poor section of Harlem whose deceased mother previously worked for rich widower Philip Drummond (Bain), who eventually adopted them. They lived in a penthouse with Drummond, his daughter Kimberly (Plato) and their maid. There were three maids during the sitcom's run: [[Edna Garrett]] (Rae), Adelaide Brubaker (Volz) and Pearl Gallagher (Catlett). They lived in the Penthouse Suite at 697 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] in New York City. As Arnold, Coleman popularized the [[catchphrase]] \"What'chu talkin' 'bout, Willis?\" with the ending often varied, depending on whom he was addressing. Early episodes addressed typical issues in a family. As the series progressed, although sticking to more light-hearted sit-com themes in many episodes, at times it focused on more serious topics including drug abuse, alcoholism, hitchhiking, child abuse and crime, among other issues.\n\n===Seasons 1-4 (1978-1982)===\nThe first season very much covered 'every day life' of this unusual family line-up. Although billed on the opening credits, Plato did not appear in every episode as her character was often said to be away at her private school (the character would become more regular later in the first season and across the second season). During the first season, the [[unseen character]] of \"The Gooch\" is first mentioned as a supposedly mean, hulking (but not very bright) bully at Arnold's school. First 'featured' in the first-season episode ''The Fight,'' where he is said to be bullying Arnold at school, The Gooch went on to be the focus of several future episodes and is mentioned in countless others across the run of the series. Rae appeared in every first-season episode as Edna Garrett and is present for the first 13 episodes of the second season, but is absent in several episodes late on in the season, before leaving to star in her own spin-off, ''The Facts of Life,'' set at Kimberly's private school, the fictional Eastland (Kimberly herself did not become a regular character in that series, although the two shows had a number of crossovers). Following Rae's departure near the end of the second season following the episode \"The Rivals,\" Volz took over as the housekeeper, the older and crankier Adelaide Brubaker. Although she was not added to the opening credits (instead always being credited with the guest cast on the closing credits), Volz appeared as a frequent semi-regular character. Also first seen in the second season was Arnold's best friend Dudley ([[Shavar Ross]]) (initially called Dudley Ramsay, later Dudley Johnson). The character went on to be featured in many episodes, both school-based and otherwise, throughout the show's run. During the fourth season, [[Dody Goodman]] was also introduced as Philip's dotty sister Sophia. Also appearing on a semi-regular basis, she effectively filled the same function as Adelaide as the older female character in many stories.\n\n===Seasons 5-6 (1982-1984)===\nIn Season 5, Catlett portrayed Pearl Gallagher, the last of the three maids and joined the cast as a series regular. Pearl appeared in almost every episode until the final season. Midway through the sixth season, Plato became pregnant and approached the producers of the show to include her pregnancy. Initially they agreed to add it, but they later decided not to add the pregnancy, with Plato's publicized brushes with substance abuse contributing to this decision, resulting in her dismissal from the series, with her character, Kimberly, written out of the storylines with the explanation that she moved to Paris to study for a couple of years. Plato did not appear as a regular cast member in the final two seasons of the series, but she made several guest appearances. At the same time, ratings were beginning to fall, so new characters were added to open up future storylines. [[Dixie Carter]] and [[Danny Cooksey]] portrayed recently divorced television aerobics instructor Margaret \"Maggie\" McKinney and her son Sam, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title= TV Playbook: ''Let's Add a Kid!''|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/935/935812p2.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> Carter was introduced midway into the sixth season; after she left for [[California]], Drummond and the family took off after her, during a two-part trip in February 1984, a storyline which also introduced Sam. Phillip proposed to Maggie and they married. Several past characters attended the wedding ceremony including Dudley, Aunt Sophia, Adelaide and Mrs. Garrett.\n\n===Season 7 (1984-1985)===\nIn the seventh season, Carter and Cooksey were added to the opening credits (with Carter getting special \"and\" billing, last in the order) and many new areas and ideas were explored in the storylines, as viewers now got to see Philip as a happily married man. Plato was no longer appearing as a main cast member, because of her pregnancy in real life. The producers felt that the pregnancy wouldn't be acceptable, so she was dropped from the show and returned for the season finale ''A Special Friend'' as a guest star. Also, since there was a new fresh-faced kid in the house with Sam, Arnold now had his own little sidekick and was happy to be a \"big brother\" for a change and with Willis being dropped into the background slightly, this new brotherly duo took center stage for many storylines. In the season, Todd Bridges was continuing the show as a main cast member, but developed absences in several episodes. Additionally, stories focusing on Arnold's school life (featured occasionally in many previous seasons) were delved into much more. The ratings did not improve to NBC's hopes. Carter departed at the end of the seventh season and was replaced in the final season with Mobley.\n\n===Season 8 (1985-1986)===\nIn the spring of 1985, NBC canceled the series because of poor ratings. ABC picked up the series for an eighth season and aired it Friday nights. In this season, Mobley replaced Carter as Maggie McKinney Drummond. Mobley, who had previously played an unrelated, one-off love interest of Drummond's in the second-season episode \"Teacher's Pet,\" was considered for Maggie when the role was created, but she was not initially chosen in part due to age disparity between her and Bain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y_9aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3384,3850530&dq=mary-ann-mobley+diff-rent-strokes&hl=en|title=The Durant Daily Democrat \u2013 Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> ABC canceled the series after 19 episodes and aired its final episode on March 7, 1986. The show returned to ABC's schedule in June for three months of summer reruns, which ended on August 30, 1986. The final season ranked 76th out of 106 shows and averaged an 11.5 household rating.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Diff'rent Strokes characters}}\n<!-- Please note: The years next to the name of an actor or actress are those of appearance on the show only! -->\n* [[Conrad Bain]] as Phillip Drummond\n* [[Gary Coleman]] as Arnold Jackson\n* [[Todd Bridges]] as Willis Jackson\n* [[Dana Plato]] as Kimberly Drummond (1978\u201384, 1985\u201386 recurring)\n* [[Charlotte Rae]] as Edna Garrett (1978\u201379)\n* [[Nedra Volz]] as Adelaide Brubaker (1980\u201384)\n* [[Janet Jackson]] as Charlene DuPrey (1980\u201384 recurring)\n* [[Dody Goodman]] as Sophia Drummond (1981\u201384 recurring)\n* [[Shavar Ross]] as Dudley Johnson (1980\u201386 recurring)\n* [[Le Tari]] as Ted Ramsey (1980\u201384 recurring)\n* [[Mary Jo Catlett]] as Pearl Gallagher (1982\u201386)\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Miss Chung (1981\u201383 recurring)\n* [[Steven Mond]] as Robbie Jason (1980\u201385 recurring)\n* [[Dixie Carter]] as Maggie McKinney Drummond #1 (1984\u201385)\n* [[Mary Ann Mobley]] as Maggie McKinney Drummond #2 (1985\u201386) and as Ms. Osbourne \n* [[Danny Cooksey]] as Sam McKinney (1984\u201386)\n* [[Jason Hervey]] as Charlie (1985\u201386 recurring)\n* Nikki Swasey as Lisa Hayes (1982\u201386 recurring)\n\nPhillip Drummond is the only character to appear in every episode of the series. Arnold Jackson missed five episodes, two from the fourth season in 1981-82 (\u201cFirst Day Blues\" and \"The Team\") and three from the seventh season in 1984\u201385 (\"The Gymnasts\", \"Sam Adopts a Grandparent\" and \"Baseball Blues\").\n\n===Supporting characters===\nOutside of the Drummond household, there were a large number of supporting characters seen over the years. Phillip's slightly dotty sister Sophia ([[Dody Goodman]]) was regularly seen in the fourth season, playing matchmaker for her brother in hopes of getting Philip to marry again. Dudley Johnson ([[Shavar Ross]]) was Arnold's new best friend, who, like Arnold, was also adopted, with whom he shared many memorable childhood scrapes. Some of these were important or serious storylines under the \"very special episode\" heading, which ''Diff'rent Strokes'' popularized (see below). Ted Ramsey ([[Le Tari]]) was Dudley's adoptive father, who turned up occasionally. In the third season, [[Janet Jackson]] played Willis' girlfriend, Charlene DuPrey. She was a frequent recurring character until the sixth season, when Charlene and Willis decided to [[break up]], but remain friends. Other classmates and friends of Arnold seen over time included Robbie Jason ([[Steven Mond]]) and snobby Lisa Hayes (Nikki Swasey), who initially was sweet on Arnold, but later came to despise him, leading to hatred between the pair and many squabbles. Miss Chung ([[Rosalind Chao]]) was Arnold's teacher. In the fall of 1985, when the series moved to ABC for the seventh season, Arnold, Dudley and Lisa entered high school, where they gained a new friend in Charlie ([[Jason Hervey]]). An oft-mentioned character, spanning the entire show's run, was \"The Gooch,\" a notorious bully at Arnold's school. First mentioned in the first-season episode \"The Fight,\" which revolves around his bullying of Arnold, his name is mentioned in numerous episodes (and his bullying of Arnold returned as the center of several plots), with Arnold's frequent descriptions of him as a burly, troublesome brute, forever looking for trouble but not very intelligent, but the character never actually appeared on screen. In the seventh season, after years of harassing Arnold (and later Sam), the Gooch was finally defeated by Arnold's neighbor and nemesis Carmella, a [[Foreign exchange student]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Diff'rent Strokes episodes}}\n{{:List of Diff'rent Strokes episodes}}\n\n===Very special episodes===\n[[File:Nancyreagandiffrentstrokes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nancy Reagan on the set of ''Diff'rent Strokes'']]\n''Diff'rent Strokes'' was also known for its many \"very special episodes,\" most notably an anti-drug episode (\"The Reporter\") that featured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]], who promoted her \"[[Just Say No]]\" campaign and \"[[The Bicycle Man]],\" a two-part episode that guest starred [[Gordon Jump]] as a [[pedophilia|pedophile]] who lures Arnold and Dudley into his bicycle shop and attempts to [[child molestation|molest]] them. Another episode involved a [[con artist]] (played by [[Whitman Mayo]]) posing as a relative of Arnold and Willis in an attempt to get access to the inheritance they were left by a former neighbor. Another episode (\"Skin Deep or True Blue\") involved Kimberly's new boyfriend, Roger Morehouse, not allowing his sister, Emily ([[Melora Hardin]]), to go to their school's costume ball with Willis because he is black. A less serious episode (\"Green Hair\") had Kimberly's hair turning green from acid rain. In a two-part episode on the dangers of [[hitchhiking]] (\"The Hitchhikers\"), Kimberly and Arnold (who were out in the cold weather and didn't have money for cab or bus fare) were abducted by a serial kidnapper-rapist (played by Woody Eney), who initially acted as a good Samaritan by giving the two of them a ride and inviting them to his apartment. After the man's true nature became known, Arnold escaped to look for help and the man nearly raped Kimberly before the police arrived to arrest him. At the end of the episode, Bain (in an out-of-character [[Public Service Announcement|PSA]]) spoke about what to do if real life situations as the one portrayed on the show were to occur. Two notable episodes dealt with the consequences of [[alcoholism]]. In the first, season 5's \"A Drinking Problem,\" Willis moves out of the penthouse to live with Jerry ([[Lawrence Monoson]]) who abuses alcohol. In the second, season 7's \"Cheers to Arnold,\" Arnold must deal with Ricky ([[Robert Jayne]]), a classmate whom he catches drinking a thermos of alcohol in the school bathroom. In the final season (when the sitcom moved from NBC to ABC), the one-hour season opener (\"Sam's Missing\") revolved around Sam being kidnapped by Donald Brown ([[Royce D. Applegate]]), a bereaved father hoping to replace his own dead son, Tommy. In other notable episodes, such as season 8's \"Bulimia,\" the family discovered that Kimberly was suffering from [[bulimia]]. In another episode, season 7's \"A Special Friend,\" Arnold and Sam met Karen, a [[street performer]]. After a performance, she has an [[Epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure and Sam thinks she's dying. The boys then feel uncomfortable around her and when they begin making jokes about her seizures, they find out that housekeeper Pearl herself has epilepsy but, unlike Karen, controls her seizures by taking medication.\n\n===Spin-off and crossovers===\n''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' (1979-1988) is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Diff'rent Strokes'' featuring Drummond's former maid Mrs. Garrett, who had accepted a job as the housemother for a dormitory at Eastland, an all-girls private school that Kimberly was attending. In a late first-season episode of ''Strokes'' (\"The Girls School,\" which served as the \"[[backdoor pilot]]\" of ''Facts''), Mrs. Garrett took Kimberly to the school with the intent of helping her sew costumes for a school play. While there, Mrs. Garrett met Kimberly's classmates and was offered the job as \"dorm mother.\" She declines in this episode, but come fall, clearly had a change of heart. The ''Diff'rent Strokes'' cast appeared in the first episode of ''The Facts of Life'' (at one point, Drummond asks Mrs. Garrett \"Are you sure we can't change your mind to come back to us?\"). The success of the spin-off led to several ''Strokes''/''Facts'' crossovers in the ensuing years. While not a spin-off, ''[[Hello, Larry]]'' (1979-1980) had a connection to ''Strokes'' as it was established in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover episode]] that Philip Drummond and Larry Alder ([[McLean Stevenson]]) were old Army buddies and Mr. Drummond had bought the company that owned the radio station where Larry worked as a talk show host. The episode \"Almost American\" (A.K.A. \"Night School\"), was the pilot for a potential spin-off series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Almost American |url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0559935/ |agency=[[IMDb]] |date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, Arnold appeared on the ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' episode \"The Great Computer Caper\" and the ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'' episode \"Remote Control Man.\"\n\n===Later appearances as the characters===\nIn 1994, Coleman appeared in an episode of ''[[Married... with Children]]'' (\"How Green Was My Apple\"), playing a building code inspector whom [[Al Bundy]] ([[Ed O'Neill]]) called to report an illegal driveway.

All three experienced various legal problems while Bridges and Plato also struggled with drug addictions, all of which were documented in the press.

Due to financial difficulties and her growing addiction to drugs and alcohol, Plato relinquished custody of her son, Tyler, to Lambert. In an attempt to boost her faltering career, Plato posed for ''[[Playboy]]'' in June 1989, but her appearance in the magazine did not help her land acting jobs.<ref name=\"sporkin\" /> By 1990, Plato was living in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

The series stars [[Gary Coleman]] and [[Todd Bridges]] as Arnold and Willis Jackson, respectively, two [[African Americans|African-American]] boys from [[Harlem]] taken in by a rich white [[Park Avenue]] businessman and widower named Phillip Drummond ([[Conrad Bain]]) and his daughter Kimberly ([[Dana Plato]]), for whom their deceased mother previously worked.<ref>{{cite news |title=Diff'rent Strokes: Complete First Season|work=DVD Talk|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/12268/diffrent-strokes-complete-first-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Diff'rent Strokes: The Complete Second Season|work=DVD Talk|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20017/diffrent-strokes-the-complete-second-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref> During the first season and first half of the second season, [[Charlotte Rae]] also starred as Mrs. Edna Garrett, the Drummonds' first housekeeper who ultimately spun off into her own sitcom, ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' as a housemother at the fictional Eastland School. The second housekeeper, Adelaide Brubaker, was played by [[Nedra Volz]]. The third housekeeper, Pearl Gallagher, was played by [[Mary Jo Catlett]], appearing first as a recurring character before eventually becoming a main cast member. The series made stars out of Coleman, Bridges and Plato and became known for the \"[[very special episode]]s\" in which serious issues such as [[racism]], [[illegal drug use]], [[alcoholism]], [[hitchhiking]], [[kidnapping]] and [[child sexual abuse]] were dramatically explored. The lives of these stars were later plagued by legal troubles and drug addiction, with Plato and Coleman suffering early deaths in 1999 and 2010, respectively.\n\n==History==\nThe series was originally devised jointly to serve as a vehicle for Bain (after ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' had abruptly finished production in 1978) and Coleman, a child actor who had caught producers' attentions after appearing in a number of commercials. An early rough outline for the series, featuring the characters created for Bain and Coleman, had the proposed title ''45 Minutes from Harlem'' (even though Harlem is only 10-15 minutes away from the Drummond residence by subway or taxi).<ref>{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein |url-access=registration |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein/page/174 174]}}</ref> As the pitch was developed, Coleman's character gained an older brother and the daughter of Bain's character and a housekeeper was added to the line-up. The title eventually became ''Diff'rent Strokes,'' inspired by the quote \"Different strokes for different folks\" popularized by boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1966 (Ali himself makes a guest appearance in the second season).<ref>{{cite news |title=10 things you never knew about 'Diff'rent Strokes' |url=https://www.metv.com/lists/10-things-you-never-knew-about-diffrent-strokes |agency=[[MeTV]] |date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> The sitcom starred Coleman as Arnold Jackson and Bridges as his older brother, Willis. They played two children from a poor section of Harlem whose deceased mother previously worked for rich widower Philip Drummond (Bain), who eventually adopted them. They lived in a penthouse with Drummond, his daughter Kimberly (Plato) and their maid. There were three maids during the sitcom's run: [[Edna Garrett]] (Rae), Adelaide Brubaker (Volz) and Pearl Gallagher (Catlett). They lived in the Penthouse Suite at 697 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] in New York City. As Arnold, Coleman popularized the [[catchphrase]] \"What'chu talkin' 'bout, Willis?\" with the ending often varied, depending on whom he was addressing. Early episodes addressed typical issues in a family. As the series progressed, although sticking to more light-hearted sit-com themes in many episodes, at times it focused on more serious topics including drug abuse, alcoholism, hitchhiking, child abuse and crime, among other issues.\n\n===Seasons 1-4 (1978-1982)===\nThe first season very much covered 'every day life' of this unusual family line-up. Although billed on the opening credits, Plato did not appear in every episode as her character was often said to be away at her private school (the character would become more regular later in the first season and across the second season). During the first season, the [[unseen character]] of \"The Gooch\" is first mentioned as a supposedly mean, hulking (but not very bright) bully at Arnold's school. First 'featured' in the first-season episode ''The Fight,'' where he is said to be bullying Arnold at school, The Gooch went on to be the focus of several future episodes and is mentioned in countless others across the run of the series. Rae appeared in every first-season episode as Edna Garrett and is present for the first 13 episodes of the second season, but is absent in several episodes late on in the season, before leaving to star in her own spin-off, ''The Facts of Life,'' set at Kimberly's private school, the fictional Eastland (Kimberly herself did not become a regular character in that series, although the two shows had a number of crossovers). Following Rae's departure near the end of the second season following the episode \"The Rivals,\" Volz took over as the housekeeper, the older and crankier Adelaide Brubaker. Although she was not added to the opening credits (instead always being credited with the guest cast on the closing credits), Volz appeared as a frequent semi-regular character. Also first seen in the second season was Arnold's best friend Dudley ([[Shavar Ross]]) (initially called Dudley Ramsay, later Dudley Johnson). The character went on to be featured in many episodes, both school-based and otherwise, throughout the show's run. During the fourth season, [[Dody Goodman]] was also introduced as Philip's dotty sister Sophia. Also appearing on a semi-regular basis, she effectively filled the same function as Adelaide as the older female character in many stories.\n\n===Seasons 5-6 (1982-1984)===\nIn Season 5, Catlett portrayed Pearl Gallagher, the last of the three maids and joined the cast as a series regular. Pearl appeared in almost every episode until the final season. Midway through the sixth season, Plato became pregnant and approached the producers of the show to include her pregnancy. Initially they agreed to add it, but they later decided not to add the pregnancy, with Plato's publicized brushes with substance abuse contributing to this decision, resulting in her dismissal from the series, with her character, Kimberly, written out of the storylines with the explanation that she moved to Paris to study for a couple of years. Plato did not appear as a regular cast member in the final two seasons of the series, but she made several guest appearances. At the same time, ratings were beginning to fall, so new characters were added to open up future storylines. [[Dixie Carter]] and [[Danny Cooksey]] portrayed recently divorced television aerobics instructor Margaret \"Maggie\" McKinney and her son Sam, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title= TV Playbook: ''Let's Add a Kid!''|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/935/935812p2.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> Carter was introduced midway into the sixth season; after she left for [[California]], Drummond and the family took off after her, during a two-part trip in February 1984, a storyline which also introduced Sam. Phillip proposed to Maggie and they married. Several past characters attended the wedding ceremony including Dudley, Aunt Sophia, Adelaide and Mrs. Garrett.\n\n===Season 7 (1984-1985)===\nIn the seventh season, Carter and Cooksey were added to the opening credits (with Carter getting special \"and\" billing, last in the order) and many new areas and ideas were explored in the storylines, as viewers now got to see Philip as a happily married man. Plato was no longer appearing as a main cast member, because of her pregnancy in real life. The producers felt that the pregnancy wouldn't be acceptable, so she was dropped from the show and returned for the season finale ''A Special Friend'' as a guest star. Also, since there was a new fresh-faced kid in the house with Sam, Arnold now had his own little sidekick and was happy to be a \"big brother\" for a change and with Willis being dropped into the background slightly, this new brotherly duo took center stage for many storylines. In the season, Todd Bridges was continuing the show as a main cast member, but developed absences in several episodes. Additionally, stories focusing on Arnold's school life (featured occasionally in many previous seasons) were delved into much more. The ratings did not improve to NBC's hopes. Carter departed at the end of the seventh season and was replaced in the final season with Mobley.\n\n===Season 8 (1985-1986)===\nIn the spring of 1985, NBC canceled the series because of poor ratings. ABC picked up the series for an eighth season and aired it Friday nights. In this season, Mobley replaced Carter as Maggie McKinney Drummond. Mobley, who had previously played an unrelated, one-off love interest of Drummond's in the second-season episode \"Teacher's Pet,\" was considered for Maggie when the role was created, but she was not initially chosen in part due to age disparity between her and Bain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y_9aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3384,3850530&dq=mary-ann-mobley+diff-rent-strokes&hl=en|title=The Durant Daily Democrat \u2013 Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> ABC canceled the series after 19 episodes and aired its final episode on March 7, 1986. The show returned to ABC's schedule in June for three months of summer reruns, which ended on August 30, 1986. The final season ranked 76th out of 106 shows and averaged an 11.5 household rating.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Diff'rent Strokes characters}}\n<!-- Please note: The years next to the name of an actor or actress are those of appearance on the show only! -->\n* [[Conrad Bain]] as Phillip Drummond\n* [[Gary Coleman]] as Arnold Jackson\n* [[Todd Bridges]] as Willis Jackson\n* [[Dana Plato]] as Kimberly Drummond (1978\u201384, 1985\u201386 recurring)\n* [[Charlotte Rae]] as Edna Garrett (1978\u201379)\n* [[Nedra Volz]] as Adelaide Brubaker (1980\u201384)\n* [[Janet Jackson]] as Charlene DuPrey (1980\u201384 recurring)\n* [[Dody Goodman]] as Sophia Drummond (1981\u201384 recurring)\n* [[Shavar Ross]] as Dudley Johnson (1980\u201386 recurring)\n* [[Le Tari]] as Ted Ramsey (1980\u201384 recurring)\n* [[Mary Jo Catlett]] as Pearl Gallagher (1982\u201386)\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Miss Chung (1981\u201383 recurring)\n* [[Steven Mond]] as Robbie Jason (1980\u201385 recurring)\n* [[Dixie Carter]] as Maggie McKinney Drummond #1 (1984\u201385)\n* [[Mary Ann Mobley]] as Maggie McKinney Drummond #2 (1985\u201386) and as Ms. Osbourne \n* [[Danny Cooksey]] as Sam McKinney (1984\u201386)\n* [[Jason Hervey]] as Charlie (1985\u201386 recurring)\n* Nikki Swasey as Lisa Hayes (1982\u201386 recurring)\n\nPhillip Drummond is the only character to appear in every episode of the series. Arnold Jackson missed five episodes, two from the fourth season in 1981-82 (\u201cFirst Day Blues\" and \"The Team\") and three from the seventh season in 1984\u201385 (\"The Gymnasts\", \"Sam Adopts a Grandparent\" and \"Baseball Blues\").\n\n===Supporting characters===\nOutside of the Drummond household, there were a large number of supporting characters seen over the years. Phillip's slightly dotty sister Sophia ([[Dody Goodman]]) was regularly seen in the fourth season, playing matchmaker for her brother in hopes of getting Philip to marry again. Dudley Johnson ([[Shavar Ross]]) was Arnold's new best friend, who, like Arnold, was also adopted, with whom he shared many memorable childhood scrapes. Some of these were important or serious storylines under the \"very special episode\" heading, which ''Diff'rent Strokes'' popularized (see below). Ted Ramsey ([[Le Tari]]) was Dudley's adoptive father, who turned up occasionally. In the third season, [[Janet Jackson]] played Willis' girlfriend, Charlene DuPrey. She was a frequent recurring character until the sixth season, when Charlene and Willis decided to [[break up]], but remain friends. Other classmates and friends of Arnold seen over time included Robbie Jason ([[Steven Mond]]) and snobby Lisa Hayes (Nikki Swasey), who initially was sweet on Arnold, but later came to despise him, leading to hatred between the pair and many squabbles. Miss Chung ([[Rosalind Chao]]) was Arnold's teacher. In the fall of 1985, when the series moved to ABC for the seventh season, Arnold, Dudley and Lisa entered high school, where they gained a new friend in Charlie ([[Jason Hervey]]). An oft-mentioned character, spanning the entire show's run, was \"The Gooch,\" a notorious bully at Arnold's school. First mentioned in the first-season episode \"The Fight,\" which revolves around his bullying of Arnold, his name is mentioned in numerous episodes (and his bullying of Arnold returned as the center of several plots), with Arnold's frequent descriptions of him as a burly, troublesome brute, forever looking for trouble but not very intelligent, but the character never actually appeared on screen. In the seventh season, after years of harassing Arnold (and later Sam), the Gooch was finally defeated by Arnold's neighbor and nemesis Carmella, a [[Foreign exchange student]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Diff'rent Strokes episodes}}\n{{:List of Diff'rent Strokes episodes}}\n\n===Very special episodes===\n[[File:Nancyreagandiffrentstrokes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nancy Reagan on the set of ''Diff'rent Strokes'']]\n''Diff'rent Strokes'' was also known for its many \"very special episodes,\" most notably an anti-drug episode (\"The Reporter\") that featured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]], who promoted her \"[[Just Say No]]\" campaign and \"[[The Bicycle Man]],\" a two-part episode that guest starred [[Gordon Jump]] as a [[pedophilia|pedophile]] who lures Arnold and Dudley into his bicycle shop and attempts to [[child molestation|molest]] them. Another episode involved a [[con artist]] (played by [[Whitman Mayo]]) posing as a relative of Arnold and Willis in an attempt to get access to the inheritance they were left by a former neighbor. Another episode (\"Skin Deep or True Blue\") involved Kimberly's new boyfriend, Roger Morehouse, not allowing his sister, Emily ([[Melora Hardin]]), to go to their school's costume ball with Willis because he is black. A less serious episode (\"Green Hair\") had Kimberly's hair turning green from acid rain. In a two-part episode on the dangers of [[hitchhiking]] (\"The Hitchhikers\"), Kimberly and Arnold (who were out in the cold weather and didn't have money for cab or bus fare) were abducted by a serial kidnapper-rapist (played by Woody Eney), who initially acted as a good Samaritan by giving the two of them a ride and inviting them to his apartment. After the man's true nature became known, Arnold escaped to look for help and the man nearly raped Kimberly before the police arrived to arrest him. At the end of the episode, Bain (in an out-of-character [[Public Service Announcement|PSA]]) spoke about what to do if real life situations as the one portrayed on the show were to occur. Two notable episodes dealt with the consequences of [[alcoholism]]. In the first, season 5's \"A Drinking Problem,\" Willis moves out of the penthouse to live with Jerry ([[Lawrence Monoson]]) who abuses alcohol. In the second, season 7's \"Cheers to Arnold,\" Arnold must deal with Ricky ([[Robert Jayne]]), a classmate whom he catches drinking a thermos of alcohol in the school bathroom. In the final season (when the sitcom moved from NBC to ABC), the one-hour season opener (\"Sam's Missing\") revolved around Sam being kidnapped by Donald Brown ([[Royce D. Applegate]]), a bereaved father hoping to replace his own dead son, Tommy. In other notable episodes, such as season 8's \"Bulimia,\" the family discovered that Kimberly was suffering from [[bulimia]]. In another episode, season 7's \"A Special Friend,\" Arnold and Sam met Karen, a [[street performer]]. After a performance, she has an [[Epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure and Sam thinks she's dying. The boys then feel uncomfortable around her and when they begin making jokes about her seizures, they find out that housekeeper Pearl herself has epilepsy but, unlike Karen, controls her seizures by taking medication.\n\n===Spin-off and crossovers===\n''The Facts of Life'' (1979-1988) is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Diff'rent Strokes'' featuring Drummond's former maid Mrs. Garrett, who had accepted a job as the housemother for a dormitory at Eastland, an all-girls private school that Kimberly was attending. In a late first-season episode of ''Strokes'' (\"The Girls School,\" which served as the \"[[backdoor pilot]]\" of ''Facts''), Mrs. Garrett took Kimberly to the school with the intent of helping her sew costumes for a school play. While there, Mrs. Garrett met Kimberly's classmates and was offered the job as \"dorm mother.\" She declines in this episode, but come fall, clearly had a change of heart. The ''Diff'rent Strokes'' cast appeared in the first episode of ''The Facts of Life'' (at one point, Drummond asks Mrs. Garrett \"Are you sure we can't change your mind to come back to us?\"). The success of the spin-off led to several ''Strokes''/''Facts'' crossovers in the ensuing years. While not a spin-off, ''[[Hello, Larry]]'' (1979-1980) had a connection to ''Strokes'' as it was established in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover episode]] that Philip Drummond and Larry Alder ([[McLean Stevenson]]) were old Army buddies and Mr. Drummond had bought the company that owned the radio station where Larry worked as a talk show host. The episode \"Almost American\" (A.K.A. \"Night School\"), was the pilot for a potential spin-off series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Almost American |url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0559935/ |agency=[[IMDb]] |date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, Arnold appeared on the ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' episode \"The Great Computer Caper\" and the ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'' episode \"Remote Control Man.\"\n\n===Later appearances as the characters===\nIn 1994, Coleman appeared in an episode of ''[[Married... with Children]]'' (\"How Green Was My Apple\"), playing a building code inspector whom [[Al Bundy]] ([[Ed O'Neill]]) called to report an illegal driveway. When Kelly ([[Christina Applegate]]) recognizes him, he denies any connection to Arnold Jackson, but utters his catchphrase to Al, \"What'chu talkin' about, Bundy?\" In 1996, Coleman and Bain reprised their roles for the series finale of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' entitled \"I, Done Part II,\" where they consider buying the Banks mansion, they reference Willis by name before meeting Will Smith's character, leading to Coleman uttering a variation of his catchphrase, \"What'chu talkin' about, Will?\"\n\n===Additional catchphrase references and appearances in popular culture===\nIn 2004, Coleman appeared on the [[The Surreal Life#Season 2|second season]] of ''[[The Surreal Life]]'' and was pressured to quote his famous [[catchphrase]] by [[Vanilla Ice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ron-jeremy-gary-coleman-hated-saying-whatchu-talkin-bout-line-2010305|title=Ron Jeremy: Gary Coleman Hated Saying \"Whatchu Talkin' Bout\" Line|date=30 May 2010|work=US Magazine|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/05/28/vanilla-ice-gary-coleman-death/|title=Vanilla Ice \u2013 I'm Going to Gary Coleman's Memorial|work=tmz.com|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> He also guest-starred as himself on ''[[The Wayans Bros.]],'' ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]],'' ''[[Drake & Josh]],'' ''[[The Jamie Foxx Show]],'' ''[[The Parkers]],'' ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]].''\n\n==After ''Diff'rent Strokes'' ended==\nFollowing the cancellation of ''Diff'rent Strokes'' in 1986, Coleman, Bridges and Plato encountered difficulty in obtaining acting jobs. All three experienced various legal problems while Bridges and Plato also struggled with drug addictions, all of which were documented in the press. The press and fans of the series blamed the cast's personal problems and faltering careers on what was eventually dubbed the \"curse of ''Diff'rent Strokes''\" by various tabloids.<ref name=\"sporkin\">{{cite journal|last=Sporkin|first=Elizabeth|date=March 25, 1991|title=Diff'rent Strokes, Fallen Stars|journal=People|volume=35|issue=11|issn=0093-7673|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114736,00.html}}</ref>\n\n===Gary Coleman===\n{{main|Gary Coleman}} \nIn 1989, three years after the series ended, Coleman sued his parents and his former manager over misappropriation of his trust fund.

In 1998, Coleman was charged with assault after he punched a woman while working as a security guard at a shopping mall.

Due to financial difficulties and her growing addiction to drugs and alcohol, Plato relinquished custody of her son, Tyler, to Lambert. In an attempt to boost her faltering career, Plato posed for ''[[Playboy]]'' in June 1989, but her appearance in the magazine did not help her land acting jobs.<ref name=\"sporkin\" /> By 1990, Plato was living in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

It was originally termed for the [[Proto-prog|early progressive rock of the 1960s]]. Some stylistic features of progressive pop include changes in [[key (music)|key]] and [[rhythm]], experiments with larger [[musical form|forms]], and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions.\n\nThe movement started as a byproduct of the mid 1960s economic boom, when record labels began investing in artists and allowing performers limited control over their own content and marketing. Groups who combined [[rock and roll]] with various other music styles such as Indian [[raga]]s and [[Music of Asia|oriental]] melodies ultimately influenced the creation of progressive rock (or \"prog\"). When prog records began declining in sales, some artists returned to a more accessible sound that remained commercially appealing until the 1990s. \n\n{{toclimit|4}}\n\n==Definition and scope==\n{{Details|Progressive music|Pop music#Characteristics}}\n{{See also|Progressive rock}}\n\nThe term \"progressive\" refers to the wide range of attempts to break with standard pop music formulas through methods such as extended instrumentation, personalized lyrics, and individual [[musical improvisation|improvisation]].{{sfn|Haworth|Smith|1975|p=126}} Its initial premise involved [[popular music]] that was created with the intention of listening, not [[dance music|dancing]], and opposed the influence of managers, agents, or record companies.{{sfn|Shepherd|Virden|Vulliamy|1977|pp=187\u2013188}} In general, progressive music was produced by the performing artists themselves.{{sfn|Shepherd|Virden|Vulliamy|1977|pp=186\u2013188}}\n\nSimilar to [[rock and roll]], the tonal structure of progressive pop overthrows harmony as its basic organizing structure. However, unlike rock and roll, progressive pop inverts received conventions, playing with them ironically, disrupting them, or producing shadows of them in new and unexpected forms.{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=220}}  Some stylistic features include changes in [[key (music)|key]] and [[rhythm]] or experiments with larger forms.{{sfn|Palmberg|Baaz|2001|p=49}}{{refn|group=nb|''The Songwriting Sourebook'' (2003) states that key changes are more common to \"arty\" genres like [[progressive rock]] than they are to Top 40 pop songs, slow [[reggae]] tunes, [[dance music]], [[R&B]], [[punk music|punk]], [[12-bar blues]], and 1950s [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Roberts|Rooksby|2003|p=137}}}} Electronic techniques such as echo, feedback, stereo, loudness, and distortion may be used to give the music the impression of space and lateral extension.{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=220}}\n\n===Early uses===\n\"Progressive pop\" was originally termed for [[progressive rock]] music.{{sfn|Moore|2004|p=22}} The latter genre was influenced by the \"progressive\" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian [[raga]]s, [[Music of Asia|oriental]] melodies, and [[Gregorian chant]]s, like [[the Beatles]] and [[the Yardbirds]].{{sfn|Prown|Newquist|1997|p=78}}{{refn|group=nb|Among exemplar progressive pop music of this period, Paul Willis cites [[Frank Zappa]]'s disuse of ordinary conventions and tone (\"[[Uncle Meat]])\", [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s \"untempered\" guitar, the Beatles' use of intrumentation as a type of rhythm (\"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\", \"Penny Lane\"), and [[Van Morrison]]'s unusual, repeated cadences that make up the rhythm foundation for \"[[Madame George]]\".{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=220}}}} In December 1966, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' attempted to define the recent developments in pop. In this article, titled \"Progressive Pop\", [[Chris Welch]] categorised artists using terms previously associated with [[jazz]]; in the most advanced of these, \"Avant-Garde\", he placed the Beatles, [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Love (band)|Love]], [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Soft Machine]], while \"Modern\", the next category, comprised [[the Byrds]], [[Donovan]] and [[the Small Faces]].{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=606\u2013607}}  After the release of the Beatles' 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', magazines such as ''Melody Maker'' drew a sharp line between \"pop\" and \"rock\", thus eliminating the \"roll\" from \"[[rock and roll]]\" (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained \"rock\" would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from \"radio friendly\" standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective \"progressive\" for groups like [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Family (band)|Family]], [[East of Eden (band)|East of Eden]], [[Van der Graaf Generator]], and [[King Crimson]].{{sfn|Zoppo|2014|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}}}}\n\nIn 1970, a ''Melody Maker'' journalist described progressive pop as music appealing to the masses, but less disposable than the \"six weeks in the charts and the 'forget it' music of older pop forms.\"{{sfn|Jacobshagen|Leniger|Henn|2007|p=141}} By the late 1970s, \"progressive pop\" was roughly synonymous with \"[[rock music]]\".{{sfn|Shepherd|Virden|Vulliamy|1977|p=201}} Authors Don and Jeff Breithaupt define progressive pop in the 1970s and 1980s as a \"leaner breed of [[pomp rock]]\" that was derivative of the Beatles.{{sfn|Breithaupt|Breithaupt|2000|p=68}} Producer [[Alan Parsons]], who worked as an engineer on the Beatles' album ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969),{{sfn|Breithaupt|Breithaupt|2000|p=70}} remembered that even though he considered some of his songs \"pure pop\", others continued to categorize his band ([[the Alan Parsons Project]]) under the \"progressive rock\" label. Parsons thought \"progressive pop\" was a better name, explaining that \"what made [our music] progressive was the epic sound and the orchestration which very few people were doing that at the time.\"<ref name=\"APP15\">{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Rich|title=Alan Parsons Project: \"I think we were part of the punk rebellion\"|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2015-11-25/alan-parsons-project-i-think-we-were-part-of-the-punk-rebellion|website=Team Rock|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution and popularity==\n\n===1960s: Origins{{anchor|Origins}}===\n{{See also|Proto-prog}}\n\n[[File: Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|thumb| [[The Beatles]] working in the studio with their producer [[George Martin]], circa 1964]]\nDuring the mid 1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners.

Now, of course, with jaded memories, we think of it as ushering in an era of pomposity, with varying degrees of seriousness&nbsp;... The question after 1967 was whether 'progressive' pop/rock was to be trusted, because it was dealing with issues 'deeper' than simply interpersonal relationships. In the long run, the answer turned out to be 'no' (at least, that is, until a later generation of bands discovered the delight of pastiching the Beatles).\"{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=70}}\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, progressive pop music was received with doubt{{sfn|Heylin|2012|p=40}} and disinterest.{{sfn|Lenig|2010|p=34}} The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] reflected that \"a lot of psychedelic bullshit was going on\", referring to \"garbage\" being promoted in the charts, and that many artists who were doing ambitious works were instantly being labelled \"pretentious\".

offshoot of the [[progressive rock]] genre that was commonly heard on [[AM radio]] in the 1970s and 1980s. It was originally termed for the [[Proto-prog|early progressive rock of the 1960s]]. Some stylistic features of progressive pop include changes in [[key (music)|key]] and [[rhythm]], experiments with larger [[musical form|forms]], and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions.\n\nThe movement started as a byproduct of the mid 1960s economic boom, when record labels began investing in artists and allowing performers limited control over their own content and marketing. Groups who combined [[rock and roll]] with various other music styles such as Indian [[raga]]s and [[Music of Asia|oriental]] melodies ultimately influenced the creation of progressive rock (or \"prog\"). When prog records began declining in sales, some artists returned to a more accessible sound that remained commercially appealing until the 1990s. \n\n{{toclimit|4}}\n\n==Definition and scope==\n{{Details|Progressive music|Pop music#Characteristics}}\n{{See also|Progressive rock}}\n\nThe term \"progressive\" refers to the wide range of attempts to break with standard pop music formulas through methods such as extended instrumentation, personalized lyrics, and individual [[musical improvisation|improvisation]].{{sfn|Haworth|Smith|1975|p=126}} Its initial premise involved [[popular music]] that was created with the intention of listening, not [[dance music|dancing]], and opposed the influence of managers, agents, or record companies.{{sfn|Shepherd|Virden|Vulliamy|1977|pp=187\u2013188}} In general, progressive music was produced by the performing artists themselves.{{sfn|Shepherd|Virden|Vulliamy|1977|pp=186\u2013188}}\n\nSimilar to [[rock and roll]], the tonal structure of progressive pop overthrows harmony as its basic organizing structure. However, unlike rock and roll, progressive pop inverts received conventions, playing with them ironically, disrupting them, or producing shadows of them in new and unexpected forms.{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=220}}  Some stylistic features include changes in [[key (music)|key]] and [[rhythm]] or experiments with larger forms.{{sfn|Palmberg|Baaz|2001|p=49}}{{refn|group=nb|''The Songwriting Sourebook'' (2003) states that key changes are more common to \"arty\" genres like [[progressive rock]] than they are to Top 40 pop songs, slow [[reggae]] tunes, [[dance music]], [[R&B]], [[punk music|punk]], [[12-bar blues]], and 1950s [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Roberts|Rooksby|2003|p=137}}}} Electronic techniques such as echo, feedback, stereo, loudness, and distortion may be used to give the music the impression of space and lateral extension.{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=220}}\n\n===Early uses===\n\"Progressive pop\" was originally termed for [[progressive rock]] music.{{sfn|Moore|2004|p=22}} The latter genre was influenced by the \"progressive\" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian [[raga]]s, [[Music of Asia|oriental]] melodies, and [[Gregorian chant]]s, like [[the Beatles]] and [[the Yardbirds]].{{sfn|Prown|Newquist|1997|p=78}}{{refn|group=nb|Among exemplar progressive pop music of this period, Paul Willis cites [[Frank Zappa]]'s disuse of ordinary conventions and tone (\"[[Uncle Meat]])\", [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s \"untempered\" guitar, the Beatles' use of intrumentation as a type of rhythm (\"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\", \"Penny Lane\"), and [[Van Morrison]]'s unusual, repeated cadences that make up the rhythm foundation for \"[[Madame George]]\".{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=220}}}} In December 1966, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' attempted to define the recent developments in pop. In this article, titled \"Progressive Pop\", [[Chris Welch]] categorised artists using terms previously associated with [[jazz]]; in the most advanced of these, \"Avant-Garde\", he placed the Beatles, [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Love (band)|Love]], [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Soft Machine]], while \"Modern\", the next category, comprised [[the Byrds]], [[Donovan]] and [[the Small Faces]].{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=606\u2013607}}  After the release of the Beatles' 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', magazines such as ''Melody Maker'' drew a sharp line between \"pop\" and \"rock\", thus eliminating the \"roll\" from \"[[rock and roll]]\" (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained \"rock\" would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from \"radio friendly\" standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective \"progressive\" for groups like [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Family (band)|Family]], [[East of Eden (band)|East of Eden]], [[Van der Graaf Generator]], and [[King Crimson]].{{sfn|Zoppo|2014|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}}}}\n\nIn 1970, a ''Melody Maker'' journalist described progressive pop as music appealing to the masses, but less disposable than the \"six weeks in the charts and the 'forget it' music of older pop forms.\"{{sfn|Jacobshagen|Leniger|Henn|2007|p=141}} By the late 1970s, \"progressive pop\" was roughly synonymous with \"[[rock music]]\".{{sfn|Shepherd|Virden|Vulliamy|1977|p=201}} Authors Don and Jeff Breithaupt define progressive pop in the 1970s and 1980s as a \"leaner breed of [[pomp rock]]\" that was derivative of the Beatles.{{sfn|Breithaupt|Breithaupt|2000|p=68}} Producer [[Alan Parsons]], who worked as an engineer on the Beatles' album ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969),{{sfn|Breithaupt|Breithaupt|2000|p=70}} remembered that even though he considered some of his songs \"pure pop\", others continued to categorize his band ([[the Alan Parsons Project]]) under the \"progressive rock\" label. Parsons thought \"progressive pop\" was a better name, explaining that \"what made [our music] progressive was the epic sound and the orchestration which very few people were doing that at the time.\"<ref name=\"APP15\">{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Rich|title=Alan Parsons Project: \"I think we were part of the punk rebellion\"|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2015-11-25/alan-parsons-project-i-think-we-were-part-of-the-punk-rebellion|website=Team Rock|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution and popularity==\n\n===1960s: Origins{{anchor|Origins}}===\n{{See also|Proto-prog}}\n\n[[File: Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|thumb| [[The Beatles]] working in the studio with their producer [[George Martin]], circa 1964]]\nDuring the mid 1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners.

Now, of course, with jaded memories, we think of it as ushering in an era of pomposity, with varying degrees of seriousness&nbsp;... The question after 1967 was whether 'progressive' pop/rock was to be trusted, because it was dealing with issues 'deeper' than simply interpersonal relationships. In the long run, the answer turned out to be 'no' (at least, that is, until a later generation of bands discovered the delight of pastiching the Beatles).\"{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=70}}\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, progressive pop music was received with doubt{{sfn|Heylin|2012|p=40}} and disinterest.{{sfn|Lenig|2010|p=34}} The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] reflected that \"a lot of psychedelic bullshit was going on\", referring to \"garbage\" being promoted in the charts, and that many artists who were doing ambitious works were instantly being labelled \"pretentious\". He believed: \"Anybody that was any good&nbsp;... was more or less becoming insignificant again.\"{{sfn|Heylin|2012|pp=40\u201341}} In 1969, writer [[Nik Cohn]] reported that the pop music industry had been split \"roughly eighty percent ugly and twenty percent idealist\", with the eighty percent being \"mainline pop\" and the twenty percent being \"progressive pop [developed to] an esoteric feel\". He predicted that in ten years, the genre would be called by another name (possibly \"electric music\"), and that its relationship to pop music would be similar to the one between [[art movie]]s and [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|Cohn|1970|p=242}} While progressive pop did not \"shrink to a minority cult\", as Cohn wrote one year later, \"in England, I wasn't entirely wrong&nbsp;...

He is widely recognized as one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz, playing an important role in the development of [[cool jazz]], [[modal jazz]], [[free jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]]. He is best known for his acclaimed collaborations with [[Miles Davis]].<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=gil-evans-mn0000551815|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gil Evans Biography|author=[[Scott Yanow|Yanow, Scott]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGil Evans was born to Ian Ernest Green and Margaret Julia McConnachy on May 13, 1912. Originally named Ian Ernest Gilmore Green, he would eventually change his name from Green to Evans, taking the name of his step-father, John Evans. His father was a doctor and his mother was a homemaker and he had two siblings, Jean and Montgomery.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nFrom a young age, Evans moved many times; from his birthplace in Toronto to western Canada, then to Washington State before finally settling in [[Stockton, California]]. He graduated from [[Stockton High School (California)|Stockton High School]] and [[Modesto Junior College]]. Evans remained a Canadian citizen until he entered the US Army during the second World War. After 1946, he lived and worked primarily in [[New York City]], living for many years at [[Westbeth Artists Community]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/>\n\n==Career==\nBetween 1941 and 1948, Evans worked as an arranger for the [[Claude Thornhill]] Orchestra.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=441/2}}</ref> Even then, early in his career, his arrangements were such  a challenge to musicians that bassist Bill Crow recalled that bandleader Thornhill would bring out Evans\u2019s arrangements \"when he wanted to punish the band.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gil-Evans|title=Gil Evans Canadian composer|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref> Evans' modest basement apartment behind a New York City Chinese laundry soon became a meeting place for musicians looking to develop new musical styles outside of the dominant [[bebop]] style of the day. Those present included the leading bebop performer, [[Charlie Parker]], as well as [[Gerry Mulligan]] and [[John Carisi]]. In 1948, Evans, with [[Miles Davis]], Mulligan, and others, collaborated on a band book for a nonet.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> These ensembles, larger than the trio-to-quintet \"combos\", but smaller than the \"big bands\" which were on the brink of economic unviability, allowed arrangers to have a larger palette of colors by using [[French horn in Jazz|French horns]] and [[tuba]]. [[Claude Thornhill]] had employed hornist [[John Graas]] in 1942, and composer-arranger [[Bob Graettinger]] had scored for horns and tubas with the [[Stan Kenton]] orchestra, but the \"Kenton sound\" was in the context of a dense orchestral wall of sound that Evans avoided.\n\nThe Miles Davis-led group was booked for a week at the \"[[Royal Roost]]\" as an intermission group on the bill with the [[Count Basie]] Orchestra. [[Capitol Records]] recorded 12 numbers by the nonet at three sessions in 1949 and 1950. These recordings were reissued on a 1957 Miles Davis LP titled ''[[Birth of the Cool]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nLater, while Davis was under contract with [[Columbia Records]], producer [[George Avakian]] suggested that Davis could work with any of several arrangers. Davis immediately chose Evans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/23/george-avakian-jazz-scholar-miles-davis-dies|title=George Avakian, jazz producer of Miles Davis and more, dies at 98|work=[[The Guardian]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 23, 2007|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref> The three albums that resulted from the collaboration are ''[[Miles Ahead (album)|Miles Ahead]]'' (1957), ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' (1958), and ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.jazziz.com/miles-davis-gil-evans-miles-ahead/|author=Brian Zimmerman|title=Miles Davis & Gil Evans \u2013 \u201cMiles Ahead\u201d|magazine=Jazziz|date=May 6, 2019}}</ref> Another collaboration from this period, ''[[Quiet Nights (Miles Davis and Gil Evans album)|Quiet Nights]]'' (1962) was issued later, against the wishes of Davis, who broke with his then-producer [[Teo Macero]] for a time as a result. Although these four records were marketed primarily under Davis's name (and credited to ''Miles Davis with Orchestra Under the Direction of Gil Evans''), Evans's contribution was as important as Davis's. Their work coupled Evans's classic [[big band]] jazz stylings and arrangements with Davis's solo playing. Evans also contributed behind the scenes to Davis' classic quintet albums of the 1960s.\n\nThe demands of the score for ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' were legendary, from the very first note for the lead trumpet. The limited time allotted for rehearsals revealed that the ability to read such a challenging score was not consistent among jazz musicians, and there are many audible errors. Yet the recording is now regarded by many as one of the greatest reinterpretations of [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]]'s music in any musical style, because Evans and Davis were each devoted to going outside the \"mainstream\" of commercial expectations for jazz musicians. Evans was a great influence on Davis's interest in \"non-jazz\" music, especially orchestral music. Unfortunately, Evans's orchestral scores from the ''Porgy and Bess'' sessions were later found to be incomplete (or simply lost), and [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Gil Goldstein]] attempted to reconstruct these for Miles Davis's final 1991 concerts at [[Montreux]], recorded as ''[[Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux]]''. Davis had relented after years of refusing to revisit this material, but he was clearly ill, recovering from [[pneumonia]], and trumpeter [[Wallace Roney]], who was mentored by Davis, covered many of the challenging passages. Davis died before the release of the album.\n\nFrom 1957 onwards, Evans recorded albums under his own name. Tubist [[Bill Barber (musician)|Bill Barber]] and trumpeter Louis Mucci from Thornhill's band were both stalwarts in Evans's early ensembles, with Mucci finding a spot on nearly every pre1980s Evans recording. Among the featured soloists on these records were [[Lee Konitz]], [[Jimmy Cleveland]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Johnny Coles]] and [[Cannonball Adderley]]. In 1965 he arranged the big band tracks on [[Kenny Burrell]]'s ''[[Guitar Forms]]'' album.\n\nEvans was influenced by Spanish composers [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]], and by other Latin and Brazilian music, as well as by German expatriate [[Kurt Weill]]. His arrangements of pieces already well known to some listeners from their original cabaret, concert hall or Broadway stage arrangements, revealed aspects of the music in a wholly original way. Sometimes in an unexpected contrast to the original atmosphere of the piece, and sometimes taking a dark ballad such as Weill's \"Barbara Song\" into an even darker place. The personnel list for ''[[The Individualism of Gil Evans]]'' (1964), not only features [[Bill Barber (musician)|Bill Barber]] and hornists [[James Buffington]] and [[Julius Watkins]] (along with two others), but each section features the cream of the younger (some more classically trained) musicians who were making their names in jazz. The presence of four of the most acclaimed young bassists ([[Richard Davis (bassist)|Richard Davis]], [[Paul Chambers]], [[Ron Carter]], and [[Ben Tucker]]) along with veteran [[Milt Hinton]] would ordinarily indicate that each is used individually for separate tracks, but Evans's scores usually required at least two bassists on any given track, some playing ''arco'' (with the bow) and some ''pizzicato'' (plucking with fingers, the standard jazz method). These arrangements frequently featured greatly slowed-down tempos with [[polyrhythmic]] percussion and no prevailing \"beat\". To his by-now standard French horns and tuba, Evans's scores added [[Alto flute|alto]] and [[bass flute]]s, [[double reed]]s, and [[harp]]; orchestral instruments not associated with \"swing\" bands, providing a larger pallette of orchestral colors, and allowing him to attain the ethereal quality heard in his arrangements during his Thornhill days.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He frequently wrote a part for the [[tenor violin]] of [[Harry Lookofsky]]. Yet, this album featured an orchestral arrangement of \"[[Spoonful]]\" by bluesman [[Willie Dixon]], an early indication of Evans's breadth and a hint of things to come.\n\nIn 1966, he recorded an album with Brazilian singer [[Astrud Gilberto]], ''[[Look to the Rainbow (Astrud Gilberto album)|Look to the Rainbow]]''.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=Gil Evans: Out of the Cool: His Life and Music|url=https://archive.org/details/gilevansoutofco00stei|url-access=registration|author=Crease, Stephanie Stein|publisher=A Capella Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gilevansoutofco00stei/page/362 362-366]|year=2002|isbn=1556529864}}</ref> He was discouraged by the commercial direction [[Verve Records]] was taking with the Gilberto sessions, and he went into a period of hiatus.\n\nDuring this period while he was somewhat depressed about the commercial and logistical difficulties of his previous scoring requirements, his wife suggested that he listen to the guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Evans developed a particular interest in the work of the rock guitarist. Evans gradually built another orchestra in the 1970s, with none of the coloration instruments from his past arrangements. Working in the [[free jazz]] and [[jazz-rock]] idioms, he gained a new generation of admirers. These ensembles, rarely more than fifteen and frequently smaller, allowed him to make more contributions on keyboards, and with the development of truly portable [[synthesizers]], he began using these to provide additional color.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Hendrix's 1970 death precluded a scheduled meeting with Evans to discuss having Hendrix collaborate with a big band led by Evans.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/2001/12/stephanie-stein-crease-author-of-gil-evans-out-of-the-cool/|title=Gil Evans: Out of the Cool: His Life and Music|author=Crease, Stephanie Stein|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1556524936}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, he released an album of his, and other band member's, arrangements of music by Hendrix with guitarists [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]] and [[Ryo Kawasaki]].<ref name=book/> From then on Evans's ensembles featured electric instruments, i.e. guitars, basses, and synthesizers including a collaboration with bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]]. In contrast to his intricate scores for large ensembles, which required precision orchestral playing accompanying a single soloist, his later arrangements would feature more unison playing by the entire ensemble, such as on Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\", with improvisational touches added throughout by the musicians.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Live recordings demonstrate that some entire pieces were collaborative efforts, and Evans can be heard giving cues from the keyboard (behind the band) to guide the band. Before the 1970s, his keyboard playing was generally sparse on recordings but after the 1970s he took a more active role in the rhythm section of the band.\n\n''[[Where Flamingos Fly]]'' (recorded 1971, released 1981) demonstrated his ability to contract the most accomplished musicians, with veterans Coles, [[Harry Lookofsky]], [[Richard Davis (double bassist)|Richard Davis]] and [[Jimmy Knepper]] (who played the solo on the \"Where Flamingos Fly\" track on 1961's ''[[Out of the Cool]]'') alongside young multi-instrumentalist [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], synthesizer player [[Don Preston]] (at that time still a member of [[The Mothers of Invention]]), and [[Billy Harper]].\n\nIn April 1983, the Gil Evans Orchestra was booked into the [[Sweet Basil Jazz Club]] ([[Greenwich Village]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) by jazz producer and Sweet Basil owner [[Horst Liepolt]]. This turned out to be a regular Monday night engagement for Evans for nearly five years and also resulted in the release of a number of successful albums by ''Gil Evans and the Monday Night Orchestra''.<ref name=aaj>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/hidden-treasures-vol-1-monday-nights-the-gil-evans-orchestra-bopper-spock-suns-music-review-by-jerome-wilson.php|author=Jerome Wilson|title=The Gil Evans Orchestra: Hidden Treasures Vol. 1, Monday Nights|website=All About Jazz|date=December 31, 2018|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Nakayama |first=Yasuki |date=2018 |title=\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u4e2d\u5c71\u5eb7\u6a39 |trans-title=Yasuki Nakayama in \"Swing Journal\" era |url= |language=Japanese |location=Tokyo, Japan |publisher=Shinko Music Entertainment |chapter=\u30ae\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30fb\u30bb\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 |trans-chapter=Gil Evans' Monday night sessions |pages=68-78 |isbn=}}</ref> Evans's ensemble featured many of the top-call musicians in New York, many of whom were also in the [[NBC]] [[Saturday Night Live Band]] and there were many conflicts, so their \"deputies\" for the night might be other world-class musicians. Yet Evans was also known to let newcomers \"sit in\" occasionally. The band also performed arrangements by band members, current and past. Stalwarts in this ensemble were [[Lew Soloff]], [[Alan Rubin]], [[Marvin Peterson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom \"Bones\" Malone]], [[George Adams (musician)]], [[David Sanborn]], [[Hiram Bullock]], Mark Eagan, drummer Kenwood Dennard, saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] (no relation) and Gil Goldstein. In 1987, Evans recorded a live album with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], featuring big band arrangements of songs by and with [[The Police]]. In the same spirit of introducing new talent in his bands, he collaborated with [[Maria Schneider (musician)|Maria Schneider]] with her as an apprentice arranger on this and other final projects. His final project was Nov. 3 & 26, 1987, his arrangements for the Laurent Cugny Big Band in Paris, on the recording \u201cGolden Hair\u201d on Emarcy/Polygram.\n\n===Ryan Truesdell presents the Gil Evans Project===\n[[Ryan Truesdell]] [[:de:Ryan Truesdell|(de)]] began the Gil Evans Project, which resulted in a 2012 CD entitled ''Centennial'', featuring previously unrecorded compositions and arrangements. These were produced with the permission of the Gil Evans estate, who gave Truesdell access to these scores and materials. Miles Evans, Gil's son, also led the Gil Evans Orchestra for a centennial concert at New York's [[Highline Ballroom]], featuring many of the musicians heard in the orchestra during Evans's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/ryan-truesdell-the-gil-evans-project-ryan-truesdell-by-victor-l-schermer.php|title=Ryan Truesdell: The Gil Evans Project|author=Victor L.

Very little is known about this marriage. In 1963, he would marry again. Evans was survived by his second wife Anita (Cooper) and two children, Noah and Miles.

He is widely recognized as one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz, playing an important role in the development of [[cool jazz]], [[modal jazz]], [[free jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]]. He is best known for his acclaimed collaborations with [[Miles Davis]].<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=gil-evans-mn0000551815|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gil Evans Biography|author=[[Scott Yanow|Yanow, Scott]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGil Evans was born to Ian Ernest Green and Margaret Julia McConnachy on May 13, 1912. Originally named Ian Ernest Gilmore Green, he would eventually change his name from Green to Evans, taking the name of his step-father, John Evans. His father was a doctor and his mother was a homemaker and he had two siblings, Jean and Montgomery.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nFrom a young age, Evans moved many times; from his birthplace in Toronto to western Canada, then to Washington State before finally settling in [[Stockton, California]]. He graduated from [[Stockton High School (California)|Stockton High School]] and [[Modesto Junior College]]. Evans remained a Canadian citizen until he entered the US Army during the second World War. After 1946, he lived and worked primarily in [[New York City]], living for many years at [[Westbeth Artists Community]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/>\n\n==Career==\nBetween 1941 and 1948, Evans worked as an arranger for the [[Claude Thornhill]] Orchestra.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=441/2}}</ref> Even then, early in his career, his arrangements were such  a challenge to musicians that bassist Bill Crow recalled that bandleader Thornhill would bring out Evans\u2019s arrangements \"when he wanted to punish the band.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gil-Evans|title=Gil Evans Canadian composer|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref> Evans' modest basement apartment behind a New York City Chinese laundry soon became a meeting place for musicians looking to develop new musical styles outside of the dominant [[bebop]] style of the day. Those present included the leading bebop performer, [[Charlie Parker]], as well as [[Gerry Mulligan]] and [[John Carisi]]. In 1948, Evans, with [[Miles Davis]], Mulligan, and others, collaborated on a band book for a nonet.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> These ensembles, larger than the trio-to-quintet \"combos\", but smaller than the \"big bands\" which were on the brink of economic unviability, allowed arrangers to have a larger palette of colors by using [[French horn in Jazz|French horns]] and [[tuba]]. [[Claude Thornhill]] had employed hornist [[John Graas]] in 1942, and composer-arranger [[Bob Graettinger]] had scored for horns and tubas with the [[Stan Kenton]] orchestra, but the \"Kenton sound\" was in the context of a dense orchestral wall of sound that Evans avoided.\n\nThe Miles Davis-led group was booked for a week at the \"[[Royal Roost]]\" as an intermission group on the bill with the [[Count Basie]] Orchestra. [[Capitol Records]] recorded 12 numbers by the nonet at three sessions in 1949 and 1950. These recordings were reissued on a 1957 Miles Davis LP titled ''[[Birth of the Cool]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nLater, while Davis was under contract with [[Columbia Records]], producer [[George Avakian]] suggested that Davis could work with any of several arrangers. Davis immediately chose Evans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/23/george-avakian-jazz-scholar-miles-davis-dies|title=George Avakian, jazz producer of Miles Davis and more, dies at 98|work=[[The Guardian]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 23, 2007|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref> The three albums that resulted from the collaboration are ''[[Miles Ahead (album)|Miles Ahead]]'' (1957), ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' (1958), and ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.jazziz.com/miles-davis-gil-evans-miles-ahead/|author=Brian Zimmerman|title=Miles Davis & Gil Evans \u2013 \u201cMiles Ahead\u201d|magazine=Jazziz|date=May 6, 2019}}</ref> Another collaboration from this period, ''[[Quiet Nights (Miles Davis and Gil Evans album)|Quiet Nights]]'' (1962) was issued later, against the wishes of Davis, who broke with his then-producer [[Teo Macero]] for a time as a result. Although these four records were marketed primarily under Davis's name (and credited to ''Miles Davis with Orchestra Under the Direction of Gil Evans''), Evans's contribution was as important as Davis's. Their work coupled Evans's classic [[big band]] jazz stylings and arrangements with Davis's solo playing. Evans also contributed behind the scenes to Davis' classic quintet albums of the 1960s.\n\nThe demands of the score for ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' were legendary, from the very first note for the lead trumpet. The limited time allotted for rehearsals revealed that the ability to read such a challenging score was not consistent among jazz musicians, and there are many audible errors. Yet the recording is now regarded by many as one of the greatest reinterpretations of [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]]'s music in any musical style, because Evans and Davis were each devoted to going outside the \"mainstream\" of commercial expectations for jazz musicians. Evans was a great influence on Davis's interest in \"non-jazz\" music, especially orchestral music. Unfortunately, Evans's orchestral scores from the ''Porgy and Bess'' sessions were later found to be incomplete (or simply lost), and [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Gil Goldstein]] attempted to reconstruct these for Miles Davis's final 1991 concerts at [[Montreux]], recorded as ''[[Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux]]''. Davis had relented after years of refusing to revisit this material, but he was clearly ill, recovering from [[pneumonia]], and trumpeter [[Wallace Roney]], who was mentored by Davis, covered many of the challenging passages. Davis died before the release of the album.\n\nFrom 1957 onwards, Evans recorded albums under his own name. Tubist [[Bill Barber (musician)|Bill Barber]] and trumpeter Louis Mucci from Thornhill's band were both stalwarts in Evans's early ensembles, with Mucci finding a spot on nearly every pre1980s Evans recording. Among the featured soloists on these records were [[Lee Konitz]], [[Jimmy Cleveland]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Johnny Coles]] and [[Cannonball Adderley]]. In 1965 he arranged the big band tracks on [[Kenny Burrell]]'s ''[[Guitar Forms]]'' album.\n\nEvans was influenced by Spanish composers [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]], and by other Latin and Brazilian music, as well as by German expatriate [[Kurt Weill]]. His arrangements of pieces already well known to some listeners from their original cabaret, concert hall or Broadway stage arrangements, revealed aspects of the music in a wholly original way. Sometimes in an unexpected contrast to the original atmosphere of the piece, and sometimes taking a dark ballad such as Weill's \"Barbara Song\" into an even darker place. The personnel list for ''[[The Individualism of Gil Evans]]'' (1964), not only features [[Bill Barber (musician)|Bill Barber]] and hornists [[James Buffington]] and [[Julius Watkins]] (along with two others), but each section features the cream of the younger (some more classically trained) musicians who were making their names in jazz. The presence of four of the most acclaimed young bassists ([[Richard Davis (bassist)|Richard Davis]], [[Paul Chambers]], [[Ron Carter]], and [[Ben Tucker]]) along with veteran [[Milt Hinton]] would ordinarily indicate that each is used individually for separate tracks, but Evans's scores usually required at least two bassists on any given track, some playing ''arco'' (with the bow) and some ''pizzicato'' (plucking with fingers, the standard jazz method). These arrangements frequently featured greatly slowed-down tempos with [[polyrhythmic]] percussion and no prevailing \"beat\". To his by-now standard French horns and tuba, Evans's scores added [[Alto flute|alto]] and [[bass flute]]s, [[double reed]]s, and [[harp]]; orchestral instruments not associated with \"swing\" bands, providing a larger pallette of orchestral colors, and allowing him to attain the ethereal quality heard in his arrangements during his Thornhill days.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He frequently wrote a part for the [[tenor violin]] of [[Harry Lookofsky]]. Yet, this album featured an orchestral arrangement of \"[[Spoonful]]\" by bluesman [[Willie Dixon]], an early indication of Evans's breadth and a hint of things to come.\n\nIn 1966, he recorded an album with Brazilian singer [[Astrud Gilberto]], ''[[Look to the Rainbow (Astrud Gilberto album)|Look to the Rainbow]]''.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=Gil Evans: Out of the Cool: His Life and Music|url=https://archive.org/details/gilevansoutofco00stei|url-access=registration|author=Crease, Stephanie Stein|publisher=A Capella Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gilevansoutofco00stei/page/362 362-366]|year=2002|isbn=1556529864}}</ref> He was discouraged by the commercial direction [[Verve Records]] was taking with the Gilberto sessions, and he went into a period of hiatus.\n\nDuring this period while he was somewhat depressed about the commercial and logistical difficulties of his previous scoring requirements, his wife suggested that he listen to the guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Evans developed a particular interest in the work of the rock guitarist. Evans gradually built another orchestra in the 1970s, with none of the coloration instruments from his past arrangements. Working in the [[free jazz]] and [[jazz-rock]] idioms, he gained a new generation of admirers. These ensembles, rarely more than fifteen and frequently smaller, allowed him to make more contributions on keyboards, and with the development of truly portable [[synthesizers]], he began using these to provide additional color.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Hendrix's 1970 death precluded a scheduled meeting with Evans to discuss having Hendrix collaborate with a big band led by Evans.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/2001/12/stephanie-stein-crease-author-of-gil-evans-out-of-the-cool/|title=Gil Evans: Out of the Cool: His Life and Music|author=Crease, Stephanie Stein|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1556524936}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, he released an album of his, and other band member's, arrangements of music by Hendrix with guitarists [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]] and [[Ryo Kawasaki]].<ref name=book/> From then on Evans's ensembles featured electric instruments, i.e. guitars, basses, and synthesizers including a collaboration with bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]]. In contrast to his intricate scores for large ensembles, which required precision orchestral playing accompanying a single soloist, his later arrangements would feature more unison playing by the entire ensemble, such as on Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\", with improvisational touches added throughout by the musicians.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Live recordings demonstrate that some entire pieces were collaborative efforts, and Evans can be heard giving cues from the keyboard (behind the band) to guide the band. Before the 1970s, his keyboard playing was generally sparse on recordings but after the 1970s he took a more active role in the rhythm section of the band.\n\n''[[Where Flamingos Fly]]'' (recorded 1971, released 1981) demonstrated his ability to contract the most accomplished musicians, with veterans Coles, [[Harry Lookofsky]], [[Richard Davis (double bassist)|Richard Davis]] and [[Jimmy Knepper]] (who played the solo on the \"Where Flamingos Fly\" track on 1961's ''[[Out of the Cool]]'') alongside young multi-instrumentalist [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], synthesizer player [[Don Preston]] (at that time still a member of [[The Mothers of Invention]]), and [[Billy Harper]].\n\nIn April 1983, the Gil Evans Orchestra was booked into the [[Sweet Basil Jazz Club]] ([[Greenwich Village]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) by jazz producer and Sweet Basil owner [[Horst Liepolt]]. This turned out to be a regular Monday night engagement for Evans for nearly five years and also resulted in the release of a number of successful albums by ''Gil Evans and the Monday Night Orchestra''.<ref name=aaj>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/hidden-treasures-vol-1-monday-nights-the-gil-evans-orchestra-bopper-spock-suns-music-review-by-jerome-wilson.php|author=Jerome Wilson|title=The Gil Evans Orchestra: Hidden Treasures Vol. 1, Monday Nights|website=All About Jazz|date=December 31, 2018|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Nakayama |first=Yasuki |date=2018 |title=\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u4e2d\u5c71\u5eb7\u6a39 |trans-title=Yasuki Nakayama in \"Swing Journal\" era |url= |language=Japanese |location=Tokyo, Japan |publisher=Shinko Music Entertainment |chapter=\u30ae\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30fb\u30bb\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 |trans-chapter=Gil Evans' Monday night sessions |pages=68-78 |isbn=}}</ref> Evans's ensemble featured many of the top-call musicians in New York, many of whom were also in the [[NBC]] [[Saturday Night Live Band]] and there were many conflicts, so their \"deputies\" for the night might be other world-class musicians. Yet Evans was also known to let newcomers \"sit in\" occasionally. The band also performed arrangements by band members, current and past. Stalwarts in this ensemble were [[Lew Soloff]], [[Alan Rubin]], [[Marvin Peterson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom \"Bones\" Malone]], [[George Adams (musician)]], [[David Sanborn]], [[Hiram Bullock]], Mark Eagan, drummer Kenwood Dennard, saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] (no relation) and Gil Goldstein. In 1987, Evans recorded a live album with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], featuring big band arrangements of songs by and with [[The Police]]. In the same spirit of introducing new talent in his bands, he collaborated with [[Maria Schneider (musician)|Maria Schneider]] with her as an apprentice arranger on this and other final projects.

When the summer comes to an end, Sandy\u2014who is going back to Australia\u2014frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is \"only beginning\". The film moves to the start of the seniors' term at Rydell High School. Danny is a member and leader of the T-Birds [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] gang, consisting of his best friend Kenickie, Doody, Sonny, and Putzie. The Pink Ladies, a clique of greaser girls, also arrive, consisting of leader Rizzo, Frenchy, Marty, and Jan.\n\nAfter her parents decide not to return to Australia, Sandy enrolls at Rydell and is befriended by Frenchy, who considers dropping out of school to become a beautician. Unaware of each other's presence at Rydell, Danny and Sandy tell their respective groups the accounts of events during the pair's brief romance, without initially mentioning the other's name (\"Summer Nights\"). Sandy's version emphasizes the romance of the relationship, while Danny's version is more sexual.\n\nWhen Sandy finally says Danny's name, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion for the two, but Danny is forced to maintain his bad-boy attitude in front of his pals, upsetting Sandy, who storms off and begins dating Tom, a [[jock (subculture)|jock]]. Kenickie unveils the used car, Greased Lightnin', that he plans on restoring and racing (\"Greased Lightnin'\"). Frenchy invites the girls to a pajama party, but Sandy falls ill from the sight of blood after getting her ears pierced by Frenchy, Rizzo starts to make fun of Sandy (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\"). While Sandy is outside, she soon starts to think of Danny, and how much she loves him even though he hurt her (\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\"). Rizzo departs to have sex with Kenickie, during which his condom breaks. The two are disturbed by Leo, leader of the T-Birds' rival gang, the Scorpions, and his girlfriend Cha-Cha.\n\nIn an attempt to impress Sandy, Danny turns to Coach Calhoun to get into sports, eventually becoming a runner. He reunites with Sandy and they attempt to go on a date, but their friends crash it. Kenickie and a distressed Rizzo argue and split up. Left alone, Frenchy is visited by a [[guardian angel]] who advises her to return to school after a mishap in beauty class leaves her with candy-pink hair (\"Beauty School Dropout\").\n\nThe school dance arrives, broadcast live on television and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine, who flirts with Marty. Rizzo and Kenickie attempt to spite one another by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates. Danny and Sandy arrive together and dance well during the chaotic [[hand jive]] contest (\"Born to Hand Jive\"); just before the end of the contest Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor, and Cha-Cha cuts in to win the contest with Danny, causing Sandy to leave the event broken-hearted.\n\nDanny tries to make it up to Sandy by taking her to a drive-in theater (\"Alone at the Drive-in Movies\") but forces himself on her, causing Sandy to leave (\"Sandy\"). Meanwhile Rizzo fears she is pregnant after missing a period and confides in Marty, but Marty tells Sonny and he inadvertently spreads the rumor to Kenickie, the apparent father, though Rizzo denies this to him. At school, Rizzo is getting laughed at by other girls, and she soon realizes that she isn't as tough as she seems (\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\").\n\nOn race day, Kenickie suffers a concussion when hit by his own car door, so Danny takes the wheel. He and Leo race until Leo crashes and leaves humiliated, with Danny as the victor. Sandy watches from afar, concluding she still loves Danny, and decides to change her attitude and look to impress him; she then asks Frenchy for help to achieve this goal (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)\").\n\nOn the last day of school, Principal McGee and her assistant Blanche sob about the departing class.

He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted, including suggesting [[Randal Kleiser]] (who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm ''[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]'') as director, and [[Olivia Newton-John]], then known almost exclusively as a multiple Grammy winning pop and country singer, as Sandy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Travolta|first=John|title=Inside the Actor's Studio}}</ref> Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965's ''[[Funny Things Happen Down Under]]'' and the unreleased 1970 film ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'', which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time.

When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene. As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references. The 'blurring' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged.

When the summer comes to an end, Sandy\u2014who is going back to Australia\u2014frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is \"only beginning\". The film moves to the start of the seniors' term at Rydell High School. Danny is a member and leader of the T-Birds [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] gang, consisting of his best friend Kenickie, Doody, Sonny, and Putzie. The Pink Ladies, a clique of greaser girls, also arrive, consisting of leader Rizzo, Frenchy, Marty, and Jan.\n\nAfter her parents decide not to return to Australia, Sandy enrolls at Rydell and is befriended by Frenchy, who considers dropping out of school to become a beautician. Unaware of each other's presence at Rydell, Danny and Sandy tell their respective groups the accounts of events during the pair's brief romance, without initially mentioning the other's name (\"Summer Nights\"). Sandy's version emphasizes the romance of the relationship, while Danny's version is more sexual.\n\nWhen Sandy finally says Danny's name, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion for the two, but Danny is forced to maintain his bad-boy attitude in front of his pals, upsetting Sandy, who storms off and begins dating Tom, a [[jock (subculture)|jock]]. Kenickie unveils the used car, Greased Lightnin', that he plans on restoring and racing (\"Greased Lightnin'\"). Frenchy invites the girls to a pajama party, but Sandy falls ill from the sight of blood after getting her ears pierced by Frenchy, Rizzo starts to make fun of Sandy (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\"). While Sandy is outside, she soon starts to think of Danny, and how much she loves him even though he hurt her (\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\"). Rizzo departs to have sex with Kenickie, during which his condom breaks. The two are disturbed by Leo, leader of the T-Birds' rival gang, the Scorpions, and his girlfriend Cha-Cha.\n\nIn an attempt to impress Sandy, Danny turns to Coach Calhoun to get into sports, eventually becoming a runner. He reunites with Sandy and they attempt to go on a date, but their friends crash it. Kenickie and a distressed Rizzo argue and split up. Left alone, Frenchy is visited by a [[guardian angel]] who advises her to return to school after a mishap in beauty class leaves her with candy-pink hair (\"Beauty School Dropout\").\n\nThe school dance arrives, broadcast live on television and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine, who flirts with Marty. Rizzo and Kenickie attempt to spite one another by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates. Danny and Sandy arrive together and dance well during the chaotic [[hand jive]] contest (\"Born to Hand Jive\"); just before the end of the contest Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor, and Cha-Cha cuts in to win the contest with Danny, causing Sandy to leave the event broken-hearted.\n\nDanny tries to make it up to Sandy by taking her to a drive-in theater (\"Alone at the Drive-in Movies\") but forces himself on her, causing Sandy to leave (\"Sandy\"). Meanwhile Rizzo fears she is pregnant after missing a period and confides in Marty, but Marty tells Sonny and he inadvertently spreads the rumor to Kenickie, the apparent father, though Rizzo denies this to him. At school, Rizzo is getting laughed at by other girls, and she soon realizes that she isn't as tough as she seems (\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\").\n\nOn race day, Kenickie suffers a concussion when hit by his own car door, so Danny takes the wheel. He and Leo race until Leo crashes and leaves humiliated, with Danny as the victor. Sandy watches from afar, concluding she still loves Danny, and decides to change her attitude and look to impress him; she then asks Frenchy for help to achieve this goal (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)\").\n\nOn the last day of school, Principal McGee and her assistant Blanche sob about the departing class. Rizzo discovers she is not pregnant and reunites with Kenickie. Danny has lettered in track but is shocked when Sandy arrives dressed as a female T-Bird. In song (\"You're the One That I Want\"), they confess their mutual love and reconcile. The class celebrates their graduation at the fair on school grounds (\"We Go Together\"). Sandy and Danny depart in Greased Lightnin', which takes flight (\"Grease\").\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Principal cast===\n* [[John Travolta]] as Danny Zuko, who lives a double life as leader of the greaser gang the T-Birds and as Sandy's boyfriend\n* [[Olivia Newton-John]] as Sandy Olsson, Danny's girlfriend and an Australian [[immigrant]] and [[ing\u00e9nue]], who transforms from square to greaser\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Betty Rizzo, Kenickie's girlfriend and the cynical leader of the Pink Ladies clique\n* [[Jeff Conaway]] as Kenickie Murdoch, Danny's best friend, Rizzo's boyfriend and the owner of Greased Lightnin'\n* [[Barry Pearl]] as Doody, a member of the T-Birds; he pairs with Frenchy at the school dance\n* [[Michael Tucci]] as Sonny LaTieri, a trouble-making wannabe womanizer and T-Bird who courts Marty with little success over the course of the film\n* [[Kelly Ward]] as Putzie, a member of the T-Birds whose relationship with Jan builds over the course of the film\n* [[Didi Conn]] as Frenchy, Sandy's closest friend in the Pink Ladies and an aspiring beautician\n* [[Jamie Donnelly]] as Jan, a quirky member of the Pink Ladies with a liking for [[Ipana]] toothpaste\n* [[Dinah Manoff]] as Marty Maraschino, a member of the Pink Ladies whose attractiveness regularly draws the attention of men, including Sonny and Vince Fontaine\n\n===Secondary cast===\n* [[Eve Arden]] as Principal McGee, who shows discomfort at the goings-on at Rydell High.\n* [[Dody Goodman]] as Secretary Blanche Hodel, who enjoys even the wilder antics at the school.\n* [[Sid Caesar]] as Coach Vince Calhoun, the tough-talking gym teacher and coach of all the school's perennially losing sports teams\n* [[Eddie Deezen]] as Eugene Felsnick, the class nerd\n* [[Susan Buckner]] as Patty Simcox, the head cheerleader and a rival for Danny's affections\n* [[Lorenzo Lamas]] as Tom Chisum, a popular jock who competes for Sandy's affections\n* [[Dennis Cleveland Stewart|Dennis C.

He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted, including suggesting [[Randal Kleiser]] (who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm ''[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]'') as director, and [[Olivia Newton-John]], then known almost exclusively as a multiple Grammy winning pop and country singer, as Sandy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Travolta|first=John|title=Inside the Actor's Studio}}</ref> Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965's ''[[Funny Things Happen Down Under]]'' and the unreleased 1970 film ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'', which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time. Before accepting the role, Newton-John requested a [[screen test]] for ''Grease'' to avoid another career setback.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20071391,00.html |title=Ohh Sandy! \u2013 Olivia Newton-John |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |first=Robert |last=Windeler |date=July 31, 1978 |accessdate=November 10, 2008}}</ref> The screen test was done with the drive-in movie scene. Newton-John, who is native to England and lived most of her life in Australia, was unable to perform with a convincing American accent, and thus her character was rewritten to be Australian. Before Newton-John was hired, [[Allan Carr]] was considering numerous names such as [[Ann-Margret]], [[Susan Dey]] and [[Marie Osmond]] for the lead role; Newton-John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In a case of life imitating art, Newton-John's own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character; her next album after ''Grease'', the provocatively titled ''[[Totally Hot]]'', featured a much more sexual and pop-oriented approach, with Newton-John appearing on the album cover in similar all-leather attire and teased hair.<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&pg=PA334#PPA335,M1 |title=All music guide to country: the ... |publisher= Google Books |date= |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Jeff Conaway]], like Travolta, had previously appeared in the stage version of ''Grease''; he had played Danny Zuko during the show's run on Broadway.<ref name=newsdayobit>{{cite news|authorlink=Frank Lovece |last=Lovece |first=Frank |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/obituaries/grease-taxi-star-jeff-conaway-dies-1.2907909 |title='Grease,' 'Taxi' Star Jeff Conaway Dies |work=[[Newsday]] |date=May 27, 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z4Hujzwq?url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/obituaries/grease-taxi-star-jeff-conaway-dies-1.2907909?p= |archivedate=May 30, 2011 |df= }} (Subscription required.) .

The drive-in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive-In (it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place).

When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene. As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references. The 'blurring' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged. According to Kleiser, \"We just had to hope that Pepsi wouldn't complain.
