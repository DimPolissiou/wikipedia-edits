Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

The show is hosted by [[Todd Newton]]. [[Burton Richardson (television announcer)|Burton Richardson]] announced for the first two seasons, until he was replaced by Stacey J. Aswad for the third season, and then [[Andrew Kishino]] beginning in the fourth season. The 60-minute program debuted on October 10, 2010 on [[Discovery Family|The Hub]], formerly Discovery Kids. The network would become Discovery Family on October 13, 2014; it was previewed on October 9, 2010 on its sister channel, [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. Seasons 1 through 3 each contained between 20 and 30 episodes. Seasons 4 and 5 each contained 15 episodes. Season two premiered on Friday, September 2, 2011, and new games were added. The games added to the second season included Cranium Brain Breaks (which replaced ''Guess Who?'' as the opening toss-up game), Green Scream, Ratuki Go-Round, Simon Flash, Operation Sam Dunk, Trouble Pop Quiz, and Spelling Bee.\n\nOn June 19, 2012, ''Family Game Night'' was renewed for a third season by The Hub, which premiered on September 23, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/486128-The_Hub_Orders_Third_Season_Of_Family_Game_Night.php|title=The Hub Orders Third Season Of ''Family Game Night''|author=MCN Staff|work=MultiChannel News|date=June 19, 2012|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn July 9, 2012, it was announced that ''Family Game Night'' was one of four original series from The Hub that won the [[CINE|CINE Golden Eagle Award]] for high quality production and storytelling.<ref>{{cite web|title=HubWorld.com press release|url=http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|access-date=13 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020112156/http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|archive-date=20 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe show's fifth season premiered on August 3, 2014 and added a new feature in which a celebrity plays to win cash and prizes for the audience members that they team up with, as well as their favorite [[charities]]. The fifth season ended on November 9, 2014.\n\n==Gameplay==\nFor the first two seasons, the TV show featured two families of four competing for cash and prizes. Each family consisted of the mother, the father, and two children, ages 8 to 18. Teams are usually named for the younger of the two kids (i.e. Willie's Family or Suzie's Family).\n\nTeams earned \"[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] Crazy Cash Cards\" by playing the various games, normally five of them in each episode. Whenever a family won a game, the youngest child was allowed to select a Monopoly Crazy Cash Card from a rack located at the \"Crazy Cash Corner\" on the far left of the stage. The rack initially held 21 different cards, each depicting one of the tokens used in either the original \"Monopoly\" board game or the \"''[[Monopoly (game)#Monopoly Here and Now|Monopoly: Here and Now Edition]]''\" board game. Each card held a different randomized amount of money, which was revealed at the end of the show. Most of the cards were valued between $200\u2013$995 in $5 increments, although at least one card held a four-figure amount (usually between $1,000\u2013$7,000) and one card was the \"Top Cash Card\" worth between $7,500\u2013$25,000.\n\nIn addition to the Cash Card, a family that won a game also received a special bonus prize which they kept regardless of the final outcome of the show. In the first season of the show, this prize was simply revealed by host Newton, but in the second season, each bonus prize was a \"Monopoly Party Prize\" revealed by announcer Burton. At the end of the show, both families took their accumulated cards to the \"Crazy Cash Machine\". Each card was placed into the Machine, revealing its value, at which point the machine would spit out the amount in oversized Monopoly Money bills. Both families kept all the cash and prizes they won during the game, and the family with the most cash at the end also won a family vacation. If there is a tie after both families have used all their cards, then both families win the vacation. If the \"Top Cash Card\" was not found by the players, the host would usually tell the audience near the end of the show what card held it.\n\nIn season 3, the format of the show was changed slightly. Instead of two families competing for the whole show, families of varying sizes (two to four members) were chosen from the studio audience to play the games, winning cash or prizes. Instead of earning Monopoly Cash Cards, teams compete for the right to take combination codes from the Mr. Monopoly statue's hand. After four games are played, the families attempt to use these cards to open the Community Chest. If they pick the winning combination, they win money and get a chance to play for more money and a grand prize of a brand-new car.\n\nThe final game is the \"Crazy Cash Machine\" where the child selects from a board of 16 Monopoly Cash Cards starting from the bottom row. Each row above it has one more \"Go to Jail\" card than the previous one (meaning there are none on the bottom row, one in the second row, two in the third row and three on the top row). The one winning card on the top row has the word \"WIN\" instead of a cash amount. If a \"Go to Jail\" card is selected, the game is over; however, the family may keep the money they earned up to that point. If they make it to the top row and select the WIN card, they win a new car in addition to the money accumulated.\n\n==Games==\n\n===Season 1===\n''Family Game Night'' features an interchangeable selection of mini-games, similar to ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. Many games involve family members playing in turn, starting in order with the youngest child, then the oldest child, the moms, and finally, the dads.\n\n====Guess Who?====\n'''''[[Guess Who?]]''''' is the opening toss-up game that decides which family is given the option to play first or second in the first game. The host gives up to four clues to the identity of a celebrity or a fictional person. The families can buzz in whenever they want. If they get it right, they get to pick to go first or second in the next game. If they get it wrong, the other family wins the round and they get to decide if they want to go first or second. In addition, after this game, each family selects a \"Crazy Cash\" card, starting with the family that will be playing first.\n\n====Scrabble Flash====\n'''''[[Scrabble]] Flash''''' is a game where the families have to make words using 5 oversized electronic ''Scrabble Flash'' letter tiles. Alternating between teams, each family member in family order takes a turn picking what word they can make. The player then arranges the Flash tiles used to make that word. The team gets 3 points for making a word with 3 letters, 4 points by making a word with 4 letters, or 5 points by making a word with 5 letters. The first family to reach a score of 25 points or more is the winner.\n\n====Cranium====\n'''''[[Cranium (board game)|Cranium]]''''' is actually a set of four minigames, each represented by one of the Cranium characters. The host reveals one of the characters and the character's related game. The game is then played in two parts, with the children in each team competing first, followed by the parents. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nIn an early episode, all 4 minigames were featured; the team with the highest combined score won the game.\n\n'''Data Head''': Players are shown a series of images and are either asked questions about the image or are asked to identify an aspect of the image or something related to it. Five such images/questions are asked to the kids for 10 points each. Then another five more difficult images/questions are asked of the parents for 20 points each.\n\n'''Creative Cat''': This minigame divided into 2 halves. In the first half, the 2 children in each family are given clay, as well as a card with a thing that each pair of children has to make from their clay. After a commercial break, the clay \"masterpieces\" are brought out, and the parents have 15 seconds to guess what their children made. Each correct answer is worth 10 points per second remaining.  Then, in the second half, the parents get to draw things for their children to guess. Each parent uses an electronic sketch pad and is blindfolded while drawing. The children then have 15 seconds to guess what each parent is drawing. Correct answers are worth 10 points per second remaining. The family with the most total points from the two halves wins the round.\n\n'''Star Performer''': In one version of this minigame, Dads have 30 seconds to guess activities performed by their kids and their wife; The first round had players form letters and are worth 10 points, the second round sees players forming numbers which are worth 20, the third round is symbols which are worth 30, and finally the charaders form general things with each correct answer worth 40 points. The family with the most points wins the round. If there's a tie, then the Dad that guess correctly in a least amount of time wins.\n\nIn another version of this minigame, the families faced music keypad with five notes numbered and colored. 1-Blue, 2-Red, 3-Green, 4-Yellow and 5-Purple. This is a [[Simon (game)|Simon]]-like game where the player who made a mistake forfeited the points to his/her opposing family. The kids played first and they must add one note at a time; their round is worth 10 points. The adults played second, but they must add two notes at a time; their round is worth 20 points. The family with the most points wins. This version is now played in the second season as '''Cranium Piano'''.\n\n'''Word Worm''': First, the kids are shown words that are revealed either from top to bottom or reverse. The first team to guess a word scores 10 points; five words are played.  Then, the parents participate in a \"backwards spelling bee\", in which they have to spell given words backwards, at 20 points per correct word.  The family with the most total points wins.\n\n====Bop It! Boptagon====\n'''''[[Bop It|Bop It!]] Boptagon''''' is a memory game designated to test how fast the players can respond to specific commands. Set inside a ring called the \"Boptagon\", the players each operate one of 8 stations: Twist It, Pull It, Shout It, Kick It, Whack It, Honk It, Crash It, and Bop It. The players will hear a command, and they must obey it in time. They might also hear \"Rotate It\" and \"Reverse It\". When they hear one of these commands, they move one station left for Rotate It, and one station right for Reverse It. If one or more players fail to correctly obey the command, does their command if it is not the one called, or goes in the wrong direction during \"Rotate It\" or \"Reverse It\", they are knocked out. The family with one or more of their team left in the Boptagon is the winner.\n\n====Guesstures Free Fall====\nIn '''''Guesstures Free Fall''''', a variation of the charades game ''Guesstures'', one family member has two minutes to guess things or actions mimed by the other three family members, each suspended in mid-air by wires. 10 points are awarded for each correct answer, but if the family member who guesses decides to pass on an item or if the family member who mimes makes a noise while doing so, the miming player is then lowered, [[freefall]]-style, behind the Guesstures barrier. The answer is then revealed, and another of the family members suspended in mid-air gets to [[mime]]. The family with the most points wins the round. Ties are broken by determining which family made the fewest passes.\n\nA subsequent rules change for this game had the time limit reduced to 45 seconds, with all three family members acting out things or actions for the fourth member to guess. The same scoring rules remained in effect. At the 30-second mark, one of the family members is lowered, followed by another at the 15-second mark. Passing is allowed only 3 times.\n\nA later rule change doubled the time limit to 90 seconds, with each family member being given 30 seconds to act out progressively harder words.  In the first 30 seconds, the younger child will act out words for 10 points each.  In the middle 30, the older child will act out 20-point words, and in the last 30 seconds, the adult will act out words for 30 points each. Guessers are still only allowed 3 passes.\n\nThe 2-minute version of ''Guesstures Free Fall'' continued for the second season, with the addition of a short fanfare playing once three members from each family rise up in mid-air. Guessers are allowed infinite passes.\n\n====Operation Relay====\n'''''[[Operation (game)|Operation]] Relay''''' is where the families take turns in family order get the pieces from Cavity Sam using tongs. If they hit the edge, the person is buzzed and has to go to the end of the line. If they get the piece, they have to limbo under bones (called the \"limbone\"), walk across two balance beams, jump over two hurdles, then go through a giant tissue box. If they do something wrong they do not get the points. If they trip over or miss an obstacle, they have to go to the end of the line. Each family is given 2 or 2\u00bd minutes, with the family scoring the most points winning the game. If a tie occurs the family with the least amount of buzzes from Sam is the winner.\n\n====Bounce 'n Boogie Boggle====\nOn a 5-by-5 grid that resembles a '''[[Boggle]]''' board (in fact, a \"Big Boggle\" board), family members take turns searching for words. A player announces a word, then walking to the first letter in the word, spells it out by jumping from square to square to spell them, scoring 1 point for each letter in a correct word. As in the board game, words must be at least 3 letters long, and the letters used in spelling the word must touch each other in the grid orthogonally or diagonally. If a player spells a word that has two letters, backtracks (uses a letter square they have already used in the given word), spells a word incorrectly, uses unconnected letters, spells a word different from their announced word, steps on the same letter twice, use contraction words, or fails to come up with a word in time, that player's turn is lost. The family that scores the most points in the 2-minute time limit wins. Also, if a family member spells a pre-determined 6-, 7-, or 8- letter Secret Word [shown to the home viewers], that family wins an additional bonus prize.\n\n====Connect 4 Basketball====\nIn this variation on the vertical checkers game '''[[Connect Four]]''', the checkers are replaced with red and yellow balls. Family members take turns in family order throwing those balls into baskets on a 7x6 board, in order to get 4 in a row in any direction.\n\nIn an early episode, players from both teams shot their red and yellow balls at the same time. The first team to make 4 in a row won one round; the first to win two rounds won the game.\n\n====Twister Lights Out====\nIn this variation on '''[[Twister (game)|Twister]]''', family members have to follow commands like \"left foot, blue\", with the dots shown on a floor-level video board. As play goes on, the dots disappear one by one, clockwise. If a family member's hand or foot is on a dot about to disappear, he/she must move their hand/foot to another dot of the same color. If a family member either [1] has a body part that's on a disappeared dot, [2] does not follow the command on time, [3] has any body part other than hands or feet on the board, [4] has their hand or foot off of the Twister board or [5] has their body part on the wrong color or wrong body part on the same color, it's *boom* lights out for them.\n\nThe first round has the kids participating; the second round has the adults taking part. Whichever family has one player standing wins a round; two rounds win the game. If a third round is needed, Todd tosses a coin, with heads indicating that the kids play, and tails indicating the adults play; whichever family wins that round then wins the game.\n\n====Sorry! Sliders====\nIn this big version of '''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]] Sliders''', each family has two giant-sized rolling pawns. One player from each family pushes the pawns into one of the 4 rings with point values starting at 5 in the center, then 3, 1 and The Sorry Ring, which is worth no points, in the outer area. Players can push their opponents' pawns to affect the scoring. Each round consists of 2 rolls per family. The family with the most points wins the round, and the first family to win 2 rounds wins the game. If a round is tied, each family gets a half-win. If tied after 2 rounds, a \"slide-off\" takes place with only one roll per family; the most points wins. Starting in season 2, each team places a special prize dot on the board (except that they cannot place their dots on the 5-point zone). If a team's pawn is at least partially on their own prize dot at the end of the round, their team wins a prize; if their pawn is on their opponent's dot at the end of the round, that pawn does not count for any points.\n\n====Yahtzee Bowling====\nIn this variation of '''[[Yahtzee]]''', the dice are represented as 5 six-sided [[bowling pins]] with dice pips numbered 1 through 6 on every pin. Each family gets three chances to roll a [[bowling ball]] down a lane and knock down the pins to make the best scoring combination possible\u2014in order from least to best: a pair, two pair, three of a kind, a small straight, a full house, a large straight, four of a kind, or Yahtzee (five of a kind).\n\nThe family with the best combination wins a frame; two frames win the game. If a third frame is required after the families split the first two, each family gets only one roll, with the best combination winning the game. The family who makes a Yahtzee also receives a bonus prize.\n\n====[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] Crazy Cash Machine====\nKnown as the final game of the show, both teams use the Crazy Cash Cards from the Crazy Cash Corner to earn cash. The Crazy Cash Corner holds 21 cards in a 3x7 grid featuring Monopoly tokens. Both teams start with one card and they can earn more by winning games. Each player from a team inserts the card to the machine and a random amount of cash is added to their bank with the highest amount ranging from $7,500 to $25,000. When that happens, [[Monopoly money]] will come out of the machine. The team with the most cash when all of the cards are used earns a vacation. Even if a family loses, both teams get to keep their money. Starting with season three, one family plays the game for a car, but with 16 cards.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn addition to the return of ''Bop It Boptagon'', ''Bounce 'n Boogie Boggle'', ''Connect 4 Basketball'', ''Cranium'', ''Guesstures Freefall'', ''Sorry! Sliders'', ''Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine'' and ''Yahtzee Bowling'', new games were introduced. Also, ''Guess Who?'' is no longer the opening game, and ''Operation Relay'' and ''Scrabble Flash'' (now used on ''[[Scrabble Showdown]]'') were removed. Also, teams earn \"Monopoly Party Packages\" for winning each game.\n\n====Cranium Brain Break====\nEach episode now starts off with a ''Cranium Brain Break'' where teams perform a ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]''-esque stunt, such as trying to throw two rings onto a ''Sorry!'' Slider, or getting more balls in a basket on host Newton's head in 30 seconds. In a timed event, if the game ends in a tie, the first team that scores in the game wins.\n\n====Cranium Guesstimator====\nSimilar to the educated guess questions on ''[[Card Sharks]]'', one team is given a question that has a numeric answer. The other team must then predict if the actual answer is higher or lower than the first team's guess. The kids play first for questions worth 10, 20, 30 and 40 points, then the adults play more difficult questions for double points. Highest score wins. If there is a tie, one final question is read, and each team makes a numeric guess, with the closest guess winning.\n\n====Cranium Who's Older====\nTeams take turns being shown a pair of people and/or things and identifying which one is older. Right answers win points, wrong answers forfeit the points the opposing team. The kids play four questions worth 10 points each, then the adults play four questions at double points. Highest score wins. If there is a tie, one final question is played, and the team that buzzes in first gets to answer, with the winner determined by their right or wrong answer.\n\n====Simon Flash====\nA variation on '''[[Simon (game)|Simon]]''', families wear giant cubes around their bodies, colored red, yellow, green, and blue, like the actual game. A sequence appears on screen and families arrange themselves to match the sequence to score a point. Each player's color randomly changes after each score. First to five points wins.\n\n====Operation Sam Dunk====\nReplacing ''Operation Relay'' this season, this game involves rolling skee-balls to land in various cavities on Sam's body to score points. In addition, a bell (for Ringing In The Ear) is installed to double the team's total score if hit. (If no one has tried for the bell yet after the first round, Newton will call attention to it.) Each family member gets two rolls in family order. Highest score wins.\n\n====Ratuki Go-Round====\nA variation on ''Ratuki'', this game involves a relay race to get rid of twenty cards, with values from 1 to 4 on it, and the final 20th card with a value of 5 on it (displayed by different types of pictures). Players can only place a card that's one number higher or lower than the previous card that is placed. Also, the final 5 cannot be placed down before all the other cards are gone. Breaking the rules causes you to freeze for 10 seconds. The first family to place all their cards wins.\n\nMidway through the season, the rules was adjusted. If the family places the wrong card, their opponents will automatically win the game. In addition, regular 5's have been added to the team's decks. If they place a 5 card, their opponents freeze for 10 seconds. The final 5, however, must still be played last in order to win.\n\n====Trouble Pop Quiz====\nThe kids are asked number-based questions, using a larger-than-life Pop-o-Matic to answer. A right answer or a false start from the opponent moves mom or dad forward the number of spaces shown on the die. Landing on an opponent's space sends the opponent back a space. First team to get both parents past the finish line wins.\n\n====Green Scream====\nKids roll around on a green screen floor, revealing pictures (associated with a category) for the parents to guess in 90 seconds. Up to ten are used per family and a right answer scores ten points. Highest score after the game wins. If there is a tie after the 90 second time limit, the team who correctly solved the words in the fastest time wins.\n\n====Spelling Bee====\nMom wears a \"stinger\" (a black marker) on her back to spell out words for other family members. The moms are not allowed to talk, or else the word is disqualified. They are, however, sometimes encouraged to make \"buzzing\" noises like a bee. If a family can't guess the word after the third letter, host Newton gives a clue to the word. Each right answer is worth 100 points, and each family has 90 seconds to guess as many words as possible. Highest score wins. Ties are broken by who took the least time to score their words.\n\n===Season 3===\nThough some of the basic games were held over from the previous seasons, they were changed in some ways to accommodate the show's new format as well as the addition of some new games. Simon Flash and Connect 4 Basketball, so far, are the only games to remain unchanged. Also, Stacey J. Aswad took over the announcing duties replacing [[Burton Richardson (announcer)|Burton Richardson]]. After each game is played, each team picks a combination code for the [[Chance and Community Chest cards|Community Chest]] near the end of the show. Each combination has three specified colors, and if the chest is opened, the teams will play for a new car. If the chest is not opened, the teams keep the prizes they won earlier.\n\n====[[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]====\nThe players stand behind podiums with a button. On the 5x5 floor grid, six ships (3 [[cruisers]], 2 [[submarines]] and a [[battleship]]) are hidden under [[coordinates]] that the players call out on the board (for example: B3). Once the coordinate is locked in, Newton and the audience must do a three-second countdown. Once the \"Launch!\" signal is given, the player presses the button which launches a virtual peg from the [[video screen]] in the background. Each hit sinks a ship and three sunken ships wins the game. If the family has a score of 3\u20132 without any misses, the family with 2 ships sunk will have a chance to get a prize like their opponents did, so that both families win the same prize. The winners get to draw a Community Chest combination code from [[Mr. Monopoly]]'s hand first and wins the game's prize package.\n\n====Sorry!====\nInstead of Sorry Sliders, the parent now dresses up as Sorry pieces and are moved down a path with different dollar amounts from $100 to $900 in $100 steps by their child(s) choosing a card with either a number of spaces to move ranging from one to four, or \"Sorry\" on them. The players can stop on any of the spaces and win the cumulative amount of money they landed on or continue on towards the prize at the end. If a \"Sorry\" card is drawn, the parent is moved back to start and they lose the money in their bank at that point. If the other \"Sorry\" card is drawn, the game is over. At the end of the game, the family draws a combination card for the Community Chest.\n\n====Operation====\nIn this variation, the family can win money. To begin with, the family gets one roll and they can earn up to three more by removing a piece from the parent's body. After that, they will use these rolls to earn money by rolling into Cavity Sam, which is similar to Operation Sam Dunk from the show's second season. The family can win up to $4,000 in cash and they will also earn a Community Chest combination card.\n\n====Yahtzee Bowling====\nAlthough fundamentally the same from the previous seasons, instead of two families competing with each other, one family is chosen from the audience and three members must bowl (one for each person), trying to build up a different combination of numbers. However, instead of the highest combination winning the game in earlier seasons, each combination is assigned a different prize the family can win after they have all played ranging from cameras to a vacation. At the end of the game, they proceed to draw a Community Chest combination card.\n\n====Bop It! Boptagon====\nThough fundamentally the same as the previous seasons, the Boptagon is now smaller and accommodates only one player at a time in teams of two. Each player gets thirty seconds to get as many commands as possible. The new commands include \"Chop it!\" and \"Squeeze It!\" (which replace Twist It and Shout It). After two rounds of play with both team members, the team with the most correct commands wins the game. After that, the two teams will receive a Community Chest combination card.\n\n====Twister Lights Out====\nBasically the same as the previous season, there are several changes. First, there is the new command of \"air,\" which means the players must raise the indicated body part up off the ground. Second, the dots no longer disappear one at a time but instead the entire border row flashes before it disappears all at once.\n\n====Monopoly Community Chest====\n{{see also|Chance and Community Chest cards}}\n\nAll teams have a chance to play for a car by using a combination card from the previous games they've played during the show. Each card has three colors ranging from red to blue. To unlock the chest, the team captain must input the three-color combination code that Newton calls out before pressing the button. If it's locked, a buzzer will sound, signaling a wrong combination. When that happens, that team will go back into the studio audience. If it opens however, then a fanfare will play and [[Monopoly money|cash]] will come out from the chest, which signals a winning combination. When that happens, that team will move on to the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine for a chance to win more money and a brand-new car.\n\n====Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine====\nThis is the same as in the previous seasons, but only one family can play with 16 Crazy Cash Cards in a 4x4 grid. Nine of the cards have cash, six of them have Go To Jail, and the last one has Win. Each time they get a Cash Card from each row, they will earn the corresponding amount on the card and move on to the next one. If a team gets a Go To Jail Card (rows two through four), the game is over, but they get to keep ''all'' the money they've earned along with the prizes from earlier. When that happens, Newton will reveal where in the top row the car is. However, if they get to the top row and successfully find the Win Card (the screen displays \"WIN!\" and \"GO TO JAIL\" on [[slot machine|slots]]), they'll earn a [[Jeep Patriot]] in Seasons 3 & 4, and a [[Ford Escape]] in Season 5, along with the prizes and the money they've accumulated.\n\n===Season 4===\nFor the show's fourth season, new games were introduced along with returning games, and some classic games were modified. Also, [[Andrew Kishino]] took over the announcing duties replacing Stacey J. Aswad, and the names in each selected family are shown on the big screen. Those families who lose their games receive $100. Combinations were still chosen from Mr. Monopoly's hand to open the Monopoly Community Chest before playing the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine.\n\n====Monopoly Remix====\nThe fast-dealing game of properties is re-imagined in a whole new way where a sharp eye and a good sense of recall are rewarded with cash and prizes. One family plays on a MONOPOLY-style virtual game board with two dark blue property spaces \u2014 Boardwalk and Park Place \u2014 and starts with $1,000 of [[Monopoly money|MONOPOLY money]]. In the first round, Boardwalk and Park Place are shuffled amongst two penalty spaces \u2014 Luxury Tax and Income Tax. Family members use keen vision and extreme concentration to follow the properties as they are rapidly shuffled around the playing field. If the family accurately identifies and places their jumbo-sized hotels where Boardwalk and Park Place landed on the game board, they keep the $1,000 of MONOPOLY money. If the family places their hotels on the penalty spaces, they pay the fine. In the first round, the penalty spaces cost $300 each. In the second round, a Street Repairs space is added and the penalty spaces cost $400 each. In the final round, the fines increase to $500 and a Bankrupt space is added. If a hotel is placed on Bankrupt (and/or they run out of MONOPOLY money), they lose everything. If the family has any MONOPOLY money left at the end of the game, they win the remaining money and a prize.\n\n====Jenga====\nTwo families remove and stack blocks on an oversized version of the iconic Jenga tower. The game starts with one member from each family picking a numbered disc from a box. The number indicates how many Jenga blocks the other family members have to pull from anywhere on the tower and stack on top within a two-minute time allotment. The tension builds with each turn as the tower gets perilously higher and unbalanced, and the families race against the clock. The teammates must alternate tagging each other removing and placing the blocks, as well as pressing their buzzer to stop their clock. The family who avoids knocking over the tower or running out of time during their turn wins the game. A family can be assessed a five-second penalty if one teammate does something out of turn.\n\n====Yahtzee====\nThe famous dice game is re-invented for the new season. Yahtzee is now played in two rounds by one family. The object of the game is to stop the spinning animated dice in order to get a Yahtzee, which is five-of-a-kind. Before the family plays, they answer one trivia question that has three correct answers. Each correct answer earns them one WILD space on all five dice; the WILD space can represent any number on the dice and helps the family get closer to the ultimate five-of-a-kind Yahtzee. If they get Yahtzee in three rolls or less, they win a prize.\n\n====[[Barrel of Monkeys (game)|Barrel of Monkeys]]====\nIn order to win the game, the sole family playing pulls virtual [[monkey]] chains of varying lengths out of ten big lettered barrels ranging from A to J and correctly hangs them in sequential order on one of five colored trees. But it is not as easy as it sounds. The family has to be strategic when placing each monkey chain in order to win the game. For example, if a family picks a barrel with a chain of nine animated monkeys and places it on the red tree on the far right, they could potentially lose the game if the next barrel they pick has a chain of ten monkeys. To help them out, one barrel's dubbed the Top Banana & if chosen, gives the family a save in case they make a mistake. The monkey will show the viewers which lettered barrel the Top Banana is located before the game starts.\n\n====Bop It! Boptagon====\nThough fundamentally the same as Season 3, the Boptagon has been altered. The \"Whack\" and \"Kick\" commands have been replaced with \"Lift\" and \"Dunk\" commands.\n\n====Monopoly Community Chest====\nThe Monopoly Community Chest has been altered. Before, contestants manually changed the combination lock to the three colors on their cards. This season, a slot was added for the combination cards to be inserted into so that the combination would automatically light up on the combination lock. If the light is red, the chest remains locked and they'll go back into the studio audience. If there is only one family remaining, then their combination would win for them. If it's green however, then it will unlock and the family will advance to the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine for more money and a brand-new car.\n\n====Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine====\nAlmost the same rules as Season 3 but the only differences are that the Iron card has been replaced by the Cat card (since the Cat replaces the Iron in the MONOPOLY board games.)\n\n===Season 5===\nSame games that are in the show's fourth season, but in the fifth season the show features celebrities playing with the families.  A victory awards $10,000 to a charity while a loss still awards half that amount or $5,000 to a charity of their choice. But they will not be eligible to participate in either the Monopoly Community Chest or the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine.\n\n====Sorry!====\nThe cards are re-themed, and the silver card is replaced by the yellow card.\n\n====Jenga ====\nThe rules are the same but now players take blocks out of the mini Jenga tower to know how many blocks players need to pull and stack on the tower.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|1742341|Family Game Night}}\n* [https://allspark.hasbro.com/shows/game-shows ''Game Shows''] at [[Allspark (company)|Allspark]]\n\n{{Hasbro Studios}}\n{{Discovery Family programs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Family Game Night (Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:Cable game shows]]\n[[Category:Discovery Family original programming]]\n[[Category:American television programs based on video games]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on board games]]\n[[Category:2010s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2010 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Scrabble on television]]\n[[Category:Monopoly (game)]]\n[[Category:Television series by Hasbro Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows based on Hasbro toys]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Family Game Night (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2014}}\n{{fanpov|date=February 2014}}\n}}{{Infobox Television\n|show_name = Family Game Night\n|caption = \n|genre = [[Game Show]]\n|runtime = 44 Minutes, Approx.<br/>(60 Minutes with commercials) \n|location = [[Old Warner Brothers Studio|Sunset Bronson Studios]]<br/>Hollywood, California\n|composer = \n|voices = \n|starring = \n|country = [[United States]]\n|language = English\n|network = [[Discovery Family|The Hub]] (2010\u20132014)<br/>[[Discovery Family]] (2014)\n|company = [[All3Media|ZOO Productions]]<br/>[[Allspark (company)|Allspark Pictures]]\n|presenter = [[Todd Newton]]\n|narrated = [[Burton Richardson]]<br/>Stacey J.

The show is hosted by [[Todd Newton]]. [[Burton Richardson (television announcer)|Burton Richardson]] announced for the first two seasons, until he was replaced by Stacey J. Aswad for the third season, and then [[Andrew Kishino]] beginning in the fourth season. The 60-minute program debuted on October 10, 2010 on [[Discovery Family|The Hub]], formerly Discovery Kids. The network would become Discovery Family on October 13, 2014; it was previewed on October 9, 2010 on its sister channel, [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. Seasons 1 through 3 each contained between 20 and 30 episodes. Seasons 4 and 5 each contained 15 episodes. Season two premiered on Friday, September 2, 2011, and new games were added. The games added to the second season included Cranium Brain Breaks (which replaced ''Guess Who?'' as the opening toss-up game), Green Scream, Ratuki Go-Round, Simon Flash, Operation Sam Dunk, Trouble Pop Quiz, and Spelling Bee.\n\nOn June 19, 2012, ''Family Game Night'' was renewed for a third season by The Hub, which premiered on September 23, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/486128-The_Hub_Orders_Third_Season_Of_Family_Game_Night.php|title=The Hub Orders Third Season Of ''Family Game Night''|author=MCN Staff|work=MultiChannel News|date=June 19, 2012|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn July 9, 2012, it was announced that ''Family Game Night'' was one of four original series from The Hub that won the [[CINE|CINE Golden Eagle Award]] for high quality production and storytelling.<ref>{{cite web|title=HubWorld.com press release|url=http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|access-date=13 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020112156/http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|archive-date=20 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe show's fifth season premiered on August 3, 2014 and added a new feature in which a celebrity plays to win cash and prizes for the audience members that they team up with, as well as their favorite [[charities]]. The fifth season ended on November 9, 2014.\n\n==Gameplay==\nFor the first two seasons, the TV show featured two families of four competing for cash and prizes. Each family consisted of the mother, the father, and two children, ages 8 to 18. Teams are usually named for the younger of the two kids (i.e. Willie's Family or Suzie's Family).\n\nTeams earned \"[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] Crazy Cash Cards\" by playing the various games, normally five of them in each episode. Whenever a family won a game, the youngest child was allowed to select a Monopoly Crazy Cash Card from a rack located at the \"Crazy Cash Corner\" on the far left of the stage. The rack initially held 21 different cards, each depicting one of the tokens used in either the original \"Monopoly\" board game or the \"''[[Monopoly (game)#Monopoly Here and Now|Monopoly: Here and Now Edition]]''\" board game. Each card held a different randomized amount of money, which was revealed at the end of the show. Most of the cards were valued between $200\u2013$995 in $5 increments, although at least one card held a four-figure amount (usually between $1,000\u2013$7,000) and one card was the \"Top Cash Card\" worth between $7,500\u2013$25,000.\n\nIn addition to the Cash Card, a family that won a game also received a special bonus prize which they kept regardless of the final outcome of the show. In the first season of the show, this prize was simply revealed by host Newton, but in the second season, each bonus prize was a \"Monopoly Party Prize\" revealed by announcer Burton. At the end of the show, both families took their accumulated cards to the \"Crazy Cash Machine\". Each card was placed into the Machine, revealing its value, at which point the machine would spit out the amount in oversized Monopoly Money bills. Both families kept all the cash and prizes they won during the game, and the family with the most cash at the end also won a family vacation. If there is a tie after both families have used all their cards, then both families win the vacation. If the \"Top Cash Card\" was not found by the players, the host would usually tell the audience near the end of the show what card held it.\n\nIn season 3, the format of the show was changed slightly. Instead of two families competing for the whole show, families of varying sizes (two to four members) were chosen from the studio audience to play the games, winning cash or prizes. Instead of earning Monopoly Cash Cards, teams compete for the right to take combination codes from the Mr. Monopoly statue's hand. After four games are played, the families attempt to use these cards to open the Community Chest. If they pick the winning combination, they win money and get a chance to play for more money and a grand prize of a brand-new car.\n\nThe final game is the \"Crazy Cash Machine\" where the child selects from a board of 16 Monopoly Cash Cards starting from the bottom row. Each row above it has one more \"Go to Jail\" card than the previous one (meaning there are none on the bottom row, one in the second row, two in the third row and three on the top row). The one winning card on the top row has the word \"WIN\" instead of a cash amount. If a \"Go to Jail\" card is selected, the game is over; however, the family may keep the money they earned up to that point. If they make it to the top row and select the WIN card, they win a new car in addition to the money accumulated.\n\n==Games==\n\n===Season 1===\n''Family Game Night'' features an interchangeable selection of mini-games, similar to ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. Many games involve family members playing in turn, starting in order with the youngest child, then the oldest child, the moms, and finally, the dads.\n\n====Guess Who?====\n'''''[[Guess Who?]]''''' is the opening toss-up game that decides which family is given the option to play first or second in the first game. The host gives up to four clues to the identity of a celebrity or a fictional person. The families can buzz in whenever they want. If they get it right, they get to pick to go first or second in the next game. If they get it wrong, the other family wins the round and they get to decide if they want to go first or second. In addition, after this game, each family selects a \"Crazy Cash\" card, starting with the family that will be playing first.\n\n====Scrabble Flash====\n'''''[[Scrabble]] Flash''''' is a game where the families have to make words using 5 oversized electronic ''Scrabble Flash'' letter tiles. Alternating between teams, each family member in family order takes a turn picking what word they can make. The player then arranges the Flash tiles used to make that word. The team gets 3 points for making a word with 3 letters, 4 points by making a word with 4 letters, or 5 points by making a word with 5 letters. The first family to reach a score of 25 points or more is the winner.\n\n====Cranium====\n'''''[[Cranium (board game)|Cranium]]''''' is actually a set of four minigames, each represented by one of the Cranium characters. The host reveals one of the characters and the character's related game. The game is then played in two parts, with the children in each team competing first, followed by the parents. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nIn an early episode, all 4 minigames were featured; the team with the highest combined score won the game.\n\n'''Data Head''': Players are shown a series of images and are either asked questions about the image or are asked to identify an aspect of the image or something related to it. Five such images/questions are asked to the kids for 10 points each. Then another five more difficult images/questions are asked of the parents for 20 points each.\n\n'''Creative Cat''': This minigame divided into 2 halves. In the first half, the 2 children in each family are given clay, as well as a card with a thing that each pair of children has to make from their clay. After a commercial break, the clay \"masterpieces\" are brought out, and the parents have 15 seconds to guess what their children made. Each correct answer is worth 10 points per second remaining.  Then, in the second half, the parents get to draw things for their children to guess. Each parent uses an electronic sketch pad and is blindfolded while drawing. The children then have 15 seconds to guess what each parent is drawing. Correct answers are worth 10 points per second remaining. The family with the most total points from the two halves wins the round.\n\n'''Star Performer''': In one version of this minigame, Dads have 30 seconds to guess activities performed by their kids and their wife; The first round had players form letters and are worth 10 points, the second round sees players forming numbers which are worth 20, the third round is symbols which are worth 30, and finally the charaders form general things with each correct answer worth 40 points. The family with the most points wins the round. If there's a tie, then the Dad that guess correctly in a least amount of time wins.\n\nIn another version of this minigame, the families faced music keypad with five notes numbered and colored. 1-Blue, 2-Red, 3-Green, 4-Yellow and 5-Purple. This is a [[Simon (game)|Simon]]-like game where the player who made a mistake forfeited the points to his/her opposing family. The kids played first and they must add one note at a time; their round is worth 10 points. The adults played second, but they must add two notes at a time; their round is worth 20 points. The family with the most points wins. This version is now played in the second season as '''Cranium Piano'''.\n\n'''Word Worm''': First, the kids are shown words that are revealed either from top to bottom or reverse. The first team to guess a word scores 10 points; five words are played.  Then, the parents participate in a \"backwards spelling bee\", in which they have to spell given words backwards, at 20 points per correct word.  The family with the most total points wins.\n\n====Bop It! Boptagon====\n'''''[[Bop It|Bop It!]] Boptagon''''' is a memory game designated to test how fast the players can respond to specific commands. Set inside a ring called the \"Boptagon\", the players each operate one of 8 stations: Twist It, Pull It, Shout It, Kick It, Whack It, Honk It, Crash It, and Bop It. The players will hear a command, and they must obey it in time. They might also hear \"Rotate It\" and \"Reverse It\". When they hear one of these commands, they move one station left for Rotate It, and one station right for Reverse It. If one or more players fail to correctly obey the command, does their command if it is not the one called, or goes in the wrong direction during \"Rotate It\" or \"Reverse It\", they are knocked out. The family with one or more of their team left in the Boptagon is the winner.\n\n====Guesstures Free Fall====\nIn '''''Guesstures Free Fall''''', a variation of the charades game ''Guesstures'', one family member has two minutes to guess things or actions mimed by the other three family members, each suspended in mid-air by wires. 10 points are awarded for each correct answer, but if the family member who guesses decides to pass on an item or if the family member who mimes makes a noise while doing so, the miming player is then lowered, [[freefall]]-style, behind the Guesstures barrier. The answer is then revealed, and another of the family members suspended in mid-air gets to [[mime]]. The family with the most points wins the round. Ties are broken by determining which family made the fewest passes.\n\nA subsequent rules change for this game had the time limit reduced to 45 seconds, with all three family members acting out things or actions for the fourth member to guess. The same scoring rules remained in effect. At the 30-second mark, one of the family members is lowered, followed by another at the 15-second mark. Passing is allowed only 3 times.\n\nA later rule change doubled the time limit to 90 seconds, with each family member being given 30 seconds to act out progressively harder words.  In the first 30 seconds, the younger child will act out words for 10 points each.  In the middle 30, the older child will act out 20-point words, and in the last 30 seconds, the adult will act out words for 30 points each. Guessers are still only allowed 3 passes.\n\nThe 2-minute version of ''Guesstures Free Fall'' continued for the second season, with the addition of a short fanfare playing once three members from each family rise up in mid-air. Guessers are allowed infinite passes.\n\n====Operation Relay====\n'''''[[Operation (game)|Operation]] Relay''''' is where the families take turns in family order get the pieces from Cavity Sam using tongs. If they hit the edge, the person is buzzed and has to go to the end of the line. If they get the piece, they have to limbo under bones (called the \"limbone\"), walk across two balance beams, jump over two hurdles, then go through a giant tissue box. If they do something wrong they do not get the points. If they trip over or miss an obstacle, they have to go to the end of the line. Each family is given 2 or 2\u00bd minutes, with the family scoring the most points winning the game. If a tie occurs the family with the least amount of buzzes from Sam is the winner.\n\n====Bounce 'n Boogie Boggle====\nOn a 5-by-5 grid that resembles a '''[[Boggle]]''' board (in fact, a \"Big Boggle\" board), family members take turns searching for words. A player announces a word, then walking to the first letter in the word, spells it out by jumping from square to square to spell them, scoring 1 point for each letter in a correct word. As in the board game, words must be at least 3 letters long, and the letters used in spelling the word must touch each other in the grid orthogonally or diagonally. If a player spells a word that has two letters, backtracks (uses a letter square they have already used in the given word), spells a word incorrectly, uses unconnected letters, spells a word different from their announced word, steps on the same letter twice, use contraction words, or fails to come up with a word in time, that player's turn is lost. The family that scores the most points in the 2-minute time limit wins. Also, if a family member spells a pre-determined 6-, 7-, or 8- letter Secret Word [shown to the home viewers], that family wins an additional bonus prize.\n\n====Connect 4 Basketball====\nIn this variation on the vertical checkers game '''[[Connect Four]]''', the checkers are replaced with red and yellow balls. Family members take turns in family order throwing those balls into baskets on a 7x6 board, in order to get 4 in a row in any direction.\n\nIn an early episode, players from both teams shot their red and yellow balls at the same time. The first team to make 4 in a row won one round; the first to win two rounds won the game.\n\n====Twister Lights Out====\nIn this variation on '''[[Twister (game)|Twister]]''', family members have to follow commands like \"left foot, blue\", with the dots shown on a floor-level video board. As play goes on, the dots disappear one by one, clockwise. If a family member's hand or foot is on a dot about to disappear, he/she must move their hand/foot to another dot of the same color. If a family member either [1] has a body part that's on a disappeared dot, [2] does not follow the command on time, [3] has any body part other than hands or feet on the board, [4] has their hand or foot off of the Twister board or [5] has their body part on the wrong color or wrong body part on the same color, it's *boom* lights out for them.\n\nThe first round has the kids participating; the second round has the adults taking part. Whichever family has one player standing wins a round; two rounds win the game. If a third round is needed, Todd tosses a coin, with heads indicating that the kids play, and tails indicating the adults play; whichever family wins that round then wins the game.\n\n====Sorry! Sliders====\nIn this big version of '''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]] Sliders''', each family has two giant-sized rolling pawns. One player from each family pushes the pawns into one of the 4 rings with point values starting at 5 in the center, then 3, 1 and The Sorry Ring, which is worth no points, in the outer area. Players can push their opponents' pawns to affect the scoring. Each round consists of 2 rolls per family. The family with the most points wins the round, and the first family to win 2 rounds wins the game. If a round is tied, each family gets a half-win. If tied after 2 rounds, a \"slide-off\" takes place with only one roll per family; the most points wins. Starting in season 2, each team places a special prize dot on the board (except that they cannot place their dots on the 5-point zone). If a team's pawn is at least partially on their own prize dot at the end of the round, their team wins a prize; if their pawn is on their opponent's dot at the end of the round, that pawn does not count for any points.\n\n====Yahtzee Bowling====\nIn this variation of '''[[Yahtzee]]''', the dice are represented as 5 six-sided [[bowling pins]] with dice pips numbered 1 through 6 on every pin. Each family gets three chances to roll a [[bowling ball]] down a lane and knock down the pins to make the best scoring combination possible\u2014in order from least to best: a pair, two pair, three of a kind, a small straight, a full house, a large straight, four of a kind, or Yahtzee (five of a kind).\n\nThe family with the best combination wins a frame; two frames win the game. If a third frame is required after the families split the first two, each family gets only one roll, with the best combination winning the game. The family who makes a Yahtzee also receives a bonus prize.\n\n====[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] Crazy Cash Machine====\nKnown as the final game of the show, both teams use the Crazy Cash Cards from the Crazy Cash Corner to earn cash. The Crazy Cash Corner holds 21 cards in a 3x7 grid featuring Monopoly tokens. Both teams start with one card and they can earn more by winning games. Each player from a team inserts the card to the machine and a random amount of cash is added to their bank with the highest amount ranging from $7,500 to $25,000. When that happens, [[Monopoly money]] will come out of the machine. The team with the most cash when all of the cards are used earns a vacation. Even if a family loses, both teams get to keep their money. Starting with season three, one family plays the game for a car, but with 16 cards.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn addition to the return of ''Bop It Boptagon'', ''Bounce 'n Boogie Boggle'', ''Connect 4 Basketball'', ''Cranium'', ''Guesstures Freefall'', ''Sorry! Sliders'', ''Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine'' and ''Yahtzee Bowling'', new games were introduced. Also, ''Guess Who?'' is no longer the opening game, and ''Operation Relay'' and ''Scrabble Flash'' (now used on ''[[Scrabble Showdown]]'') were removed. Also, teams earn \"Monopoly Party Packages\" for winning each game.\n\n====Cranium Brain Break====\nEach episode now starts off with a ''Cranium Brain Break'' where teams perform a ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]''-esque stunt, such as trying to throw two rings onto a ''Sorry!'' Slider, or getting more balls in a basket on host Newton's head in 30 seconds. In a timed event, if the game ends in a tie, the first team that scores in the game wins.\n\n====Cranium Guesstimator====\nSimilar to the educated guess questions on ''[[Card Sharks]]'', one team is given a question that has a numeric answer. The other team must then predict if the actual answer is higher or lower than the first team's guess. The kids play first for questions worth 10, 20, 30 and 40 points, then the adults play more difficult questions for double points. Highest score wins. If there is a tie, one final question is read, and each team makes a numeric guess, with the closest guess winning.\n\n====Cranium Who's Older====\nTeams take turns being shown a pair of people and/or things and identifying which one is older. Right answers win points, wrong answers forfeit the points the opposing team. The kids play four questions worth 10 points each, then the adults play four questions at double points. Highest score wins. If there is a tie, one final question is played, and the team that buzzes in first gets to answer, with the winner determined by their right or wrong answer.\n\n====Simon Flash====\nA variation on '''[[Simon (game)|Simon]]''', families wear giant cubes around their bodies, colored red, yellow, green, and blue, like the actual game. A sequence appears on screen and families arrange themselves to match the sequence to score a point. Each player's color randomly changes after each score. First to five points wins.\n\n====Operation Sam Dunk====\nReplacing ''Operation Relay'' this season, this game involves rolling skee-balls to land in various cavities on Sam's body to score points. In addition, a bell (for Ringing In The Ear) is installed to double the team's total score if hit. (If no one has tried for the bell yet after the first round, Newton will call attention to it.) Each family member gets two rolls in family order. Highest score wins.\n\n====Ratuki Go-Round====\nA variation on ''Ratuki'', this game involves a relay race to get rid of twenty cards, with values from 1 to 4 on it, and the final 20th card with a value of 5 on it (displayed by different types of pictures). Players can only place a card that's one number higher or lower than the previous card that is placed. Also, the final 5 cannot be placed down before all the other cards are gone. Breaking the rules causes you to freeze for 10 seconds. The first family to place all their cards wins.\n\nMidway through the season, the rules was adjusted. If the family places the wrong card, their opponents will automatically win the game. In addition, regular 5's have been added to the team's decks. If they place a 5 card, their opponents freeze for 10 seconds. The final 5, however, must still be played last in order to win.\n\n====Trouble Pop Quiz====\nThe kids are asked number-based questions, using a larger-than-life Pop-o-Matic to answer. A right answer or a false start from the opponent moves mom or dad forward the number of spaces shown on the die. Landing on an opponent's space sends the opponent back a space. First team to get both parents past the finish line wins.\n\n====Green Scream====\nKids roll around on a green screen floor, revealing pictures (associated with a category) for the parents to guess in 90 seconds. Up to ten are used per family and a right answer scores ten points. Highest score after the game wins. If there is a tie after the 90 second time limit, the team who correctly solved the words in the fastest time wins.\n\n====Spelling Bee====\nMom wears a \"stinger\" (a black marker) on her back to spell out words for other family members. The moms are not allowed to talk, or else the word is disqualified. They are, however, sometimes encouraged to make \"buzzing\" noises like a bee. If a family can't guess the word after the third letter, host Newton gives a clue to the word. Each right answer is worth 100 points, and each family has 90 seconds to guess as many words as possible. Highest score wins. Ties are broken by who took the least time to score their words.\n\n===Season 3===\nThough some of the basic games were held over from the previous seasons, they were changed in some ways to accommodate the show's new format as well as the addition of some new games. Simon Flash and Connect 4 Basketball, so far, are the only games to remain unchanged. Also, Stacey J. Aswad took over the announcing duties replacing [[Burton Richardson (announcer)|Burton Richardson]]. After each game is played, each team picks a combination code for the [[Chance and Community Chest cards|Community Chest]] near the end of the show. Each combination has three specified colors, and if the chest is opened, the teams will play for a new car. If the chest is not opened, the teams keep the prizes they won earlier.\n\n====[[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]====\nThe players stand behind podiums with a button. On the 5x5 floor grid, six ships (3 [[cruisers]], 2 [[submarines]] and a [[battleship]]) are hidden under [[coordinates]] that the players call out on the board (for example: B3). Once the coordinate is locked in, Newton and the audience must do a three-second countdown. Once the \"Launch!\" signal is given, the player presses the button which launches a virtual peg from the [[video screen]] in the background. Each hit sinks a ship and three sunken ships wins the game. If the family has a score of 3\u20132 without any misses, the family with 2 ships sunk will have a chance to get a prize like their opponents did, so that both families win the same prize. The winners get to draw a Community Chest combination code from [[Mr. Monopoly]]'s hand first and wins the game's prize package.\n\n====Sorry!====\nInstead of Sorry Sliders, the parent now dresses up as Sorry pieces and are moved down a path with different dollar amounts from $100 to $900 in $100 steps by their child(s) choosing a card with either a number of spaces to move ranging from one to four, or \"Sorry\" on them. The players can stop on any of the spaces and win the cumulative amount of money they landed on or continue on towards the prize at the end. If a \"Sorry\" card is drawn, the parent is moved back to start and they lose the money in their bank at that point. If the other \"Sorry\" card is drawn, the game is over. At the end of the game, the family draws a combination card for the Community Chest.\n\n====Operation====\nIn this variation, the family can win money. To begin with, the family gets one roll and they can earn up to three more by removing a piece from the parent's body. After that, they will use these rolls to earn money by rolling into Cavity Sam, which is similar to Operation Sam Dunk from the show's second season. The family can win up to $4,000 in cash and they will also earn a Community Chest combination card.\n\n====Yahtzee Bowling====\nAlthough fundamentally the same from the previous seasons, instead of two families competing with each other, one family is chosen from the audience and three members must bowl (one for each person), trying to build up a different combination of numbers. However, instead of the highest combination winning the game in earlier seasons, each combination is assigned a different prize the family can win after they have all played ranging from cameras to a vacation. At the end of the game, they proceed to draw a Community Chest combination card.\n\n====Bop It! Boptagon====\nThough fundamentally the same as the previous seasons, the Boptagon is now smaller and accommodates only one player at a time in teams of two. Each player gets thirty seconds to get as many commands as possible. The new commands include \"Chop it!\" and \"Squeeze It!\" (which replace Twist It and Shout It). After two rounds of play with both team members, the team with the most correct commands wins the game. After that, the two teams will receive a Community Chest combination card.\n\n====Twister Lights Out====\nBasically the same as the previous season, there are several changes. First, there is the new command of \"air,\" which means the players must raise the indicated body part up off the ground. Second, the dots no longer disappear one at a time but instead the entire border row flashes before it disappears all at once.\n\n====Monopoly Community Chest====\n{{see also|Chance and Community Chest cards}}\n\nAll teams have a chance to play for a car by using a combination card from the previous games they've played during the show. Each card has three colors ranging from red to blue. To unlock the chest, the team captain must input the three-color combination code that Newton calls out before pressing the button. If it's locked, a buzzer will sound, signaling a wrong combination. When that happens, that team will go back into the studio audience. If it opens however, then a fanfare will play and [[Monopoly money|cash]] will come out from the chest, which signals a winning combination. When that happens, that team will move on to the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine for a chance to win more money and a brand-new car.\n\n====Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine====\nThis is the same as in the previous seasons, but only one family can play with 16 Crazy Cash Cards in a 4x4 grid. Nine of the cards have cash, six of them have Go To Jail, and the last one has Win. Each time they get a Cash Card from each row, they will earn the corresponding amount on the card and move on to the next one. If a team gets a Go To Jail Card (rows two through four), the game is over, but they get to keep ''all'' the money they've earned along with the prizes from earlier. When that happens, Newton will reveal where in the top row the car is. However, if they get to the top row and successfully find the Win Card (the screen displays \"WIN!\" and \"GO TO JAIL\" on [[slot machine|slots]]), they'll earn a [[Jeep Patriot]] in Seasons 3 & 4, and a [[Ford Escape]] in Season 5, along with the prizes and the money they've accumulated.\n\n===Season 4===\nFor the show's fourth season, new games were introduced along with returning games, and some classic games were modified. Also, [[Andrew Kishino]] took over the announcing duties replacing Stacey J. Aswad, and the names in each selected family are shown on the big screen. Those families who lose their games receive $100. Combinations were still chosen from Mr. Monopoly's hand to open the Monopoly Community Chest before playing the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine.\n\n====Monopoly Remix====\nThe fast-dealing game of properties is re-imagined in a whole new way where a sharp eye and a good sense of recall are rewarded with cash and prizes. One family plays on a MONOPOLY-style virtual game board with two dark blue property spaces \u2014 Boardwalk and Park Place \u2014 and starts with $1,000 of [[Monopoly money|MONOPOLY money]]. In the first round, Boardwalk and Park Place are shuffled amongst two penalty spaces \u2014 Luxury Tax and Income Tax. Family members use keen vision and extreme concentration to follow the properties as they are rapidly shuffled around the playing field. If the family accurately identifies and places their jumbo-sized hotels where Boardwalk and Park Place landed on the game board, they keep the $1,000 of MONOPOLY money. If the family places their hotels on the penalty spaces, they pay the fine. In the first round, the penalty spaces cost $300 each. In the second round, a Street Repairs space is added and the penalty spaces cost $400 each. In the final round, the fines increase to $500 and a Bankrupt space is added. If a hotel is placed on Bankrupt (and/or they run out of MONOPOLY money), they lose everything. If the family has any MONOPOLY money left at the end of the game, they win the remaining money and a prize.\n\n====Jenga====\nTwo families remove and stack blocks on an oversized version of the iconic Jenga tower. The game starts with one member from each family picking a numbered disc from a box. The number indicates how many Jenga blocks the other family members have to pull from anywhere on the tower and stack on top within a two-minute time allotment. The tension builds with each turn as the tower gets perilously higher and unbalanced, and the families race against the clock. The teammates must alternate tagging each other removing and placing the blocks, as well as pressing their buzzer to stop their clock. The family who avoids knocking over the tower or running out of time during their turn wins the game. A family can be assessed a five-second penalty if one teammate does something out of turn.\n\n====Yahtzee====\nThe famous dice game is re-invented for the new season. Yahtzee is now played in two rounds by one family. The object of the game is to stop the spinning animated dice in order to get a Yahtzee, which is five-of-a-kind. Before the family plays, they answer one trivia question that has three correct answers. Each correct answer earns them one WILD space on all five dice; the WILD space can represent any number on the dice and helps the family get closer to the ultimate five-of-a-kind Yahtzee. If they get Yahtzee in three rolls or less, they win a prize.\n\n====[[Barrel of Monkeys (game)|Barrel of Monkeys]]====\nIn order to win the game, the sole family playing pulls virtual [[monkey]] chains of varying lengths out of ten big lettered barrels ranging from A to J and correctly hangs them in sequential order on one of five colored trees. But it is not as easy as it sounds. The family has to be strategic when placing each monkey chain in order to win the game. For example, if a family picks a barrel with a chain of nine animated monkeys and places it on the red tree on the far right, they could potentially lose the game if the next barrel they pick has a chain of ten monkeys. To help them out, one barrel's dubbed the Top Banana & if chosen, gives the family a save in case they make a mistake. The monkey will show the viewers which lettered barrel the Top Banana is located before the game starts.\n\n====Bop It! Boptagon====\nThough fundamentally the same as Season 3, the Boptagon has been altered. The \"Whack\" and \"Kick\" commands have been replaced with \"Lift\" and \"Dunk\" commands.\n\n====Monopoly Community Chest====\nThe Monopoly Community Chest has been altered. Before, contestants manually changed the combination lock to the three colors on their cards. This season, a slot was added for the combination cards to be inserted into so that the combination would automatically light up on the combination lock. If the light is red, the chest remains locked and they'll go back into the studio audience. If there is only one family remaining, then their combination would win for them. If it's green however, then it will unlock and the family will advance to the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine for more money and a brand-new car.\n\n====Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine====\nAlmost the same rules as Season 3 but the only differences are that the Iron card has been replaced by the Cat card (since the Cat replaces the Iron in the MONOPOLY board games.)\n\n===Season 5===\nSame games that are in the show's fourth season, but in the fifth season the show features celebrities playing with the families.  A victory awards $10,000 to a charity while a loss still awards half that amount or $5,000 to a charity of their choice. But they will not be eligible to participate in either the Monopoly Community Chest or the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine.\n\n====Sorry!====\nThe cards are re-themed, and the silver card is replaced by the yellow card.\n\n====Jenga ====\nThe rules are the same but now players take blocks out of the mini Jenga tower to know how many blocks players need to pull and stack on the tower.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|1742341|Family Game Night}}\n* [https://allspark.hasbro.com/shows/game-shows ''Game Shows''] at [[Allspark (company)|Allspark]]\n\n{{Hasbro Studios}}\n{{Discovery Family programs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Family Game Night (Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:Cable game shows]]\n[[Category:Discovery Family original programming]]\n[[Category:American television programs based on video games]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on board games]]\n[[Category:2010s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2010 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Scrabble on television]]\n[[Category:Monopoly (game)]]\n[[Category:Television series by Hasbro Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows based on Hasbro toys]]\n[[Category:Television game shows with incorrect disambiguation]]\n", "name_user": "Rfl0216", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Game_Night_(game_show)"}

With the technological advancements, the state has changed very rapidly. Himachal Pradesh is a multireligional, multicultural as well as multilingual state like other Indian states. Some of the most commonly spoken languages are [[Hindi]] and the various [[Himachali languages|Pahari]] languages.<ref name=dem2>{{cite web\n|url = http://123himachal.com/himachal/info.htm\n|title = The people and tribes\n|accessdate = 20 May 2007\n|publisher = www.123himachal.com\n}}</ref> The [[Hindu]] communities residing in Himachal include the ''[[Brahmin]]s'', ''[[Rajput]]s'', ''Kannets'', ''Rathis'' and ''[[Kolis]]''.

The carpets, leather works, shawls, paintings, metalware, woodwork and paintings are worth appreciating. Pashmina shawl is one of the products which is highly in demand not only in Himachal but all over the country. Himachali caps are also famous art work of the people.\n\nLocal music and dance reflects the cultural identity of the state. Through their dance and music, they entreat their gods during local festivals and other special occasions.\n\nApart from the fairs and festivals that are celebrated all over India, there are number of other fairs and festivals, including the temple fairs in nearly every region that are of great significance to Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe day to day food of ''Himachalis'' is very similar to the rest of the north India. They too have [[lentil]], [[broth]], [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s and [[bread]]. As compared to other states in north India non-vegetarian cuisine is more preferred. Some of the specialities of Himachal include ''Manee'',''Madeera'',''Pateer'', ''Chouck'', ''Bhagjery'' and ''chutney'' of Til.\n\nThe Annual Festival of Kasol knows as Himachal Hills Festival which take place on 30-31 December 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/himachal-to-celebrate-himachal-hills-festival-from-december-30-31/as67205358.cms|title=Himachal to celebrate Himachal Hills Festival from December 30-31|website=Times of India Travel}}</ref>\n\n==People and culture==\nAround 96% of the population of the state is of [[Hindu]]s.

The Lahaulis of [[Lahaul and Spiti]]  and native of spiti, Kinnaur region mainly comprises Buddhists.<ref>[http://www.himachalpradeshindia.com/culture-of-himachal-pradesh.html Ethnicity of Himachal Pradesh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402192358/http://www.himachalpradeshindia.com/culture-of-himachal-pradesh.html |date=2 April 2007 }} Retrieved 27 May 2007</ref> A percentage of people are also Tibetans. Muslim, Christian and Sikhs are in minority but they also enjoy the same rights as Hindus.\n\nThough [[Hindi]] is the state language, many people speak the various [[Western Pahari languages]]. A majority of the population is engaged in agricultural practices, however the more educated of them are now moving towards tertiary sectors.\nAs per the traditional dressing norms the dress of the Brahmin male includes dhoti, kurta, coat, waistcoat, turban and a hand towel while that of the Rajput male consists of tight fitting churidar pyjamas, a long coat and a starched turban. With the changing time the dress up of the people has now become a mixed one. Though the above-mentioned style is now hardly followed, people have started wearing western style of clothes.\n\nThe typical house is constructed of [[clay]] bricks and the roofs are of [[slate]]. In some areas the slate roof is also replaced by [[timber]].\n\n==Arts and crafts==\n{{details|Arts and crafts of Himachal Pradesh}}\nThe handicraft that comes out of this state are the carpets, leather works, shawls, paintings, metalware, woodwork and paintings. Pashmina shawl is the prity product which is highly in demand not only in Himachal but all over the country. Colourful Himachali caps are also famous art work of the people.

This automatically qualified Delf\u00edn a spot for the first time to a [[Copa Libertadores]], which made them the first team from the [[Manab\u00ed Province|Manabi]] province to enter an international tournament. On December 17, Delf\u00edn lost to [[C.S. Emelec|Emelec]] 2\u20130 in the second leg of the final for the [[Ecuadorian Serie A]] championship in el [[Estadio Jocay]] and therefore ended the season as runner-up.\n\nOn April 5, 2018, Delf\u00edn achieved its first international win after defeating 2\u20130 Chilean club [[Colo-Colo]] at the [[2018 Copa Libertadores]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Delf\u00edn sorprende a Colo Colo y le gana 2\u20130|trans-title=Delf\u00edn surprises Colo Colo and wins 2\u20130|url=http://conmebol.com/es/delfin-sorprende-colo-colo-y-le-gana-2-0|accessdate=7 April 2018|publisher=CONMEBOL|date=5 April 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref> Delf\u00edn ended in fourth place at the end of the season, which gave them a straight ticket to their second [[Copa Libertadores]]. \n[[File:Panor\u00e1mica del Estadio Jocay.JPG|thumb|365x365px|Estadio Jocay in Manta, Ecuador]]\n\n2019 marked the greatest year for the team as they won their first Seria A title, and the first time a team from their province won any title. The final was played against Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito.\n\n==Rivalries==\nThe club's biggest rival is [[LDU Portoviejo]] with whom they contest the ''Cl\u00e1sico Manabita''.<ref>http://www.eluniverso.com/deportes/2015/07/26/nota/5039965/liga-portoviejo-gano-clasico-manabita-serie-b</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n'''[[Ecuadorian Serie A|Serie A]]'''\n* '''Winners (1):''' [[2019 Campeonato Ecuatoriano de F\u00fatbol Serie A|2019]]\n* Runners-up (1): [[2017 Campeonato Ecuatoriano de F\u00fatbol Serie A|2017]]\n\n'''[[Ecuadorian Serie B|Serie B]]'''\n* '''Winners (2):''' 1989 E1, 2015\n* Runners-up (2): 1997, 2000\n\n'''[[Copa Ecuador]]'''\n* Runners-up (1): [[2019 Copa Ecuador|2019]]\n\n<br />\n[[File:Perro Muerto.jpg|thumb|362x362px|Delf\u00edn supporters at el Estadio Jocay.]]\n\n== Players ==\n{{updated|27 January 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat= VEN |pos=GK|name=[[Alain Baroja]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2|nat= ECU |pos=DF|name=Bryan Hern\u00e1ndez}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|nat= EQG |pos=MF|name=[[Niko Kata]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat= ECU |pos=DF|name=Roberto Luzarraga}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat= ECU |pos=DF|name=[[Jerry Le\u00f3n]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat= ECU |pos=FW|name=Juan Diego Rojas}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat= ECU |pos=MF|name=Richard Calder\u00f3n |other=on loan from [[Barcelona SC]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat= ECU |pos=MF|name=Francisco Mera}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat= ECU |pos=FW|name=[[Carlos Garc\u00e9s]]|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat= ECU |pos=FW|name=Janner Corozo}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat= ECU |pos=DF|name=Segundo Portocarrero |other=on loan from [[CS Emelec]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat= URU |pos=MF|name=[[Mart\u00edn Alaniz]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat= ECU |pos=FW|name=[[Jhon Cifuente| Jhon Jairo Cifuente]]}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no= 17|nat= ECU |pos=MF|name=Charles V\u00e9lez}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat= ECU |pos=MF|name=David Noboa}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat= COL |pos=FW|name=[[Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Valencia|Jos\u00e9 Valencia]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat= ECU |pos=FW|name=Alejandro Villalva}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat= ECU |pos=DF|name=[[Geovanny Nazareno]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat= URU |pos=DF|name=[[Agust\u00edn Ale]]|other=on loan from [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate (Montevideo)|River Plate]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat= ARG |pos=MF|name=[[Oscar Ben\u00edtez]] |other=on loan from [[Benfica]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=33|nat= ECU |pos=DF|name=[[Luis Cang\u00e1]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=80|nat= ECU |pos=MF|name=Julio Ortiz}}\n{{Fs player|no=99|nat= ECU |pos=GK|name=Dennis Corozo}}\n{{Fs player|no= \u2014|nat= ECU |pos=MF|name=[[Jonathan Gonz\u00e1lez (footballer, born 1995)|Jonathan Gonz\u00e1lez]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= \u2014|nat= ECU |pos=FW|name=[[Daniel Porozo]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Delf\u00edn Sporting Club}}\n*[https://www.delfinsc.ec/ Official website] {{in lang|es}}\n*[http://www.footlive.com/team/delfin-sc/ Delf\u00edn Sporting Club results]\n*https://www.delfinsc.com/\n\n{{Campeonato Ecuatoriano de F\u00fatbol}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delfin, Sporting Club}}\n[[Category:Delf\u00edn S.C.]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1989]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in Ecuador]]\n", "name_user": "Robby.is.on", "label": "safe", "comment": "Date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delf%C3%ADn_S.C."}

He played for six clubs but spent the majority of his career with [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]].\n\n==Playing career==\nShipley was one of several players discovered by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s scouting network in the North East and was brought to [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]] as a trainee in August 1975. After regular appearances for the reserves, he signed professional papers on his 18th birthday in March 1977. For the next two seasons he was a regular fixture in the reserves and, after a loan spell with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the end of the 1978\u201379 season, he eventually made his first team appearance as a substitute in a First Division match at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 21 August 1979. He started the next two games but despite an \"assist\" for the winning goal in a home victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] he never played for the Saints again.\n\nAfter a loan spell with [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in October 1979, he joined [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in January 1980 for a then club record \u00a345,000. A tenacious midfielder, he remained with Lincoln City for the next 5 years, making a total of 274 appearances and 52 goals. He was recently voted number 24 in the top 100 league legends at Lincoln. In his last game for Lincoln he was to witness a nightmare when 56 spectators were killed in a [[Bradford City stadium fire|horrendous stand fire]] while playing Bradford City.\n\nHe joined [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in July 1985 and was a regular member of the side who came runners-up in Division 2 in [[1985\u201386 in English football#Second Division 2|1985\u201386]], thus gaining promotion to the First Division. In 1986\u201387, Shipley managed to hang on to his place in the team who struggled to avoid relegation. He then joined [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] for the next two seasons, before returning to Lincoln City on a non-contract basis for a short period at the end of 1989.\n\n==Training career==\nAfter a period scouting for [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]], he returned to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] as youth team manager in July 1991 before quickly moving on to fill a similar position at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. In June 1994, he became assistant manager at [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]].

By the [[American Revolution]], most residents lived near the [[Cambridge Common|Common]] and Harvard College, with most of the town comprising farms and estates. Most inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of [[Anglicans|Anglican]] \"worthies\" who were not involved in village life, made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along \"the Road to Watertown\" (today's [[Brattle Street (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Brattle Street]], still known as [[Tory Row]]).\n\nComing north from [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]], George Washington took command of the volunteer American soldiers camped on Cambridge Common on July 3, 1775,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} now reckoned the birthplace of the [[U.S. Army]].{{efn|The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.}} Most of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, [[Henry Knox]] arrived with artillery captured from [[Fort Ticonderoga]], which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston.\n\n[[File:Cambridge 1873 WardMap.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of Cambridge from 1873]]\nBetween 1790 and 1840, Cambridge grew rapidly, with the construction of the [[West Boston Bridge]] in 1792 connecting Cambridge directly to Boston, so that it was no longer necessary to travel {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Boston Neck]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to cross the Charles River. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new [[Middlesex Canal]]. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and [[marsh]]land into prime industrial and residential districts.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution. It was home to some of the famous Fireside Poets\u2014so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. The [[Fireside Poets]]\u2014[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]\u2014were highly popular and influential in their day.\n\nSoon after, [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were built: the [[Cambridge and Concord Turnpike]] (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]] (Hampshire St. and [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Ave.]] northwest of [[Porter Square]]), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets connected various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, the town was connected to the [[Boston & Maine Railroad]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=96}} leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] from the formerly rural parts of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].\n\n[[File:1852 Middlesex Canal (Massachusetts) map.jpg|thumb|1852 Map of Boston area showing Cambridge and regional rail lines and highlighting the course of the [[Middlesex Canal]].

The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge led to three major changes: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and [[Alewife Brook]]; the ice-cutting industry launched by [[Frederic Tudor]] on [[Fresh Pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Fresh Pond]]; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to house the thousands of immigrants who arrived to work in the new industries.\n\nFor many decades, the city's largest employer was the [[New England Glass Company]], founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century it was the world's largest and most modern glassworks. In 1888, [[Edward Libbey|Edward Drummond Libbey]] moved all production to [[Toledo, Ohio]], where it continues today under the name [[Owens-Illinois]]. The company's flint glassware with heavy lead content is prized by antique glass collectors. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] has a large collection. The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and the Sandwich Glass Museum on [[Cape Cod]] also have a few pieces.\n\nIn 1895, [[Edwin Ginn]] founder of [[Ginn and Company]] built the [[Athenaeum Press]] Building for his publishing text book empire.\n\nBy 1920, Cambridge was one of [[New England]]'s main industrial cities, with nearly 120,000 residents. Among the largest businesses in Cambridge during the period of industrialization was [[Carter's Ink Company]], whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the world's largest ink manufacturer.

It also began to become an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important as both a landowner and an institution, but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. When Radcliffe College was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation's most academically talented female students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's move from Boston in 1916 reinforced Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.\n\nAfter the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. In Cambridge Highlands, the technology company [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek, & Newman]] produced [[Interface Message Processor|the first network router]] in 1969, and hosted the invention of computer-to-computer email in 1971. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups. Those selling advanced [[minicomputer]]s were overtaken by the [[microcomputer]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Cambridge-based [[VisiCorp]] made the first [[spreadsheet]] software for personal computers, [[Visicalc]], and helped propel the [[Apple II]] to major consumer success. It was overtaken and purchased by Cambridge-based [[Lotus Development]], maker of [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. (This was in turn replaced in the market by [[Microsoft Excel]]).\n\nThe city continues to be home to many startups. Kendall Square was a major software hub through the [[dot-com boom]] and today hosts offices of such technology companies as Google, [[Microsoft]], and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. The Square also now houses the headquarters of [[Akamai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/locations.jsp |title=Locations \u2013 Akamai |website=Akamai.com |accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Harvard's plans to start experiments with recombinant DNA led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel. In the end, Cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977. This led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when [[Biogen]] opened a lab in 1982, in contrast to the hostility that caused the Genetic Institute (a Harvard spinoff) to abandon Somerville and Boston for Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/17/how-cambridge-became-the-life-sciences-capital/ |title=How Cambridge became the life sciences capital}}</ref> The biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in Cambridge, which now includes headquarters for Biogen and [[Genzyme]]; laboratories for [[Novartis]], [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], [[Alnylam Pharmaceuticals|Alnylam]], [[Ironwood Pharmaceuticals|Ironwood]], [[Catabasis Pharmaceuticals|Catabasis]], [[Moderna Therapeutics]], [[Editas Medicine]]; support companies such as [[Cytel]]; and many smaller companies.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most costly housing markets in the Northeastern United States.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Glaeser |first=E.

[[Cambridgeport]] is south of Central Square along Magazine Street and Brookline Street.\n* Harvard Square, formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and JFK Street. This is the primary site of Harvard University and a major Cambridge shopping area. It is served by a [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Red Line station]]. Harvard Square was originally the Red Line's northwestern terminus and a major transfer point to streetcars that also operated in a short [[Harvard Bus Tunnel|tunnel]]\u2014which is still a major bus terminal, although the area under the Square was reconfigured dramatically in the 1980s when the Red Line was extended.

Both [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[I-93 (MA)|Interstate 93]] also provide additional access on the eastern end of Cambridge at Leverett Circle in Boston. [[Massachusetts State Highway 2A|Route 2A]] runs the length of the city, chiefly along Massachusetts Avenue. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges connecting Cambridge to Boston, including the Longfellow Bridge and the [[Harvard Bridge]], eight of which are open to motorized road traffic.\n\nCambridge has an irregular street network because many of the roads date from the colonial era. Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns, and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Today, the major \"squares\" are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as Massachusetts Avenue between Harvard Square and Central Square, or Hampshire Street between Kendall Square and Inman Square.\n\n==== Mass transit ====\n[[File:Outbound platform at Central station, April 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Central (MBTA)|Central Station]] on the [[MBTA Red Line]]]]\nCambridge is served by the [[MBTA]], including the Porter Square Station on the regional [[MBTA Commuter Rail|Commuter Rail]]; the Lechmere Station on the Green Line; and the Red Line at [[Alewife Station (MBTA)|Alewife]], [[Porter (MBTA)|Porter Square]], Harvard Square, Central Square, and [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall Square/MIT]] Stations. Alewife Station, the terminus of the Red Line, has a large multi-story parking garage (at a rate of $7 per day {{as of|lc=y|2015}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=10029 |title=> Schedules & Maps > Subway > Alewife Station |publisher=MBTA |accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Harvard Bus Tunnel, under Harvard Square, connects to the Red Line underground. This tunnel was originally opened for streetcars in 1912, and served trackless trolleys ([[trolleybus]]es) and buses as the routes were converted; four lines of the [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston|MBTA trolleybus system]] continue to use it. The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s.\n\nBesides the state-owned transit agency, the city is also served by the Charles River Transportation Management Agency (CRTMA) shuttles which are supported by some of the largest companies operating in city, in addition to the municipal government itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |title=Charles River TMA Members |date=January 1, 2013 |work=CRTMA |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127055722/http://charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |archivedate=November 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Cycling ====\nCambridge has several [[bike path]]s, including one along the Charles River,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117145514/http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 17, 2004 |title=Dr. Paul Dudley White Bikepath |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Cambridge Linear Park|Linear Park]] connecting the [[Minuteman Bikeway]] at Alewife with the [[Somerville Community Path]].

On several central MIT streets, bike lanes transfer onto the sidewalk.

By the [[American Revolution]], most residents lived near the [[Cambridge Common|Common]] and Harvard College, with most of the town comprising farms and estates. Most inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of [[Anglicans|Anglican]] \"worthies\" who were not involved in village life, made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along \"the Road to Watertown\" (today's [[Brattle Street (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Brattle Street]], still known as [[Tory Row]]).\n\nComing north from [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]], George Washington took command of the volunteer American soldiers camped on Cambridge Common on July 3, 1775,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} now reckoned the birthplace of the [[U.S. Army]].{{efn|The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.}} Most of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, [[Henry Knox]] arrived with artillery captured from [[Fort Ticonderoga]], which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston.\n\n[[File:Cambridge 1873 WardMap.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of Cambridge from 1873]]\nBetween 1790 and 1840, Cambridge grew rapidly, with the construction of the [[West Boston Bridge]] in 1792 connecting Cambridge directly to Boston, so that it was no longer necessary to travel {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Boston Neck]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to cross the Charles River. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new [[Middlesex Canal]]. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and [[marsh]]land into prime industrial and residential districts.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution. It was home to some of the famous Fireside Poets\u2014so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. The [[Fireside Poets]]\u2014[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]\u2014were highly popular and influential in their day.\n\nSoon after, [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were built: the [[Cambridge and Concord Turnpike]] (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]] (Hampshire St. and [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Ave.]] northwest of [[Porter Square]]), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets connected various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, the town was connected to the [[Boston & Maine Railroad]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=96}} leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] from the formerly rural parts of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].\n\n[[File:1852 Middlesex Canal (Massachusetts) map.jpg|thumb|1852 Map of Boston area showing Cambridge and regional rail lines and highlighting the course of the [[Middlesex Canal]].

The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge led to three major changes: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and [[Alewife Brook]]; the ice-cutting industry launched by [[Frederic Tudor]] on [[Fresh Pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Fresh Pond]]; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to house the thousands of immigrants who arrived to work in the new industries.\n\nFor many decades, the city's largest employer was the [[New England Glass Company]], founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century it was the world's largest and most modern glassworks. In 1888, [[Edward Libbey|Edward Drummond Libbey]] moved all production to [[Toledo, Ohio]], where it continues today under the name [[Owens-Illinois]]. The company's flint glassware with heavy lead content is prized by antique glass collectors. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] has a large collection. The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and the Sandwich Glass Museum on [[Cape Cod]] also have a few pieces.\n\nIn 1895, [[Edwin Ginn]] founder of [[Ginn and Company]] built the [[Athenaeum Press]] Building for his publishing text book empire.\n\nBy 1920, Cambridge was one of [[New England]]'s main industrial cities, with nearly 120,000 residents. Among the largest businesses in Cambridge during the period of industrialization was [[Carter's Ink Company]], whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the world's largest ink manufacturer.

It also began to become an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important as both a landowner and an institution, but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. When Radcliffe College was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation's most academically talented female students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's move from Boston in 1916 reinforced Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.\n\nAfter the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. In Cambridge Highlands, the technology company [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek, & Newman]] produced [[Interface Message Processor|the first network router]] in 1969, and hosted the invention of computer-to-computer email in 1971. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups. Those selling advanced [[minicomputer]]s were overtaken by the [[microcomputer]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Cambridge-based [[VisiCorp]] made the first [[spreadsheet]] software for personal computers, [[Visicalc]], and helped propel the [[Apple II]] to major consumer success. It was overtaken and purchased by Cambridge-based [[Lotus Development]], maker of [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. (This was in turn replaced in the market by [[Microsoft Excel]]).\n\nThe city continues to be home to many startups. Kendall Square was a major software hub through the [[dot-com boom]] and today hosts offices of such technology companies as Google, [[Microsoft]], and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. The Square also now houses the headquarters of [[Akamai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/locations.jsp |title=Locations \u2013 Akamai |website=Akamai.com |accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Harvard's plans to start experiments with recombinant DNA led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel. In the end, Cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977. This led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when [[Biogen]] opened a lab in 1982, in contrast to the hostility that caused the Genetic Institute (a Harvard spinoff) to abandon Somerville and Boston for Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/17/how-cambridge-became-the-life-sciences-capital/ |title=How Cambridge became the life sciences capital}}</ref> The biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in Cambridge, which now includes headquarters for Biogen and [[Genzyme]]; laboratories for [[Novartis]], [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], [[Alnylam Pharmaceuticals|Alnylam]], [[Ironwood Pharmaceuticals|Ironwood]], [[Catabasis Pharmaceuticals|Catabasis]], [[Moderna Therapeutics]], [[Editas Medicine]]; support companies such as [[Cytel]]; and many smaller companies.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most costly housing markets in the Northeastern United States.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Glaeser |first=E.

[[Cambridgeport]] is south of Central Square along Magazine Street and Brookline Street.\n* Harvard Square, formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and JFK Street. This is the primary site of Harvard University and a major Cambridge shopping area. It is served by a [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Red Line station]]. Harvard Square was originally the Red Line's northwestern terminus and a major transfer point to streetcars that also operated in a short [[Harvard Bus Tunnel|tunnel]]\u2014which is still a major bus terminal, although the area under the Square was reconfigured dramatically in the 1980s when the Red Line was extended.

Both [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[I-93 (MA)|Interstate 93]] also provide additional access on the eastern end of Cambridge at Leverett Circle in Boston. [[Massachusetts State Highway 2A|Route 2A]] runs the length of the city, chiefly along Massachusetts Avenue. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges connecting Cambridge to Boston, including the Longfellow Bridge and the [[Harvard Bridge]], eight of which are open to motorized road traffic.\n\nCambridge has an irregular street network because many of the roads date from the colonial era. Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns, and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Today, the major \"squares\" are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as Massachusetts Avenue between Harvard Square and Central Square, or Hampshire Street between Kendall Square and Inman Square.\n\n==== Mass transit ====\n[[File:Outbound platform at Central station, April 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Central (MBTA)|Central Station]] on the [[MBTA Red Line]]]]\nCambridge is served by the [[MBTA]], including the Porter Square Station on the regional [[MBTA Commuter Rail|Commuter Rail]]; the Lechmere Station on the Green Line; and the Red Line at [[Alewife Station (MBTA)|Alewife]], [[Porter (MBTA)|Porter Square]], Harvard Square, Central Square, and [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall Square/MIT]] Stations. Alewife Station, the terminus of the Red Line, has a large multi-story parking garage (at a rate of $7 per day {{as of|lc=y|2015}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=10029 |title=> Schedules & Maps > Subway > Alewife Station |publisher=MBTA |accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Harvard Bus Tunnel, under Harvard Square, connects to the Red Line underground. This tunnel was originally opened for streetcars in 1912, and served trackless trolleys ([[trolleybus]]es) and buses as the routes were converted; four lines of the [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston|MBTA trolleybus system]] continue to use it. The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s.\n\nBesides the state-owned transit agency, the city is also served by the Charles River Transportation Management Agency (CRTMA) shuttles which are supported by some of the largest companies operating in city, in addition to the municipal government itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |title=Charles River TMA Members |date=January 1, 2013 |work=CRTMA |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127055722/http://charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |archivedate=November 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Cycling ====\nCambridge has several [[bike path]]s, including one along the Charles River,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117145514/http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 17, 2004 |title=Dr. Paul Dudley White Bikepath |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Cambridge Linear Park|Linear Park]] connecting the [[Minuteman Bikeway]] at Alewife with the [[Somerville Community Path]].

On several central MIT streets, bike lanes transfer onto the sidewalk.
