It was noted by [[Thomas P. Grazulis|Grazulis]] and other researchers<ref name=Grazulis />{{rp|648}} that this outbreak developed near the center of a large-scale low, in a fashion resembling the 1925 Tri-State tornado. In this outbreak, the damage path was attributed to separate tornadoes, though one storm produced (on an estimated 250+ mile track) a family of 13 large tornadoes, 10 of which produced F3 or F4 damage, which was occasionally connected by swaths of downburst damage. The resulting [[tornado family]], the series of tornadoes in totality is among the longest on record.<ref name=\"Maddox\">{{cite journal |last = Maddox |first = Robert A. |first2= M.

The northern part of the same system first spawned additional severe (non-tornadic) thunderstorms, which caused 4 additional deaths in [[Maryland]] and [[Pennsylvania]], before then dropping snow, sleet and ice across a wide area of the northeast. The thunderstorms which produced the tornado outbreak were also responsible (according to the same data) for numerous reports of large hail and wind damage in [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] southwest North Carolina, and numerous larger cities ([[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]], [[Columbia, South Carolina]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], [[Dover, Delaware]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[Suffolk, Virginia]], [[Norfolk, Virginia]]) at the periphery of the outbreak, with wind damage from thunderstorms reported as far north as [[Delaware]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]\n* [[Fujita scale]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Grazulis, Thomas P.

It was noted by [[Thomas P. Grazulis|Grazulis]] and other researchers<ref name=Grazulis />{{rp|648}} that this outbreak developed near the center of a large-scale low, in a fashion resembling the 1925 Tri-State tornado. In this outbreak, the damage path was attributed to separate tornadoes, though one storm produced (on an estimated 250+ mile track) a family of 13 large tornadoes, 10 of which produced F3 or F4 damage, which was occasionally connected by swaths of downburst damage. The resulting [[tornado family]], the series of tornadoes in totality is among the longest on record.<ref name=\"Maddox\">{{cite journal |last = Maddox |first = Robert A. |first2= M.

The northern part of the same system first spawned additional severe (non-tornadic) thunderstorms, which caused 4 additional deaths in [[Maryland]] and [[Pennsylvania]], before then dropping snow, sleet and ice across a wide area of the northeast. The thunderstorms which produced the tornado outbreak were also responsible (according to the same data) for numerous reports of large hail and wind damage in [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] southwest North Carolina, and numerous larger cities ([[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]], [[Columbia, South Carolina]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], [[Dover, Delaware]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[Suffolk, Virginia]], [[Norfolk, Virginia]]) at the periphery of the outbreak, with wind damage from thunderstorms reported as far north as [[Delaware]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]\n* [[Fujita scale]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Grazulis, Thomas P.

Across the country, there are more than 210 pipeline systems that total more than 305,000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipelines.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/index.html US Energy Information Administration website, accessed September 18 2010]</ref>\n\nOf the lower 48 US states, those with the most natural gas pipeline running through them are Texas (58,588 miles), Louisiana (18,900), Oklahoma (18,539), Kansas (15,386), Illinois (11,900) and California (11,770).  The states with the least natural gas pipeline are Vermont and New Hampshire.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/index.html US Energy Information Administration website, accessed September 18 2010]</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n[[File:Gas Valve Cover.jpg|thumb|right|A gas valve cover in Boston, Massachusetts.]]\nThe U.S. DOT Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) administers the national regulatory program to assure the safe and environmentally sound transportation of natural gas, liquefied natural gas and hazardous liquids by pipeline.  The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] reviews and authorizes the operation of the interstate natural gas pipelines.<ref>[http://www.ferc.gov/about/ferc-does.asp FERC website, accessed September 18 2010]</ref> Intrastate pipelines that run within one state and do not cross state boundaries are typically regulated by a state government agency. For example, in Texas, the [[Railroad Commission of Texas]]<ref>[http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/ Railroad Commission of Texas website, accessed September 18 2010]</ref> regulates pipelines, and in Louisiana, it is the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.<ref>[http://dnr.louisiana.gov/sec/execdiv/about-dnr.htm Louisiana Dept of Natural Resources, accessed September 18 2010]</ref>\n\n==Development==\nMuch of the natural gas pipeline system was constructed in the 1930s and 1940s before many of the then small towns and rural areas across the country were developed into today's larger cities and suburban areas.\n\nMany gas pipelines were made \u2014 and continue to be made today \u2013 of steel in diameters of 6&nbsp;inches (15&nbsp;cm) to up to 48&nbsp;inches (1.2 m).<ref>[http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport.asp Natural Gas Supply Association, accessed September 18 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101062510/http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport.asp |date=2011-01-01 }}</ref>  Since [[9/11]], for national security purposes, detailed maps of gas pipelines are not available to the general public.\n\n==Safety==\n\nOver the years, there have been many natural gas explosions involving pipelines in which people have been injured or killed.  The most recent was the [[2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion]] that killed at least four people, injured 60 and more victims are still missing.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/US/san-bruno-explosion-investigation-pipelines-run-homes-safe/story?id=11628120 ABC News, San Bruno Explosion, Are Pipelines That Run Under Homes Safe?, September 13 2010]</ref> Portions of the San Bruno pipeline had been built in 1956.\n\nIn ideal situations, pipeline inspection gauges or a \u201cPIG\u201d (see [[Pigging]]) is used to inspect and insure the safe operation of natural gas pipelines.   About 63 percent of all natural gas pipelines in the US cannot be properly inspected using a PIG, or automatic robot in the pipes, because the pipelines are either too old or they twist and turn and PIGs cannot operate in them.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39174246 NBC News News, Most US Gas Lines Don\u2019t Use Latest Technology, September 14 2010]</ref>\n\nMany experts and studies show that the inferior oversight of gas pipelines have led to hundreds of pipeline accidents that have \u201ckilled 60 people and injured 230 others in the last five years,\u201d according to the New York Times.

The states with the least natural gas pipeline are Vermont and New Hampshire.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/index.html US Energy Information Administration website, accessed Sept 18 2010]</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n[[File:Gas Valve Cover.jpg|thumb|right|A gas valve cover in Boston, Massachusetts.]]\nThe U.S. DOT Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) administers the national regulatory program to assure the safe and environmentally sound transportation of natural gas, liquefied natural gas and hazardous liquids by pipeline.  The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] reviews and authorizes the operation of the interstate natural gas pipelines.<ref>[http://www.ferc.gov/about/ferc-does.asp FERC website, accessed Sept 18 2010]</ref> Intrastate pipelines that run within one state and do not cross state boundaries are typically regulated by a state government agency. For example, in Texas, the [[Railroad Commission of Texas]]<ref>[http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/ Railroad Commission of Texas website, accessed Sept 18 2010]</ref> regulates pipelines, and in Louisiana, it is the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.<ref>[http://dnr.louisiana.gov/sec/execdiv/about-dnr.htm Louisiana Dept of Natural Resources, accessed Sept 18 2010]</ref>\n\n==Development==\nMuch of the natural gas pipeline system was constructed in the 1930s and 1940s before many of the then small towns and rural areas across the country were developed into today's larger cities and suburban areas.\n\nMany gas pipelines were made \u2014 and continue to be made today \u2013 of steel in diameters of 6&nbsp;inches (15&nbsp;cm) to up to 48&nbsp;inches (1.2 m).<ref>[http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport.asp Natural Gas Supply Association, accessed Sept 18 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101062510/http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport.asp |date=2011-01-01 }}</ref>  Since [[9/11]], for national security purposes, detailed maps of gas pipelines are not available to the general public.\n\n==Safety==\n\nOver the years, there have been many natural gas explosions involving pipelines in which people have been injured or killed.

About 63 percent of all natural gas pipelines in the US cannot be properly inspected using a PIG, or automatic robot in the pipes, because the pipelines are either too old or they twist and turn and PIGs cannot operate in them.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39174246 NBC News News, Most US Gas Lines Don\u2019t Use Latest Technology, Sept 14 2010]</ref>\n\nMany experts and studies show that the inferior oversight of gas pipelines have led to hundreds of pipeline accidents that have \u201ckilled 60 people and injured 230 others in the last five years,\u201d according to the New York Times.
