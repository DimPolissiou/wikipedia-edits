Flack, the first College Librarian. References in minutes of the University Council from the 1930s refer to the University Library's accession of significant gifts and deposits of archival materials, a process which accelerated after the war. The first archivist was appointed in 1948, and a separate Department of Manuscripts was established within the University Library in 1958 under the management of a newly appointed Keeper of the Manuscripts.\n\nSubsequent developments have added conservation facilities. With the move into new library premises in 1973 (the [[Hallward Library]]) the Department acquired purpose-built accommodation and facilities which supported a steady expansion in its holdings and activities.\n\nEarly or rare imprints of printed books formed the basis of Special Collections in the areas of arts and social sciences, science and engineering, medicine, agriculture and food sciences, and law. In addition, several of the subject libraries acquired particular named Special Collections, devoted to particular subjects or preserving the libraries of particular individuals and institutions. The East Midlands Collection was developed to serve both as a reference and loan collection for local studies and a special collection of early and rare imprints concerning the region.\n\nIn 1989 the Department of Manuscripts became the Department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, with a common reading room and staffing. Since then subject collections from the medical and law libraries have moved into Special Collections. The most substantial internal transfer was the acquisition in 1995 of the library of the former Institute of German, Austrian and Swiss Affairs, including both published and archival holdings.\n\nIn 2006 the department moved to new premises at [[King's Meadow Campus]], the University's new campus at Lenton Lane.  This provided a reading Room, Store, Conservation, reprographical digitisation workshops and offices, with space for more expansion.\n\nThe office has been appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] as a repository for specified classes of public records (hospital records; British Coal, research report series). It has been approved for the custody of collections of national significance accepted in lieu of tax. It is recognised by the [[Master of the Rolls]] as a repository for manorial documents. It is also approved by the [[Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham]] as a repository for the archive of the former [[Archdeaconry]] of Nottingham.\n\nIn October 2005, the Portland (London), Portland of Welbeck, and Newcastle of Clumber papers won recognition through the Designation Scheme of the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA), as being of outstanding national and international importance. The [[D. H. Lawrence|D.H.

Named after John L. Macdonald and Merl C. Kelce, the library opened on October 19, 1969. The building was designed by the architectural firm Fletcher-Valenti of Tampa, Florida.\n\n==Brief history==\nThe University of Tampa's main library was originally housed in early September 1933 in the old Tampa Bay Hotel's Grand Salon (i.e., ballroom). Its core collection consisted of donations from academic libraries such as [[Cornell University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Carlisle Barracks]]. Local citizens also contributed to the fledgling library with sizable donations like those of Harry F. Barrell (5,000 books), Perry G. Wall, Mayor of Tampa  (5,000 books), and James C. Alvord (4,000 books).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://utopia.ut.edu/history.htm|title= Library History|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= University of Tampa: UT Archives, History & Institutional Repository|publisher= University of Tampa|access-date= November 4, 2019|quote=}}</ref> When the University of Tampa was first opened in the 1931, it was Tampa Junior College.

Named after John L. Macdonald and Merl C. Kelce, the library opened on October 19, 1969. The building was designed by the architectural firm Fletcher-Valenti of Tampa, Florida.\n\n==Brief history==\nThe University of Tampa's main library was originally housed in early September 1933 in the old Tampa Bay Hotel's Grand Salon (i.e., ballroom). Its core collection consisted of donations from academic libraries such as [[Cornell University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Carlisle Barracks]]. Local citizens also contributed to the fledgling library with sizable donations like those of Harry F. Barrell (5,000 books), Perry G. Wall, Mayor of Tampa  (5,000 books), and James C. Alvord (4,000 books).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://utopia.ut.edu/history.htm|title= Library History|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= University of Tampa: UT Archives, History & Institutional Repository|publisher= University of Tampa|access-date= November 4, 2019|quote=}}</ref> When the University of Tampa was first opened in the 1931, it was Tampa Junior College.

The official Fujita scale category is determined by [[meteorologist]]s and [[civil engineer|engineers]] after a ground or [[Aerial_survey|aerial damage survey]], or both; and depending on the circumstances, ground-swirl patterns ([[cycloid]]al marks), [[weather radar]] data, witness testimonies, media reports and damage imagery, as well as [[photogrammetry]] or [[videogrammetry]] if motion picture recording is available. The Fujita scale was replaced with the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] (EF-Scale) in the [[United States]] in February 2007. In April 2013, [[Canada]] adopted the EF-Scale over the Fujita scale along with 31 \"Specific Damage Indicators\" used by [[Environment Canada]] (EC) in their ratings.<ref name=\"NOAA: Fujita Tornado Damage Scale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/f-scale.html |title=Fujita Tornado Damage Scale|website=spc.noaa.gov|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"FJFK: Fujita Scale - Tornado Damage Scale\">{{cite web|url=https://www.factsjustforkids.com/weather-facts/tornado-facts-for-kids/fujita-scale.html |title=Fujita Scale - Tornado Damage Scale|website=factsjustforkids.com|accessdate=June 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe scale was introduced in 1971 by [[Ted Fujita]] of the [[University of Chicago]], in collaboration with  [[Allen Pearson]], head of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center/NSSFC (currently the [[Storm Prediction Center]]/SPC). The scale was updated in 1973, taking into account path length and width. In the United States, starting in 1973, tornadoes were rated soon after occurrence. The Fujita scale was applied retroactively to tornadoes reported between 1950 and 1972 in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] National Tornado Database.

The Enhanced Fujita Scale was formulated due to research which suggested that the wind speeds required to inflict damage by intense tornadoes on the Fujita scale are greatly overestimated. A process of [[expert elicitation]] with top engineers and meteorologists resulted in the EF scale wind speeds, however, these are biased to United States construction practices. The EF scale also improved damage parameter descriptions.\n\n== Derivation ==\n[[File:Fujita scale technical.svg|right|200px]]\n\nThe original scale as derived by Fujita was a theoretical 13-level scale (F0\u2013F12) designed to smoothly connect the [[Beaufort scale]] and the [[Mach number]] scale. F1 corresponds to the twelfth level of the Beaufort scale, and F12 corresponds to Mach number 1.0. F0 was placed at a position specifying no damage (approximately the eighth level of the Beaufort scale), in analogy to how the Beaufort's zeroth level specifies little to no wind. From these wind speed numbers, [[qualitative data|qualitative]] descriptions of damage were made for each category of the Fujita scale, and then these descriptions were used to classify tornadoes.<ref name=\"enhancedIntro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/ |title=Storm Prediction Center|website=spc.noaa.gov|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}</ref> The diagram on the right illustrates the relationship between the Beaufort, Fujita, and Mach number scales.\n\nAt the time Fujita derived the scale, little information was available on damage caused by wind, so the original scale presented little more than educated guesses at [[wind speed]] ranges for specific tiers of damage. Fujita intended that only F0\u2013F5 be used in practice, as this covered all possible levels of damage to frame homes as well as the expected estimated bounds of wind speeds. He did, however, add a description for F6, which he phrased as \"inconceivable tornado\", to allow for wind speeds exceeding F5 and for possible future advancements in damage analysis which might show it.<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\"/>\n\nFurthermore, the original wind speed numbers have since been found to be higher than the actual wind speeds required to incur the damage described at each category. The error manifests itself to an increasing degree as the category increases, especially in the range of F3 through F5. NOAA notes that \"...&nbsp;precise wind speed numbers are actually guesses and have never been scientifically verified. Different wind speeds may cause similar-looking damage from place to place\u2014even from building to building. Without a thorough engineering analysis of tornado damage in any event, the actual wind speeds needed to cause that damage are unknown.\"<ref name=\"SPC FAQ\">[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/ Tornado FAQ].

Structural damage cannot exceed total destruction, which constitutes F5 damage. A tornado with wind speeds greater than {{convert|319|mph}} is theoretically possible, and the [[1999 Bridge Creek\u2013Moore tornado|1999 Bridge Creek-Moore Tornado]] may have been such an event.

Also, although the scale gave general descriptions for the type of damage a tornado could cause, it gave little leeway for strength of construction and other factors that might cause a building to receive higher damage at lower wind speeds.

Fujita| title = Proposed characterization of tornadoes and hurricanes by area and intensity| publisher = University of Chicago| year = 1971| location = Chicago }}</ref> Fujita and others recognized this immediately and intensive engineering analysis was conducted through the rest of the 1970s. This research, as well as subsequent research, showed that tornado wind speeds required to inflict the described damage were actually much lower than the F-scale indicated, particularly for the upper categories. Also, although the scale gave general descriptions for the type of damage a tornado could cause, it gave little leeway for strength of construction and other factors that might cause a building to receive higher damage at lower wind speeds. Fujita tried to address these problems somewhat in 1992 with the Modified Fujita Scale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/|title=NOAA's NWS Storm Prediction Center|first=Storm Prediction|last=Center|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}</ref> but by then he was semi-retired and the National Weather Service was not in a position for the undertaking of updating to an entirely new scale, so it went largely unenacted.<ref name=\"Fujita Memoirs\">{{cite book | last = Fujita| first = Tetsuya Theodore| authorlink = Ted Fujita| title = Memoirs of an Effort to Unlock the Mystery of Severe Storms| publisher = University of Chicago| year = 1992| location = Chicago }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, on February 1, 2007,<ref name=\"NOAA: Fujita Tornado Damage Scale\"/> the Fujita scale was decommissioned in favor of what these scientists believe is a more accurate Enhanced Fujita Scale, which replaces it. The meteorologists and engineers who designed the EF Scale believe it an improvement on the F-scale on many counts\u2014it accounts for different degrees of damage that occur with different types of structures, both man-made and natural. The expanded and refined damage indicators and degrees of damage standardize what was somewhat ambiguous. It also is thought to provide a much better estimate for wind speeds and sets no upper limit on the wind speeds for the strongest level, EF5. Several countries{{which|date=April 2014}} continue to use the original Fujita Scale.

Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were concerned because Marty often returned from being with Kent bleeding or covered in bruises. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym goers, both boys were rumored to use [[steroid]]s, which in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.\n\nKent and Puccio had experimented with making [[gay porn]] movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly [[Film director|directed]] them and coaxed a [[Florida]] man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled ''Rough Boys'', to porn shops across [[South Florida]]. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a [[dildo]].<ref>Schutze, pp. 52\u201358, 61\u201362, 77, 104</ref>\n\n==Murder==\nToward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time Puccio spent with Kent (aged 20) as well as Kent's treatment of Puccio, Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice (Ali) Willis (aged 17) with Kent.<ref>Schutze, p. 72-74</ref> Kent and Willis dated for a few weeks, but she ultimately ended the relationship because he was [[domestic violence|abusive]].<ref>Schutze, p. 75-76</ref> In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to end the friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant with Puccio\u2019s child, and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.<ref>Schutze, p. 87</ref>\n\nAllegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him.<ref>Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, events detailed in chapter 4.</ref> On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that \"Bobby Kent was planning to come to [[Palm Bay, Florida|Palm Bay]] [where Willis was living] to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.\"<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Puccio v.

Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).<ref>Schutze, pp. 98-100</ref>\n\nOn the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis' [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Mustang 5.0]] and have sex with her.<ref>Schutze, pp. 106-107</ref> Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis, but was unable to go through with shooting him.<ref>Schutze, pp. 108-110</ref>\n\nDespite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed \"hit man\" named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis'. The group met Kaufman at his home in [[Rolling Oaks, Florida|Rolling Oaks]].<ref>Schutze, pp. 111-113</ref> They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19).<ref>Schutze, p. 125</ref> The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance.<ref>Schutze, pp.136-145</ref> <!-- Puccio alleged he was not a part of these meetings on July 13. [No source available] -->\n\nLate on the night of July 14, 1993, the seven joined together at Puccio's house and finalized their plans. Puccio contacted Kent and convinced him to come out with the group that night, with the promise that they would race their cars and that Willis wanted to have sex with him again.<ref>Schutze, p. 132</ref> The group assembled their weapons: between them, they had two knives, a lead pipe, and a baseball bat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1997/86242-0.html|title=Puccio v.

Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt \"ill-will and hatred\" towards Kent, who would [[bullying|bully]] and pummel him.<ref name=Supcourt>{{cite court|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1997/86242-0.html|litigants=Martin PUCCIO, Appellant, v.

Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were concerned because Marty often returned from being with Kent bleeding or covered in bruises. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym goers, both boys were rumored to use [[steroid]]s, which in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.\n\nKent and Puccio had experimented with making [[gay porn]] movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly [[Film director|directed]] them and coaxed a [[Florida]] man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled ''Rough Boys'', to porn shops across [[South Florida]]. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a [[dildo]].<ref>Schutze, pp. 52\u201358, 61\u201362, 77, 104</ref>\n\n==Murder==\nToward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time Puccio spent with Kent (aged 20) as well as Kent's treatment of Puccio, Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice (Ali) Willis (aged 17) with Kent.<ref>Schutze, p. 72-74</ref> Kent and Willis dated for a few weeks, but she ultimately ended the relationship because he was [[domestic violence|abusive]].<ref>Schutze, p. 75-76</ref> In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to end the friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant with Puccio\u2019s child, and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.<ref>Schutze, p. 87</ref>\n\nAllegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him.<ref>Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, events detailed in chapter 4.</ref> On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that \"Bobby Kent was planning to come to [[Palm Bay, Florida|Palm Bay]] [where Willis was living] to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.\"<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Puccio v.

Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).<ref>Schutze, pp. 98-100</ref>\n\nOn the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis' [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Mustang 5.0]] and have sex with her.<ref>Schutze, pp. 106-107</ref> Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis, but was unable to go through with shooting him.<ref>Schutze, pp. 108-110</ref>\n\nDespite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed \"hit man\" named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis'. The group met Kaufman at his home in [[Rolling Oaks, Florida|Rolling Oaks]].<ref>Schutze, pp. 111-113</ref> They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19).<ref>Schutze, p. 125</ref> The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance.<ref>Schutze, pp.136-145</ref> <!-- Puccio alleged he was not a part of these meetings on July 13. [No source available] -->\n\nLate on the night of July 14, 1993, the seven joined together at Puccio's house and finalized their plans. Puccio contacted Kent and convinced him to come out with the group that night, with the promise that they would race their cars and that Willis wanted to have sex with him again.<ref>Schutze, p. 132</ref> The group assembled their weapons: between them, they had two knives, a lead pipe, and a baseball bat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1997/86242-0.html|title=Puccio v.
