For the remainder of the [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|1998\u201399 Premier League season]], Bridge was only used occasionally as Saints narrowly avoided relegation.

Harris, Ph.D., and Elise Gerich, ''ConneXions'', Vol. 10, No. 4, April 1996</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Internet }}</ref> - and marketers and publicists began to test what was possible.\n\nVery soon [[email spam]] was ubiquitous, unavoidable and repetitive.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spam|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary}}</ref> This article details significant events in the history of spam, and the efforts made to limit it.\n\n==Background==\nCommercialization of the internet and integration of electronic mail as an accessible means of communication has another face - the influx of unwanted information and mails. As the internet started to gain popularity in the early 1990s, it was quickly recognized as an excellent advertising tool. At practically no cost, a person can use the internet to send an email message to thousands of people. These unsolicited junk electronic mails came to be called 'Spam'. The history of spam is intertwined with the history of electronic mail.\n\nWhile the linguistic significance of the usage of the word 'spam' is attributed to the British comedy troupe [[Monty Python]] in a now legendary [[Spam (Monty Python)|sketch]] from their [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|''Flying Circus'']] TV series, in which a group of Vikings sing a chorus of \"SPAM, SPAM, SPAM...\" at increasing volumes, the historic significance lies in it being adopted to refer to unsolicited commercial electronic mail sent to a large number of addresses, in what was seen as drowning out normal communication on the internet.\n\n===The \"first spam email\" in 1978===\nThe first known email spam (although not yet called that), was sent on May 1, 1978, to several hundred users on ARPANET. It was an advertisement for a presentation by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] for their [[DECSYSTEM-20]] products sent by Gary Thuerk, a marketer of theirs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamreact.html|accessdate=23 February 2017|title=Reaction to the DEC Spam of 1978}}</ref>\n\nThe reaction to it was almost universally negative, and for a long time, there were no further instances.\n\nhi\n\n===USENET===\n{{Main|Newsgroup spam}}\nThe name \"spam\" was actually first applied, in April 1993, not to an email, but to unwanted postings on [[Usenet]] [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]] network. Richard Depew accidentally posted 200 messages to news.admin.policy and in the aftermath readers of this group were making jokes about the accident, when one person referred to the messages as \u201cspam\u201d,<ref>{{cite book|last1=McWilliams|first1=Brian|title=Spam Kings: The Real Story Behind the High-Rolling Hucksters Pushing Porn|publisher=O'Reilly|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0JlyBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309&dq=Richard+Depew+accidentally+posted+200+messages+to+news.admin.policy#v=onepage&q=Richard%20Depew%20accidentally%20posted%20200%20messages%20to%20news.admin.policy&f=false|accessdate=23 February 2017|isbn=9781491913802|date=2014-09-09}}</ref> coining the term that would later be applied to similar incidents over email.\n\nOn January 18, 1994, the first large-scale deliberate USENET spam occurred. A message with the subject \u201cGlobal Alert for All: Jesus is Coming Soon\u201d was cross-posted to every available newsgroup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamterm.html|title=Origin of the term \"spam\" to mean net abuse|accessdate=11 July 2006|first=Brad|last=Templeton|authorlink=Brad Templeton}}</ref><ref name=\"Google groups timeline\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html| title=20 Year Archive on Google Groups| accessdate=11 July 2006|year=2003|publisher=Google}}</ref> Its controversial message sparked many debates all across USENET.\n\nIn April 1994 the first commercial USENET spam arrived. Two lawyers from Phoenix, [[Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel|Canter and Siegel]], hired a programmer to post their \"Green Card Lottery- Final One?\" message to as many newsgroups as possible.<ref name=\"Google groups timeline\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mailmsg.com/SPAM_history.htm |title=History of Spam |publisher=Mailmsg.com |accessdate=11 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326032433/http://www.mailmsg.com/SPAM_history.htm |archivedate=26 March 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2odj9q%2425q%40herald.indirect.com</ref> What made them different was that they did not hide the fact that they were spammers. They were proud of it, and thought it was great advertising. They even went on to write the book \"How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway : Everyone\u2019s Guerrilla Guide to Marketing on the internet and Other On-Line Services\". They planned on opening a consulting company to help other people post similar advertisements, but it never took off.\n\n==The 1990s==\nMAPS (\"[[Mail Abuse Prevention System]]\") was founded in 1996. Dave Rand and [[Paul Vixie]], well known internet software engineers, had started keeping a list of IP addresses which had sent out spam or engaged in other behavior they found objectionable. The list became known as the ''Real-time Blackhole List'' ([[DNSBL|RBL]]). Many network managers wanted to use the RBL to block unwanted email. Thus, Rand and Vixie created a DNS-based distribution scheme which quickly became popular.<ref>{{IETF RFC|5782}}</ref>\n\nSpam was already becoming a serious concern, leading in late 1997 to the [[Mail Abuse Prevention System|MAPS]], which was \"blackhole list\" to allow mail servers to block mail coming from spam sources.\n\nOthers started DNS-based blacklists of open relays.\n\nAlan Hodgson started Dorkslayers in September 1998. By November 1998 he was forced to close, since his upstream BCTel considered the open relay scanning to be abusive. The successor [[Open Relay Behavior-modification System|ORBS project]] was then moved to Alan Brown in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Taggart|first1=Stewart|title=Spam Blockers Pass It On|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/07/44876|accessdate=23 February 2017|magazine=TIME|date=2001-07-02}}</ref>\n\nAl Iverson of Radparker started the RRSS around May 1999. By September 1999 that project was folded into the MAPS group of DNS-based lists as the RSS.\n\nIn August 1999, MAPS listed the ORBS mail servers, since the ORBS relay testing was thought to be abusive.\n\n==2000, spam becomes a serious problem==\nThe [[Apache SpamAssassin|SpamAssassin]] spam-filtering system is first uploaded to [[SourceForge]].net on April 20, 2001 by creator Justin Mason.\n\nIn May 2000 the [[ILOVEYOU]] [[computer worm]] travelled by email to tens of millions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] personal computers.<ref>{{cite web|title=VBS.LoveLetter.Var|url=http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2000-121815-2258-99|publisher=Symantec|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> Although not spam, its impact highlighted how pervasive email had become.\n\nIn June 2001, ORBS was sued in New Zealand, and shortly thereafter closed down.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn August 2002, Paul Graham published an influential paper, \"A plan for spam\",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Paul|title=A Plan for Spam|url=http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html|website=PaulGraham.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> describing a spam-filtering technique using improved [[Naive Bayes spam filtering|Bayesian filtering]]<ref>Paul Graham (2003), [http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html Better Bayesian filtering]</ref><ref>Brian Livingston (2002), [http://www.infoworld.com/t/business/paul-graham-provides-stunning-answer-spam-e-mails-295 Paul Graham provides stunning answer to spam e-mails]</ref> and variants of this were soon implemented in a number of products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls|title=Junk Mail Controls|publisher=MozillaZine|date=November 2009}}</ref> including [[server-side]] email filters, such as [[DSPAM]], SpamAssassin,<ref name=twsSep14yy>{{cite web\n |title       = Installation\n |publisher   = Ubuntu manuals\n |quote       = Gary Robinson\u2019s f(x) and combining algorithms, as used in SpamAssassin\n |date        = 2010-09-18\n |url         = http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/sa-learn.1p.html\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-18\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100929165032/http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/sa-learn.1p.html\n |archivedate = 29 September 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> and [[SpamBayes]].<ref name=twsSep2>{{Cite news\n |title= Background Reading\n |publisher= SpamBayes project\n |quote= Sharpen your pencils, this is the mathematical background (such as it is).* The paper that started the ball rolling: Paul Graham's A Plan for Spam.* Gary Robinson has an interesting essay suggesting some improvements to Graham's original approach.* Gary Robinson's Linux Journal article discussed using the chi squared distribution.\n |date= 2010-09-18\n |url= http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/background.html\n |accessdate= 2010-09-18\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100906031341/http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/background.html| archivedate= 6 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==2003 the fight to control spam==\nIn June 2003 [[Meng Weng Wong]] starts the ''SPF-discuss'' mailing list and posted the very first version of the \"Sender Permitted From\" proposal, that would later become the [[Sender Policy Framework]], a simple email-validation system designed to detect email spoofing as part of the solution to spam.\n\nThe [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on December 16, 2003, establishing the [[United States]]' first national standards for the sending of commercial [[email]] and requiring the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) to enforce its provisions. The [[backronym]] CAN-SPAM derives from the bill's full name: \"''C''ontrolling the ''A''ssault of ''N''on-''S''olicited ''P''ornography ''A''nd ''M''arketing Act of 2003\".

As the internet started to gain popularity in the early 1990s, it was quickly recognized as an excellent advertising tool. At practically no cost, a person can use the internet to send an email message to thousands of people. These unsolicited junk electronic mails came to be called 'Spam'. The history of spam is intertwined with the history of electronic mail.\n\nWhile the linguistic significance of the usage of the word 'spam' is attributed to the British comedy troupe [[Monty Python]] in a now legendary [[Spam (Monty Python)|sketch]] from their [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|''Flying Circus'']] TV series, in which a group of Vikings sing a chorus of \"SPAM, SPAM, SPAM...\" at increasing volumes, the historic significance lies in it being adopted to refer to unsolicited commercial electronic mail sent to a large number of addresses, in what was seen as drowning out normal communication on the internet.\n\n===The \"first spam email\" in 1978===\nThe first known email spam (although not yet called that), was sent on May 1, 1978 to several hundred users on ARPANET. It was an advertisement for a presentation by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] for their [[DECSYSTEM-20]] products sent by Gary Thuerk, a marketer of theirs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamreact.html|accessdate=23 February 2017|title=Reaction to the DEC Spam of 1978}}</ref>\n\nThe reaction to it was almost universally negative, and for a long time there were no further instances.\n\n===USENET===\n{{Main|Newsgroup spam}}\nThe name \"spam\" was actually first applied, in April 1993, not to an email, but to unwanted postings on [[Usenet]] [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]] network. Richard Depew accidentally posted 200 messages to news.admin.policy and in the aftermath readers of this group were making jokes about the accident, when one person referred to the messages as \u201cspam\u201d,<ref>{{cite book|last1=McWilliams|first1=Brian|title=Spam Kings: The Real Story Behind the High-Rolling Hucksters Pushing Porn|publisher=O'Reilly|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0JlyBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309&dq=Richard+Depew+accidentally+posted+200+messages+to+news.admin.policy#v=onepage&q=Richard%20Depew%20accidentally%20posted%20200%20messages%20to%20news.admin.policy&f=false|accessdate=23 February 2017|isbn=9781491913802|date=2014-09-09}}</ref> coining the term that would later be applied to similar incidents over email.\n\nOn January 18, 1994, the first large-scale deliberate USENET spam occurred. A message with the subject \u201cGlobal Alert for All: Jesus is Coming Soon\u201d was cross-posted to every available newsgroup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamterm.html|title=Origin of the term \"spam\" to mean net abuse|accessdate=11 July 2006|first=Brad|last=Templeton|authorlink=Brad Templeton}}</ref><ref name=\"Google groups timeline\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html| title=20 Year Archive on Google Groups| accessdate=11 July 2006|year=2003|publisher=Google}}</ref> Its controversial message sparked many debates all across USENET.\n\nIn April 1994 the first commercial USENET spam arrived.

They were proud of it, and thought it was great advertising. They even went on to write the book \"How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway : Everyone\u2019s Guerrilla Guide to Marketing on the internet and Other On-Line Services\". They planned on opening a consulting company to help other people post similar advertisements, but it never took off.\n\n==The 1990s==\nMAPS (\"[[Mail Abuse Prevention System]]\") was founded in 1996. Dave Rand and [[Paul Vixie]], well known internet software engineers, had started keeping a list of IP addresses which had sent out spam or engaged in other behavior they found objectionable. The list became known as the ''Real-time Blackhole List'' ([[DNSBL|RBL]]). Many network managers wanted to use the RBL to block unwanted email. Thus, Rand and Vixie created a DNS-based distribution scheme which quickly became popular.<ref>{{IETF RFC|5782}}</ref>\n\nSpam was already becoming a serious concern, leading in late 1997 to the [[Mail Abuse Prevention System|MAPS]], which was \"blackhole list\" to allow mail servers to block mail coming from spam sources.\n\nOthers started DNS-based blacklists of open relays.\n\nAlan Hodgson started Dorkslayers in September 1998. By November 1998 he was forced to close, since his upstream BCTel considered the open relay scanning to be abusive. The successor [[Open Relay Behavior-modification System|ORBS project]] was then moved to Alan Brown in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Taggart|first1=Stewart|title=Spam Blockers Pass It On|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/07/44876|accessdate=23 February 2017|magazine=TIME|date=2001-07-02}}</ref>\n\nAl Iverson of Radparker started the RRSS around May 1999. By September 1999 that project was folded into the MAPS group of DNS-based lists as the RSS.\n\nIn August 1999, MAPS listed the ORBS mail servers, since the ORBS relay testing was thought to be abusive.\n\n==2000, spam becomes a serious problem==\nThe [[Apache SpamAssassin|SpamAssassin]] spam-filtering system is first uploaded to [[SourceForge]].net on April 20, 2001 by creator Justin Mason.\n\nIn May 2000 the [[ILOVEYOU]] [[computer worm]] travelled by email to tens of millions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] personal computers.<ref>{{cite web|title=VBS.LoveLetter.Var|url=http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2000-121815-2258-99|publisher=Symantec|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> Although not spam, its impact highlighted how pervasive email had become.\n\nIn June 2001, ORBS was sued in New Zealand, and shortly thereafter closed down.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn August 2002, Paul Graham published an influential paper, \"A plan for spam\",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Paul|title=A Plan for Spam|url=http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html|website=PaulGraham.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> describing a spam-filtering technique using improved [[Naive Bayes spam filtering|Bayesian filtering]]<ref>Paul Graham (2003), [http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html Better Bayesian filtering]</ref><ref>Brian Livingston (2002), [http://www.infoworld.com/t/business/paul-graham-provides-stunning-answer-spam-e-mails-295 Paul Graham provides stunning answer to spam e-mails]</ref> and variants of this were soon implemented in a number of products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kb.mozillazine.org/Junk_Mail_Controls|title=Junk Mail Controls|publisher=MozillaZine|date=November 2009}}</ref> including [[server-side]] email filters, such as [[DSPAM]], SpamAssassin,<ref name=twsSep14yy>{{cite web\n |title       = Installation\n |publisher   = Ubuntu manuals\n |quote       = Gary Robinson\u2019s f(x) and combining algorithms, as used in SpamAssassin\n |date        = 2010-09-18\n |url         = http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/sa-learn.1p.html\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-18\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100929165032/http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/sa-learn.1p.html\n |archivedate = 29 September 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> and [[SpamBayes]].<ref name=twsSep2>{{Cite news\n |title= Background Reading\n |publisher= SpamBayes project\n |quote= Sharpen your pencils, this is the mathematical background (such as it is).* The paper that started the ball rolling: Paul Graham's A Plan for Spam.* Gary Robinson has an interesting essay suggesting some improvements to Graham's original approach.* Gary Robinson's Linux Journal article discussed using the chi squared distribution.\n |date= 2010-09-18\n |url= http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/background.html\n |accessdate= 2010-09-18\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100906031341/http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/background.html| archivedate= 6 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==2003 the fight to control spam==\nIn June 2003 [[Meng Weng Wong]] starts the ''SPF-discuss'' mailing list and posted the very first version of the \"Sender Permitted From\" proposal, that would later become the [[Sender Policy Framework]], a simple email-validation system designed to detect email spoofing as part of the solution to spam.\n\nThe [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on December 16, 2003, establishing the [[United States]]' first national standards for the sending of commercial [[email]] and requiring the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) to enforce its provisions.

Originally a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]], Bergkamp was moved to main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and then to [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], where he remained throughout his playing career. Nicknamed the \"Non-[[Flying Dutchman]]\" by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters due to his [[fear of flying]], Bergkamp is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nThe son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in [[Amsterdam]] and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by Ajax at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Prolific form led to an international call-up with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club [[Inter Milan]] in 1993, where he had two underwhelming seasons. After joining Arsenal in 1995, he rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three [[Premier League]] titles, four [[FA Cup]] trophies, and reach the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]], which marked his last appearance as a player.\n\nWith the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], where he impressed, scoring three goals in the tournament.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he scored a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which has been regarded as one of the greatest [[FIFA World Cup]] goals.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bergkamp surpassed [[Faas Wilkes]]'s record to become the country's top goalscorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Robin van Persie]] and [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]].\n\nBergkamp has been described by [[Jan Mulder (footballer)|Jan Mulder]] as having \"the finest technique\" of any Dutch international<ref name=\"Burgcamp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/017c244e-d6da-11da-b64c-0000779e2340.html#axzz1tS5U1MZp|title=No more walking in a 'Burgcamp' Wonderland|last=Kuper|first=Simon|date=28 April 2006|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> and a \"dream for a striker\" by teammate [[Thierry Henry]].<ref name=\"Indy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/there-was-only-one-dennis-bergkamp-408838.html|title=There was only one Dennis Bergkamp|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=22 July 2006|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=13 December 2011|location=London}}</ref> Bergkamp finished third twice in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award and was selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100]] greatest living players.

He is generally regarded as one of the country's greatest ever players. He was born, educated and started his career in [[Fife]], but his peak playing years were in the early 1960s with the [[Glasgow]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], whom he helped to win ten trophies between 1960 and 1965, and where he became known as \"Slim Jim\". However, he started drinking heavily during a four-month layoff caused by a leg fracture in December 1964, his fitness suffered, and he was [[Transfer (football)|transferred]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in summer 1965. In two and a half years at Sunderland he played 98 games and scored 12 goals, becoming known for drinking himself unconscious the night before a match and playing well the next day. At the end of 1967 Sunderland transferred him to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who gave him a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] back to Rangers in 1969 after 50 games. After a further year with Rangers Baxter retired from football in 1970, at the age of 31.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1967, he was a leading member of a strong Scottish international team that lost only once to [[England national football team|England]], in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2\u20131 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most of the credit for the 3\u20132 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score.\n\nIn his prime, Baxter was known for his ability to raise a team's morale, his good tactical vision, precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way \u2013 and for being a joker on the pitch. He also broke with Glasgow tradition by becoming friendly with several members of their major [[Old Firm|Glasgow rivals]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\nAlthough he gained a reputation as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a [[Public house|pub]], and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that he needed two [[Organ transplant|transplant]]s at the age of 55, after which he swore off [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated to have lost between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000. After he died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2001, his funeral was held in [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and his ashes were buried at Rangers' [[Ibrox Stadium]]. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, [[Hill of Beath]].\n\n==Early life==\nBaxter was born in [[Hill of Beath]], [[Fife]], on 29 September 1939 and was educated and started his career there. After leaving school he spent eight months as an apprentice [[Cabinet making|cabinet maker]], and then worked as a coal miner.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\nHis former headmaster James Carmichael took an interest in ex-pupils and encouraged Baxter to join local football team Halbeath Juveniles instead of one of the glamour clubs.<ref name=\"IndependentObit\" /> Baxter went on to play for the Fife junior team, [[Crossgates Primrose J.F.C.|Crossgates Primrose]].<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\n==Club career==\n===Raith Rovers===\nBaxter joined [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] as a part-timer in 1957.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" /> In his time at Raith he orchestrated a 3-2 win over Rangers at Ibrox. [[Scot Symon]] decided he wanted to sign him for Rangers from that performance.\n\nIn an interview on his career, Baxter was asked if joining the senior ranks was the beginning of his football education. He said he found the idea of being given any sort of football education laughable, before then commenting on [[Willie McNaught]]. Describing McNaught as, 'a smashing guy', Baxter explained how instead of thoughtlessly charging forward with the ball, McNaught suggested more considered football \u2013 change from running 30 yards to produce a five-yard pass to running five yards and producing a 30-yard pass. This, Baxter then stated, was his football education with Willie McNaught the provider.<ref name = \"qoswillie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=1215 |title=Willie McNaught (and Ken) |work=Queen of the South official website |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref> He later said of his time with the two Fife clubs, \"I would never have made it in today's circumstances.

He is generally regarded as one of the country's greatest ever players. He was born, educated and started his career in [[Fife]], but his peak playing years were in the early 1960s with the [[Glasgow]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], whom he helped to win ten trophies between 1960 and 1965, and where he became known as \"Slim Jim\". However, he started drinking heavily during a four-month layoff caused by a leg fracture in December 1964, his fitness suffered, and he was [[Transfer (football)|transferred]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in summer 1965. In two and a half years at Sunderland he played 98 games and scored 12 goals, becoming known for drinking himself unconscious the night before a match and playing well the next day. At the end of 1967 Sunderland transferred him to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who gave him a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] back to Rangers in 1969 after 50 games. After a further year with Rangers Baxter retired from football in 1970, at the age of 31.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1967, he was a leading member of a strong Scottish international team that lost only once to [[England national football team|England]], in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2\u20131 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most of the credit for the 3\u20132 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score.\n\nIn his prime, Baxter was known for his ability to raise a team's morale, his good tactical vision, precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way \u2013 and for being a joker on the pitch. He also broke with Glasgow tradition by becoming friendly with several members of their major [[Old Firm|Glasgow rivals]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\nAlthough he gained a reputation as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a [[Public house|pub]], and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that he needed two [[Organ transplant|transplant]]s at the age of 55, after which he swore off [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated to have lost between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000. After he died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2001, his funeral was held in [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and his ashes were buried at Rangers' [[Ibrox Stadium]]. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, [[Hill of Beath]].\n\n==Early life==\nBaxter was born in [[Hill of Beath]], [[Fife]], on 29 September 1939 and was educated and started his career there. After leaving school he spent eight months as an apprentice [[Cabinet making|cabinet maker]], and then worked as a coal miner.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\nHis former headmaster James Carmichael took an interest in ex-pupils and encouraged Baxter to join local football team Halbeath Juveniles instead of one of the glamour clubs.<ref name=\"IndependentObit\" /> Baxter went on to play for the Fife junior team, [[Crossgates Primrose J.F.C.|Crossgates Primrose]].<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\n==Club career==\n===Raith Rovers===\nBaxter joined [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] as a part-timer in 1957.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" /> In his time at Raith he orchestrated a 3-2 win over Rangers at Ibrox. [[Scot Symon]] decided he wanted to sign him for Rangers from that performance.\n\nIn an interview on his career, Baxter was asked if joining the senior ranks was the beginning of his football education. He said he found the idea of being given any sort of football education laughable,  before then commenting on [[Willie McNaught]]. Describing McNaught as, 'a smashing guy', Baxter explained how instead of thoughtlessly charging forward with the ball, McNaught suggested more considered football \u2013 change from running 30 yards to produce a five-yard pass to running five yards and producing a 30-yard pass. This, Baxter then stated, was his football education with Willie McNaught the provider.<ref name = \"qoswillie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=1215 |title=Willie McNaught (and Ken) |work=Queen of the South official website |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref> He later said of his time with the two Fife clubs, \"I would never have made it in today's circumstances.

Founded in 1861 by [[Matthew Vassar]], it was the second degree-granting institution of higher education for women in the United States, closely following [[Elmira College]]. It became coeducational in 1969, and now has a gender ratio at the national average.  The school is one of the historic [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]], the first elite women's colleges in the U.S., and has a historic relationship with [[Yale University]], which suggested a merger before they both became coeducational institutions.\n\nThe college offers [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degrees in more than 50 majors and features a flexible curriculum designed to promote a breadth of studies. Student groups at the college include theater and comedy organizations, acappella groups, club sports teams, volunteer and service groups, and a circus troupe. Vassar College's varsity sports teams, known as the Brewers, play in the [[NCAA]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] as members of the [[Liberty League]].\n\nVassar tied for the 14th best liberal arts college in the nation in the 2020 annual ranking of ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', with admissions described as \"most selective\". The total number of students attending the college is around 2,450.\n\nThe Vassar campus comprises over {{convert|1000|acre|ha}} and more than 100 buildings, including two [[National Historic Landmarks]] and an additional [[National Historic Place]]. A designated [[arboretum]], the campus features more than 200 species of trees, a native plant preserve, and a {{convert|530|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[ecological preserve]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Portrait of Matthew Vassar by Charles Loring Elliott.jpg|thumb|left|[[Matthew Vassar]]]]\n\nVassar was founded as a [[women's college|women's school]] under the name Vassar Female College in 1861.<ref name=\"3decades\"/> Its first president was Milo P.

The college became [[coeducational]] in 1969.<ref name=\"3decades\" />\n\nVassar was the second of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges, higher education schools that were formerly strictly for women, and historically sister institutions to the [[Ivy League]]. It was chartered by its namesake, brewer Matthew Vassar, in 1861 in the [[Hudson Valley]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of [[New York City]].  The first person appointed to the Vassar faculty was the [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Maria Mitchell]], in 1865.\n\nVassar adopted coeducation in 1969. However, immediately following [[World War II]], Vassar accepted a very small number of male students on the [[G.I. Bill]]. Because Vassar's charter prohibited male matriculants, the graduates were given diplomas via the [[University of the State of New York]]. These were reissued under the Vassar title after the school formally became co-educational.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aavc.vassar.edu/vq/articles/vassar_vets|title=Vassar's Vets: Forgotten Grads|accessdate=March 25, 2015|last1=Winum|first1=Jessica|work=Vassar, the Alumnae/i Quarterly|date=Fall 2000|archivedate=December 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201105148/http://www.aavc.vassar.edu/vq/articles/vassar_vets}}</ref> The formal decision to become co-ed came after its trustees declined an offer to merge with [[Yale University]], its sibling institution, in the wave of mergers between the historically all-male colleges of the Ivy League and their Seven Sisters counterparts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/coeducation/the-vassar-yale-study.html|title=The Vassar-Yale Study|accessdate=October 10, 2011|date=2007 |website=Vassar College Encyclopedia|publisher=Vassar College}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vassar College ca 1862 edit1.jpg|thumb|Main Building, built in 1861 by architect [[James Renwick, Jr.]], had the most interior space of any building in the United States, until the [[U.S. Capitol]] was completed in 1868.<ref name=main-vce>{{cite web|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/buildings-grounds/buildings/main-building/|title=Main Building|accessdate=September 7, 2013|date=2005|website=Vassar College Encyclopedia|publisher=Vassar College}}</ref>]]\nIn its early years, Vassar was associated with the social elite of the Protestant establishment.

Matthew Vassar was known for declaring that \"art should stand boldly forth as an educational force\". The art collection at Vassar dates to the founding of the College, when Vassar provided an extensive collection of [[Hudson River School]] paintings to be displayed in the Main Building.  Referred to as the Magoon Collection, it continues to be one of the best in the nation for Hudson River School paintings. One of the largest U.S. college or university art museums, the Frances Lehman Loeb Gallery displays a selection of Vassar's 18,000 articles of art in the building designed by [[Cesar Pelli]].\n\nToday, the gallery's collection displays art from the ancient world up through contemporary works. The collection includes work by European masters such as [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger|Brueghel]], [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], [[Picasso]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Bacon]], [[Vuillard]], [[C\u00e9zanne]], [[Braque]] and [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], as well as examples from leading twentieth-century American painters [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Charles Sheeler]], and [[Ben Shahn]].  The Loeb's works on paper represent a major collection in the United States, with prints by [[Rembrandt]] (including important impressions of the ''[[Hundred Guilder Print]]'' and the ''Three Trees'') and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] as well as photographs by [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Diane Arbus]], and others. Students at the college can act as liaisons between the art center and the wider college community through work on the Student Committee of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, to which incoming freshmen can apply.\n\nIn November 2016, the gallery opened the Hoene Hoy Photography gallery on the second floor, named after Anne Hoene Hoy from the class of 1963.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gopalakrishnan|first1=Sasha|title=Loeb opens new photo gallery|url=http://miscellanynews.org/2016/11/09/arts/loeb-opens-new-photo-gallery/|work=[[The Miscellany News]]|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Capital Improvements===\n[[File:Bridge for Laboratory Sciences exterior west, March 2016.jpg|thumb|Bridge for Laboratory Sciences exterior west, March 2016]]\nIn 2011, Vassar embarked on a $120 million project to improve science facilities at the college, centering on the construction of a new $90 million [[Bridge for Laboratory Sciences]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Morgan|first1=Jamie|title=Vassar College \u2013 Integrated Science Center|url=http://www.construction-today.com/index.php/sections/institutional/1401-vassar-college-integrated-science-center |accessdate=March 25, 2015|work=Construction Today}}</ref> The project will include renovations of Olmsted Hall of Biological Sciences, New England Building and Sanders Physics Building as well as the construction of a new Integrated Science Center, a bridge building that will connect to Olmsted Hall and cross over the [[Fonteyn Kill]].

Students also participate in such programs as the Self-Instructional Language Program (SILP) which offers courses in Hindi, Irish/Gaelic, Korean, Portuguese, Swahili, Swedish, Turkish, and Yiddish. Vassar has a flexible curriculum intended to promote breadth in studies. While each field of study has specific requirements for majors, the only universal requirements for graduation are proficiency in a foreign language, a quantitative course, and a freshman writing course. Students are also encouraged to [[study abroad]], which they typically do during one or two semesters of their junior year. Students (usually juniors) may apply for a year or a semester away either in the U.S. or abroad. Vassar sponsors programs in China, England, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, Mexico, Morocco, Spain, and Russia; students may also join preapproved programs offered by other colleges. Students may also apply for approved programs at various U.S. institutions, including the historically Black colleges and members of the Twelve College Exchange.\n\nAll classes are taught by members of the faculty, and there are no graduate students or teachers' assistants.

The college became [[coeducational]] in 1969.<ref name=\"3decades\" />\n\nVassar was the second of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges, higher education schools that were formerly strictly for women, and historically sister institutions to the [[Ivy League]]. It was chartered by its namesake, brewer Matthew Vassar, in 1861 in the [[Hudson Valley]], about {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of [[New York City]].  The first person appointed to the Vassar faculty was the [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Maria Mitchell]], in 1865.\n\nVassar adopted coeducation in 1969. However, immediately following [[World War II]], Vassar accepted a very small number of male students on the [[G.I. Bill]]. Because Vassar's charter prohibited male matriculants, the graduates were given diplomas via the [[University of the State of New York]].

Matthew Vassar was known for declaring that \"art should stand boldly forth as an educational force\". The art collection at Vassar dates to the founding of the College, when Vassar provided an extensive collection of [[Hudson River School]] paintings to be displayed in the Main Building.  Referred to as the Magoon Collection, it continues to be one of the best in the nation for Hudson River School paintings. One of the largest U.S. college or university art museums, the Frances Lehman Loeb Gallery displays a selection of Vassar's 18,000 articles of art in the building designed by [[Cesar Pelli]].\n\nToday, the gallery's collection displays art from the ancient world up through contemporary works. The collection includes work by European masters such as [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger|Brueghel]], [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], [[Picasso]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Bacon]], [[Vuillard]], [[C\u00e9zanne]], [[Braque]] and [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], as well as examples from leading twentieth-century American painters [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Charles Sheeler]], and [[Ben Shahn]].  The Loeb's works on paper represent a major collection in the United States, with prints by [[Rembrandt]] (including important impressions of the ''[[Hundred Guilder Print]]'' and the ''Three Trees'') and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] as well as photographs by [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Diane Arbus]], and others. Students at the college can act as liaisons between the art center and the wider college community through work on the Student Committee of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, to which incoming freshmen can apply.\n\nIn November 2016, the gallery opened the Hoene Hoy Photography gallery on the second floor, named after Anne Hoene Hoy from the class of 1963.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gopalakrishnan|first1=Sasha|title=Loeb opens new photo gallery|url=http://miscellanynews.org/2016/11/09/arts/loeb-opens-new-photo-gallery/|work=[[The Miscellany News]]|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Capital Improvements===\n[[File:Bridge for Laboratory Sciences exterior west, March 2016.jpg|thumb|Bridge for Laboratory Sciences exterior west, March 2016]]\nIn 2011, Vassar embarked on a $120 million project to improve science facilities at the college, centering on the construction of a new $90 million [[Bridge for Laboratory Sciences]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Morgan|first1=Jamie|title=Vassar College \u2013 Integrated Science Center|url=http://www.construction-today.com/index.php/sections/institutional/1401-vassar-college-integrated-science-center |accessdate=March 25, 2015|work=Construction Today}}</ref> The project will include renovations of Olmsted Hall of Biological Sciences, New England Building and Sanders Physics Building as well as the construction of a new Integrated Science Center, a bridge building that will connect to Olmsted Hall and cross over the [[Fonteyn Kill]].

Students also participate in such programs as the Self-Instructional Language Program (SILP) which offers courses in Hindi, Irish/Gaelic, Korean, Portuguese, Swahili, Swedish, Turkish, and Yiddish. Vassar has a flexible curriculum intended to promote breadth in studies. While each field of study has specific requirements for majors, the only universal requirements for graduation are proficiency in a foreign language, a quantitative course, and a freshman writing course. Students are also encouraged to [[study abroad]], which they typically do during one or two semesters of their junior year. Students (usually juniors) may apply for a year or a semester away either in the U.S. or abroad. Vassar sponsors programs in China, England, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, Mexico, Morocco, Spain, and Russia; students may also join preapproved programs offered by other colleges. Students may also apply for approved programs at various U.S. institutions, including the historically Black colleges and members of the Twelve College Exchange.\n\nAll classes are taught by members of the faculty, and there are no graduate students or teachers' assistants.
