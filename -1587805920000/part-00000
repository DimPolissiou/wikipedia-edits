He ruled Prussia during the difficult times of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Steering a careful course between France and her enemies, after a [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|major military defeat]] in 1806, he eventually and reluctantly joined the coalition against Napoleon in the ''[[German Campaign of 1813|Befreiungskriege]]''. Following Napoleon's defeat, he was King of Prussia during the [[Congress of Vienna]], which assembled to settle the political questions arising from the new, post-Napoleonic order in Europe. He was determined to unify the Protestant churches, to homogenize their liturgy, their organization, and even their architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Friederike Luise von Hessen-Darmstadt (Therbusch) crop.jpg|thumb|Friedrich Wilhelm and his mother (1775)]]\n\nFrederick William was born in [[Potsdam]] in 1770 as the son of [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] and [[Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt]]. He was considered to be a shy and reserved boy, which became noticeable in his particularly reticent conversations distinguished by the lack of personal pronouns. This manner of speech subsequently came to be considered entirely appropriate for military officers.<ref>[[Franz Blei]] (1931) \"K\u00f6nigin Luise von Preu\u00dfen\" in ''Gef\u00e4hrtinnen''. Berlin. pp. 68 ff</ref>  He was neglected by his father during his childhood and suffered from an inferiority complex his entire life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-William-III|title=Federick William III|last=Encyclopaedia Britannica|first=The Editors of|date=30 July 2018|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Frederick William's father (under the influence of his mistress,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Frederick William III. |volume=11 |pages=65\u201366}}</ref> [[Wilhelmine, Gr\u00e4fin von Lichtenau|Wilhelmine Enke, Countess of Lichtenau]]) had him handed over to tutors, as was quite normal for the period.  He spent part of the time living at [[Paretz]], the estate of the old soldier Count Hans [[von Blumenthal]] who was the governor of his brother Prince Heinrich.  They thus grew up partly with the Count's son, who accompanied them on their Grand Tour in the 1780s.  Frederick William was happy at Paretz, and for this reason in 1795 he bought it from his boyhood friend and turned it into an important royal country retreat.  He was a melancholy boy, but he grew up [[pious]] and honest. His tutors included the dramatist [[Johann Jakob Engel|Johann Engel]].\n\nAs a soldier, he received the usual training of a Prussian prince, obtained his [[lieutenant|lieutenancy]] in 1784, became a lieutenant colonel in 1786, a [[colonel]] in 1790, and took part in the campaigns against France of 1792\u20131794.<ref name=EB1911/> On 24 December 1793, Frederick William married [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], who bore him ten children. In the ''[[Kronprinzenpalais]]'' (Crown Prince's Palace) in Berlin, Frederick William lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became [[King of Prussia]] in 1797. His wife Louise was particularly loved by the Prussian people, which boosted the popularity of the whole House of Hohenzollern, including the King himself.<ref name=\"Kings\"/>\n\n==Reign==\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Frederick William III of Prussia.jpg|thumb|Lenient and slow to recognize the growing French threat, Frederick's restrained entry into the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|war in 1806]] ended in defeat and humiliation for Prussia.]]\n\nFrederick William succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797. He also became, in [[personal union]], the sovereign prince of the [[Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel]] (1797\u20131806 and again 1813\u20131840). At once, the new King showed that he was earnest of his good intentions by cutting down the expenses of the royal establishment, dismissing his father's ministers, and reforming the most oppressive abuses of the late reign.<ref name=EB1911/> He had the Hohenzollern determination to retain personal power but not the [[Hohenzollern]] genius for using it.<ref name=EB1911/> Too distrustful to delegate responsibility to his ministers,<ref name=EB1911/> he greatly reduced the effectiveness of his reign since he was forced to assume the roles he did not delegate. This is a main factor of his inconsistent rule.\n\nDisgusted with the moral debauchery of his father's court (in both political intrigues and sexual affairs), Frederick William's first, and most successful early endeavor was to restore the moral legitimacy to his dynasty. The eagerness to restore dignity to his family went so far that it nearly caused sculptor [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] to cancel the expensive and lavish ''Prinzessinnengruppe'' project, which was commissioned by the previous monarch [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]]. He was quoted as saying the following,  which demonstrated his sense of duty and peculiar manner of speech:\n\n{{bquote|Every civil servant has a dual obligation: to the sovereign and to the country. It can occur that the two are not compatible; then, the duty to the country is higher.}}\n\nAt first Frederick William and his advisors attempted to pursue a policy of neutrality in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Although they succeeded in keeping out of the [[Third Coalition]] in 1805, eventually Frederick William was swayed by the attitude of the queen, who led Prussia's pro-war party, and entered into war in October 1806. On 14 October 1806, at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerst\u00e4dt]], the French effectively decimated the effectiveness and functionality of the Prussian army led by Frederick William, and the Prussian army collapsed entirely soon after. [[Fall of Berlin (1806)|Napoleon occupied Berlin]] in late October. The royal family fled to [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]], [[East Prussia]], where they fell on the mercy of Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]].\n\nAlexander, too, suffered defeat at the hands of the French, and at [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] on the [[Niemen River|Niemen]] France made peace with Russia and Prussia. Napoleon dealt with Prussia very harshly, despite the pregnant Queen's personal interview with the French emperor which was believed would soften the blow of defeat. Instead, Napoleon took much less mercy on the Prussians than what was expected. Prussia lost many of its Polish territories, as well as all territory west of the [[Elbe River|Elbe]], and had to finance a large indemnity and to pay for French troops to occupy key strong points within the Kingdom.\n\nAlthough the ineffectual King himself seemed resigned to Prussia's fate, various reforming ministers, such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl, baron von und zum Stein|Baron vom Stein]], Prince [[Karl August von Hardenberg|von Hardenberg]], [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], and Count [[August von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]], set about reforming Prussia's administration and military, with the encouragement of Queen Luise (who died, greatly mourned, in 1810).\n\nIn 1813, following [[Napoleon]]'s defeat in [[Russia]], Frederick William turned against France and signed an alliance with Russia at [[Treaty of Kalisz (1813)|Kalisz]], although he had to flee Berlin, still under French occupation. Prussian troops played a key part in the victories of the allies in 1813 and 1814, and the King himself travelled with the main army of [[Karl Philipp F\u00fcrst zu Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]], along with Alexander of Russia and [[Emperor Francis II|Francis of Austria]].\n\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]], Frederick William's ministers succeeded in securing important territorial increases for Prussia, although they failed to obtain the annexation of all of [[Saxony]], as they had wished.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Following the war, Frederick William turned towards political reaction, abandoning the promises he had made in 1813 to provide Prussia with a constitution.<ref>Martyn Lyons (2006) ''Post-revolutionary Europe, 1815\u20131856''.

The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the [[Prussian Union of churches]]. In a series of proclamations over several years the ''Church of the Prussian Union'' was formed, bringing together the majority group of Lutherans, and the minority group of Reformed Protestants. The main effect was that the government of Prussia had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognized as the leading bishop.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Christopher Clark|title=Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340|journal=Historical Journal|volume= 39|issue=4 |year=1996|pages= 985\u20131004|jstor=2639865 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X00024730}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824 Frederick William III remarried ([[Morganatic marriage|morganatically]]) Countess [[Auguste von Harrach]], Princess of Liegnitz.

3 August 1770 \u2013 7 June 1840) was king of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] from 1797 to 1840. He ruled Prussia during the difficult times of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Steering a careful course between France and her enemies, after a [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|major military defeat]] in 1806, he eventually and reluctantly joined the coalition against Napoleon in the ''[[German Campaign of 1813|Befreiungskriege]]''. Following Napoleon's defeat, he was King of Prussia during the [[Congress of Vienna]], which assembled to settle the political questions arising from the new, post-Napoleonic order in Europe. He was determined to unify the Protestant churches, to homogenize their liturgy, their organization, and even their architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Friederike Luise von Hessen-Darmstadt (Therbusch) crop.jpg|thumb|Friedrich Wilhelm and his mother (1775)]]\n\nFrederick William was born in [[Potsdam]] in 1770 as the son of [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] and [[Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt]]. He was considered to be a shy and reserved boy, which became noticeable in his particularly reticent conversations distinguished by the lack of personal pronouns. This manner of speech subsequently came to be considered entirely appropriate for military officers.<ref>[[Franz Blei]] (1931) \"K\u00f6nigin Luise von Preu\u00dfen\" in ''Gef\u00e4hrtinnen''. Berlin. pp. 68 ff</ref>  He was neglected by his father during his childhood and suffered from an inferiority complex his entire life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-William-III|title=Federick William III|last=Encyclopaedia Britannica|first=The Editors of|date=30 July 2018|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Frederick William's father (under the influence of his mistress,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Frederick William III. |volume=11 |pages=65\u201366}}</ref> [[Wilhelmine, Gr\u00e4fin von Lichtenau|Wilhelmine Enke, Countess of Lichtenau]]) had him handed over to tutors, as was quite normal for the period.  He spent part of the time living at [[Paretz]], the estate of the old soldier Count Hans [[von Blumenthal]] who was the governor of his brother Prince Heinrich.  They thus grew up partly with the Count's son, who accompanied them on their Grand Tour in the 1780s.  Frederick William was happy at Paretz, and for this reason in 1795 he bought it from his boyhood friend and turned it into an important royal country retreat.  He was a melancholy boy, but he grew up [[pious]] and honest. His tutors included the dramatist [[Johann Jakob Engel|Johann Engel]].\n\nAs a soldier, he received the usual training of a Prussian prince, obtained his [[lieutenant|lieutenancy]] in 1784, became a lieutenant colonel in 1786, a [[colonel]] in 1790, and took part in the campaigns against France of 1792\u20131794.<ref name=EB1911/> On 24 December 1793, Frederick William married [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], who bore him ten children. In the ''[[Kronprinzenpalais]]'' (Crown Prince's Palace) in Berlin, Frederick William lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became [[King of Prussia]] in 1797. His wife Louise was particularly loved by the Prussian people, which boosted the popularity of the whole House of Hohenzollern, including the King himself.<ref name=\"Kings\"/>\n\n==Reign==\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Frederick William III of Prussia.jpg|thumb|Lenient and slow to recognize the growing French threat, Frederick's restrained entry into the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|war in 1806]] ended in defeat and humiliation for Prussia.]]\n\nFrederick William succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797. He also became, in [[personal union]], the sovereign prince of the [[Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel]] (1797\u20131806 and again 1813\u20131840). At once, the new King showed that he was earnest of his good intentions by cutting down the expenses of the royal establishment, dismissing his father's ministers, and reforming the most oppressive abuses of the late reign.<ref name=EB1911/> He had the Hohenzollern determination to retain personal power but not the [[Hohenzollern]] genius for using it.<ref name=EB1911/> Too distrustful to delegate responsibility to his ministers,<ref name=EB1911/> he greatly reduced the effectiveness of his reign since he was forced to assume the roles he did not delegate. This is a main factor of his inconsistent rule.\n\nDisgusted with the moral debauchery of his father's court (in both political intrigues and sexual affairs), Frederick William's first, and most successful early endeavor was to restore the moral legitimacy to his dynasty. The eagerness to restore dignity to his family went so far that it nearly caused sculptor [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] to cancel the expensive and lavish ''Prinzessinnengruppe'' project, which was commissioned by the previous monarch [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]]. He was quoted as saying the following,  which demonstrated his sense of duty and peculiar manner of speech:\n\n{{bquote|Every civil servant has a dual obligation: to the sovereign and to the country. It can occur that the two are not compatible; then, the duty to the country is higher.}}\n\nAt first Frederick William and his advisors attempted to pursue a policy of neutrality in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Although they succeeded in keeping out of the [[Third Coalition]] in 1805, eventually Frederick William was swayed by the attitude of the queen, who led Prussia's pro-war party, and entered into war in October 1806. On 14 October 1806, at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerst\u00e4dt]], the French effectively decimated the effectiveness and functionality of the Prussian army led by Frederick William, and the Prussian army collapsed entirely soon after. [[Fall of Berlin (1806)|Napoleon occupied Berlin]] in late October. The royal family fled to [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]], [[East Prussia]], where they fell on the mercy of Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]].\n\nAlexander, too, suffered defeat at the hands of the French, and at [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] on the [[Niemen River|Niemen]] France made peace with Russia and Prussia. Napoleon dealt with Prussia very harshly, despite the pregnant Queen's personal interview with the French emperor which was believed would soften the blow of defeat. Instead, Napoleon took much less mercy on the Prussians than what was expected. Prussia lost many of its Polish territories, as well as all territory west of the [[Elbe River|Elbe]], and had to finance a large indemnity and to pay for French troops to occupy key strong points within the Kingdom.\n\nAlthough the ineffectual King himself seemed resigned to Prussia's fate, various reforming ministers, such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl, baron von und zum Stein|Baron vom Stein]], Prince [[Karl August von Hardenberg|von Hardenberg]], [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]], and Count [[August von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]], set about reforming Prussia's administration and military, with the encouragement of Queen Luise (who died, greatly mourned, in 1810).\n\nIn 1813, following [[Napoleon]]'s defeat in [[Russia]], Frederick William turned against France and signed an alliance with Russia at [[Treaty of Kalisz (1813)|Kalisz]], although he had to flee Berlin, still under French occupation. Prussian troops played a key part in the victories of the allies in 1813 and 1814, and the King himself travelled with the main army of [[Karl Philipp F\u00fcrst zu Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]], along with Alexander of Russia and [[Emperor Francis II|Francis of Austria]].\n\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]], Frederick William's ministers succeeded in securing important territorial increases for Prussia, although they failed to obtain the annexation of all of [[Saxony]], as they had wished.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Following the war, Frederick William turned towards political reaction, abandoning the promises he had made in 1813 to provide Prussia with a constitution.<ref>Martyn Lyons (2006) ''Post-revolutionary Europe, 1815\u20131856''.

The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the [[Prussian Union of churches]]. In a series of proclamations over several years the ''Church of the Prussian Union'' was formed, bringing together the majority group of Lutherans, and the minority group of Reformed Protestants. The main effect was that the government of Prussia had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognized as the leading bishop.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Christopher Clark|title=Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340|journal=Historical Journal|volume= 39|issue=4 |year=1996|pages= 985\u20131004|jstor=2639865 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X00024730}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824 Frederick William III remarried ([[Morganatic marriage|morganatically]]) Countess [[Auguste von Harrach]], Princess of Liegnitz.

She married Barrie Wood in 1959 and moved to [[Surbiton]] in [[Surrey]] where she took up a teaching role at Hollyfield Road Secondary School.\n\nThis was the era of the first children's paperback book and Anne became an early pioneer of a children's paperback book club scheme for schools set up by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Publications]]. She retired from teaching on the birth of her daughter and was taken on by ''Scholastic'' as editor of their Children's Book Club.\n\n===Children\u2019s books===\nWhen the Wood family moved to Byfleet in Surrey, she expanded her interest in how books and children's development could be brought together. In 1965 she founded and edited a quarterly magazine ''Books for Your Children'', a publication aimed at parents, teachers and librarians and fully supported by children's publishers. Initially the UK [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] supported the magazine with a small financial grant. As a further promotion of children's books in 1969 Wood set up the [[Federation of Children's Book Groups]], an organisation still in existence today. Also in 1969 in recognition of her contribution to the promotion of children's books Wood was awarded the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]].<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Television producer===\n#[[Tyne Tees Television]] for ITV 1977 ''Puzzle Party'' hosted by [[Gyles Brandreth]] and featuring Gnigel the Gnu\n#[[Yorkshire Television]] for ITV 1979 \u2013 1983 5 series of ''[[The Book Tower]]'', a programme aimed at stimulating children's interest in books.

She is also the co-creator of ''[[Tots TV]]'' and ''[[Teletubbies]]''. She was a recipient of the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]].\n\n==Early years==\nShe was born in [[Spennymoor]], [[County Durham]], [[England]], and grew up in Tudhoe Colliery, a small coal-mining village nearby.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite web|author=Meg Carter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/01/childrensservices.guardiansocietysupplement |title=Interview: Anne Wood, the co-creator of the Teletubbies &#124; Society |work=Guardian|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nShe qualified as a secondary school teacher through the Bingley Training College in [[Yorkshire]] and took up her first teaching post back home in Spennymoor. She married Barrie Wood in 1959 and moved to [[Surbiton]] in [[Surrey]] where she took up a teaching role at Hollyfield Road Secondary School.\n\nThis was the era of the first children's paperback book and Anne became an early pioneer of a children's paperback book club scheme for schools set up by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Publications]]. She retired from teaching on the birth of her daughter and was taken on by ''Scholastic'' as editor of their Children's Book Club.\n\n===Children\u2019s books===\nWhen the Wood family moved to Byfleet in Surrey, she expanded her interest in how books and children's development could be brought together. In 1965 she founded and edited a quarterly magazine ''Books for Your Children'', a publication aimed at parents, teachers and librarians and fully supported by children's publishers. Initially the UK [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] supported the magazine with a small financial grant. As a further promotion of children's books in 1969 Wood set up the [[Federation of Children's Book Groups]], an organisation still in existence today. Also in 1969 in recognition of her contribution to the promotion of children's books Wood was awarded the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]].<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Television producer===\n#[[Tyne Tees Television]] for ITV 1977 ''Puzzle Party'' hosted by [[Gyles Brandreth]] and featuring Gnigel the Gnu\n#[[Yorkshire Television]] for ITV 1979 \u2013 1983 5 series of ''[[The Book Tower]]'', a programme aimed at stimulating children's interest in books.

This included trading contacts with [[Arabia]], [[Persia]], [[Israel]] and [[China]] spanning millennia, and with European colonial powers for several centuries.\n\n==European contributions==\n===Portuguese===<!-- This section is linked from [[Portuguese language]] -->\nMost of the loan words from [[Portuguese language]] are for items which the native population lacked when the encounter with [[Portuguese empire]] happened from around the final years of the 15th century.\nPortuguese was the [[List of lingua francas#Portuguese|lingua franca]] in Africa, Brazil, South Asia and parts of South East Asia during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The Portuguese Empire was the major ruling colonial power in South India during this period, they were first modern European power to encounter India on a large scale, and thus their language had a strong influence on Malayalam (similar to many other Indian languages).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qk-p5hKuccC&lpg=PP1|title=Portuguese Vocables in Asiatic Languages: From the Portuguese Original of Monsignor Sebasti\u00e3o Rodolfo Dalgado|last=Dalgado|first=Sebasti\u00e3o Rodolfo|date=1988|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120604131|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Malayalam!!

On Prospect Bluff, overlooking the [[Apalachicola River]], there lived a settlement that included a trading post that Andrew Jackson and other Americans labeled '''Negro Fort''', built by the [[British Army|British]] in 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], in a remote part of what was at the time [[Spanish Florida]]. It is part of the [[Prospect Bluff Historic Sites]], in the [[Apalachicola National Forest]], [[Franklin County, Florida]].\n\nThe fort was called Negro Fort only after the British evacuated Florida in the aftermath of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1815; its later residents were primarily blacks, either being [[free Negroes]] or [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]], together with some [[Choctaw people|Choctaws]]. There were a significant number of [[Maroon (people)|maroon]]s already in the area before the fort was built{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and beginning in 1804 there was for several years a [[trading post]] operating in the settlement. The blacks, having worked on plantations, knew how to plant and care for crops, and also to care for domesticated animals, mostly cattle.\n\nWhen withdrawing in 1815, the local British commander, the [[Irish people|Irishman]] [[Edward Nicolls]], intentionally left the fully armed fort in the hands of the blacks who had been with the British during the War of 1812 and paid off a group of [[Corps of Colonial Marines|Colonial Marines]] and their [[Creek people|Creek]] allies, most of whom resided there and took part in the defense of the fort. As Nicolls hoped, the fort became a center of resistance to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] near the Southern border of the United States. The site was militarily significant, although without artillery training, the residents of the fort were ultimately unable to defend themselves from potential U.S incursions. It is the largest and most famous instance before the [[American Civil War]] in which armed black slaves resisted whites who sought to return them to slavery (a much smaller predecessor was [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Fort Mose]], near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]). The fort was destroyed in 1816 at the command of General [[Andrew Jackson]]. The [[United States Armed Forces|American forces]] used [[heated shot]] against the fort and ignited the powder magazine, blowing up the fort and killing over 270 people instantly. However, the area continued to attract escaped slaves until the U.S construction of [[Prospect Bluff Historic Sites#Fort Gadsden|Fort Gadsden]] in 1818.\n\n==Negro Fort==\nThe \"Negro Fort\", as it soon came to be called, became widely known among the inhabitants of the region.

The newly-built Fort Scott required supplies in or men in or out to pass in front of the Negro Fort.

Contemporary maps rarely mention Negro Fort; the site until 2016 was called Fort Gadsden Historic Site, but Fort Gadsden had a less dramatic history. None of the four historic markers at the site mentions Negro Fort (it is mentioned on the information kiosk at the site). The [[Union Jack]] (British flag) flies over the site; the Colonial Marines, at least, felt they were British subjects. (See [[Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost]].) Historical markers call it a \"British post\", and nothing is mentioned as to the ethnicity of the fortress's defenders, except that, as blacks and \"Indians\", they were not \"Americans\". ''British Fort Magazine'' described the carnage:<blockquote>It is hard to imagine the horrible scene that greeted the first Americans to stand here on the morning of July 27, 1816. The remains of the 270 persons killed in the magazine explosion lay scattered about. They also found an arsenal of ten cannons, 2,500 muskets and over 150 barrels of black powder. Some original timbers from the octagonal magazine were uncovered here by excavations.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Angola, Florida]]\n* [[Black Seminoles]]\n* [[Fort Mose Historic State Park]]\n* [[Fort Scott (Flint River, Georgia)|Fort Scott]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n|first=Larry Eugene\n|last=Rivers\n|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]\n|title=Rebels and Runaways: Slave Resistance in Nineteenth-Century Florida\n|year=2012\n|via=[[Project MUSE]]\n|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/book/19134\n|isbn=978-0-252-03691-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite AV media\n|title=Historic Fort Gadsden\n|publisher=The Archeology Channel\n|url=https://www.archaeologychannel.org/video-guide/video-guide/video-guide-list/2024-historic-fort-gadsden\n|access-date=February 22, 2018\n|year=2011\n|people=USDA Forest Service}}\n* [https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/north-americas-largest-act-of-slave-resistance \"North America's Largest Act of Slave Resistance\"], a 2015 lecture by Nathaniel Millett\n{{Franklin County, Florida}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Negro Fort}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1816]]\n[[Category:1816 in the United States]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Seminole Wars]]\n[[Category:Native American history of Florida]]\n[[Category:Pre-emancipation African-American history]]\n[[Category:History of Florida]]\n[[Category:Naval battles and operations of the American Indian Wars]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Florida]]\n[[Category:July 1816 events]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Franklin County, Florida]]\n[[Category:African-American history of Florida]]\n[[Category:Colonial forts in Florida]]\n[[Category:Spanish Florida]]\n[[Category:Underground Railroad locations]]\n[[Category:19th-century establishments in the Spanish Empire]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Underground Railroad]]\n[[Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Florida]]\n[[Category:Native Americans of the Seminole Wars]]\n[[Category:Maroons (people)]]\n[[Category:American rebel slaves]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Franklin County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Slave rebellions in the United States]]\n[[Category:Seminole Wars]]\n[[Category:African-American military monuments and memorials]]\n[[Category:Negro Fort]]\n[[Category:Black Seminoles]]\n[[Category:Landmarks of the War of 1812]]\n[[Category:War of 1812 forts]]\n[[Category:Populated places established by African Americans]]\n[[Category:African-American tourist attractions in Florida]]\n[[Category:Fugitive American slaves]]\n[[Category:Andrew Jackson]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "rmvd unsourced contect per WP:POV", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_Fort"}

Groves High School''' or '''Groves''') is a [[high school]] in [[Beverly Hills, Michigan]], United States, in the [[Birmingham City School District|Birmingham Public School District]].  Groves' colors are green, white, and yellow and its mascot is Freddy the Falcon. The current principal is Dr. Embekka Roberson, and the assistant principals are Othamian Peterson, Delois Spryszak, and Darin Wilcox, and the athletic director is Tom Flynn.\n\nThe [[French School of Detroit]] holds its high school classes at Groves High School.<ref>\"[http://www.frenchschoolofdetroit.org/curriculum/high-school The High School].\" [[French School of Detroit]]. Retrieved on June 20, 2015. \"Location: Groves High School, 20500 13 mile Road, Beverly, MI 48025.\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nIn 1951, a new high school in Birmingham opened under the name Birmingham High School (which is now known as Seaholm High School). At the time, the president of the Board of Education was Ernest W. Seaholm and the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. When Birmingham had to build another school to accommodate the incoming baby boomers, these men's names would become the source of the modern names of Birmingham's two main high schools: Seaholm High School and Groves High School.\n\n=== Building history ===\nCompleted in 1959, the building was an example of the International Style applied to ordinary school design, resulting in a modernistic exterior look similar to much subsequent school construction. The building's original architectural \"signature\" was a scalloped circular white roof over the circular library; now painted black, it is visible but no longer prominent. The building has a grid-like floor plan, with three main hallways intersected by six shorter ones. Liberal use was made of glass walls and interior courtyards, with energy costs not yet a major concern in 1959. Since the school's opening, the building has undergone periodic renovations, the most extensive occurring from 1999\u20132001 when the school was completely remodeled. The school features state of the art technology, including seven computer labs (including one for modern languages) and a large media center; state of the art science labs for biology, chemistry, physics, CAD, and robotics; a little theatre that seats approximately 300; an auditorium that seats approximately 1200; art studios for drawing, photography, jewelry, ceramics, and graphic design; a TV studio; and a large, open commons area where students gather for lunch, dances, and other activities. In 2005, construction began to renovate the athletic wing of the school, as well as to build a new competitive size swimming pool. The former swimming pool has been converted into classrooms, a fitness center, and a dance studio. The school was one of the first schools in Michigan to use artificial \"[[FieldTurf]]\" for its football/soccer field. In 2017, there was renovations of the auditorium and construction of a scene shop addition.\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe school opened in the fall of 1959 with 1,052 students in grades seven through ten. Intended eventually to be Birmingham's second high school, it was named after a local civic leader and school board member. In the first year, students selected the school colors (green and white), team nickname (Falcons), fight song (\"Rise Up, All Falcons,\" music and lyrics composed by Mr. Burton Bronson, Groves Band Director), names of the yearbook (\"Talon\") and newspaper (\"Scriptor\"), etc. The original tenth graders became the first class of graduating seniors in 1962. For a brief period the school was a junior and senior high school, and the classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 spent grades seven through twelve there. Beginning with the 1963-64 school year, grades seven and eight were moved from Groves to Berkshire Middle School, which today serves grades six through eight in the Birmingham City School District.  The lower grades were eliminated as new junior high schools were built. This pattern enabled the school district to accommodate, with phased construction, the demographic wave of babyboomers emerging from elementary schools in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school offers numerous Honors and Advanced Placement courses for students to elect. Advanced Placement is offered for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Computer Science, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Science, European History, French, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, Statistics, US History, and US Government. The school has a variety of academic elective options for students who do not wish to take Honors or AP courses. The school also offers many courses in journalism, with the newspaper- \"The Scriptor\", the yearbook- \"The Talon\", and the television production- \"The Fann (Falcon Action News Network)\"\n\n== Athletics and activities ==\nThe school offers over thirty varsity sports for both men and women.  Most sports are broken down into varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen teams. Groves is a member of the Oakland Activities Association and has won league championships in nearly every sport since the league's inception in 1994. Groves also offers a variety of activities for students to participate in, including instrumental music (both band and orchestra), forensics team, eco club, interact club, fashion club, Amnesty and Animal Rights club, Gay-Straight Alliance club, Japanese club, Spanish club, French club, debate team, theatre, quiz bowl, bowling club, photography club, and the National Honor Society. Both the forensics and debate teams have enjoyed success in recent years. The forensics team finished second in the state in 2007, while the debate team finished first in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nGroves Student Congress (GSC) is responsible for planning school-wide activities and events such as Spirit Week, Field Day, Extreme Dodgeball, Operation Volleyball, Sadie Hawkins Dance, Wylie's Winter Week, and two blood drives. Members of GSC are elected in school-wide elections. In addition, each class elects its own government, which is responsible for planning class-wide events. Groves students also run their own events independent of the school, including the seniors-only \"Water Wars\" tournament at the end of the year.\n\n=== State Championships ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\"|State Championships\n|-\n!

Groves High School''' or '''Groves''') is a [[high school]] in [[Beverly Hills, Michigan]], United States, in the [[Birmingham City School District|Birmingham Public School District]].  Groves' colors are green, white, and yellow and its mascot is Freddy the Falcon. The current principal is Dr. Embekka Roberson, and the assistant principals are Othamian Peterson, Delois Spryszak, and Darin Wilcox, and the athletic director is Tom Flynn.\n\nThe [[French School of Detroit]] holds its high school classes at Groves High School.<ref>\"[http://www.frenchschoolofdetroit.org/curriculum/high-school The High School].\" [[French School of Detroit]]. Retrieved on June 20, 2015. \"Location: Groves High School, 20500 13 mile Road, Beverly, MI 48025.\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nIn 1951, a new high school in Birmingham opened under the name Birmingham High School (which is now known as Seaholm High School). At the time, the president of the Board of Education was Ernest W. Seaholm and the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. When Birmingham had to build another school to accommodate the incoming baby boomers, these men's names would become the source of the modern names of Birmingham's two main high schools: Seaholm High School and Groves High School.\n\n=== Building history ===\nCompleted in 1959, the building was an example of the International Style applied to ordinary school design, resulting in a modernistic exterior look similar to much subsequent school construction. The building's original architectural \"signature\" was a scalloped circular white roof over the circular library; now painted black, it is visible but no longer prominent. The building has a grid-like floor plan, with three main hallways intersected by six shorter ones. Liberal use was made of glass walls and interior courtyards, with energy costs not yet a major concern in 1959. Since the school's opening, the building has undergone periodic renovations, the most extensive occurring from 1999\u20132001 when the school was completely remodeled. The school features state of the art technology, including seven computer labs (including one for modern languages) and a large media center; state of the art science labs for biology, chemistry, physics, CAD, and robotics; a little theatre that seats approximately 300; an auditorium that seats approximately 1200; art studios for drawing, photography, jewelry, ceramics, and graphic design; a TV studio; and a large, open commons area where students gather for lunch, dances, and other activities. In 2005, construction began to renovate the athletic wing of the school, as well as to build a new competitive size swimming pool. The former swimming pool has been converted into classrooms, a fitness center, and a dance studio. The school was one of the first schools in Michigan to use artificial \"[[FieldTurf]]\" for its football/soccer field. In 2017, there was renovations of the auditorium and construction of a scene shop addition.\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe school opened in the fall of 1959 with 1,052 students in grades seven through ten. Intended eventually to be Birmingham's second high school, it was named after a local civic leader and school board member. In the first year, students selected the school colors (green and white), team nickname (Falcons), fight song (\"Rise Up, All Falcons,\" music and lyrics composed by Mr. Burton Bronson, Groves Band Director), names of the yearbook (\"Talon\") and newspaper (\"Scriptor\"), etc. The original tenth graders became the first class of graduating seniors in 1962. For a brief period the school was a junior and senior high school, and the classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 spent grades seven through twelve there. Beginning with the 1963-64 school year, grades seven and eight were moved from Groves to Berkshire Middle School, which today serves grades six through eight in the Birmingham City School District.  The lower grades were eliminated as new junior high schools were built. This pattern enabled the school district to accommodate, with phased construction, the demographic wave of babyboomers emerging from elementary schools in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school offers numerous Honors and Advanced Placement courses for students to elect. Advanced Placement is offered for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Computer Science, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Science, European History, French, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, Statistics, US History, and US Government. The school has a variety of academic elective options for students who do not wish to take Honors or AP courses. The school also offers many courses in journalism, with the newspaper- \"The Scriptor\", the yearbook- \"The Talon\", and the television production- \"The Fann (Falcon Action News Network)\"\n\n== Athletics and activities ==\nThe school offers over thirty varsity sports for both men and women.  Most sports are broken down into varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen teams. Groves is a member of the Oakland Activities Association and has won league championships in nearly every sport since the league's inception in 1994. Groves also offers a variety of activities for students to participate in, including instrumental music (both band and orchestra), forensics team, eco club, interact club, fashion club, Amnesty and Animal Rights club, Gay-Straight Alliance club, Japanese club, Spanish club, French club, debate team, theatre, quiz bowl, bowling club, photography club, and the National Honor Society. Both the forensics and debate teams have enjoyed success in recent years. The forensics team finished second in the state in 2007, while the debate team finished first in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nGroves Student Congress (GSC) is responsible for planning school-wide activities and events such as Spirit Week, Field Day, Extreme Dodgeball, Operation Volleyball, Sadie Hawkins Dance, Wylie's Winter Week, and two blood drives. Members of GSC are elected in school-wide elections. In addition, each class elects its own government, which is responsible for planning class-wide events. Groves students also run their own events independent of the school, including the seniors-only \"Water Wars\" tournament at the end of the year.\n\n=== State Championships ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\"|State Championships\n|-\n!

It currently has three sections, which are Kindergarten, Primary and Secondary. Historically, it had four sections including Kindergarten, Primary, Secondary (including sixth-form), and Business Studies.\n\n==Co-Curricular Activities Committee (For Secondary Section only)==\nThe Co-Curricular Activities Committee was established in 1994. The departments of Co-Curricular Activities Committee are as follows:\n\n*'''Student Council Executive Committee''' - In the beginning of school term every year, the election of \"Student Council\" is held which enables two cabinets to compete for becoming the ruling council of the year. Students take part in the election under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis. Members from the Student Council Executive Committee have to bear up with the prefect duties as they are also the \"Student Leaders\".\n*'''Student Council Representative Committee''' - It is formed by the \"Student Leaders\". It implements the duty of supervising the works done by \"Student Council Executive Committee\".\n*'''Student Council Service Team''' - Assists the \"Student Council Executive Committee\" to carry out the charitable works of caring for the needs of underprivileged minorities within the Wanchai community.\n*'''Rosarian Editorial Board''' - Reports the campus news and publishes the literary articles, which is accountable to the supervision of \"Student Council Executive Committee\"\n*'''House Captain Liaison Committee''' - Each House appoints two captains to form this Committee\n*'''House Executive Committee''' - The House Captains, who are elected under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis, form this Committee. All elected captains have to bear up with the prefect duties as they are also the \"Student Leaders\".\n*'''Sports Association''' - Formed by representatives of different sports teams\n*'''New Youth Society''' - Formerly known as \"Catholic Students Society\", which is administered by the Religious Department of the Dominican Priests\n*'''Altar Service Team''' - Administered by the Religious Department of the Dominican Priests\n*'''Discipline Team''' - \"Student Leaders\" from different Houses accomplish the prefect duties, and they elect their favourite Head Prefects.\n*'''Library Service Team'''\n*'''Red Cross Youth Unit'''\n*'''Boys Scouts Team'''\n*'''Youth Ambassadors Team'''\n*'''School Choir'''\n*'''Singing and Guitar Club'''\n*'''Lion Dance Team'''\n*'''Mobile Apps Programming Club'''\n*'''Horticulture Club'''\n*'''School Annual Editorial Board''' - Publishes School Annual every year. Members are responsible for the editorial tasks of reporting the official event news of Kindergarten, Primary Section and Secondary Section.\n\nBetween September 1994 and July 2004, the \"Student Council Executive Committee\", \"Student Council Representative Committee\", \"Student Council Service Team\", \"Rosarian Editorial Board\", \"House Captain Liaison Committee\", \"House Executive Committee\" and \"Sports Association\" under the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\" were independent from the operations of \"Discipline Team\". Since September 2004, a system called \"an integration among Student Council, Houses, Sports Association and Discipline Team\" has been implemented. Members from the four Student Council units, the elected captains from the six houses, and representatives from \"Sports Association\" are consistently regarded as \"Student Leaders\". They have to bear up with the prefect duties assigned by the \"Discipline Team\" while tackling with their leadership duties within the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\". Moreover, all the \"Student Leaders\" have to elect several \"Head Prefects\" under a \"one man, one vote\" basis.\n\n==House System (For Secondary Section only)==\nThere are six Houses in total, which are administered by the \"House Captain Liaison Committee\" from the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\". \"Student Leaders\" from six Houses have to take part in the prefect duties of the Discipline Team at the same time. Each teacher, including the two Deputy Principals and the Officer of Student Affairs, is given a House identity as well. Captains from the six Houses are elected by their corresponding housemates within the campus under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis. The elected Captains form the \"House Executive Committee\":\n\n*'''Dragon House'''\n:Yellow is the House colour, whereas [[dragon]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Eagle House'''\n:Brown is the House colour, whereas [[eagle]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Flamingo House'''\n:Red is the House colour, whereas [[flamingo]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Peacock House'''\n:Blue is the House colour, whereas [[peacock]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Phoenix House'''\n:Orange is the House colour, whereas [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Unicorn House'''\n:Green is the House colour, whereas [[unicorn]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n==Supervisor==\nSince the establishment of Rosaryhill School, the position of Supervisor was accomplished by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priests. Fr. He Yousun now serves as the Supervisor in Rosaryhill School.\n\n==List of Principals (For Secondary Section only)==\nSince the establishment of Rosaryhill School, the position of Secondary Section Principal was accomplished by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priests.\n\nSince September 2006, there was a change which Francis Tsung Pui-sum (\u53e2\u57f9\u68ee\u5148\u751f), a Chinese intellectual, succeeded the position as the Principal of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section). Francis Tsung Pui-sum became the first-ever Chinese intellectual to serve as the Principal of Secondary Section in the history of Rosaryhill School.\n\nSince September 2015, 'Cherry Wong (\u9ec3\u78a7\u745c\u5973\u58eb) succeeded the position as the Principal of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section).

Since 2001, there has been approval of Visual Arts curriculum in Form 6 and Form 7 levels. Students were then allowed to register for the Visual Arts examinations from the [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] and the [[Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination]]. Since 2009, to keep abreast with the new 3-3-4 education system, students were allowed to register for the Visual Arts examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\nThe new 3-3-4 education was implemented in the Music curriculum for Form 4, Form 5 and Form 6 students in 2009. Form 6 students were allowed to register for the Music examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\n==History Education (For Secondary Section only)==\nThe History Education (or \"World History\" Education) of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section) is renowned with its requirement that the Form 4 and Form 5 students of the \"Arts Stream\" from the old era of [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination]] had to take this academic discipline as a compulsory subject. Form 6 and Form 7 students could freely choose to study History in either \"[[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]]\" module or '\"[[Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination]]\" module.\n\nThe \"Two History Teachers System\" was Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section)'s unique innovation from the history of education development in Hong Kong.\n\nSince 2009, to keep abreast with the new 3-3-4 education system, students were allowed to register for the History examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\nSince 1994, the History Department of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section) participated in the competitions and research schemes organized by [[Hong Kong Museum of History]], [[Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union]], [[The Hong Kong Institute for Promotion of Chinese Culture]] and the Moral and Civic Education Team of HKSAR [[Education Bureau]].

Form 6 and Form 7 students could freely choose to study Geography in \"[[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]]\" module.\n\nBut, the school authority did not provide the option of \"ASL Geography\" (i.e. \"[[Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination]]\" module) for students to choose.\n\nBefore July 2008, Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section) implemented the \"Two Geography Teachers System\" within the Geography classes of Form 6 and Form 7 levels. Two teachers are responsible for teaching \"[[Physical geography]]\" and the \"[[Agricultural geography|Agricultural]] [[Urban geography|and Urban geography]]\" respectively.\n\nStudents who registered for the Geography examination in \"[[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]]\" (or \"AL Geography\") module had to attend both \"[[Physical geography]]\" lessons and \"Agricultural and Urban geography\" lessons.\n\nThe \"Two Geography Teachers System\" was Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section)'s unique innovation from the history of education development in Hong Kong.\n\nSince 2009, to keep abreast with the new 3-3-4 education system, students were allowed to register for the Geography examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\n==Performing Arts Education (For Secondary Section only)==\nThe \"Performing Arts Education\" of Rosaryhill School was established in 1994 by Former Vice Panel Head of Co-Curricular Activities Committee and Former Panel Head of Chinese History Department.

The departments of Co-Curricular Activities Committee are as follows:\n\n*'''Student Council Executive Committee''' - In the beginning of school term every year, the election of \"Student Council\" is held which enables two cabinets to compete for becoming the ruling council of the year. Students take part in the election under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis. Members from the Student Council Executive Committee have to bear up with the prefect duties as they are also the \"Student Leaders\".\n*'''Student Council Representative Committee''' - It is formed by the \"Student Leaders\". It implements the duty of supervising the works done by \"Student Council Executive Committee\".\n*'''Student Council Service Team''' - Assists the \"Student Council Executive Committee\" to carry out the charitable works of caring for the needs of underprivileged minorities within the Wanchai community.\n*'''Rosarian Editorial Board''' - Reports the campus news and publishes the literary articles, which is accountable to the supervision of \"Student Council Executive Committee\"\n*'''House Captain Liaison Committee''' - Each House appoints two captains to form this Committee\n*'''House Executive Committee''' - The House Captains, who are elected under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis, form this Committee.

Members are responsible for the editorial tasks of reporting the official event news of Kindergarten, Primary Section and Secondary Section.\n\nBetween September 1994 and July 2004, the \"Student Council Executive Committee\", \"Student Council Representative Committee\", \"Student Council Service Team\", \"Rosarian Editorial Board\", \"House Captain Liaison Committee\", \"House Executive Committee\" and \"Sports Association\" under the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\" were independent from the operations of \"Discipline Team\". Since September 2004, a system called \"an integration among Student Council, Houses, Sports Association and Discipline Team\" has been implemented. Members from the four Student Council units, the elected captains from the six houses, and representatives from \"Sports Association\" are consistently regarded as \"Student Leaders\". They have to bear up with the prefect duties assigned by the \"Discipline Team\" while tackling with their leadership duties within the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\". Moreover, all the \"Student Leaders\" have to elect several \"Head Prefects\" under a \"one man, one vote\" basis.\n\n==House System (For Secondary Section only)==\nThere are six Houses in total, which are administered by the \"House Captain Liaison Committee\" from the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\". \"Student Leaders\" from six Houses have to take part in the prefect duties of the Discipline Team at the same time. Each teacher, including the two Deputy Principals and the Officer of Student Affairs, is given a House identity as well. Captains from the six Houses are elected by their corresponding housemates within the campus under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis. The elected Captains form the \"House Executive Committee\":\n\n*'''Dragon House'''\n:Yellow is the House colour, whereas [[dragon]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Eagle House'''\n:Brown is the House colour, whereas [[eagle]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Flamingo House'''\n:Red is the House colour, whereas [[flamingo]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Peacock House'''\n:Blue is the House colour, whereas [[peacock]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Phoenix House'''\n:Orange is the House colour, whereas [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Unicorn House'''\n:Green is the House colour, whereas [[unicorn]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n==Supervisor==\nSince the establishment of Rosaryhill School, the position of Supervisor was accomplished by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priests.

Students were then allowed to register for the Visual Arts examinations from the [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] and the [[Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination]]. Since 2009, to keep abreast with the new 3-3-4 education system, students were allowed to register for the Visual Arts examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\nThe new 3-3-4 education was implemented in the Music curriculum for Form 4, Form 5 and Form 6 students in 2009. Form 6 students were allowed to register for the Music examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\n==History Education (For Secondary Section only)==\nThe History Education (or \"World History\" Education) of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section) is renowned with its requirement that the Form 4 and Form 5 students of the \"Arts Stream\" from the old era of [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination]] had to take this academic discipline as a compulsory subject.
