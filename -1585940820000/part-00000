{"title_page": "Just intonation", "text_new": "{{short description|Musical tuning based on pure intervals}}\n{{technical|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[File:Harmonic series klang.png|thumb|Harmonic series, partials 1\u20135 numbered {{audio|Harmonic series klang.mid|Play}}.]]\n\nIn music, '''just intonation''' or '''pure intonation''' is the [[Musical tuning|tuning]] of musical [[Interval (music)|intervals]] as [[Natural number|whole number]] [[ratio]]s (such as 3:2 or 4:3) of [[Frequency|frequencies]]. Any [[interval (music)|interval]] tuned in this way is called a '''just interval'''. Just intervals (and chords created by combining them) consist of members of a single [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of a (lower) implied [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]]. For example, in the diagram at right, the notes G and middle C (labeled 3 and 4), are both members of the harmonic series of the lowest C and their frequencies will be 3 and 4 times, respectively, the fundamental frequency; thus, their interval ratio will be 4:3. If the frequency of the fundamental is 64 [[Hertz]], the frequencies of the two notes in question would be 192 and 256.\n\nInstruments are not always tuned using these intervals. In the Western world, instruments of fixed pitch, such as pianos, are typically tuned using [[equal temperament]], in which intervals other than octaves consist of irrational-number frequency ratios.\n\n==Terminology==\nTuning systems that have frequency ratios of powers of 2 include [[Octave|perfect octaves]] and, potentially, octave transposability.\n\n[[Pythagorean tuning]], or '''3-limit tuning''', also allows ratios including the number 3 and its powers, such as 3:2, a [[perfect fifth]], and 9:4, a [[Ninth|major ninth]]. Although the interval from C to G is called a '''perfect fifth''' for purposes of music analysis regardless of its tuning method, for purposes of discussing tuning systems musicologists may distinguish between a '''perfect fifth''' created using the 3:2 ratio and a '''tempered fifth''' using some other system, such as [[Meantone temperament|meantone]] or equal temperament.\n\n[[Five-limit tuning|5-limit tuning]] encompasses ratios additionally using the number 5 and its powers, such as 5:4, a [[major third]], and 15:8, a [[major seventh]]. The specialized term '''perfect third''' is occasionally used to distinguish the 5:4 ratio from major thirds created using other tuning methods. 7-limit and higher systems use higher partials in the overtone series.\n\nA [[wolf interval]] is an interval whose tuning is too far from its just-tuned equivalent, usually perceived as discordant and undesirable.\n\n[[Comma (music)|Commas]] are very small intervals that result from minute differences between pairs of just intervals. For example, the 5:4 ratio is different from the Pythagorean (3-limit) major third (81:64) by a difference of 81:80, called the [[syntonic comma]].\n\n[[Cent (music)|Cents]] are a measure of interval size. In 12-tone equal temperament, every half step is 100 cents.\n\n==History==\n[[File:12-tet scale compared to just in the chromatic circle.svg|thumb|Just (black) major and parallel minor triad, compared to its equal temperament (gray) approximations, within the [[chromatic circle]]]]\n\n[[Pythagorean tuning]] has been attributed to both [[Pythagoras]] and [[Eratosthenes]] by later writers, but may also been analyzed by other early Greeks or other early cultures as well.

Natural minor would include a tuning of 9:5 for the [[subtonic]].\n\n==Twelve-tone scale==\n{{anchor|Chromatic scale}}\nThere are several ways to create a just tuning of the twelve-tone scale.\n\n===Pythagorean tuning===\n{{Main|Pythagorean tuning}}\n\n[[Pythagorean tuning]] can produce a twelve-tone scale, but it does so by involving ratios of very large numbers, corresponding to natural harmonics very high in the harmonic series that do not occur widely in physical phenomena.  This tuning uses ratios involving only powers of 3 and 2, creating a sequence of just [[perfect fifth|fifths]] or [[perfect fourth|fourth]]s, as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | Note\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | G{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | D{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | A{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | E{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | B{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | F\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | C\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | G\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | D\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | A\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | E\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | B\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | F{{music|sharp}}\n|-\n!

Cents\n|588\n|90\n|792\n|294\n|996\n|498\n|0\n|702\n|204\n|906\n|408\n|1110\n|612\n|}\n\nThe ratios are computed with respect to C (the ''base note''). Starting from C, they are obtained by moving six steps (around the [[circle of fifths]]) to the left and six to the right. Each step consists of a multiplication of the previous pitch by 2/3 (descending fifth), 3/2 (ascending fifth), or their [[inversion (music)|inversions]] (3/4 or 4/3).\n\nBetween the [[enharmonic]] notes at both ends of this sequence is a [[pitch (music)|pitch]] ratio of {{nobreak|3<sup>12</sup> / 2<sup>19</sup> {{=}} 531441 / 524288}}, or about 23 [[Cent (music)|cents]], known as the [[Pythagorean comma]]. To produce a twelve-tone scale, one of them is arbitrarily discarded. The twelve remaining notes are repeated by increasing or decreasing their frequencies by a power of 2 (the size of one or more [[octave]]s) to build scales with multiple octaves (such as the keyboard of a piano). A drawback of Pythagorean tuning is that one of the twelve fifths in this scale is badly tuned and hence unusable (the [[wolf fifth]], either F{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|flat}} if G{{music|flat}} is discarded, or B-G{{music|flat}} if F{{music|sharp}} is discarded). This twelve-tone scale is fairly close to [[equal temperament]], but it does not offer much advantage for [[tonality|tonal]] harmony because only the perfect intervals (fourth, fifth, and octave) are simple enough to sound pure. Major thirds, for instance, receive the rather unstable interval of 81:64, sharp of the preferred 5:4 by an 81:80 ratio.<ref name=\"autogenerated1968\">{{Cite book | author=Danielou, Alain | title=The Ragas of Northern Indian Music | year=1968 | publisher=Barrie & Rockliff |location=London | isbn = 0-214-15689-3}}</ref> The primary reason for its use is that it is extremely easy to tune, as its building block, the perfect fifth, is the simplest and consequently the most [[consonance and dissonance|consonant]] interval after the octave and unison.\n\nPythagorean tuning may be regarded as a \"three-limit\" tuning system, because the ratios can be expressed as a product of integer powers of only whole numbers less than or equal to 3.\n\n===Five-limit tuning===\n{{Main|Five-limit tuning}}\n\nA twelve-tone scale can also be created by compounding harmonics up to the fifth. Namely, by multiplying the frequency of a given reference note (the '''base note''') by powers of 2, 3, or 5, or a combination of them. This method is called five-limit tuning.\n\nTo build such a twelve-tone scale (using C as the base note), we may start by constructing a table containing fifteen pitches:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! Factor\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | {{fraction|1|9}}\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | {{fraction|1|3}}\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | 1\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | 3\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | 9\n!\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | 5\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | D\n| A\n| E\n| B\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | F{{music|sharp}}\n! note\n|-\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 10:9\n| 5:3\n| 5:4\n| 15:8\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 45:32\n! ratio\n|-\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 182\n| 884\n| 386\n| 1088\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 590\n! cents\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | 1\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | B{{music|b}}\n| F\n| '''{{red|C}}'''\n| G\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | D\n! note\n|-\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 16:9\n| 4:3\n| 1:1\n| 3:2\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 9:8\n! ratio\n|-\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 996\n| 498\n| 0\n| 702\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 204\n! cents\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | {{fraction|1|5}}\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | G{{music|flat}}\n| D{{music|flat}}\n| A{{music|flat}}\n| E{{music|flat}}\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | B{{music|flat}}\n! note\n|-\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 64:45\n| 16:15\n| 8:5\n| 6:5\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 9:5\n! ratio\n|-\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 610\n| 112\n| 814\n| 316\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1018\n! cents\n|}\n\nThe factors listed in the first row and column are powers of 3 and 5, respectively (e.g., 1/9 = 3<sup>\u22122</sup>). Colors indicate couples of [[enharmonic]] notes with almost identical pitch. The ratios are all expressed relative to C in the centre of this diagram (the base note for this scale). They are computed in two steps:\n\n# For each cell of the table, a ''base ratio'' is obtained by multiplying the corresponding factors. For instance, the base ratio for the lower-left cell is 1/9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1/5&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/45.\n# The base ratio is then multiplied by a negative or positive power of 2, as large as needed to bring it within the range of the octave starting from C (from 1:1 to 2:1). For instance, the base ratio for the lower left cell (1/45) is multiplied by 2<sup>6</sup>, and the resulting ratio is 64:45, which is a number between 1:1 and 2:1.\n\nNote that the powers of 2 used in the second step may be interpreted as ascending or descending [[octave]]s. For instance, multiplying the frequency of a note by 2<sup>6</sup> means increasing it by 6 octaves. Moreover, each row of the table may be considered to be a sequence of fifths (ascending to the right), and each column a sequence of major thirds (ascending upward). For instance, in the first row of the table, there is an ascending fifth from D and A, and another one (followed by a descending octave) from A to E. This suggests an alternative but equivalent method for computing the same ratios. For instance, one can obtain A, starting from C, by moving one cell to the left and one upward in the table, which means descending by a fifth and ascending by a major third:\n\n:{{sfrac|2|3}} \u00d7 {{sfrac|5|4}} = {{sfrac|10|12}} = {{sfrac|5|6}}.\n\nSince this is below C, one needs to move up by an octave to end up within the desired range of ratios (from 1:1 to 2:1):\n\n:{{sfrac|5|6}} \u00d7 {{sfrac|2|1}} = {{sfrac|10|6}} = {{sfrac|5|3}}.\n\nA 12-tone scale is obtained by removing one note for each couple of enharmonic notes. This can be done in at least three ways, which have in common the removal of G{{music|flat}}, according to a convention which was valid even for C-based Pythagorean and quarter-comma meantone scales. Note that it is a [[diminished fifth]], close to half an octave, above the tonic C, which is a disharmonic interval; also its ratio has the largest values in its numerator and denominator of all tones in the scale, which make it least harmonious: all reasons to avoid it.\n\nThis is only one possible strategy of [[five-limit tuning]]. It consists of discarding the first column of the table (labeled \"{{frac|1|9}}\"). The resulting 12-tone scale is shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Asymmetric scale\n|-\n!

However, it can be easily extended by using higher positive and negative powers of the same numbers, such as 5<sup>2</sup> = 25, 5<sup>\u22122</sup> = 1/25, 3<sup>3</sup> = 27, or 3<sup>\u22123</sup> = 1/27. A scale with 25, 35 or even more pitches can be obtained by combining these base ratios, as in [[five-limit tuning]].\n\n==Indian scales==\nIn [[Indian music]], the just diatonic scale described above is used, though there are different possibilities, for instance for the sixth pitch (''Dha''), and further modifications may be made to all pitches excepting ''Sa'' and ''Pa''.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Bagchee, Sandeep | authorlink= | title=Nad: Understanding Raga Music | publisher=BPI (India) PVT Ltd | location= | isbn=81-86982-07-8 | page=23| year= 1998}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | Note\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Sa''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Re''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Ga''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Ma''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Pa''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Dha''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Ni''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Sa''\n|-\n!

There are many different explanations.)\n\n==Practical difficulties==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nSome fixed just intonation scales and systems, such as the diatonic scale above, produce [[wolf interval]]s. The above scale allows a minor tone to occur next to a semitone which produces the awkward ratio 32:27 for D-F, and still worse, a minor tone next to a fourth giving 40:27 for D-A. Moving D down to 10:9 alleviates these difficulties but creates new ones: D-G becomes 27:20, and D-B becomes 27:16. This fundamental problem arises in any system of tuning using a limited number of notes.\n\nOne can have more [[fret]]s on a [[guitar]] to handle both As, 9:8 with respect to G and 10:9 with respect to G so that A-C can be played as 6:5 while A-D can still be played as 3:2. 9:8 and 10:9 are less than 1/53 of an octave apart, so mechanical and performance considerations have made this approach extremely rare. And the problem of how to tune chords such as C-E-G-A-D, in typical 5-limit just intonation, is left unresolved (for instance, A could be 4:3 below D (making it 9:8, if G is 1) or 4:3 above E (making it 10:9, if G is 1) but not both at the same time, so one of the fourths in the chord will have to be an out-of-tune wolf interval). However the frets may be removed entirely\u2014this, unfortunately, makes in-tune fingering of many chords exceedingly difficult, due to the construction and mechanics of the human hand\u2014and the tuning of most complex chords in just intonation is generally ambiguous.\n\nSome composers deliberately use these wolf intervals and other dissonant intervals as a way to expand the tone color palette of a piece of music.  For example, the extended piano pieces ''[[The Well-Tuned Piano]]'' by LaMonte Young and ''The Harp Of New Albion'' by Terry Riley use a combination of very consonant and dissonant intervals for musical effect.  In \"Revelation\", [[Michael Harrison (musician)|Michael Harrison]] goes even further, and uses the tempo of beat patterns produced by some dissonant intervals as an integral part of several movements.\n\nFor many fixed-pitch instruments tuned in just intonation, one cannot change [[key (music)|keys]] without retuning the instrument. For instance, if a piano is tuned in just intonation intervals and a minimum of wolf intervals for the key of G, then only one other key (typically E-flat) can have the same intervals, and many of the keys have a very dissonant and unpleasant sound. This makes [[modulation (music)|modulation]] within a piece, or playing a repertoire of pieces in different keys, impractical to impossible.\n\n[[Synthesizer]]s have proven a valuable tool for composers wanting to experiment with just intonation. They can be easily retuned with a [[microtuner]]. Many commercial synthesizers provide the ability to use built-in just intonation scales or to create them manually. [[Wendy Carlos]] used a system on her 1986 album ''[[Beauty in the Beast]]'', where one electronic keyboard was used to play the notes, and another used to instantly set the root note to which all intervals were tuned, which allowed for modulation. On her 1987 lecture album ''Secrets of Synthesis'' there are audible examples of the difference in sound between equal temperament and just intonation.\n\n==Singing and scale-free instruments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nThe human voice is among the most pitch-flexible instruments in common use. Pitch can be varied with no restraints and adjusted in the midst of performance, without needing to retune. Although the explicit use of just intonation fell out of favour concurrently with the increasing use of instrumental accompaniment (with its attendant constraints on pitch), most [[a cappella]] ensembles naturally tend toward just intonation because of the comfort of its stability. [[Barbershop music|Barbershop quartets]] are a good example of this.\n\nThe unfretted stringed instruments from the violin family (the violin, the viola, the cello and the double bass) are quite flexible in the way pitches can be adjusted. Stringed instruments that are not playing with fixed pitch instruments tend to adjust the pitch of key notes such as thirds and [[leading tone]]s so that the pitches differ from equal temperament.\n\nTrombones have a slide that allows arbitrary tuning during performance. French horns can be tuned by shortening or lengthening the main tuning slide on the back of the instrument, with each individual rotary or piston slide for each rotary or piston valve, and by using the right hand inside the bell to adjust the pitch by pushing the hand in deeper to sharp the note, or pulling it out to flatten the note while playing. Some natural horns also may adjust the tuning with the hand in the bell, and valved cornets, trumpets, Flugelhorns, Saxhorns, Wagner tubas, and tubas have overall and valve-by-valve tuning slides, like valved horns. \n\nWind instruments with valves are biased towards natural tuning and must be micro-tuned if equal temperament is required.\n\nOther wind instruments, although built to a certain scale, can be micro-tuned to a certain extent by using the embouchure or adjustments to fingering.\n\n==Western composers==\nComposers often impose a [[Limit (music)|limit]] on how complex the ratios may become.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Genesis of a music : an account of a creative work, its roots and its fulfillments|last=1901\u20131974|first=Partch, Harry|isbn=030671597X|edition=Second edition, enlarged|location=New York|oclc=624666|year = 1974}}</ref> For example, a composer who chooses to write in 7-limit just intonation will not employ ratios that use powers of prime numbers larger than 7. Under this scheme, ratios like 11:7 and 13:6 would not be permitted, because 11 and 13 cannot be expressed as powers of those prime numbers \u2264 7 (''i.e.'' 2, 3, 5, and 7).\n\nThough just intonation in its simplest form (5-limit) may seem to suggest a necessarily [[tonality|tonal]] logic, it need not be the case. Some music of [[Kraig Grady]] and [[Daniel James Wolf]] uses just intonation scales designed by [[Erv Wilson]] explicitly for a consonant form of [[atonality]], and many of Ben Johnston's early works, like the ''[[Sonata for Microtonal Piano]]'' and ''String Quartet No. 2'', use [[serialism]] to elide the predominance of a tonal centre.\n\nAlternatively, composers such as [[La Monte Young]], Ben Johnston, [[James Tenney]], [[Marc Sabat]], [[Wolfgang von Schweinitz]], and [[Cat Lamb|Catherine Lamb]] have sought a new kind tonality and harmony \u2013 one based on the perception and experience of sound, which not only allows for the more familiar consonant structures, but also extends them beyond the 5-limit into a nuanced and diverse network of relationships between tones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plainsound.org/|title=Plainsound Music Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Yuri Landman]] devised a just intonation musical scale from an atonal [[prepared guitar]] [[extended technique|playing technique]] based on adding a third [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] under the strings.

[[James Tenney]], amongst others, preferred to combine JI ratios with [[cent (music)|cents]] deviations from the [[equal tempered]] pitches, indicated in a legend or directly in the score, allowing performers to readily use electronic tuning devices if desired.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Garland, Peter |year=1984 |series=Soundings |volume=13 |title=The Music of James Tenney |publisher=Soundings Press |location=Santa Fe, New Mexico |oclc=11371167}}</ref> \n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Ben Johnston had proposed an alternative approach, redefining the understanding of conventional symbols (the seven \"white\" notes, the sharps and flats) and adding further accidentals, each designed to extend the notation into higher [[prime limit]]s. His notation \"begins with the 16th-century Italian definitions of intervals and continues from there.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kylegann.com/tuning.html |title=Just Intonation Explained |website=KyleGann.com |access-date=28 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> '''Johnston notation''' is based on a diatonic C Major scale tuned in JI [[#fig4|(Fig.&nbsp;4)]], in which the interval between D (9:8 above C) and A (5:3 above C) is one [[syntonic comma]] less than a Pythagorean perfect fifth 3:2.

The three conventional white notes A E B are tuned as Ptolemaic major thirds (5:4) above F C G respectively.

In particular, the conventional flats, naturals and sharps define a Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. The Pythagorean pitches are then paired with new symbols that commatically alter them to represent various other partials of the harmonic series [[#fig1|(Fig.&nbsp;1)]]. To facilitate quick estimation of pitches, cents indications may be added (e.g. downward deviations below and upward deviations above the respective accidental). A typically used convention is that cent deviations refer to the ''tempered pitch'' implied by the flat, natural, or sharp.

At the same time, they provide some degree of practicality through their extension of staff notation, as traditionally trained performers may draw on their intuition for roughly estimating pitch height. This may be contrasted with the more abstract use of ratios for representing pitches in which the amount by which two pitches differ and the \"direction\" of change may not be immediately obvious to most musicians. One caveat is the requirement for performers to learn and internalize a (large) number of new graphical symbols. However, the use of unique symbols reduces harmonic ambiguity and the potential confusion arising from indicating only cent deviations.\n\n==Audio examples==\n*{{audio|A_Major_Scale,_Triads,_and_Fifths_Just.ogg|Just intonation}} An A-major scale, followed by three major triads, and then a progression of fifths in just intonation.\n*{{audio|A_Major_Scale,_Triads,_and_Fifths_Equal.ogg|Equal temperament}} An A-major scale, followed by three major triads, and then a progression of fifths in equal temperament.

Any [[interval (music)|interval]] tuned in this way is called a '''just interval'''. Just intervals (and chords created by combining them) consist of members of a single [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of a (lower) implied [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]]. For example, in the diagram at right, the notes G and middle C (labeled 3 and 4), are both members of the harmonic series of the lowest C and their frequencies will be 3 and 4 times, respectively, the fundamental frequency; thus, their interval ratio will be 4:3. If the frequency of the fundamental is 64 [[Hertz]], the frequencies of the two notes in question would be 192 and 256.\n\nInstruments are not always tuned using these intervals. In the Western world, instruments of fixed pitch, such as pianos, are typically tuned using [[equal temperament]], in which intervals other than octaves consist of irrational-number frequency ratios.\n\n==Terminology==\nTuning systems that have frequency ratios of powers of 2 include [[Octave|perfect octaves]] and, potentially, octave transposability.\n\n[[Pythagorean tuning]], or '''3-limit tuning''', also allows ratios including the number 3 and its powers, such as 3:2, a [[perfect fifth]], and 9:4, a [[Ninth|major ninth]]. Although the interval from C to G is called a '''perfect fifth''' for purposes of music analysis regardless of its tuning method, for purposes of discussing tuning systems musicologists may distinguish between a '''perfect fifth''' created using the 3:2 ratio and a '''tempered fifth''' using some other system, such as [[Meantone temperament|meantone]] or equal temperament.\n\n[[Five-limit tuning|5-limit tuning]] encompasses ratios additionally using the number 5 and its powers, such as 5:4, a [[major third]], and 15:8, a [[major seventh]]. The specialized term '''perfect third''' is occasionally used to distinguish the 5:4 ratio from major thirds created using other tuning methods. 7-limit and higher systems use higher partials in the overtone series.\n\nA [[wolf interval]] is an interval whose tuning is too far from its just-tuned equivalent, usually perceived as discordant and undesirable.\n\n[[Comma (music)|Commas]] are very small intervals that result from minute differences between pairs of just intervals. For example, the 5:4 ratio is different from the Pythagorean (3-limit) major third (81:64) by a difference of 81:80, called the [[syntonic comma]].\n\n[[Cent (music)|Cents]] are a measure of interval size. In 12-tone equal temperament, every half step is 100 cents.\n\n==History==\n[[File:12-tet scale compared to just in the chromatic circle.svg|thumb|Just (black) major and parallel minor triad, compared to its equal temperament (gray) approximations, within the [[chromatic circle]]]]\n\n[[Pythagorean tuning]] has been attributed to both [[Pythagoras]] and [[Eratosthenes]] by later writers, but may also been analyzed by other early Greeks or other early cultures as well.

Natural minor would include a tuning of 9:5 for the [[subtonic]].\n\n==Twelve-tone scale==\n{{anchor|Chromatic scale}}\nThere are several ways to create a just tuning of the twelve-tone scale.\n\n===Pythagorean tuning===\n{{Main|Pythagorean tuning}}\n\n[[Pythagorean tuning]] can produce a twelve-tone scale, but it does so by involving ratios of very large numbers, corresponding to natural harmonics very high in the harmonic series that do not occur widely in physical phenomena.  This tuning uses ratios involving only powers of 3 and 2, creating a sequence of just [[perfect fifth|fifths]] or [[perfect fourth|fourth]]s, as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | Note\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | G{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | D{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | A{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | E{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | B{{music|flat}}\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | F\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | C\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | G\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | D\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | A\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | E\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | B\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | F{{music|sharp}}\n|-\n!

Cents\n|588\n|90\n|792\n|294\n|996\n|498\n|0\n|702\n|204\n|906\n|408\n|1110\n|612\n|}\n\nThe ratios are computed with respect to C (the ''base note''). Starting from C, they are obtained by moving six steps (around the [[circle of fifths]]) to the left and six to the right. Each step consists of a multiplication of the previous pitch by 2/3 (descending fifth), 3/2 (ascending fifth), or their [[inversion (music)|inversions]] (3/4 or 4/3).\n\nBetween the [[enharmonic]] notes at both ends of this sequence is a [[pitch (music)|pitch]] ratio of {{nobreak|3<sup>12</sup> / 2<sup>19</sup> {{=}} 531441 / 524288}}, or about 23 [[Cent (music)|cents]], known as the [[Pythagorean comma]]. To produce a twelve-tone scale, one of them is arbitrarily discarded. The twelve remaining notes are repeated by increasing or decreasing their frequencies by a power of 2 (the size of one or more [[octave]]s) to build scales with multiple octaves (such as the keyboard of a piano). A drawback of Pythagorean tuning is that one of the twelve fifths in this scale is badly tuned and hence unusable (the [[wolf fifth]], either F{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|flat}} if G{{music|flat}} is discarded, or B-G{{music|flat}} if F{{music|sharp}} is discarded). This twelve-tone scale is fairly close to [[equal temperament]], but it does not offer much advantage for [[tonality|tonal]] harmony because only the perfect intervals (fourth, fifth, and octave) are simple enough to sound pure. Major thirds, for instance, receive the rather unstable interval of 81:64, sharp of the preferred 5:4 by an 81:80 ratio.<ref name=\"autogenerated1968\">{{Cite book | author=Danielou, Alain | title=The Ragas of Northern Indian Music | year=1968 | publisher=Barrie & Rockliff |location=London | isbn = 0-214-15689-3}}</ref> The primary reason for its use is that it is extremely easy to tune, as its building block, the perfect fifth, is the simplest and consequently the most [[consonance and dissonance|consonant]] interval after the octave and unison.\n\nPythagorean tuning may be regarded as a \"three-limit\" tuning system, because the ratios can be expressed as a product of integer powers of only whole numbers less than or equal to 3.\n\n===Five-limit tuning===\n{{Main|Five-limit tuning}}\n\nA twelve-tone scale can also be created by compounding harmonics up to the fifth. Namely, by multiplying the frequency of a given reference note (the '''base note''') by powers of 2, 3, or 5, or a combination of them. This method is called five-limit tuning.\n\nTo build such a twelve-tone scale (using C as the base note), we may start by constructing a table containing fifteen pitches:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! Factor\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | {{fraction|1|9}}\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | {{fraction|1|3}}\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | 1\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | 3\n! style=\"width: 4em\" | 9\n!\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | 5\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | D\n| A\n| E\n| B\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | F{{music|sharp}}\n! note\n|-\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 10:9\n| 5:3\n| 5:4\n| 15:8\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 45:32\n! ratio\n|-\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 182\n| 884\n| 386\n| 1088\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 590\n! cents\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | 1\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | B{{music|b}}\n| F\n| '''{{red|C}}'''\n| G\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | D\n! note\n|-\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 16:9\n| 4:3\n| 1:1\n| 3:2\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 9:8\n! ratio\n|-\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 996\n| 498\n| 0\n| 702\n| style=\"background:coral;\" | 204\n! cents\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | {{fraction|1|5}}\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | G{{music|flat}}\n| D{{music|flat}}\n| A{{music|flat}}\n| E{{music|flat}}\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | B{{music|flat}}\n! note\n|-\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 64:45\n| 16:15\n| 8:5\n| 6:5\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 9:5\n! ratio\n|-\n| style=\"background:springgreen;\" | 610\n| 112\n| 814\n| 316\n| style=\"background:gold;\" | 1018\n! cents\n|}\n\nThe factors listed in the first row and column are powers of 3 and 5, respectively (e.g., 1/9 = 3<sup>\u22122</sup>). Colors indicate couples of [[enharmonic]] notes with almost identical pitch. The ratios are all expressed relative to C in the centre of this diagram (the base note for this scale). They are computed in two steps:\n\n# For each cell of the table, a ''base ratio'' is obtained by multiplying the corresponding factors. For instance, the base ratio for the lower-left cell is 1/9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1/5&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/45.\n# The base ratio is then multiplied by a negative or positive power of 2, as large as needed to bring it within the range of the octave starting from C (from 1:1 to 2:1). For instance, the base ratio for the lower left cell (1/45) is multiplied by 2<sup>6</sup>, and the resulting ratio is 64:45, which is a number between 1:1 and 2:1.\n\nNote that the powers of 2 used in the second step may be interpreted as ascending or descending [[octave]]s. For instance, multiplying the frequency of a note by 2<sup>6</sup> means increasing it by 6 octaves. Moreover, each row of the table may be considered to be a sequence of fifths (ascending to the right), and each column a sequence of major thirds (ascending upward). For instance, in the first row of the table, there is an ascending fifth from D and A, and another one (followed by a descending octave) from A to E. This suggests an alternative but equivalent method for computing the same ratios. For instance, one can obtain A, starting from C, by moving one cell to the left and one upward in the table, which means descending by a fifth and ascending by a major third:\n\n:{{sfrac|2|3}} \u00d7 {{sfrac|5|4}} = {{sfrac|10|12}} = {{sfrac|5|6}}.\n\nSince this is below C, one needs to move up by an octave to end up within the desired range of ratios (from 1:1 to 2:1):\n\n:{{sfrac|5|6}} \u00d7 {{sfrac|2|1}} = {{sfrac|10|6}} = {{sfrac|5|3}}.\n\nA 12-tone scale is obtained by removing one note for each couple of enharmonic notes. This can be done in at least three ways, which have in common the removal of G{{music|flat}}, according to a convention which was valid even for C-based Pythagorean and quarter-comma meantone scales. Note that it is a [[diminished fifth]], close to half an octave, above the tonic C, which is a disharmonic interval; also its ratio has the largest values in its numerator and denominator of all tones in the scale, which make it least harmonious: all reasons to avoid it.\n\nThis is only one possible strategy of [[five-limit tuning]]. It consists of discarding the first column of the table (labeled \"{{frac|1|9}}\"). The resulting 12-tone scale is shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Asymmetric scale\n|-\n!

However, it can be easily extended by using higher positive and negative powers of the same numbers, such as 5<sup>2</sup> = 25, 5<sup>\u22122</sup> = 1/25, 3<sup>3</sup> = 27, or 3<sup>\u22123</sup> = 1/27. A scale with 25, 35 or even more pitches can be obtained by combining these base ratios, as in [[five-limit tuning]].\n\n==Indian scales==\nIn [[Indian music]], the just diatonic scale described above is used, though there are different possibilities, for instance for the sixth pitch (''Dha''), and further modifications may be made to all pitches excepting ''Sa'' and ''Pa''.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Bagchee, Sandeep | authorlink= | title=Nad: Understanding Raga Music | publisher=BPI (India) PVT Ltd | location= | isbn=81-86982-07-8 | page=23| year= 1998}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5em;\" | Note\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Sa''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Re''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Ga''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Ma''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Pa''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Dha''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Ni''\n! style=\"width:5em;\" |''Sa''\n|-\n!

There are many different explanations.)\n\n==Practical difficulties==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nSome fixed just intonation scales and systems, such as the diatonic scale above, produce [[wolf interval]]s. The above scale allows a minor tone to occur next to a semitone which produces the awkward ratio 32:27 for D-F, and still worse, a minor tone next to a fourth giving 40:27 for D-A. Moving D down to 10:9 alleviates these difficulties but creates new ones: D-G becomes 27:20, and D-B becomes 27:16. This fundamental problem arises in any system of tuning using a limited number of notes.\n\nOne can have more [[fret]]s on a [[guitar]] to handle both As, 9:8 with respect to G and 10:9 with respect to G so that A-C can be played as 6:5 while A-D can still be played as 3:2. 9:8 and 10:9 are less than 1/53 of an octave apart, so mechanical and performance considerations have made this approach extremely rare. And the problem of how to tune chords such as C-E-G-A-D, in typical 5-limit just intonation, is left unresolved (for instance, A could be 4:3 below D (making it 9:8, if G is 1) or 4:3 above E (making it 10:9, if G is 1) but not both at the same time, so one of the fourths in the chord will have to be an out-of-tune wolf interval). However the frets may be removed entirely\u2014this, unfortunately, makes in-tune fingering of many chords exceedingly difficult, due to the construction and mechanics of the human hand\u2014and the tuning of most complex chords in just intonation is generally ambiguous.\n\nSome composers deliberately use these wolf intervals and other dissonant intervals as a way to expand the tone color palette of a piece of music.  For example, the extended piano pieces ''[[The Well-Tuned Piano]]'' by LaMonte Young and ''The Harp Of New Albion'' by Terry Riley use a combination of very consonant and dissonant intervals for musical effect.  In \"Revelation\", [[Michael Harrison (musician)|Michael Harrison]] goes even further, and uses the tempo of beat patterns produced by some dissonant intervals as an integral part of several movements.\n\nFor many fixed-pitch instruments tuned in just intonation, one cannot change [[key (music)|keys]] without retuning the instrument. For instance, if a piano is tuned in just intonation intervals and a minimum of wolf intervals for the key of G, then only one other key (typically E-flat) can have the same intervals, and many of the keys have a very dissonant and unpleasant sound. This makes [[modulation (music)|modulation]] within a piece, or playing a repertoire of pieces in different keys, impractical to impossible.\n\n[[Synthesizer]]s have proven a valuable tool for composers wanting to experiment with just intonation. They can be easily retuned with a [[microtuner]]. Many commercial synthesizers provide the ability to use built-in just intonation scales or to create them manually. [[Wendy Carlos]] used a system on her 1986 album ''[[Beauty in the Beast]]'', where one electronic keyboard was used to play the notes, and another used to instantly set the root note to which all intervals were tuned, which allowed for modulation. On her 1987 lecture album ''Secrets of Synthesis'' there are audible examples of the difference in sound between equal temperament and just intonation.\n\n==Singing and scale-free instruments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nThe human voice is among the most pitch-flexible instruments in common use. Pitch can be varied with no restraints and adjusted in the midst of performance, without needing to retune. Although the explicit use of just intonation fell out of favour concurrently with the increasing use of instrumental accompaniment (with its attendant constraints on pitch), most [[a cappella]] ensembles naturally tend toward just intonation because of the comfort of its stability. [[Barbershop music|Barbershop quartets]] are a good example of this.\n\nThe unfretted stringed instruments from the violin family (the violin, the viola, the cello and the double bass) are quite flexible in the way pitches can be adjusted. Stringed instruments that are not playing with fixed pitch instruments tend to adjust the pitch of key notes such as thirds and [[leading tone]]s so that the pitches differ from equal temperament.\n\nTrombones have a slide that allows arbitrary tuning during performance. French horns can be tuned by shortening or lengthening the main tuning slide on the back of the instrument, with each individual rotary or piston slide for each rotary or piston valve, and by using the right hand inside the bell to adjust the pitch by pushing the hand in deeper to sharp the note, or pulling it out to flatten the note while playing. Some natural horns also may adjust the tuning with the hand in the bell, and valved cornets, trumpets, Flugelhorns, Saxhorns, Wagner tubas, and tubas have overall and valve-by-valve tuning slides, like valved horns. \n\nWind instruments with valves are biased towards natural tuning and must be micro-tuned if equal temperament is required.\n\nOther wind instruments, although built to a certain scale, can be micro-tuned to a certain extent by using the embouchure or adjustments to fingering.\n\n==Western composers==\nComposers often impose a [[Limit (music)|limit]] on how complex the ratios may become.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Genesis of a music : an account of a creative work, its roots and its fulfillments|last=1901\u20131974|first=Partch, Harry|isbn=030671597X|edition=Second edition, enlarged|location=New York|oclc=624666|year = 1974}}</ref> For example, a composer who chooses to write in 7-limit just intonation will not employ ratios that use powers of prime numbers larger than 7. Under this scheme, ratios like 11:7 and 13:6 would not be permitted, because 11 and 13 cannot be expressed as powers of those prime numbers \u2264 7 (''i.e.'' 2, 3, 5, and 7).\n\nThough just intonation in its simplest form (5-limit) may seem to suggest a necessarily [[tonality|tonal]] logic, it need not be the case. Some music of [[Kraig Grady]] and [[Daniel James Wolf]] uses just intonation scales designed by [[Erv Wilson]] explicitly for a consonant form of [[atonality]], and many of Ben Johnston's early works, like the ''[[Sonata for Microtonal Piano]]'' and ''String Quartet No. 2'', use [[serialism]] to elide the predominance of a tonal centre.\n\nAlternatively, composers such as [[La Monte Young]], Ben Johnston, [[James Tenney]], [[Marc Sabat]], [[Wolfgang von Schweinitz]], and [[Cat Lamb|Catherine Lamb]] have sought a new kind tonality and harmony \u2013 one based on the perception and experience of sound, which not only allows for the more familiar consonant structures, but also extends them beyond the 5-limit into a nuanced and diverse network of relationships between tones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plainsound.org/|title=Plainsound Music Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Yuri Landman]] devised a just intonation musical scale from an atonal [[prepared guitar]] [[extended technique|playing technique]] based on adding a third [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] under the strings. When this bridge is positioned at [[Node (physics)|nodal]] positions of the guitar strings' [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]], the volume of the instrument increases and the [[overtone]] becomes clear, having a consonant relation to the complementary opposed string part creating a harmonic [[multiphonic]] tone.<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html 3rd Bridge Helix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824020439/http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html |date=2012-08-24 }} by Yuri Landman on furious.com</ref>\n\n==Staff notation==\n[[File:Helmholtz-Ellis JI pitch notation microtonal accidents legend.gif|thumb|375px|alt=Legend of the HE Accidentals|{{anchor|fig1}}Fig.&nbsp;1: Legend of the Helmholtz-Ellis Accidentals within the 23-limit.]]Originally a system of notation to describe scales was devised by [[Moritz Hauptmann|Hauptmann]] and modified by [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] (1877); the starting note is presumed Pythagorean; a \u201c+\u201d is placed between if the next note is a just major third up, a \u201c\u2212\u201d if it is a just minor third, among others; finally, subscript numbers are placed on the second note to indicate how many syntonic commas (81:80) to lower by.<ref name=Helmholtz1885>{{cite book |first=Hermann |last=von Helmholtz |year=1885 |url=https://archive.org/details/onsensationston00unkngoog |title=On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music |page=276 |publisher=Longmans, Green}} Note the use of the \u201c+\u201d between just major thirds, \u201c\u2212\u201d between just minor thirds, \u201c|\u201d between Pythagorean minor thirds, and \u201c\u00b1\u201d between perfect fifths.</ref> For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C+E ({{audio|Pythagorean major third on C.mid|Play}}) while the just major third is C+E<sub>1</sub> ({{audio|Just major third on C.mid|Play}}).

[[James Tenney]], amongst others, preferred to combine JI ratios with [[cent (music)|cents]] deviations from the [[equal tempered]] pitches, indicated in a legend or directly in the score, allowing performers to readily use electronic tuning devices if desired.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Garland, Peter |year=1984 |series=Soundings |volume=13 |title=The Music of James Tenney |publisher=Soundings Press |location=Santa Fe, New Mexico |oclc=11371167}}</ref> \n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Ben Johnston had proposed an alternative approach, redefining the understanding of conventional symbols (the seven \"white\" notes, the sharps and flats) and adding further accidentals, each designed to extend the notation into higher [[prime limit]]s. His notation \"begins with the 16th-century Italian definitions of intervals and continues from there.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kylegann.com/tuning.html |title=Just Intonation Explained |website=KyleGann.com |access-date=28 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> '''Johnston notation''' is based on a diatonic C Major scale tuned in JI [[#fig4|(Fig.&nbsp;4)]], in which the interval between D (9:8 above C) and A (5:3 above C) is one [[syntonic comma]] less than a Pythagorean perfect fifth 3:2. To write a perfect fifth, Johnston introduces a pair of symbols, + and \u2212 again, to represent this comma. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F would proceed C G D A+ E+ B+. The three conventional white notes A E B are tuned as Ptolemaic major thirds (5:4) above F C G respectively. Johnston introduces new symbols for the septimal ({{music|7}} & {{music|L}}), undecimal ({{music|up}} & {{music|down}}), tridecimal ({{music|13}} & {{music|13 upside down}}), and further prime-number extensions to create an accidental based exact JI notation for what he has named \"Extended Just Intonation\" ([[#fig2|Fig.&nbsp;2]] & [[#fig3|Fig.&nbsp;3]]).<ref name=Johnson2006/>{{rp|pages=77\u201388}} For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E+ while the just major third is C-E{{music|natural}} [[#fig4|(Fig.&nbsp;4)]].[[File:Notation of partials 1-19 for 1-1.png|thumb|400px|left|{{anchor|fig2}}Fig.&nbsp;2: Staff notation of partials 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 on C<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fonville, John |date=Summer 1991 |title=Ben Johnston's Extended Just Intonation: A guide for interpreters |journal=Perspectives of New Music |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=121, 106\u2013137}}</ref> using Johnston notation {{audio|Notation of partials 1-19 for 1-1.mid|Play}}.]]\n[[File:Harmonic seventh chord just on C.png|thumb|right|200px|{{anchor|fig3}}Fig.&nbsp;3: Just harmonic seventh chord (4:5:6:7:8) on C {{audio|Harmonic seventh chord just on C.mid|Play}} in Johnston notation.

In particular, the conventional flats, naturals and sharps define a Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. The Pythagorean pitches are then paired with new symbols that commatically alter them to represent various other partials of the harmonic series [[#fig1|(Fig.&nbsp;1)]]. To facilitate quick estimation of pitches, cents indications may be added (e.g. downward deviations below and upward deviations above the respective accidental). A typically used convention is that cent deviations refer to the ''tempered pitch'' implied by the flat, natural, or sharp. A complete legend and fonts for the notation (see samples) are open source and available from the Plainsound Music Edition website.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sabat |first=Marc |title=The Extended Helmholtz Ellis JI Pitch Notation |url=http://www.marcsabat.com/pdfs/notation.pdf |publisher=Plainsound Music Edition |accessdate=March 11, 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E{{music|natural}} while the just major third is C-E{{music|natural}}\u2193 (see [[#fig4|Fig.&nbsp;4]] for \"combined\" symbol)\n[[File:HEJI Johnston.png|thumb|center|600px|{{anchor|fig4}}Fig.&nbsp;4: Comparison of Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation and Johnston Notation.

It is used to notate both just intonation and equal temperaments. The size of the symbol indicates the size of the alteration.<ref>{{cite magazine |author1-link=George Secor |author1=Secor, George D. <!-- |author2-link=David C.

At the same time, they provide some degree of practicality through their extension of staff notation, as traditionally trained performers may draw on their intuition for roughly estimating pitch height. This may be contrasted with the more abstract use of ratios for representing pitches in which the amount by which two pitches differ and the \"direction\" of change may not be immediately obvious to most musicians. One caveat is the requirement for performers to learn and internalize a (large) number of new graphical symbols. However, the use of unique symbols reduces harmonic ambiguity and the potential confusion arising from indicating only cent deviations.\n\n==Audio examples==\n*{{audio|A_Major_Scale,_Triads,_and_Fifths_Just.ogg|Just intonation}} An A-major scale, followed by three major triads, and then a progression of fifths in just intonation.\n*{{audio|A_Major_Scale,_Triads,_and_Fifths_Equal.ogg|Equal temperament}} An A-major scale, followed by three major triads, and then a progression of fifths in equal temperament.

The following year was the most prominent of Jones's career, making him one of the most popular vocalists of the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1965, \"It's Not Unusual\" reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in the United States. During 1965, Mills secured a number of film themes for Jones to record, including the theme songs for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'' (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]) and also for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.<ref name=\"BioPart3\"/> Jones was also awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1966.<ref name=\"Grammy\">{{cite magazine| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=tom+jones+grammy+award+best+new+artist&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dYaBT4GRLqWi0QXsqK2LBw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tom%20jones%20grammy%20award%20best%20new%20artist&f=false |title= Naras Champions of 1965| page= 12| work= Billboard | date= 26 March 1966| access-date= 8 April 2012}}</ref> In Hollywood, Jones met [[Elvis Presley]] for the first time; he recalls Presley singing his song as he walked towards him on set.\n\nIn 1966, Jones's popularity began to slip somewhat, causing Mills to reshape the singer's image into that of a [[crooner]]. Jones also began to sing material that appealed to a wider audience, such as the country hit \"[[Green, Green Grass of Home]]\". The strategy worked, and Jones returned to the top of the charts in the UK and began hitting the Top 40 again in the US.

The couple's son, Mark, was born in the month following their wedding. To support his young family, Jones took a job working in a glove factory and was later employed in construction.\n\n==Career==\n===Rise to fame===\nJones's voice has been described as a \"full-throated, robust [[baritone]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He became the frontman in 1963 for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a Welsh [[beat group]]. They soon gained a local following and reputation in [[South Wales]]. In 1964, the group recorded several solo tracks with producer [[Joe Meek]], who took them to various record labels, but they had little success. Later that year, [[Decca Records|Decca]] producer Peter Sullivan saw Tommy Scott and the Senators performing in a club and directed them to manager [[Phil Solomon (music executive)|Phil Solomon]], but the partnership was short-lived.\n\nThe group continued to play gigs at dance halls and [[working men's club]]s in South Wales. One night at the Top Hat in [[Cwmtillery]], Jones was spotted by [[Gordon Mills]], a London-based manager who also originally hailed from [[South Wales]].

The following year was the most prominent of Jones's career, making him one of the most popular vocalists of the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1965, \"It's Not Unusual\" reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in the United States. During 1965, Mills secured a number of film themes for Jones to record, including the theme songs for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'' (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]) and also for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.<ref name=\"BioPart3\"/> Jones was also awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1966.<ref name=\"Grammy\">{{cite magazine| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=tom+jones+grammy+award+best+new+artist&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dYaBT4GRLqWi0QXsqK2LBw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tom%20jones%20grammy%20award%20best%20new%20artist&f=false |title= Naras Champions of 1965| page= 12| work= Billboard | date= 26 March 1966| access-date= 8 April 2012}}</ref> In Hollywood, Jones met [[Elvis Presley]] for the first time; he recalls Presley singing his song as he walked towards him on set.\n\nIn 1966, Jones's popularity began to slip somewhat, causing Mills to reshape the singer's image into that of a [[crooner]].

The strategy worked, and Jones returned to the top of the charts in the UK and began hitting the Top 40 again in the US.
