{"title_page": "Scientific law", "text_new": "[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas scientific law records what happens.]]\n'''Scientific laws''' or '''laws of science''' are statements, based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]s or [[observation]]s, that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].<ref>{{OED|law of nature}}</ref> The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[Earth science]]). Laws are developed from data and can be further developed through [[mathematics]]; in all cases they are directly or indirectly based on [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they implicitly reflect, though they do not explicitly assert, causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.<ref name=\"McComas2013\">{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}</ref>\n\nScientific laws summarize the results of experiments or observations, usually within a certain range of application. In general, the accuracy of a law does not change when a new theory of the relevant phenomenon is worked out, butt rather the scope of the law's application, since the mathematics or statement representing the law does not change. As with other kinds of scientific knowledge, laws do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be contradicted, restricted, or extended by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.\n\nLaws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may entail one or several laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work |title=Definitions from |publisher=the NCSE |date= |accessdate=2019-03-18}}</ref> Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief }}</ref> Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].<ref name=gouldfact>{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34\u201337}}</ref> The nature of scientific laws has been much discussed in [[philosophy]], butt in essence scientific laws are simply empirical conclusions reached by [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nA scientific law always applies to a [[physical system]] under the same conditions, and it implies that there is a causal relationship involving the elements of the system. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like \"Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure\" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].<ref>{{Citation\n  | contribution = Laws, natural or scientific\n  | editor-last = Honderich\n  | editor-first = Bike\n  | title = Oxford Companion to Philosophy\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474 474\u2013476]\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | place = Oxford\n  | year = 1995\n  | isbn = 0-19-866132-0\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474\n  }}</ref>\n\nLaws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], [[Boyle's law]] applies with perfect accuracy only to the ideal gas, etc. These laws remain useful, butt only under the conditions where they apply.\n\nMany laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as <math>\\Delta E = 0</math>, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as <math>\\mathrm{d}U=\\delta Q-\\delta W\\,</math>, and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] can be written as ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}. While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not like mathematical theorems (which can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment).\n\nLike theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.\n\nSome laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, [[Newtonian dynamics]] (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.\n\nLaws are constantly being tested experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed. Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, butt the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations, to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.\n\n==Properties==\n\nScientific laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. A scientific law is \"[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present.\"<ref>{{OED|Law of nature}}</ref> The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]].\n\nSeveral general properties of scientific laws, particularly when referring to laws in [[physics]], have been identified.

In these cases, laws may describe general trends or expected behaviors rather than being absolutes.\n\n== Laws as consequences of mathematical symmetries==\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\nSome laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (e.g. the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, and [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[spacetime]]). Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].\n\nThe [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].\n\nOne strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.\n\n== Laws of physics ==\n=== Conservation laws ===\n\n====Conservation and symmetry====\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\n\nMost significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.\n\n*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.\n* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, butt part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.\n*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.\n*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.\n\n====Continuity and transfer====\n\nConservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted \u2207\u2022) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Physics, conserved quantity\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Conserved quantity ''q'' \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Volume density ''\u03c1'' (of ''q'') \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Flux '''J''' (of ''q'')\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Equation\n|-\n| [[Hydrodynamics]], [[fluid]]s <br />\n| ''m'' = [[mass]] (kg)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume [[mass density]] (kg m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| ''\u03c1'' '''u''', where<br/ >\n'''u''' = [[velocity field]] of fluid (m s<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) </math>\n|-\n| [[Electromagnetism]], [[electric charge]]\n| ''q'' = electric charge (C)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume electric [[charge density]] (C m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''J''' = electric [[current density]] (A m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math> \n|-\n| [[Thermodynamics]], [[energy]]\n| ''E'' = energy (J)\n| ''u'' = volume [[energy density]] (J m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''q''' = [[heat flux]] (W m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=- \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} </math> \n|-\n| [[Quantum mechanics]], [[probability]] \n|| ''P'' = ('''r''', ''t'') = \u222b|\u03a8|<sup>2</sup>d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' = [[probability distribution]]\n|| ''\u03c1'' = ''\u03c1''('''r''', ''t'') = |\u03a8|<sup>2</sup> = [[probability density function]] (m<sup>\u22123</sup>),<br />\n\u03a8 = [[wavefunction]] of quantum system\n|| '''j''' = [[probability current]]/flux\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial |\\Psi|^2}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} </math> \n|}\n\nMore general equations are the [[convection\u2013diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.\n\n===Laws of classical mechanics===\n\n====Principle of least action====\n\n{{Main|Principle of least action}}\n\nAll of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:\n\n:<math> \\delta \\mathcal{S} = \\delta\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\mathcal{S} </math> is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]\n\n:<math> L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) = T(\\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)-V(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)</math>\n\nof the physical system between two times ''t''<sub>1</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub>. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''q<sub>N</sub>'').\n\nThere are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''p<sub>N</sub>''), where:\n\n:<math>p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}</math>\n\nThe action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term \"path\" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).\n\nThe action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' \"shape\" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''<sub>1</sub> to ''t''<sub>2</sub>). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as \"differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc\", rather this idea is applied to the entire \"shape\" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).<ref>Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P.

However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]].

This leads to results which are not usually called \"laws\", butt hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.\n\nOne postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.\n\nOther postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"width:300px;\"| '''[[Quantum mechanics]], [[Quantum field theory]]'''\n\n'''[[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (general form):''' Describes the time dependence of a quantum mechanical system.\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt} \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\hat{H} \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle </math>\n\nThe [[Hamiltonian quaternions|Hamiltonian]] (in quantum mechanics) ''H'' is a [[self-adjoint operator]] acting on the state space, <math>| \\psi \\rangle </math> (see [[Dirac notation]]) is the instantaneous [[quantum state vector]] at time ''t'', position '''r''', ''i'' is the unit [[imaginary number]], ''\u0127'' = ''h''/2\u03c0 is the reduced [[Planck's constant]].\n| rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:300px;\"|'''[[Wave-particle duality]]'''\n\n'''[[Planck constant|Planck\u2013Einstein law]]:''' the [[energy]] of [[photon]]s is proportional to the [[frequency]] of the light (the constant is [[Planck's constant]], ''h'').  \n:<math> E = h\\nu = \\hbar \\omega </math>\n\n'''[[Matter wave|De Broglie wave]]length:''' this laid the foundations of wave\u2013particle duality, and was the key concept in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]],\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k}</math>\n\n'''[[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]:''' [[Uncertainty]] in position multiplied by uncertainty in [[momentum]] is at least half of the [[reduced Planck constant]], similarly for time and [[energy]];\n:<math>\\Delta x \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2},\\, \\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} </math>\n\nThe uncertainty principle can be generalized to any pair of observables - see main article.\n|-\n| '''Wave mechanics'''\n\n'''[[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (original form):''' \n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\psi + V \\psi </math>\n|- style=\"border-top: 3px solid;\"\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:600px;\"| '''[[Pauli exclusion principle]]:''' No two identical [[fermion]]s can occupy the same quantum state ([[boson]]s can).

Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]\n\nThe most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].\n\nAdditional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.\n\n[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers; although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.\n\nThe law of definite composition and the law of multiple proportions are the first two of the three laws of [[stoichiometry]], the proportions by which the chemical elements combine to form chemical compounds. The third law of stoichiometry is the [[law of reciprocal proportions]], which provides the basis for establishing [[equivalent weight]]s for each chemical element. Elemental equivalent weights can then be used to derive [[standard atomic weight|atomic weights]] for each element.\n \nMore modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.\n\n;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]\n\n* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules\u2014the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.\n* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.\n* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond\u2013Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].\n* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.\n* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.\n\n;[[Thermochemistry]]\n\n*[[Dulong\u2013Petit law]]\n*[[Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation]]\n*[[Hess's law]]\n\n;Gas laws\n\n*[[Raoult's law]]\n*[[Henry's law]]\n\n;Chemical transport\n\n*[[Fick's laws of diffusion]]\n*[[Graham's law]]\n*[[Lamm equation]]\n\n== Laws of biology ==\n{{Main|Biological rules}}\n\n\n== Laws of geology ==\n\n*[[Archie's law]]\n*[[Buys-Ballot's law]]\n*[[Birch's law]]\n*[[Byerlee's law]]\n* [[Principle of original horizontality]]\n* [[Law of superposition]] \n* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]\n* [[Principle of cross-cutting relationships]]\n* [[Principle of faunal succession]]\n* [[Law of included fragments|Principle of inclusions and components]] \n* [[Walther's law]] \n\n== Other fields ==\nSome [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.\n\nExamples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius\u2013Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, and [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as \"laws\". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.\n\n== History ==\nThe observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes\u2014such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena\u2014to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.\n\nAccording to a positivist view, when compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature replace the need for [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.\n\nIn Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.<blockquote>The formula \"law of nature\" first appears as \"a live metaphor\" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,<ref>in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, \"When Nature Got its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref> the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.<br/><br/>\nFor the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.<ref>Sedley, \"When Nature Got Its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] described \"nature\" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts \"are to be attributed to nature.

[[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).\n\nThe distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.<ref>Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use \"physical law\" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists.

In general, the accuracy of a law does not change when a new theory of the relevant phenomenon is worked out, but rather the scope of the law's application, since the mathematics or statement representing the law does not change. As with other kinds of scientific knowledge, laws do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be contradicted, restricted, or extended by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.\n\nLaws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may entail one or several laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work |title=Definitions from |publisher=the NCSE |date= |accessdate=2019-03-18}}</ref> Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief }}</ref> Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].<ref name=gouldfact>{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34\u201337}}</ref> The nature of scientific laws has been much discussed in [[philosophy]], but in essence scientific laws are simply empirical conclusions reached by [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nA scientific law always applies to a [[physical system]] under the same conditions, and it implies that there is a causal relationship involving the elements of the system. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like \"Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure\" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].<ref>{{Citation\n  | contribution = Laws, natural or scientific\n  | editor-last = Honderich\n  | editor-first = Bike\n  | title = Oxford Companion to Philosophy\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474 474\u2013476]\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | place = Oxford\n  | year = 1995\n  | isbn = 0-19-866132-0\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474\n  }}</ref>\n\nLaws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], [[Boyle's law]] applies with perfect accuracy only to the ideal gas, etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.\n\nMany laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as <math>\\Delta E = 0</math>, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as <math>\\mathrm{d}U=\\delta Q-\\delta W\\,</math>, and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] can be written as ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}. While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not like mathematical theorems (which can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment).\n\nLike theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.\n\nSome laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, [[Newtonian dynamics]] (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.\n\nLaws are constantly being tested experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed. Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations, to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.\n\n==Properties==\n\nScientific laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. A scientific law is \"[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present.\"<ref>{{OED|Law of nature}}</ref> The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]].\n\nSeveral general properties of scientific laws, particularly when referring to laws in [[physics]], have been identified.

In these cases, laws may describe general trends or expected behaviors rather than being absolutes.\n\n== Laws as consequences of mathematical symmetries==\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\nSome laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (e.g. the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, and [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[spacetime]]). Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].\n\nThe [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].\n\nOne strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.\n\n== Laws of physics ==\n=== Conservation laws ===\n\n====Conservation and symmetry====\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\n\nMost significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.\n\n*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.\n* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.\n*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.\n*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.\n\n====Continuity and transfer====\n\nConservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted \u2207\u2022) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Physics, conserved quantity\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Conserved quantity ''q'' \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Volume density ''\u03c1'' (of ''q'') \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Flux '''J''' (of ''q'')\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Equation\n|-\n| [[Hydrodynamics]], [[fluid]]s <br />\n| ''m'' = [[mass]] (kg)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume [[mass density]] (kg m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| ''\u03c1'' '''u''', where<br/ >\n'''u''' = [[velocity field]] of fluid (m s<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) </math>\n|-\n| [[Electromagnetism]], [[electric charge]]\n| ''q'' = electric charge (C)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume electric [[charge density]] (C m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''J''' = electric [[current density]] (A m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math> \n|-\n| [[Thermodynamics]], [[energy]]\n| ''E'' = energy (J)\n| ''u'' = volume [[energy density]] (J m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''q''' = [[heat flux]] (W m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=- \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} </math> \n|-\n| [[Quantum mechanics]], [[probability]] \n|| ''P'' = ('''r''', ''t'') = \u222b|\u03a8|<sup>2</sup>d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' = [[probability distribution]]\n|| ''\u03c1'' = ''\u03c1''('''r''', ''t'') = |\u03a8|<sup>2</sup> = [[probability density function]] (m<sup>\u22123</sup>),<br />\n\u03a8 = [[wavefunction]] of quantum system\n|| '''j''' = [[probability current]]/flux\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial |\\Psi|^2}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} </math> \n|}\n\nMore general equations are the [[convection\u2013diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.\n\n===Laws of classical mechanics===\n\n====Principle of least action====\n\n{{Main|Principle of least action}}\n\nAll of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:\n\n:<math> \\delta \\mathcal{S} = \\delta\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\mathcal{S} </math> is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]\n\n:<math> L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) = T(\\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)-V(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)</math>\n\nof the physical system between two times ''t''<sub>1</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub>. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''q<sub>N</sub>'').\n\nThere are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''p<sub>N</sub>''), where:\n\n:<math>p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}</math>\n\nThe action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term \"path\" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).\n\nThe action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' \"shape\" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''<sub>1</sub> to ''t''<sub>2</sub>). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as \"differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc\", rather this idea is applied to the entire \"shape\" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).<ref>Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P.

However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]].

Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be \"rotated into one another\", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.\n\n;Pre-Maxwell laws\n\nThese laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot\u2013Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form).

This leads to results which are not usually called \"laws\", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.\n\nOne postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.\n\nOther postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"width:300px;\"| '''[[Quantum mechanics]], [[Quantum field theory]]'''\n\n'''[[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (general form):''' Describes the time dependence of a quantum mechanical system.\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt} \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\hat{H} \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle </math>\n\nThe [[Hamiltonian quaternions|Hamiltonian]] (in quantum mechanics) ''H'' is a [[self-adjoint operator]] acting on the state space, <math>| \\psi \\rangle </math> (see [[Dirac notation]]) is the instantaneous [[quantum state vector]] at time ''t'', position '''r''', ''i'' is the unit [[imaginary number]], ''\u0127'' = ''h''/2\u03c0 is the reduced [[Planck's constant]].\n| rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:300px;\"|'''[[Wave-particle duality]]'''\n\n'''[[Planck constant|Planck\u2013Einstein law]]:''' the [[energy]] of [[photon]]s is proportional to the [[frequency]] of the light (the constant is [[Planck's constant]], ''h'').  \n:<math> E = h\\nu = \\hbar \\omega </math>\n\n'''[[Matter wave|De Broglie wave]]length:''' this laid the foundations of wave\u2013particle duality, and was the key concept in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]],\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k}</math>\n\n'''[[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]:''' [[Uncertainty]] in position multiplied by uncertainty in [[momentum]] is at least half of the [[reduced Planck constant]], similarly for time and [[energy]];\n:<math>\\Delta x \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2},\\, \\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} </math>\n\nThe uncertainty principle can be generalized to any pair of observables - see main article.\n|-\n| '''Wave mechanics'''\n\n'''[[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (original form):''' \n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\psi + V \\psi </math>\n|- style=\"border-top: 3px solid;\"\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:600px;\"| '''[[Pauli exclusion principle]]:''' No two identical [[fermion]]s can occupy the same quantum state ([[boson]]s can).

Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]\n\nThe most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].\n\nAdditional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.\n\n[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers; although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.\n\nThe law of definite composition and the law of multiple proportions are the first two of the three laws of [[stoichiometry]], the proportions by which the chemical elements combine to form chemical compounds. The third law of stoichiometry is the [[law of reciprocal proportions]], which provides the basis for establishing [[equivalent weight]]s for each chemical element. Elemental equivalent weights can then be used to derive [[standard atomic weight|atomic weights]] for each element.\n \nMore modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.\n\n;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]\n\n* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules\u2014the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.\n* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.\n* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond\u2013Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].\n* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.\n* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.\n\n;[[Thermochemistry]]\n\n*[[Dulong\u2013Petit law]]\n*[[Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation]]\n*[[Hess's law]]\n\n;Gas laws\n\n*[[Raoult's law]]\n*[[Henry's law]]\n\n;Chemical transport\n\n*[[Fick's laws of diffusion]]\n*[[Graham's law]]\n*[[Lamm equation]]\n\n== Laws of biology ==\n{{Main|Biological rules}}\n\n\n== Laws of geology ==\n\n*[[Archie's law]]\n*[[Buys-Ballot's law]]\n*[[Birch's law]]\n*[[Byerlee's law]]\n* [[Principle of original horizontality]]\n* [[Law of superposition]] \n* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]\n* [[Principle of cross-cutting relationships]]\n* [[Principle of faunal succession]]\n* [[Law of included fragments|Principle of inclusions and components]] \n* [[Walther's law]] \n\n== Other fields ==\nSome [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.\n\nExamples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius\u2013Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, and [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as \"laws\". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.\n\n== History ==\nThe observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes\u2014such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena\u2014to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.\n\nAccording to a positivist view, when compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature replace the need for [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.\n\nIn Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.<blockquote>The formula \"law of nature\" first appears as \"a live metaphor\" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,<ref>in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, \"When Nature Got its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref> the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.<br/><br/>\nFor the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.<ref>Sedley, \"When Nature Got Its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] described \"nature\" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts \"are to be attributed to nature.

[[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).\n\nThe distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.<ref>Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use \"physical law\" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists.

It is possibly the first depiction of the Kelmendi ''fis''.]]\n{{Template:Albanian tribes sidebar}}\n'''Kelmendi''' is a historical [[Albanian tribes|Albanian tribe]] (''fis'') and region in [[Mal\u00ebsia]] ([[Kelmend (municipality)|Kelmend municipality]]) and eastern Montenegro (parts of [[Gusinje Municipality]]). It is located in the upper valley of the [[Cem (river)|Cem]] river and its tributaries in the [[Accursed Mountains]] range of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Vermosh river springs in the [[Vermosh|village of the same]], which is Albania's northernmost village. Vermosh pours into [[Lake Plav]].\n\nKelmendi is mentioned as early as the 14th century and as a territorial tribe it developed in the 15th century. In the Balkans, it is widely known historically for its longtime resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its extensive battles and raids against the Ottomans which reached as far north as Bosnia and as far east as Bulgaria. By the 17th century, they had grown so much in numbers and strength that their name was sometimes used for all tribes of northern Albania and Montenegro. The Ottoman tried several times to expel them completely from their home territory and forcefully settle them elsewhere, but the community returned to its ancestral lands again. \n\nKelmendi's legacy is found throughout the region. Via expansion, migratory settlement or even forced resettlement, Kelmendi is found beyond the Cem valley ([[Selc\u00eb]], [[Vuk\u00ebl]], [[Nik\u00e7]] and others), Gusinje (in particular, the villages [[Vusanje|Vuthaj]], Doli, Martinaj and Gusinje/Gucia itself) and [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] (Hakaj). To the east in the [[Pe\u0161ter]] plateau, many families trace their origin to Kelmendi. In [[Kosovo]]{{Cref2|a}}, descendants of Kelmendi live in the [[Rugova Canyon]]. In Montenegro, half of the tribe (''pleme'') of Old [[Ceklin]] and a part of [[Ku\u010di]] in the 16th century come from Kelmendi. The northernmost settlement from Kelmendi is in the villages of [[Hrtkovci]] and [[Nikinci]] in [[Syrmia]] when 1,600 Catholic Albanian refugees settled there in 1737.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Kelmendi'' comes from Latin [[Clemens]]. A folk etymology explains it as Kol Mendi (Nicholas the Clever). The historical origin of the toponym is traced to the Roman fort of Clementiana which [[Procopius of Caesarea]] mentions in the mid 6th century in the road that connected [[Scodra]] and [[Petriz\u00ean]]. As a surname it first appears in 1353 in a Latin document which mentions ''dominus Georgius filius Georgii Clementi de Spasso'' (Lord Georgius, son of Georgius Clementi of Spas) in northern Albania.<ref name=\"\u0160ufflay\">{{cite book|author=Milan \u0160ufflay|authorlink=Milan \u0160ufflay|title=Izabrani politi\u010dki spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXJOAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 March 2020|year=2000|publisher=Matica hrvatska|page=136}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nikc 04.JPG|thumb|left|Catholic church in [[Nik\u00e7]].]]\n[[File:Overview of Albanian tribes, Franz Seiner, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Albanian bajraks (1918). Kelmendi bajraks are numbered 1\u20134.]]\nThe Kelmendi region is located in the [[District of Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]] in northern Albania, situated in the northernmost and most isolated part of the country. It borders the Albanian tribal regions of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the west, [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the southwest, [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Boga]] to the south, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] to the east, and the [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin tribal]] regions of [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThere are many theories on the place of origin of the Kelmendi. Before the 20th century, several travellers, historians and clergymen have recorded various oral traditions and presented their own interpretations. In modern times, archival research has provided a more historically grounded approach. [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] in the 1920s found the first reference to the Kelmendi name in the Venetian archives. The publication of the Ottoman defter of the sanjak of Scutari in 1974 marks the publication of the first historical record about the people of Kelmendi, their anthroponymy, toponymy and social organization. \n\nIn the early centuries of Kelmendi, in the 15th and 16th centuries the only information that is mentioned about them is their language, ethnic group and religion. As Catholic bishop [[Frang Bardhi]] writes in his correspondence with the [[Roman Curia]], ''they belong to the Albanian nation, speak Albanian, hold our holy Roman Catholic beliefs''.<ref name=\"Zamputi1963\">{{cite book |last1=Zamputi |first1=Injac |title=Relacione mbi gjendjen e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb veriore e t\u00eb mesme n\u00eb shekullin XVII (1634-1650) [Correspondence on the situation in northern and central Albania in the 17th century] |date=1963 |publisher=Univeristy of Tirana |page=161 |url=https://www.academia.edu/41423125 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The first writing about Kelmendi's area of origin is from Franciscan missionary, Bernardo da Verona who in 1663 wrote that ''it is not easy to make comments about Kelmendi's origin, but it has become customary to say that they came from [[Ku\u010di]] or one of the neighbouring tribes.''. The second commentary about Kelmendi's place of origin comes in 1685 in a letter by Catholic archbishop [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] who writes that ''according to oral stories the progenitor of Kelmendi came from the Upper [[Mora\u010da]]''.<ref name=\"Ukgjini1999\">{{cite web |last1=Ukgjini |first1=Nik\u00eb |title=V\u00ebshtrim i shkurt\u00ebr historik p\u00ebr fisin e Kelmendit [A short historical summary about the fis of Kelmendi] |url=http://www.kulturserver-hamburg.de/home/shkodra/phoenix_11_12/phoenix_11_12_art05.html |publisher=Phoenix Journal |date=1999 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |ref=Ukgjini1999}}</ref> \n\nFrench consul Hyacinte Hecquard (1814\u20131866), noted that all of the Kelmendi (''Clementi'') except the families called ''Onos'' believe that they descend from one ancestor, ''Clemens'' or ''Clement'' (Kelment or Kelmend{{sfn|Elsie|2015}} in Albanian).{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=177}} A Franciscan priest in Shkodra, Gabriel recounted a story about a Clemens who was a Venetian who was a priest in [[Venetian Dalmatia]] and [[Herzegovina]] before taking refuge in Albania.{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}} The story went on to say he originated from either of those two provinces, and that he was encountered by a pastor in [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]].{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}}\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded the most widely spread oral tradition about Kelmendi's origins in 1850. According it a rich herdsman in the region of Triepshi (which administratively in the past fell within Kuci) employed as a herdsman a young man who came to Triepshi from an unknown region. The young man had an affair with Bum\u00e7e, the daughter of the rich herdsman.

One story has it that the founder settled from Lajqit e Hotit, in Hoti, and to Hoti from Fundane, the village of Lopare in Ku\u010di; he was upset with the Hoti and Ku\u010di, and therefore left those tribes. When he lived in Lopare, he married a girl from Triepshi, who followed him. His name was Amati, and his wife's name was Bum\u00e7e. According to others, his name was Klement, from where the tribe received its name. Another story, which Jovi\u010devi\u0107 had heard in Selce, was that the founder was from Piperi, a poor man that had worked as a servant for a wealthy Ku\u010di, there he sinned with a girl from a noble family, and left via the [[Cem (river)|Cem]].{{sfn|Jovi\u010devi\u0107|1923|pp=60\u201361}}  \n\nIn oral tradition, Bum\u00e7e, the wife of Kelmendi came from the Bekaj brotherhood of Triepshi.<ref name=\"Shyti\">{{cite web |last1=Shyti |first1=Nikoll\u00eb |title=T\u00eb par\u00ebt e Kelmendit erdh\u00ebn nga Trieshi |url=https://zanimalsise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ZANI-I-MALESISE-PRILL-2018.pdf |website=Zani i Mal\u00ebsis\u00eb [Voice of Mal\u00ebsia] |accessdate=19 March 2020 |ref=Shyti}}</ref>\n\nThe first historical record about Kelmendi is the Ottoman [[defter]] of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] 1497, which was a supplementary registry to that of 1485.

Thus, [[Marino Bizzi]] (1570\u20131624), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] writes in 1610 that ''the Kelmendi peoples, who are almost entirely Latin, speak Albanian and Dalmatian and are divided in ten katuns: Kelmendi, Gruda, Hoti, Kastrati, Shkreli, Tuzi all Latins and Bjelopavlici, Piperi, Bratonosici, these are Dalmatians and Kuci of whom half are schismatics and half Latin''.{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2013|p=23}}\n\nBizzi reported an incident in 1613 in which an Ottoman commander, Arslan Pasha, raided the villages of the Kelmendi and started taking prisoners, until an agreement was reached with the Kelmendi clans. According to the agreement, the Kelmendi would surrender fifteen of their members as slaves, and pay a tribute of 1,000 ducats to the Ottomans. However, as Arslan Pasha waited for the payment of the tribute, the Kelmendi ambushed part of his troops and killed about thirty cavalrymen.

It is located in the upper valley of the [[Cem (river)|Cem]] river and its tributaries in the [[Accursed Mountains]] range of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Vermosh river springs in the [[Vermosh|village of the same]], which is Albania's northernmost village. Vermosh pours into [[Lake Plav]].\n\nKelmendi is mentioned as early as the 14th century and as a territorial tribe it developed in the 15th century. In the Balkans, it is widely known historically for its longtime resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its extensive battles and raids against the Ottomans which reached as far north as Bosnia and as far east as Bulgaria. By the 17th century, they had grown so much in numbers and strength that their name was sometimes used for all tribes of northern Albania and Montenegro. The Ottoman tried several times to expel them completely from their home territory and forcefully settle them elsewhere, but the community returned to its ancestral lands again. \n\nKelmendi's legacy is found throughout the region. Via expansion, migratory settlement or even forced resettlement, Kelmendi is found beyond the Cem valley ([[Selc\u00eb]], [[Vuk\u00ebl]], [[Nik\u00e7]] and others), Gusinje (in particular, the villages [[Vusanje|Vuthaj]], Doli, Martinaj and Gusinje/Gucia itself) and [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] (Hakaj). To the east in [[Ro\u017eaje]] and the [[Pe\u0161ter]] plateau, many families trace their origin to Kelmendi. In [[Kosovo]]{{Cref2|a}}, descendants of Kelmendi live in the [[Rugova Canyon]]. In Montenegro, half of the tribe (''pleme'') of Old [[Ceklin]] and a part of [[Ku\u010di]] in the 16th century come from Kelmendi. The northernmost settlement from Kelmendi is in the villages of [[Hrtkovci]] and [[Nikinci]] in [[Syrmia]] when 1,600 Catholic Albanian refugees settled there in 1737.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Kelmendi'' comes from Latin [[Clemens]]. A folk etymology explains it as Kol Mendi (Nicholas the Clever). The historical origin of the toponym is traced to the Roman fort of Clementiana which [[Procopius of Caesarea]] mentions in the mid 6th century in the road that connected [[Scodra]] and [[Petriz\u00ean]]. As a surname it first appears in 1353 in a Latin document which mentions ''dominus Georgius filius Georgii Clementi de Spasso'' (Lord Georgius, son of Georgius Clementi of Spas) in northern Albania.<ref name=\"\u0160ufflay\">{{cite book|author=Milan \u0160ufflay|authorlink=Milan \u0160ufflay|title=Izabrani politi\u010dki spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXJOAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 March 2020|year=2000|publisher=Matica hrvatska|page=136}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nikc 04.JPG|thumb|left|Catholic church in [[Nik\u00e7]].]]\n[[File:Overview of Albanian tribes, Franz Seiner, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Albanian bajraks (1918).

It borders the Albanian tribal regions of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the west, [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the southwest, [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Boga]] to the south, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] to the east, and the [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin tribal]] regions of [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThere are many theories on the place of origin of the Kelmendi. Before the 20th century, several travellers, historians and clergymen have recorded various oral traditions and presented their own interpretations. In modern times, archival research has provided a more historically grounded approach. [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] in the 1920s found the first reference to the Kelmendi name in the Venetian archives. The publication of the Ottoman defter of the sanjak of Scutari in 1974 marks the publication of the first historical record about the people of Kelmendi, their anthroponymy, toponymy and social organization. \n\nIn the early centuries of Kelmendi, in the 15th and 16th centuries the only information that is mentioned about them is their language, ethnic group and religion. As Catholic bishop [[Frang Bardhi]] writes in his correspondence with the [[Roman Curia]], ''they belong to the Albanian nation, speak Albanian, hold our holy Roman Catholic beliefs''.<ref name=\"Zamputi1963\">{{cite book |last1=Zamputi |first1=Injac |title=Relacione mbi gjendjen e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb veriore e t\u00eb mesme n\u00eb shekullin XVII (1634-1650) [Correspondence on the situation in northern and central Albania in the 17th century] |date=1963 |publisher=Univeristy of Tirana |page=161 |url=https://www.academia.edu/41423125 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The first writing about Kelmendi's area of origin is from Franciscan missionary, Bernardo da Verona who in 1663 wrote that ''it is not easy to make comments about Kelmendi's origin, but it has become customary to say that they came from [[Ku\u010di]] or one of the neighbouring tribes.''. The second commentary about Kelmendi's place of origin comes in 1685 in a letter by Catholic archbishop [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] who writes that ''according to oral stories the progenitor of Kelmendi came from the Upper [[Mora\u010da]]''.<ref name=\"Ukgjini1999\">{{cite web |last1=Ukgjini |first1=Nik\u00eb |title=V\u00ebshtrim i shkurt\u00ebr historik p\u00ebr fisin e Kelmendit [A short historical summary about the fis of Kelmendi] |url=http://www.kulturserver-hamburg.de/home/shkodra/phoenix_11_12/phoenix_11_12_art05.html |publisher=Phoenix Journal |date=1999 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |ref=Ukgjini1999}}</ref> \n\nFrench consul Hyacinte Hecquard (1814\u20131866), noted that all of the Kelmendi (''Clementi'') except the families called ''Onos'' believe that they descend from one ancestor, ''Clemens'' or ''Clement'' (Kelment or Kelmend{{sfn|Elsie|2015}} in Albanian).{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=177}} A Franciscan priest in Shkodra, Gabriel recounted a story about a Clemens who was a Venetian who was a priest in [[Venetian Dalmatia]] and [[Herzegovina]] before taking refuge in Albania.{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}} The story went on to say he originated from either of those two provinces, and that he was encountered by a pastor in [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]].{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}}\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded the most widely spread oral tradition about Kelmendi's origins in 1850.

When he lived in Lopare, he married a girl from Triepshi, who followed him. His name was Amati, and his wife's name was Bum\u00e7e.

Thus, [[Marino Bizzi]] (1570\u20131624), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] writes in 1610 that ''the Kelmendi peoples, who are almost entirely Latin, speak Albanian and Dalmatian and are divided in ten katuns: Kelmendi, Gruda, Hoti, Kastrati, Shkreli, Tuzi all Latins and Bjelopavlici, Piperi, Bratonosici, these are Dalmatians and Kuci of whom half are schismatics and half Latin''.{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2013|p=23}}\n\nBizzi reported an incident in 1613 in which an Ottoman commander, Arslan Pasha, raided the villages of the Kelmendi and started taking prisoners, until an agreement was reached with the Kelmendi clans. According to the agreement, the Kelmendi would surrender fifteen of their members as slaves, and pay a tribute of 1,000 ducats to the Ottomans. However, as Arslan Pasha waited for the payment of the tribute, the Kelmendi ambushed part of his troops and killed about thirty cavalrymen.

It is broadcast on the [[ Network]], and is currently hosted by [[ (television presenter)| ]] and [[]]. The program follows ''[[Seven News#Early News| News]]'', and runs from 5:30 am to 9:00 am. It is followed by ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning ]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kochie.jpg|thumb|David Koch, host]][[File:Samantha Armytage.jpg|thumb|upright|Samantha Armytage, host]]\nThe history of ''Sunrise'' can be traced back to at least 17 January 1991 when ''[[11AM (TV series)|11AM]]'' news presenter Darren McDonald began presenting an early morning ''Seven News \u2013 Sunrise Edition'' bulletin prior to hostilities breaking out during the Gulf War.\n\nIn 1996, Seven introduced a one-hour weekday bulletin called ''Sunrise News'', later renamed ''Sunrise''. Seven recruited [[Chris Bath]] from [[NBN Television]] to present the bulletin alongside [[Peter Ford (news anchor)|Peter Ford]].<ref>{{cite news\n | first = James | last = Cockington\n | title = Breakfast TV\n | date = 6 May 1996\n | work = Sydney Morning Herald\n | page = 4\n}}</ref> Ford moved to other presenting roles in 1996 and was replaced by finance editor David Koch. In 1997, Chris Bath was transferred to Seven's ''10.30 pm News'' and was replaced by [[Melissa Doyle]]. In 1998 ''Sunrise'' was presented by Doyle and Nick McArdle. Seven launched a Sunday bulletin hosted by [[Stan Grant (journalist)|Stan Grant]], entitled ''Sunday Sunrise'', in 1997.<ref>{{cite news\n | first = Lawrence | last = Money\n | title = Stanley times three\n | work = Sunday Age\n | date = 12 January 1997\n | page = 14\n}}</ref> Weekday ''Sunrise'' was cancelled in 1999, replaced by children's program ''[[The Big Arvo|The Big Breakfast]]''.<ref>{{cite news\n | title = Wake up with bright sparks\n | work = Adelaide Advertiser\n | date = 28 July 1999\n | page = 49\n}}</ref> Seven maintained half-hourly news updates during ''The Big Breakfast'' and their Sunday bulletin was not affected by the axing. Other temporary ''Sunrise'' hosts up until this time include [[Anne Fulwood]] (who was filling in for [[Georgie Gardner]] at the time of the program's end), [[Leigh Hatcher]] and [[Nick McArdle]] (previously weekend sport presenter, ''[[Seven News]]'' Sydney).\n\nDuring the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]], [[Andrew Daddo]] and [[Johanna Griggs]] presented ''Olympic Sunrise'' from a leased apartment near [[Lavender Bay, New South Wales]], in Sydney which provided the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and [[Sydney Opera House]] as waterside backdrops.\n\nOn 1 May 2000, the program was replaced by a new version of ''Sunrise'' produced by [[Adam Boland]]. It was hosted by Georgie Gardner and Melbourne sport reporter [[Mark Beretta]]. It was followed by music video program ''[[AMV (television program)|AMV]]''.\n\nAccording to Boland's ''Brekky Central'', in late 2001 producers had created a plan to take on ''Today'' on the Nine Network, the leader at breakfast, taking inspiration from Fox America's ''Fox and Friends''. Set to debut in March 2002, the multimillion-dollar production would have its own dedicated studio and fronted by Australian Radio personality Andrew Daddo and [[Lisa Forrest]]. However a month before its launch, the network's board axed the idea and believed money could be better spent.\n\nIn 2002, Seven revamped their breakfast television schedule with ''Seven Early News'' at 6:00 am, hosted by [[Chris Reason]] (which only lasted around one week), and a new version of ''Sunrise'' from 6:30 am to 9:00 am, hosted by Reason and Melissa Doyle. ''Sunrise'' ran from 6:00 am to 9:00 am from February the same year. David Koch was brought in to present the finance reports. In October of that year, Reason discovered he had another cancerous tumour behind his kidney and had to resign from his position. Four years earlier he had undergone treatment for another growth. Koch was appointed temporary presenter, a position later made permanent.\n\n''Sunrise'' was yet again revamped in December 2002 soon after Koch's appointment, focusing less on hard news and became more [[family friendly]]. The show, along with its rival ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' on Nine, have become more tabloid focused which has boosted ratings.\n\nIn 2003, the show began to pick up ratings, and appointed [[Natalie Barr]] to present the news updates, followed by the appointment of former [[Network Ten]] journalist [[Grant Denyer]] to present weather reports, then the re-appointment of [[Mark Beretta]], who was brought in to present sports updates. The new plan to take on Today, following the ratings rise, was some dramatic point of difference which included news updates every thirty minutes, big interviews, less formal presenting than a news bulletin, \"the soapbox\", ROS wall, natural chemistry but most importantly a shift in viewers interest. \"Kochie\" and \"Mel\", as they became informally known, replied less on scripts but more on talking points. They would debate the issues of the day and the viewers would heavily influence those topics. On 30 August 2004, ''Sunrise'', ''[[Seven News#Sydney|Seven News Sydney]]'' and ''[[Seven News|Seven Morning News]]'' moved from their studios in [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] to the new [[Seven Martin Place|Seven News centre]] at [[Martin Place]].\n\nOn 29 January 2007 ''Sunrise'' had a complete makeover with changes to the set and on-screen graphics. Due to continued viewer feedback, the ''Sunrise'' set changed again on 10 June 2007; specifically, the new set includes more of the city into its shots by the installation of [[smart glass]]. This glass, similar to that on the new [[Boeing 787]] allows for the transparency of the glass to be adjusted, ranging from clear, to partially transparent to completely opaque, showing as a solid blue. These changes have proved useful in shielding viewers from the actions of some passers by, notably, cast members of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]''. The set was also modified so ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show's]]'' set could fit into the [[Martin Place]] current affairs studio. In October 2009, it was announced that at the start of 2010, ''Sunrise'' will receive a brand new set, format, graphics and logo on 25 January 2010.\n\nIn April 2010, ''Sunrise'' added a feature show that shows a selection of highlights from the previous day's (or in the case of Monday, Friday's) ''Sunrise''; the show known as ''Sunrise Extra'' aired at 5am each weekday prior to ''[[Seven News|Seven Early News]]''.\n\n[[File:Seven News cross.jpg|thumb|left|215px|A ''Sunrise'' reporter reporting outside the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Ultimo studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].]]\n\nIn 2011, there was much speculation that Melissa Doyle would be leaving the show to present ''[[Today Tonight]]'' and that David Koch may be moved to a prime-time position. However, Doyle continued with the show for her tenth consecutive year in 2012, as did Koch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/confidential/show-hosts-play-musical-chairs/story-e6freq7o-1226174028119///Default.aspx|title=Sunrise breakfast show faces overhaul|date=23 October 2011|publisher=Courier Mail|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 February 2012, ''Sunrise'' celebrated its 10th anniversary with Doyle and Koch. Doyle is the only original presenter remaining from the March 2002 launch; at the time, Chris Reason was her co-host (he took leave in late 2002 to fight cancer, prompting the initial then-temporary appointment of Koch) and Koch was the finance analyst. Koch started presenting ''Sunrise'' on a permanent basis from 4 October 2002.\n\nIn May 2013, Sunrise broadcast once a week from the Seven Network's Melbourne studios ([[HSV (TV station)|HSV-7]]) to attempt and capture a growing Melbourne audience. ''Sunrise'' has been trailing ''Today'' (and, since 2008, ''News Breakfast'' on the ABC) in the Melbourne market since 2008. The show was broadcast from the stations ''[[AFL Game Day]]'' set. This was discontinued later on after continually poor ratings.\n\nOn 20 June 2013 during the program, Doyle announced that she was leaving ''Sunrise'' after 14 years to front a new prime time Network News initiative. She stated, \"It's with that experience and support from the team that I am able to take this next step. I'm honoured that the Network has given me this incredible new opportunity and I am unbelievably excited about the new challenges ahead.\" It was later announced that [[Samantha Armytage]] would be replacing Doyle as co-host alongside Koch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/melissa-doyle-announces-she-is-leaving-sunrise-with-samantha-armytage-to-replace-her/story-e6frfmyi-1226666651246|title=Melissa Doyle announces she is leaving Sunrise, with Samantha Armytage to replace her|date=20 June 2013|publisher=News.com.au|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, ''Sunrise'' received a new set and graphics and was extended by 30 minutes to start at 5:30&nbsp;am, matching the starting time of rival ''Today''.

This included, since 2003:\n* 22 March 2003 \u2013 David Koch and Melissa Doyle hosted the special edition of ''Sunrise'' covering the latest on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] as it happened. This also saw the rise of [[Natalie Barr]] as news presenter.\n* 24 November 2007 (as ''Weekend Sunrise'') \u2013 a special edition hosted by [[Andrew O'Keefe]] and [[Samantha Armytage]] covering the final day of the 2007 election campaign. [[Talitha Cummins]] presented the news, while [[Kylie Gillies]] presented the sport.\n* 17 July 2010 (as ''Weekend Sunrise'') \u2013 A special edition hosted by [[Larry Emdur]] and [[Rebecca Maddern]] covering from 7:00 am to 1:30 pm, Australian prime minister [[Julia Gillard]]'s trip to Government House to talk with the Governor General, [[Quentin Bryce]], and her press conference at Government House about an election to be held on 21 August and [[Tony Abbott]]'s press conference in Brisbane. [[Sarah Cumming]] presented the news, Simon Reeve presented the sport and [[James Tobin (presenter)|James Tobin]] presented the weather.\n* The weeks of 10\u201314 January and 17\u201321 January \u2013 ''Sunrise'' was extended to start at 5:00 am and going on past 9:00 am on these mornings to cover the ongoing [[2010\u20132011 Queensland floods]] and [[2011 Victorian floods]] with ''[[Seven News]]'' picking up the rest of the coverage. As a result, the tennis coverage was moved to [[7Two]] (week of 10\u201314 January) and Sunrise extended to finish at 10:00 am (week of 17\u201321 January).\n* 22 February 2011 \u2013 David Koch reported live from Christchurch on the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].\n* 26 January 2012 \u2013 ''Sunrise'' aired live from a mini-barge celebrating Australia Day on Sydney Harbour. Some viewers were given the opportunity to join the ''Sunrise'' team after entering an online competition.<ref name=\"au.tv.yahoo.com\">http://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunrise/galleries/photo/-/12695598/sunrise-on-the-harbour-for-australia-day/12695604/</ref>\n* 16 December 2014 \u2013 ''Sunrise'' reported live from 4:00 am to 9:00 am for the coverage of the [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis]]\n\n===Musical guests===\n[[File:Ava Max meeting fans.jpg|thumb|right|US pop singer [[Ava Max]] meeting fans outside the Sunrise studios following a promotional appearance in April 2019.]]\n[[File:Pussycat Dolls on Sunrise.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Pussycat Dolls]] being interviewed by David Koch after performing on the show in 2020.]]\nA number of musical guests have appeared on ''Sunrise'' and performed live action the show, usually meeting fans afterwards. Like the rest of the studio, their stage area gives people on the street a chance to view the performances. Occasionally, musical guests perform \"on the plaza\" on a temporary stage erected in [[Martin Place]]. Musical performances normally take place at 7:50am and 8:50am, with most guests playing two songs.\n\n===''Weekend Sunrise''===\n{{main|Weekend Sunrise}}\n\nIn 2005 the Seven Network replaced its struggling Sunday morning program ''Sunday Sunrise'' with a program called ''Weekend Sunrise'' which originally was an hour long (8am \u2013 9am) program with an identical format to ''Sunrise''. Hosted by [[Chris Reason]] (then the presenter of ''Sunday Sunrise'') and [[Lisa Wilkinson]], the program was successful and various critiques at the time called for the program to be lengthened to two hours (7am \u2013 9am) and be extended to Saturday mornings as well as Sunday.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn 2006, ''Weekend Sunrise'' was extended from an hour to a two-hour show, running every Sunday from 8:00 am till 10:00 am. When ''[[Sportsworld (Australian TV series)|Sportsworld]]'' returned for the football season ''Weekend Sunrise'' settled into a 90-minute format from 8:00 am to 9:30 am. After ''Sportsworld's'' series concluded, the show returned to a two-hour format.\n\n[[Andrew O'Keefe]] initially temporarily replaced host Chris Reason in 2006, but after improved ratings he was given the hosting position permanently. In 2007, Wilkinson moved to the [[Nine Network]] to host ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' and was replaced by [[Samantha Armytage]]. In 2008, ''Weekend Sunrise'' moved their start time 30 minutes earlier to 7:30 am to match the new start time of Nine's ''[[Sunday (Australian TV program)|Sunday]]'' program. The program continued to run through to 10:00 am, meaning that the program had a two-and-a-half hour running time.\n\nIn 2009, the program's start time was moved even earlier. Originally, rival [[Nine Network]] announced that ''[[Weekend Today (Australian TV series)|Today on Sunday]]'' (now ''Weekend Today''), the replacement of the long-running ''Sunday'', would run from 7:30 am to 9:00 am. But this was changed on 28 January 2009 to 7:00 am to 9:00 am. As result, Seven announced that ''Weekend Sunrise'' would also commence at 7:00 am and run to 10:00 am, meaning the program would go for three hours, the same as the weekday version of ''Sunrise''.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Weekend Sunrise wakes up to Today's alarm|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/01/weekend-sunrise-wakes-up-to-todays-alarm.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 February 2010, Seven announced that ''Weekend Sunrise'' would extend to Saturdays to compete against ''Weekend Today''. The Saturday edition airs in the same time slot as ''Weekend Today'' (7:00 am to 10:00 am). ''[[Saturday Disney]]'', which previously occupied the timeslot, aired its last two hours of their program on [[7flix]] (the first hour, from 6:00&nbsp;am &ndash; 7:00&nbsp;am, preceded ''Weekend Sunrise'' on the Seven Network). The original Saturday team consisted of [[Samantha Armytage]] co-hosting with [[Larry Emdur]] with [[Sarah Cumming]], Simon Reeve and [[James Tobin (presenter)|James Tobin]] presenting news, sport and weather respectively.\n\nIn June 2013, Melissa Doyle announced that she would be leaving ''Sunrise'' for a national network role with Samantha Armytage replacing her. [[Monique Wright]] therefore initially replaced Armytage on ''Weekend Sunrise'', but it was not until February 2014 that she was made a permanent co-host on the show.<ref>[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/02/monique-wright-named-as-permanent-co-host-of-weekend-sunrise.html Monique Wright names as permanent co-host of Weekend Sunrise], ''TV Tonight'', 25 February 2014</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, [[Andrew O'Keefe]] resigned citing a desire to spend more time with his family.<ref name=\"OKeefequits\">{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2017/12/andrew-okeefe-quits-weekend-sunrise.html|title=Andrew O'Keefe quits Weekend Sunrise|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref> In March 2018, it was announced that [[Basil Zempilas]] would replace O'Keefe.<ref>https://tvtonight.com.au/2018/03/basil-zempilas-joins-weekend-sunrise.html</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, [[Basil Zempilas]] announced his resignation as regular host of ''Weekend Sunrise'', citing a desire to spend more time with his family, but will still appear on the show intermittently as a summer and fill-in presenter whenever required.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2019/08/basil-zempilas-to-scale-back-weekend-sunrise-role.html|title=Basil Zempilas to scale back Weekend Sunrise role|last=Knox|first=David|date=18 August 2019|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref> In October 2019, it was announced that [[Matt Doran]] will replace Zempilas on the show from October 12.<ref>https://tvtonight.com.au/2019/10/matt-doran-to-join-weekend-sunrise.html</ref>\n\n{{As of|October 2019||df=}}, [[Monique Wright]] and [[Matt Doran (journalist)|Matt Doran]] are the co-hosts, with Sally Bowrey, [[Simon Reeve (Australian TV presenter)|Simon Reeve]] and [[James Tobin (presenter)|James Tobin]] presenting news, sport and weather respectively.\n\n==Format==\nLike most other breakfast television shows, ''Sunrise'' blends a mixture of news every thirty minutes, interviews and light-hearted feature pieces into three hours each morning. Often they will go out and present the show from other locations, such as Hawaii, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Athens, [[Disneyland]], Beijing and Melbourne for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], [[Beaconsfield, Tasmania|Beaconsfield]] in Tasmania and [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. A major feature of the show is that the viewer can send in their responses to stories via email, SMS, phone, Facebook and Twitter. Viewers can also bring up issues they want reviewed or investigated and it is recorded on the ROSwall (Responses of Sunrisers).\n\n===News and traffic reports===\n[[File:Sunrise Winnebago.jpg|right|thumb|The Sunrise Weather Winnebago in [[Mildura, Victoria]].]]\nLocal news updates, following the national news updates at 6am, 7am, and 8am were launched on 28 May 2007, offering viewers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, and Perth news specific to their city. Prior to this, local weather and capital city traffic updates had already been inserted into the program. These were removed in June 2008, following the commencement of ''[[Seven News|Seven Early News]]'', due to logistical reasons.\n\nSince 2015, Perth viewers have received their own localised news update, presented by [[Matt Tinney]] from Seven's [[TVW|Perth studios]] and airing every half-hour, prior to the national news update.

Bieber, however, has denied this,<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/justin-bieber-denies-kochie-claims-he-swore-at-floor-manager-on-sunrise/story-e6frf96o-1225871941062]</ref> publicly denouncing the claims as \"lies and rumors\" spread by \"adults\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/ledgerpop/article_272632062.shtml|title=Justin Bieber F Word Tirade \u2013 Twitter Response|work=National Ledger|date=29 May 2010|accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 March 2018, Armytage hosted a segment on ''Sunrise'' focusing on Aboriginal adoption, during which she incorrectly stated that Aboriginal children could not be [[Foster care|fostered]] by white people and stated that \"Post-[[Stolen Generations|Stolen Generation]], there's been a huge move to leave Aboriginal children where they are, even if they're being neglected in their own families\";<ref name=Reynolds>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/you-should-know-better-sunrise-breakfast-show-slammed-over-aboriginal-adoption-segment/news-story/ba50b71635590779999f1ac684990f4a|title='You should know better, Sunrise': Breakfast show slammed over Aboriginal adoption segment|publisher=News Limited|author=Emma Reynolds|date=15 March 2018|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> in addition, guest [[Prue MacSween]] said that most of the Stolen Generation were taken for their own well-being and suggested \"we need to do it again, perhaps\".<ref name=Reynolds/> The segment was widely criticised for these remarks, as well as for only including white people on the discussion panel and for not seeking any input from any Aboriginal people or experts on the subject. Consequently, protests were held outside the ''Sunrise'' studio in [[Martin Place]] in response to the segment on 15 March, which lead to further outrage when the programme chose to obscure the protest from viewers watching the live broadcast, citing a possible breach in broadcast standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/16/sunrise-hides-indigenous-protest-with-stock-footage-of-martin-place |title=Sunrise hides Indigenous protest outside studio with stock footage |last=Davidson |first=Helen |date=March 16, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180317041845/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/16/sunrise-hides-indigenous-protest-with-stock-footage-of-martin-place |archive-date=17 March 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/the-protest-sunrise-didnt-want-you-to-see/news-story/98b8e7c174d13c268da0b87e21a13148 |title=The protest Sunrise didn't want you to see |last=Schipp |first=Debbie |date=March 16, 2018 |work=[[News.com.au]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180317041911/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/the-protest-sunrise-didnt-want-you-to-see/news-story/98b8e7c174d13c268da0b87e21a13148 |archive-date=17 March 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In response to the controversy, the following week Koch presented a discussion on the issue with a panel of Indigenous experts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/sunrise-brings-in-indigenous-experts-following-public-outcry-20180320-p4z56y.html |title=Sunrise brings in Indigenous experts following public outcry |last=Carmody|first=Broede |date=March 20, 2018 |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}</ref> Despite this, protests continued during the show's live broadcasts at the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in April,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/the-vile-taunts-directed-at-samantha-armytage-during-sunrise-protest/news-story/8db1950f136c7f9ed9cbd57189425bf4|title=The vile taunts directed at Samantha Armytage during Sunrise protest|work=News.com.au|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> while in May rock band [[Portugal.

Both of those editions ended at 9:30 am with ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]'' picking up the rest of the coverage.\n\n''Sunrise'' was extended well past 9:00 am on the morning of 13 October 2010 to cover the [[2010 Copiap\u00f3 mining accident]]. As a result, ''The Morning Show'' did not air.\n\nOn 28 March 2017, ''Sunrise'' was extended to 1.00pm to cover Cyclone Debbie.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, ''Sunrise'' was extended to 12:00 pm to cover the Labor leadership ballot. ''The Morning Show'' did not air.\n\nOn 30 October 2012, ''Sunrise'' was extended to 1:00 pm to cover Hurricane Sandy.\n\nOn 22 January 2013, ''Sunrise'' commenced at 3:00 am and concluded at 10:00 am to cover the inauguration of Barack Obama. Normal early morning programming and ''Dr Oz'' did not air. On 29 January, ''Sunrise'' was extended to 11:00 am to cover flooding in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. As a result, ''The Morning Show'' did not air.\n\nFollowing the birth of [[Prince George of Cambridge]], Melissa Doyle fronted an extended edition of the program for two days, live from outside Buckingham Palace, with contribution from Martin Frizell, Mike Amor and Robert Jobson who had all also been covering the lead-up to the birth of the baby for ''Sunrise'' and ''7 News''. David Koch and Samantha Armytage also appeared in a reduced role back in the studio. The extended version began at 5:00 am, replacing ''Sunrise Extra'' and the ''Early News'', with Doyle also contributing reports to ''The Morning Show'' which began at its regular time of 9:00 am.\n\nOn 9 August 2013 a special ''Sunrise'' edition of This Is Your Life aired throughout the program to farewell the outgoing Sunrise host [[Melissa Doyle]]. Throughout the program special guests including [[Dannii Minogue]], [[Joe Hockey]] and then [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Kevin Rudd]] made video messages that were played to farewell Mel. [[Seven West Media]] CEO [[Tim Worner]] and [[Kerry Stokes]] appeared paying tribute to how she along with [[David Koch]] and though not mentioned Executive Producer [[Adam Boland]] revolutionised breakfast television in Australia. Throughout the show the #farewellmel trended on twitter.\n\n==Ratings==\n''Sunrise'' and its [[Nine Network]] rival ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' remain close in the ratings, with the gap between the two often being less than 50,000 viewers in ''Sunrise'''s favour.\n\nOn Good Friday, 2009, ''Sunrise'' suffered its first one-day ratings defeat nationally against ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' since 2004. In 2011, ''Sunrise'' suffered its first weekly ratings defeat against ''Today'' since the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2011/06/today-breaks-sunrise-reign.html|title=Today breaks Sunrise reign|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|date=13 June 2011|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> In 2016, after twelve straight years of ratings dominance, ''Sunrise'' dropped to second place behind ''Today'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/todays-karl-and-lisa-claim-first-annual-win-over-sunrise-after-12year-wait-20161018-gs54di.html|title=After 12-year wait, Today's Karl and Lisa claim first annual win over Sunrise|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Michael|last=Lallo|date=22 October 2016|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> but reclaimed the lead in the breakfast battle the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/crushed-by-sunrise-today-on-cusp-of-losing-2017-ratings-battle-20170721-gxfxfg.html|title=Crushed by Sunrise: Today on cusp of losing 2017 ratings battle|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Michael|last=Lallo|date=25 July 2017|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/breakfast-tv-wars-sunrise-wins-more-weeks-than-today-refuses-to-claim-victory-20170926-gyouoj.html|title=Breakfast TV wars: Sunrise wins more weeks than Today, refuses to claim victory|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Michael|last=Lallo|date=26 September 2017|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\nBecause Australia has more than one [[time zone]], ''Sunrise'' is not broadcast live to all of Australia, it is instead [[broadcast delay]]ed. [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] have ''Sunrise'' broadcast live all year round, and [[Queensland]] has ''Sunrise'' broadcast live in wintertime, but during [[Daylight Saving Time]] in Sydney has the program delayed by one hour. The [[Northern Territory]] has ''Sunrise'' delayed 30 minutes during winter and 90 minutes during Daylight Savings in Sydney. South Australia has it delayed by 30 minutes all year around and Western Australia has it delayed by two hours in wintertime and by three hours during Daylight Savings in Sydney.\n\nOccasionally, broadcasts of ''Sunrise'' are altered during special circumstances. On the morning of 20 March 2006, when ''Sunrise'' was normally on a one-hour delay in Queensland, the program was broadcast live in order to provide immediate and up-to-date information on Tropical [[Cyclone Larry]] to local residents. The show continued to be broadcast until 10am Sydney time only in to Queensland to continue these updates and prevent scheduling problems.\n\nOn most public holidays, Sunrise is extended to 10 am, thus adding an additional hour to its telecast, and has at times had a studio audience for these special events.\n\n==Theme song==\n''Sunrise'' used [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\" as its theme song up until 2010 when [[MGMT]]'s \"[[Electric Feel]]\" replaced it. In October 2011, \"(Reach Up for the) Sunrise\" was reinstated as the theme song again.\n\nFormerly, it had used a more traditional morning news theme before switching to the song. In the past it has also used the ''[[Seven News]]'' theme which was based on the John Williams piece \"[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television|Australia}}\n* [[List of longest-running Australian television series]]\n* ''[[Weekend Sunrise]]''\n* ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''\n* [[Journalism in Australia]]\n* [[List of Australian television series]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://7plus.com.au/sunrise}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0428169|title=Sunrise}}\n* {{tv.com show|sunrise|Sunrise and Weekend Sunrise}}\n\n{{Seven Network programming}}\n{{TV Newscaf Aus}}\n{{AustralianBreakfastShows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sunrise (Australian TV program)}}\n[[Category:Seven News|*]]\n[[Category:Australian television news programmes]]\n[[Category:1991 Australian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1999 Australian television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000 Australian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1990s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Australian television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Breakfast television in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Sunrise (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2011}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Sunrise\n| image                = File:7 sunrise logo 2016.png\n| genre                = [[breakfast television|Breakfast News Program]]\n| creator              =\n| developer            =\n| director             =\n| creative_director    =\n| presenter            = {{Plainlist | <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]] and the manual style of television. -->\n* [[David Koch (television presenter)|David Koch]]\n* [[Samantha Armytage]]\n* [[Natalie Barr]]\n* [[Angie Asimus]]\n* [[Mark Beretta]]\n* [[Edwina Bartholomew]]\n* [[Sam Mac]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer =\n| opentheme            = Reach Up for the Sunrise\n| endtheme             =\n| composer             =\n| country              = [[Australia]]\n| language             = English\n| num_seasons          = 24\n| num_episodes         = 5,000+\n| list_episodes        =\n| executive_producer   =[[Michael Pell]]\n| producer             = \n| location             = Martin Place, [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]\n| cinematography       =\n| editor               =\n| camera               =\n| runtime              = 210 minutes (3.5 hours)\n| network              = [[Seven Network]]\n| picture_format       = [[576i]] ([[SDTV]])<br />[[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])\n| audio_format         = [[Stereo]] \n| first_run            =\n| first_aired          = 17 January 1991 \u2013 present\n| last_aired           =\n| preceded_by          =\n| followed_by          =\n| related              = ''[[Weekend Sunrise]]''<br />''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''\n| website              = https://7plus.com.au/sunrise\n| supervising_producer =\n| asst_producer        =\n| co-producer          =\n| story_editor         =\n}}\n\n'''''Sunrise''''' is an Australian [[breakfast show]] program. It is broadcast on the [[Seven Network]], and is currently hosted by [[David Koch (television presenter)|David Koch]] and [[Samantha Armytage]]. The program follows ''[[Seven News#Seven Early News|Seven Early News]]'', and runs from 5:30 am to 9:00 am. It is followed by ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kochie.jpg|thumb|David Koch, host]][[File:Samantha Armytage.jpg|thumb|upright|Samantha Armytage, host]]\nThe history of ''Sunrise'' can be traced back to at least 17 January 1991 when ''[[11AM (TV series)|11AM]]'' news presenter Darren McDonald began presenting an early morning ''Seven News \u2013 Sunrise Edition'' bulletin prior to hostilities breaking out during the Gulf War.\n\nIn 1996, Seven introduced a one-hour weekday bulletin called ''Sunrise News'', later renamed ''Sunrise''. Seven recruited [[Chris Bath]] from [[NBN Television]] to present the bulletin alongside [[Peter Ford (news anchor)|Peter Ford]].<ref>{{cite news\n | first = James | last = Cockington\n | title = Breakfast TV\n | date = 6 May 1996\n | work = Sydney Morning Herald\n | page = 4\n}}</ref> Ford moved to other presenting roles in 1996 and was replaced by finance editor David Koch. In 1997, Chris Bath was transferred to Seven's ''10.30 pm News'' and was replaced by [[Melissa Doyle]]. In 1998 ''Sunrise'' was presented by Doyle and Nick McArdle. Seven launched a Sunday bulletin hosted by [[Stan Grant (journalist)|Stan Grant]], entitled ''Sunday Sunrise'', in 1997.<ref>{{cite news\n | first = Lawrence | last = Money\n | title = Stanley times three\n | work = Sunday Age\n | date = 12 January 1997\n | page = 14\n}}</ref> Weekday ''Sunrise'' was cancelled in 1999, replaced by children's program ''[[The Big Arvo|The Big Breakfast]]''.<ref>{{cite news\n | title = Wake up with bright sparks\n | work = Adelaide Advertiser\n | date = 28 July 1999\n | page = 49\n}}</ref> Seven maintained half-hourly news updates during ''The Big Breakfast'' and their Sunday bulletin was not affected by the axing. Other temporary ''Sunrise'' hosts up until this time include [[Anne Fulwood]] (who was filling in for [[Georgie Gardner]] at the time of the program's end), [[Leigh Hatcher]] and [[Nick McArdle]] (previously weekend sport presenter, ''[[Seven News]]'' Sydney).\n\nDuring the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]], [[Andrew Daddo]] and [[Johanna Griggs]] presented ''Olympic Sunrise'' from a leased apartment near [[Lavender Bay, New South Wales]], in Sydney which provided the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and [[Sydney Opera House]] as waterside backdrops.\n\nOn 1 May 2000, the program was replaced by a new version of ''Sunrise'' produced by [[Adam Boland]]. It was hosted by Georgie Gardner and Melbourne sport reporter [[Mark Beretta]]. It was followed by music video program ''[[AMV (television program)|AMV]]''.\n\nAccording to Boland's ''Brekky Central'', in late 2001 producers had created a plan to take on ''Today'' on the Nine Network, the leader at breakfast, taking inspiration from Fox America's ''Fox and Friends''. Set to debut in March 2002, the multimillion-dollar production would have its own dedicated studio and fronted by Australian Radio personality Andrew Daddo and [[Lisa Forrest]]. However a month before its launch, the network's board axed the idea and believed money could be better spent.\n\nIn 2002, Seven revamped their breakfast television schedule with ''Seven Early News'' at 6:00 am, hosted by [[Chris Reason]] (which only lasted around one week), and a new version of ''Sunrise'' from 6:30 am to 9:00 am, hosted by Reason and Melissa Doyle. ''Sunrise'' ran from 6:00 am to 9:00 am from February the same year. David Koch was brought in to present the finance reports. In October of that year, Reason discovered he had another cancerous tumour behind his kidney and had to resign from his position. Four years earlier he had undergone treatment for another growth. Koch was appointed temporary presenter, a position later made permanent.\n\n''Sunrise'' was yet again revamped in December 2002 soon after Koch's appointment, focusing less on hard news and became more [[family friendly]]. The show, along with its rival ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' on Nine, have become more tabloid focused which has boosted ratings.\n\nIn 2003, the show began to pick up ratings, and appointed [[Natalie Barr]] to present the news updates, followed by the appointment of former [[Network Ten]] journalist [[Grant Denyer]] to present weather reports, then the re-appointment of [[Mark Beretta]], who was brought in to present sports updates. The new plan to take on Today, following the ratings rise, was some dramatic point of difference which included news updates every thirty minutes, big interviews, less formal presenting than a news bulletin, \"the soapbox\", ROS wall, natural chemistry but most importantly a shift in viewers interest. \"Kochie\" and \"Mel\", as they became informally known, replied less on scripts but more on talking points. They would debate the issues of the day and the viewers would heavily influence those topics. On 30 August 2004, ''Sunrise'', ''[[Seven News#Sydney|Seven News Sydney]]'' and ''[[Seven News|Seven Morning News]]'' moved from their studios in [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] to the new [[Seven Martin Place|Seven News centre]] at [[Martin Place]].\n\nOn 29 January 2007 ''Sunrise'' had a complete makeover with changes to the set and on-screen graphics. Due to continued viewer feedback, the ''Sunrise'' set changed again on 10 June 2007; specifically, the new set includes more of the city into its shots by the installation of [[smart glass]]. This glass, similar to that on the new [[Boeing 787]] allows for the transparency of the glass to be adjusted, ranging from clear, to partially transparent to completely opaque, showing as a solid blue. These changes have proved useful in shielding viewers from the actions of some passers by, notably, cast members of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]''. The set was also modified so ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show's]]'' set could fit into the [[Martin Place]] current affairs studio. In October 2009, it was announced that at the start of 2010, ''Sunrise'' will receive a brand new set, format, graphics and logo on 25 January 2010.\n\nIn April 2010, ''Sunrise'' added a feature show that shows a selection of highlights from the previous day's (or in the case of Monday, Friday's) ''Sunrise''; the show known as ''Sunrise Extra'' aired at 5am each weekday prior to ''[[Seven News|Seven Early News]]''.\n\n[[File:Seven News cross.jpg|thumb|left|215px|A ''Sunrise'' reporter reporting outside the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Ultimo studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].]]\n\nIn 2011, there was much speculation that Melissa Doyle would be leaving the show to present ''[[Today Tonight]]'' and that David Koch may be moved to a prime-time position. However, Doyle continued with the show for her tenth consecutive year in 2012, as did Koch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/confidential/show-hosts-play-musical-chairs/story-e6freq7o-1226174028119///Default.aspx|title=Sunrise breakfast show faces overhaul|date=23 October 2011|publisher=Courier Mail|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 February 2012, ''Sunrise'' celebrated its 10th anniversary with Doyle and Koch. Doyle is the only original presenter remaining from the March 2002 launch; at the time, Chris Reason was her co-host (he took leave in late 2002 to fight cancer, prompting the initial then-temporary appointment of Koch) and Koch was the finance analyst. Koch started presenting ''Sunrise'' on a permanent basis from 4 October 2002.\n\nIn May 2013, Sunrise broadcast once a week from the Seven Network's Melbourne studios ([[HSV (TV station)|HSV-7]]) to attempt and capture a growing Melbourne audience. ''Sunrise'' has been trailing ''Today'' (and, since 2008, ''News Breakfast'' on the ABC) in the Melbourne market since 2008. The show was broadcast from the stations ''[[AFL Game Day]]'' set. This was discontinued later on after continually poor ratings.\n\nOn 20 June 2013 during the program, Doyle announced that she was leaving ''Sunrise'' after 14 years to front a new prime time Network News initiative. She stated, \"It's with that experience and support from the team that I am able to take this next step. I'm honoured that the Network has given me this incredible new opportunity and I am unbelievably excited about the new challenges ahead.\" It was later announced that [[Samantha Armytage]] would be replacing Doyle as co-host alongside Koch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/melissa-doyle-announces-she-is-leaving-sunrise-with-samantha-armytage-to-replace-her/story-e6frfmyi-1226666651246|title=Melissa Doyle announces she is leaving Sunrise, with Samantha Armytage to replace her|date=20 June 2013|publisher=News.com.au|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, ''Sunrise'' received a new set and graphics and was extended by 30 minutes to start at 5:30&nbsp;am, matching the starting time of rival ''Today''. This resulted in ''Seven Early News'' being moved to the 5:00&nbsp;am timeslot and ''Sunrise Extra'' being cancelled. [[Edwina Bartholomew]] announced that she will be departing her role as weather presenter with [[Sam Mac]] announced as her replacement.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/01/sunrise-to-move-to-530am-start.html|title=New-look Sunrise to start from 5:30am|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>''\n\n===Special editions===\n\nPrior to 2010, ''Sunrise'' occasionally aired two special Saturday editions. This included, since 2003:\n* 22 March 2003 \u2013 David Koch and Melissa Doyle hosted the special edition of ''Sunrise'' covering the latest on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] as it happened. This also saw the rise of [[Natalie Barr]] as news presenter.\n* 24 November 2007 (as ''Weekend Sunrise'') \u2013 a special edition hosted by [[Andrew O'Keefe]] and [[Samantha Armytage]] covering the final day of the 2007 election campaign. [[Talitha Cummins]] presented the news, while [[Kylie Gillies]] presented the sport.\n* 17 July 2010 (as ''Weekend Sunrise'') \u2013 A special edition hosted by [[Larry Emdur]] and [[Rebecca Maddern]] covering from 7:00 am to 1:30 pm, Australian prime minister [[Julia Gillard]]'s trip to Government House to talk with the Governor General, [[Quentin Bryce]], and her press conference at Government House about an election to be held on 21 August and [[Tony Abbott]]'s press conference in Brisbane.

Like the rest of the studio, their stage area gives people on the street a chance to view the performances. Occasionally, musical guests perform \"on the plaza\" on a temporary stage erected in [[Martin Place]]. Musical performances normally take place at 7:50am and 8:50am, with most guests playing two songs.\n\n===''Weekend Sunrise''===\n{{main|Weekend Sunrise}}\n\nIn 2005 the Seven Network replaced its struggling Sunday morning program ''Sunday Sunrise'' with a program called ''Weekend Sunrise'' which originally was an hour long (8am \u2013 9am) program with an identical format to ''Sunrise''. Hosted by [[Chris Reason]] (then the presenter of ''Sunday Sunrise'') and [[Lisa Wilkinson]], the program was successful and various critiques at the time called for the program to be lengthened to two hours (7am \u2013 9am) and be extended to Saturday mornings as well as Sunday.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn 2006, ''Weekend Sunrise'' was extended from an hour to a two-hour show, running every Sunday from 8:00 am till 10:00 am. When ''[[Sportsworld (Australian TV series)|Sportsworld]]'' returned for the football season ''Weekend Sunrise'' settled into a 90-minute format from 8:00 am to 9:30 am. After ''Sportsworld's'' series concluded, the show returned to a two-hour format.\n\n[[Andrew O'Keefe]] initially temporarily replaced host Chris Reason in 2006, but after improved ratings he was given the hosting position permanently. In 2007, Wilkinson moved to the [[Nine Network]] to host ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' and was replaced by [[Samantha Armytage]]. In 2008, ''Weekend Sunrise'' moved their start time 30 minutes earlier to 7:30 am to match the new start time of Nine's ''[[Sunday (Australian TV program)|Sunday]]'' program. The program continued to run through to 10:00 am, meaning that the program had a two-and-a-half hour running time.\n\nIn 2009, the program's start time was moved even earlier. Originally, rival [[Nine Network]] announced that ''[[Weekend Today (Australian TV series)|Today on Sunday]]'' (now ''Weekend Today''), the replacement of the long-running ''Sunday'', would run from 7:30 am to 9:00 am. But this was changed on 28 January 2009 to 7:00 am to 9:00 am. As result, Seven announced that ''Weekend Sunrise'' would also commence at 7:00 am and run to 10:00 am, meaning the program would go for three hours, the same as the weekday version of ''Sunrise''.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Weekend Sunrise wakes up to Today's alarm|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/01/weekend-sunrise-wakes-up-to-todays-alarm.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 February 2010, Seven announced that ''Weekend Sunrise'' would extend to Saturdays to compete against ''Weekend Today''. The Saturday edition airs in the same time slot as ''Weekend Today'' (7:00 am to 10:00 am). ''[[Saturday Disney]]'', which previously occupied the timeslot, aired its last two hours of their program on [[7flix]] (the first hour, from 6:00&nbsp;am &ndash; 7:00&nbsp;am, preceded ''Weekend Sunrise'' on the Seven Network). The original Saturday team consisted of [[Samantha Armytage]] co-hosting with [[Larry Emdur]] with [[Sarah Cumming]], Simon Reeve and [[James Tobin (presenter)|James Tobin]] presenting news, sport and weather respectively.\n\nIn June 2013, Melissa Doyle announced that she would be leaving ''Sunrise'' for a national network role with Samantha Armytage replacing her. [[Monique Wright]] therefore initially replaced Armytage on ''Weekend Sunrise'', but it was not until February 2014 that she was made a permanent co-host on the show.<ref>[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/02/monique-wright-named-as-permanent-co-host-of-weekend-sunrise.html Monique Wright names as permanent co-host of Weekend Sunrise], ''TV Tonight'', 25 February 2014</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, [[Andrew O'Keefe]] resigned citing a desire to spend more time with his family.<ref name=\"OKeefequits\">{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2017/12/andrew-okeefe-quits-weekend-sunrise.html|title=Andrew O'Keefe quits Weekend Sunrise|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref> In March 2018, it was announced that [[Basil Zempilas]] would replace O'Keefe.<ref>https://tvtonight.com.au/2018/03/basil-zempilas-joins-weekend-sunrise.html</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, [[Basil Zempilas]] announced his resignation as regular host of ''Weekend Sunrise'', citing a desire to spend more time with his family, but will still appear on the show intermittently as a summer and fill-in presenter whenever required.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2019/08/basil-zempilas-to-scale-back-weekend-sunrise-role.html|title=Basil Zempilas to scale back Weekend Sunrise role|last=Knox|first=David|date=18 August 2019|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref> In October 2019, it was announced that [[Matt Doran]] will replace Zempilas on the show from October 12.<ref>https://tvtonight.com.au/2019/10/matt-doran-to-join-weekend-sunrise.html</ref>\n\n{{As of|October 2019||df=}}, [[Monique Wright]] and [[Matt Doran (journalist)|Matt Doran]] are the co-hosts, with Sally Bowrey, [[Simon Reeve (Australian TV presenter)|Simon Reeve]] and [[James Tobin (presenter)|James Tobin]] presenting news, sport and weather respectively.\n\n==Format==\nLike most other breakfast television shows, ''Sunrise'' blends a mixture of news every thirty minutes, interviews and light-hearted feature pieces into three hours each morning. Often they will go out and present the show from other locations, such as Hawaii, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Athens, [[Disneyland]], Beijing and Melbourne for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], [[Beaconsfield, Tasmania|Beaconsfield]] in Tasmania and [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]].

Both of those editions ended at 9:30 am with ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]'' picking up the rest of the coverage.\n\n''Sunrise'' was extended well past 9:00 am on the morning of 13 October 2010 to cover the [[2010 Copiap\u00f3 mining accident]].

David Koch and Samantha Armytage also appeared in a reduced role back in the studio. The extended version began at 5:00 am, replacing ''Sunrise Extra'' and the ''Early News'', with Doyle also contributing reports to ''The Morning Show'' which began at its regular time of 9:00 am.\n\nOn 9 August 2013 a special ''Sunrise'' edition of This Is Your Life aired throughout the program to farewell the outgoing Sunrise host [[Melissa Doyle]]. Throughout the program special guests including [[Dannii Minogue]], [[Joe Hockey]] and then [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Kevin Rudd]] made video messages that were played to farewell Mel. [[Seven West Media]] CEO [[Tim Worner]] and [[Kerry Stokes]] appeared paying tribute to how she along with [[David Koch]] and though not mentioned Executive Producer [[Adam Boland]] revolutionised breakfast television in Australia. Throughout the show the #farewellmel trended on twitter.\n\n==Ratings==\n''Sunrise'' and its [[Nine Network]] rival ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' remain close in the ratings, with the gap between the two often being less than 50,000 viewers in ''Sunrise'''s favour.\n\nOn Good Friday, 2009, ''Sunrise'' suffered its first one-day ratings defeat nationally against ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' since 2004.

[[Australian Capital Territory]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] have ''Sunrise'' broadcast live all year round, and [[Queensland]] has ''Sunrise'' broadcast live in wintertime, but during [[Daylight Saving Time]] in Sydney has the program delayed by one hour. The [[Northern Territory]] has ''Sunrise'' delayed 30 minutes during winter and 90 minutes during Daylight Savings in Sydney. South Australia has it delayed by 30 minutes all year around and Western Australia has it delayed by two hours in wintertime and by three hours during Daylight Savings in Sydney.\n\nOccasionally, broadcasts of ''Sunrise'' are altered during special circumstances. On the morning of 20 March 2006, when ''Sunrise'' was normally on a one-hour delay in Queensland, the program was broadcast live in order to provide immediate and up-to-date information on Tropical [[Cyclone Larry]] to local residents. The show continued to be broadcast until 10am Sydney time only in to Queensland to continue these updates and prevent scheduling problems.\n\nOn most public holidays, Sunrise is extended to 10 am, thus adding an additional hour to its telecast, and has at times had a studio audience for these special events.\n\n==Theme song==\n''Sunrise'' used [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[(Reach Up for the) Sunrise]]\" as its theme song up until 2010 when [[MGMT]]'s \"[[Electric Feel]]\" replaced it. In October 2011, \"(Reach Up for the) Sunrise\" was reinstated as the theme song again.\n\nFormerly, it had used a more traditional morning news theme before switching to the song. In the past it has also used the ''[[Seven News]]'' theme which was based on the John Williams piece \"[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television|Australia}}\n* [[List of longest-running Australian television series]]\n* ''[[Weekend Sunrise]]''\n* ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''\n* [[Journalism in Australia]]\n* [[List of Australian television series]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://7plus.com.au/sunrise}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0428169|title=Sunrise}}\n* {{tv.com show|sunrise|Sunrise and Weekend Sunrise}}\n\n{{Seven Network programming}}\n{{TV Newscaf Aus}}\n{{AustralianBreakfastShows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sunrise (Australian TV program)}}\n[[Category:Seven News|*]]\n[[Category:Australian television news programmes]]\n[[Category:1991 Australian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1999 Australian television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000 Australian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1990s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Australian television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Breakfast television in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "181.29.8.52", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_(Australian_TV_program)"}

The next year plants flower in spring, producing cross shaped white flowers in dense clusters. As the flowering stems bloom they elongate into a spike-like shape. When blooming is complete, plants produce upright fruits that release seeds in mid-summer.
