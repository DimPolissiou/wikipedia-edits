Over the ensuing years, the Curonians ([[Duchy of Courland]]),  Dutch, English, French, Spanish and Swedish had caused Tobago to become a focal point in repeated attempts of colonisation, which led to the island having changed hands 33 times, the most in [[Caribbean]] history, before the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded it to the British in 1814. In 1662, the Dutch brothers [[Adrian Lampsins|Adrian]] and [[Cornelius Lampsins]] were granted the title of ''Barons of Tobago,'' and ruled until the English captured the island in 1666.

The effects were so severe that they changed the face of Tobago's economy. The hurricane laid waste to the banana, coconut, and [[cacao bean|cacao]] plantations that largely sustained the economy, and wreaked considerable damage on the largely pristine tropical rainforest that makes up a large proportion of the interior of the island's northern half. Many of the plantations were subsequently abandoned, and the economy changed direction away from cash crop agriculture and toward tourism. In 2004 [[Hurricane Ivan]], while less severe than Flora, also caused significant damage.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Tobago jade ceremonial ax.jpg|thumb|left|[[Greenstone (archaeology)|Greenstone]] ceremonial axe, from [[shell midden]], Mount Irvine Bay, Tobago, 1957.]]\n[[File:Phaethon aethereus Little Tobago.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Red-billed tropicbird]] on [[Little Tobago]].]]\nThe [[Tobago Forest Reserve]] ([[Main Ridge Reserve]]) is the oldest protected rain forest in the Western hemisphere and is biodiverse. It was designated a protected Crown reserve on 17 April 1776 after representations by [[Soame Jenyns]], a [[Member of Parliament]] in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] responsible for Tobago's development. It has remained a protected area since. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThis forested area has great [[biodiversity]], including many species of [[List of birds of Trinidad and Tobago|birds]] (such as the dancing [[blue-backed manakin]]), mammals, frogs, (non-venomous) snakes, [[List of Butterflies of Tobago|butterflies]] and other invertebrates. It is one of the most approachable areas of rainforest, since it is relatively small and there are government-appointed guides who provide an authoritative guiding service through the forest at a reasonable cost. The guides are knowledgeable about the plants and the animals, and can call down rare and exotic birds from the canopy by imitating their calls. Tobago also has nesting beaches for the [[leatherback turtle]], which come to shore between April and July.\n{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe island of Tobago has multiple [[coral reef]] ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lapointe|first=Brian E.|last2=Langton|first2=Richard|last3=Bedford|first3=Bradley J.|last4=Potts|first4=Arthur C.|last5=Day|first5=Owen|last6=Hu|first6=Chuanmin|date=2010-03-01|title=Land-based nutrient enrichment of the Buccoo Reef Complex and fringing coral reefs of Tobago, West Indies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X09004639|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|language=en|volume=60|issue=3|pages=334\u2013343|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.10.020|issn=0025-326X}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/tobagos-major-tourist-attraction-6.2.808091.09065114fd|title=Tobago\u2019s major tourist attraction...|website=www.guardian.co.tt|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> [[The Buccoo Reef]], the Culloden Reed and Speyside Reef are the three largest [[coral reef]] marine ecosystems in Tobago.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=Buglass|first=Salome|last2=Donner|first2=Simon D.|last3=Alemu I|first3=Jahson B.|date=2016-03-15|title=A study on the recovery of Tobago's coral reefs following the 2010 mass bleaching event|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16300376|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|language=en|volume=104|issue=1|pages=198\u2013206|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.01.038|issn=0025-326X}}</ref>These coral reef systems protect the shores of Tobago from eroding.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Burke, Lauretta Marie, contributor.

Tourism is still a fledgling industry and needs to be developed. The local governing body, The Tobago House of Assembly (THA), employs 62% of the labor force. \n\nTobago's economy is tightly linked with Trinidad which is based on liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. The principal economic forces specific to Tobago are [[tourism]] and government spending. Conventional beach and water-sports tourism is largely in the southwest around the airport and the coastal strip. Meanwhile, [[ecotourism]] is growing in significance, much of it focused on the large area of protected forest in the centre and north of the main island and on [[Little Tobago]], a small island off the main island's northeast tip.\n\nThe southwestern tourist area around Crown Point, Store Bay, Buccoo Reef, and [[Pigeon Point, Tobago|Pigeon Point]] has large expanses of sand and is dominated by resort-type developments. Tobago has many idyllic beaches along its coastline, especially those at [[Castara]], Bloody Bay, and [[Englishman's Bay]]. Tobago is linked to the world through the [[Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson International Airport]] (formerly Crown Point Airport) and Scarborough harbour. Domestic flights connect Tobago with Trinidad, and international flights connect with the Caribbean and Europe. There is a daily fast ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nTobago was thought by some to have been the island that inspired ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'',<ref>Rhead, Louis. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/12/102131943.pdf LETTER TO THE EDITOR: \"Tobago Robinson Crusoe's Island\"], ''The New York Times'', 5 August 1899.</ref><ref>[http://www.islandguide.biz/caribbean/tobago-robinson-crusoe.htm \"Robinson Crusoe and Tobago\"], ''Island Guide''</ref> but the book is probably based on some of the experiences of [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was marooned in the Pacific's [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]. Adding to the confusion, Tobago was the filming location for the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1959.\n\n===''Swiss Family Robinson''===\n{{also|Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)}}\nIn 1958, Tobago was chosen by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as the setting for a film based upon the [[Johann Wyss]] novel ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''.  When producers saw the island for the first time, they \"fell instantly in love\".<ref name=\"TCM1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/203349%7C0/Swiss-Family-Robinson.html |last=Passafiume |first=Andrea |title=SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON (1960) |work=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate= 9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Maltin|first=Leonard |year=1995 |title=The Disney Films : 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] |location=New York. |ref=harv |isbn=0-7868-8137-2 |page=176}}</ref> The script required animals, which were brought from all around the world, including eight dogs, two giant tortoises, 40 monkeys, two elephants, six ostriches, four zebras, 100 flamingos, six hyenas, two anacondas, and a tiger.<ref name=TCM1/>\n\nFilming locations include Richmond Bay (the Robinsons beach), Mount Irvine Bay (the Pirates beach), and the Craig Hall Waterfalls. The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. After filming, locals convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, sans interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and became a popular attraction before the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Flora in 1963.<ref name=\"kkidney1\">{{cite web |url=http://miehana.blogspot.com/2010/03/some-really-really-big-roots.html  |title=Some Really, Really Big Roots |work=Kevin Kidney |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The tree still remains, however, and is located on the property of the Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, located in Goldsborough, just off of Windward Road.

Trinidad, which is further south, has no significant coral because of low [[salinity]] and high silt content, the result of its position close to the mouth of [[Venezuela]]'s [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. [[Scuba diving]] on Tobago tends to be centred at [[Speyside, Trinidad and Tobago|Speyside]], almost diametrically across the island from the airport. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe island has some of the best diving sites in the Caribbean. There are three wrecks located around its shores, but the one usually considered the best is the ''Maverick Ferry'', which used to travel between Trinidad and Tobago. The ferry is {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=off}} long and has been sunk in {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} just off Rocky Point, Mt. Irvine. The top of the wreck is at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The wreck has an abundance of marine life, including a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Epinephelus itajara|jewfish]], a member of the [[grouper]] family. The wreck was purposely sunk for divers, and so all the doors and windows were removed. The waters around the island are home to many species of tropical fish, [[Batoidea|rays]], sharks, and turtles.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/discover-tobago/2016/apr/15/tobagos-spectacular-dive-sites\n</ref>\n\n===Golf===\nTobago is home to two golf courses, both of which are open to visitors. The older of the two is Mount Irvine Hotel Golf Course, built in 1968. It was seen throughout the world after hosting the popular golf show \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf\". The course is built amongst coconut palms and has a view of the Caribbean Sea from almost every hole.

Over the ensuing years, the Curonians ([[Duchy of Courland]]),  Dutch, English, French, Spanish and Swedish had caused Tobago to become a focal point in repeated attempts of colonisation, which led to the island having changed hands 33 times, the most in [[Caribbean]] history, before the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded it to the British in 1814.

The effects were so severe that they changed the face of Tobago's economy. The hurricane laid waste to the banana, coconut, and [[cacao bean|cacao]] plantations that largely sustained the economy, and wreaked considerable damage on the largely pristine tropical rainforest that makes up a large proportion of the interior of the island's northern half. Many of the plantations were subsequently abandoned, and the economy changed direction away from cash crop agriculture and toward tourism. In 2004 [[Hurricane Ivan]], while less severe than Flora, also caused significant damage.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Tobago jade ceremonial ax.jpg|thumb|left|[[Greenstone (archaeology)|Greenstone]] ceremonial axe, from [[shell midden]], Mount Irvine Bay, Tobago, 1957.]]\n[[File:Phaethon aethereus Little Tobago.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Red-billed tropicbird]] on [[Little Tobago]].]]\nThe [[Tobago Forest Reserve]] ([[Main Ridge Reserve]]) is the oldest protected rain forest in the Western hemisphere and is biodiverse. It was designated a protected Crown reserve on 17 April 1776 after representations by [[Soame Jenyns]], a [[Member of Parliament]] in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] responsible for Tobago's development. It has remained a protected area since. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThis forested area has great [[biodiversity]], including many species of [[List of birds of Trinidad and Tobago|birds]] (such as the dancing [[blue-backed manakin]]), mammals, frogs, (non-venomous) snakes, [[List of Butterflies of Tobago|butterflies]] and other invertebrates. It is one of the most approachable areas of rainforest, since it is relatively small and there are government-appointed guides who provide an authoritative guiding service through the forest at a reasonable cost. The guides are knowledgeable about the plants and the animals, and can call down rare and exotic birds from the canopy by imitating their calls.

Tourism is still a fledgling industry and needs to be developed. The local governing body, The Tobago House of Assembly (THA), employs 62% of the labor force. \n\nTobago's economy is tightly linked with Trinidad which is based on liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. The principal economic forces specific to Tobago are [[tourism]] and government spending. Conventional beach and water-sports tourism is largely in the southwest around the airport and the coastal strip. Meanwhile, [[ecotourism]] is growing in significance, much of it focused on the large area of protected forest in the centre and north of the main island and on [[Little Tobago]], a small island off the main island's northeast tip.\n\nThe southwestern tourist area around Crown Point, Store Bay, Buccoo Reef, and [[Pigeon Point, Tobago|Pigeon Point]] has large expanses of sand and is dominated by resort-type developments. Tobago has many idyllic beaches along its coastline, especially those at [[Castara]], Bloody Bay, and [[Englishman's Bay]]. Tobago is linked to the world through the [[Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson International Airport]] (formerly Crown Point Airport) and Scarborough harbour. Domestic flights connect Tobago with Trinidad, and international flights connect with the Caribbean and Europe. There is a daily fast ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nTobago was thought by some to have been the island that inspired ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'',<ref>Rhead, Louis. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/12/102131943.pdf LETTER TO THE EDITOR: \"Tobago Robinson Crusoe's Island\"], ''The New York Times'', 5 August 1899.</ref><ref>[http://www.islandguide.biz/caribbean/tobago-robinson-crusoe.htm \"Robinson Crusoe and Tobago\"], ''Island Guide''</ref> but the book is probably based on some of the experiences of [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was marooned in the Pacific's [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]. Adding to the confusion, Tobago was the filming location for the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1959.\n\n===''Swiss Family Robinson''===\n{{also|Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)}}\nIn 1958, Tobago was chosen by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as the setting for a film based upon the [[Johann Wyss]] novel ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''.  When producers saw the island for the first time, they \"fell instantly in love\".<ref name=\"TCM1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/203349%7C0/Swiss-Family-Robinson.html |last=Passafiume |first=Andrea |title=SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON (1960) |work=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate= 9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Maltin|first=Leonard |year=1995 |title=The Disney Films : 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] |location=New York. |ref=harv |isbn=0-7868-8137-2 |page=176}}</ref> The script required animals, which were brought from all around the world, including eight dogs, two giant tortoises, 40 monkeys, two elephants, six ostriches, four zebras, 100 flamingos, six hyenas, two anacondas, and a tiger.<ref name=TCM1/>\n\nFilming locations include Richmond Bay (the Robinsons beach), Mount Irvine Bay (the Pirates beach), and the Craig Hall Waterfalls. The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. After filming, locals convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, sans interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and became a popular attraction before the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Flora in 1963.<ref name=\"kkidney1\">{{cite web |url=http://miehana.blogspot.com/2010/03/some-really-really-big-roots.html  |title=Some Really, Really Big Roots |work=Kevin Kidney |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The tree still remains, however, and is located on the property of the Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, located in Goldsborough, just off of Windward Road.

Trinidad, which is further south, has no significant coral because of low [[salinity]] and high silt content, the result of its position close to the mouth of [[Venezuela]]'s [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. [[Scuba diving]] on Tobago tends to be centred at [[Speyside, Trinidad and Tobago|Speyside]], almost diametrically across the island from the airport. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe island has some of the best diving sites in the Caribbean. There are three wrecks located around its shores, but the one usually considered the best is the ''Maverick Ferry'', which used to travel between Trinidad and Tobago. The ferry is {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=off}} long and has been sunk in {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} just off Rocky Point, Mt. Irvine. The top of the wreck is at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The wreck has an abundance of marine life, including a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Epinephelus itajara|jewfish]], a member of the [[grouper]] family. The wreck was purposely sunk for divers, and so all the doors and windows were removed.

The older of the two is Mount Irvine Hotel Golf Course, built in 1968. It was seen throughout the world after hosting the popular golf show \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf\". The course is built amongst coconut palms and has a view of the Caribbean Sea from almost every hole.

The page includes a dedication to the [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Saxon Elector]] and a list of voices and instruments.]]\nThe '''Mass for the Dresden court''' is a [[Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass]] in [[B&nbsp;minor]] composed in 1733 by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who at the time worked as a [[Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]]. Bach dedicated the composition to his sovereign, [[Frederick August II]], who had recently succeeded his father, [[Augustus the Strong]], as [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] at the [[Catholic]] court in [[Dresden]]. It is a [[missa brevis]] (''Kurzmesse'') consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[Movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements, and is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]].\n\nAfter reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated this Missa as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The ''Missa'' of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I. Kyrie and Gloria (\"Missa\")|Part I of BWV&nbsp;232]].<ref name=\"BDW0290\">Bach Digital Work {{BDW|0290}} at {{url|www.bach-digital.de}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Bach's church music in Latin}}\nBach was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician, devoted to the composition of sacred music in German. He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Missa, a setting of [[Kyrie]] and [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]], for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]].

The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's Missa, these were later expanded into a complete mass (missa tota), or at least a mass with all the usual mass sections except the Credo (missa senza Credo). Nor the fact that Bach's Missa was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's Missa (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the Missa was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe Missa forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].

Bach dedicated the composition to his sovereign, [[Frederick August II]], who had recently succeeded his father, [[Augustus the Strong]], as [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] at the [[Catholic]] court in [[Dresden]]. It is a [[missa brevis]] (''Kurzmesse'') consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[Movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements, and is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]].\n\nAfter reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated this Missa as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The ''Missa'' of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I.

He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Missa, a setting of [[Kyrie]] and [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]], for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]]. Most of these copies were written by Bach himself, but for the last movements of both Kyrie and Gloria his sons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] (soprano parts), [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] (violino I parts), and his wife [[Anna Magdalena Bach|Anna Magdalena]] (cello parts) helped, along with an anonymous copyist (oboe and basso continuo parts).<ref>[http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002721 D-Dl Mus.2405-D-21] at Dresden, S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek \u2013 Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek (University library), available online at {{url|bach-digital.de}}</ref> Performance material for the choir was not included, nor was the basso continuo part very elaborated.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=53}} All these parts appear to have been copied directly from the full score, which Bach kept in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> Bach supplied the parts for single performers with many details that are not in the score he kept.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n[[File:Dresden Inneres der Hofkapelle 1719.jpg|thumb|500px|Interior of the Hofkirche (Hofkapelle){{efn|Court chapel: in this instance referring to the church building; other instances of Hofkapelle/court chapel in this article generally refer to [[chapel (music)|chapel as an ensemble of musicians]], directed by a [[chapel master]] (Kapellmeister).}} in 1719<ref>Hubert Ermisch. ''[[:File:Ermisch Das alte Archivgeb\u00e4ude am Taschenberge in Dresden.pdf|Das alte Archivgeb\u00e4ude am Taschenberge in Dresden: Ein Erinnerungsblatt]]''. Dresden: Baensch, 1888.</ref>]]\nAlthough some commentators suggest other liturgical and worldly venues where Bach may have anticipated a performance of the Missa,{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=41}} there seems little doubt that Bach intended to tailor the piece so that it could be performed at the Dresden Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\n=== Reception at the Dresden court ===\nWhen the composition arrived in Dresden its format wasn't very unusual compared to other works performed at the time at the Hofkirche. The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's Missa, these were later expanded into a complete mass (missa tota), or at least a mass with all the usual mass sections except the Credo (missa senza Credo). Nor the fact that Bach's Missa was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's Missa (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the Missa was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L. Macy. http://www.grovemusic.com/ . Last accessed August 9, 2007.</ref>\n\nAround 1745 Bach used three movements of the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] of this Missa for his cantata [[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" />\n\n== Scoring and structure \u2014 incorporation in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ==\n{{Main|Mass in B minor structure}}\n\nIn the last years of his life, presumably around 1748\u20131749, Bach integrated the complete Missa unchanged in his [[Mass in B minor]], his only complete mass (or ''missa tota'').<ref name=\"Laurson\" /> Scoring and structure are identical with the later work, but markings differ because the parts contain more details than the 1733 score which he kept. Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe Missa forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].
