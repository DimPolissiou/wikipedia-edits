The most stable [[radioisotope]] is <sup>92</sup>Nb with a [[half-life]] of 34.7 million years. The next longest-lived niobium isotopes are <sup>94</sup>Nb (half-life: 20,300 years) and <sup>91</sup>Nb with a half-life of 680 years. There is also a [[meta state]] of <sup>93</sup>Nb at 31 [[electronvolt|keV]] whose half-life is 16.13 years. Twenty-three other radioisotopes have been characterized. Most of these have half-lives that are less than two hours, except <sup>95</sup>Nb (35 days), <sup>96</sup>Nb (23.4 hours) and <sup>90</sup>Nb (14.6 hours). The primary [[decay mode]] before stable <sup>93</sup>Nb is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta emission]] with some [[neutron emission]] occurring in <sup>104\u2013110</sup>Nb.\n\nOnly <sup>95</sup>Nb (35 days) and <sup>97</sup>Nb (72 minutes) and heavier isotopes (half-lives in seconds) are [[fission products]] in significant quantity, as the other isotopes are shadowed by stable or very long-lived ([[Zirconium-93|<sup>93</sup>Zr]]) isotopes of the preceding element [[zirconium]] from production via [[beta decay]] of neutron-rich [[fission fragment]]s. <sup>95</sup>Nb is the [[decay product]] of <sup>95</sup>Zr (64 days), so disappearance of <sup>95</sup>Nb in [[used nuclear fuel]] is slower than would be expected from its own 35-day half-life alone. Small amounts of other isotopes may be produced as direct fission products.\n\n==List of isotopes ==\n{{Isotopes table\n|symbol=Nb\n|refs=<!-- not NUBASE2016 yet (2019-07-14) -->\n|notes=m, unc(),

After the Civil War the neighborhood became largely commercial, and the square began to lose social cachet at the turn of the twentieth century, with many of the old mansions being demolished.<ref name=\"NYCL-1539\" /> [[Tiffany & Co.]], which had moved to the square from Broadway and Broome Street in 1870, left its premises on 15th Street to move uptown to 37th Street in 1905; the silversmiths Gorham Company moved up from 19th Street in 1906. The last of the neighborhood's free-standing private mansions, Peter Goelet's at the northeast corner of 19th Street, made way for a commercial building in 1897.\n\n==={{anchor|Rialto, Manhattan}}The Rialto===\nThe Rialto, New York City's first commercial theater district, was located in and around Union Square beginning in the 1870s.

After the war, the development of the [[Ladies' Mile Historic District|Ladies' Mile shopping district]] along Fifth and Sixth Avenues above 14th Street had the effect of pulling the playhouses uptown, so that a \"Rialto\" theatrical strip came about on Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets, between Union Square and [[Madison Square]].<ref name=\"gotham946\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:View of Union Square, New York.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Union Square in 1908]]\n\nAt the same time, a transition from stock companies, in which a resident acting company was based around a star or impresario, to a \"combination\" system, in which productions were put together on a one-time basis to mount a specific play, expanded the amount of outside support needed to service the theatrical industry. Thus, suppliers of props, costumes, wigs, scenery, and other theatrical necessities grew up around the new theatres.  The new system also needed an organized way to engage actors for these one-off productions, so talent brokers and theatrical agents sprang up, as did theatrical boardinghouses, stage photographers, publicity agencies, theatrical printers and play publishers. Along with the hotels and restaurants which serviced the theatregoers and shoppers of the area, the Union Square Rialto was, by the end of the century, a thriving theatrical neighborhood, which would soon nonetheless migrate uptown to what became known as \"[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]\" as the Rialto became subsumed into the more vice-oriented [[Tenderloin, Manhattan|Tenderloin]] entertainment district.<ref name=\"gotham946\">Burrows & Wallace, pp. 946\u2013948.</ref>\n\n=== Office and wholesale district ===\nBy the first decade of the 20th century, Union Square had grown into a major transportation hub with several [[Elevated railway|elevated]] and [[Tram|surface]] railroad lines running nearby, and the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[14th Street\u2013Union Square station]] having opened in 1904.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|2}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 20, 1908|title=Plans for Everett House Site Improvement|url=https://rerecord.library.columbia.edu/pdf_files/ldpd_7031148_041_26.pdf|journal=The Real Estate Record: Real estate record and builders' guide|volume=81|page=|pages=1178|via=[[Columbia University|columbia.edu]]|number=2101}}</ref> With the northward relocation of the theater district, Union Square also became a major wholesaling district with several loft buildings, as well as numerous office buildings.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|2}}<ref name=\":0\" /> The office structures included the [[Everett Building (Manhattan)|Everett Building]], erected at the northwest corner of Park Avenue South and 17th Street in 1908;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|4}} the [[W New York Union Square|Germania Life Insurance Company Building]], erected at the northeast corner of the same intersection in 1910-1911;<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|6}} and the [[Consolidated Edison Building]], constructed three blocks south at 14th Street between 1910 and 1914.<ref name=\":4\" />{{Rp|5, 8}}\n\nDuring this era, many of the older homes on Union Square were converted into [[tenement]]s for immigrants and industrial workers.

People created spontaneous candle and photograph memorials in the park and vigils were held to honor the victims. At the time, non-emergency vehicles were temporarily banned and pedestrian travel was restricted in [[Lower Manhattan]] below 14th Street. The Square's tradition as a meeting place in times of upheaval was also a factor in its being used as a vigil gathering site.\n\n[[File:Union Square Park pavilion.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The renovated pavilion at the north end of the park in February 2011.]]\n\n====North end renovation====\n\nIn March 2008, an eighteen-month renovation began on the northern end of the park. Proponents of the plan described it as the completion of a renovation of Union Square Park that began in the mid-1980s that would improve the park by increasing the amount and quality of playground space, improving the quality and function of the public plaza, rehabilitating the badly deteriorating bandshell structure, improving the working conditions for park employees, and maintaining the \"eyes on the street\" presence of a restaurant at the heart of the park.  Protests and political action in response to the original renovation plans resulted in a reduction in the degree to which the pavilion was to be renovated, a reduction in the total amount of space that the restaurant would occupy, and an increase in the amount of dedicated play space, but stiff opposition remains to the idea that any commercial uses might occupy the pavilion.  Despite the fact that the overall amount of play space in the park would be increased as a result of the renovation, those critical of the plan claimed that the bandshell pavilion itself ought to be converted to play space.<ref>{{cite news |title=Opponents Pile on Union Sq.

The inclusion of trees was made possible without reducing the usable gathering space of the plaza by the simultaneous decision to remove a painted median strip, that had separated eastbound and westbound traffic along 17th Street, thus increasing the northern limits of the plaza by several feet. The \"temporary\" metal rails, welded together to make a continuous fence along the north side of the site, were removed as part of the renovation of the plaza.

Union Square has been used as a platform to raise awareness about the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.\n\nThe Square's shopping district saw strikes in the S.

After the war, the development of the [[Ladies' Mile Historic District|Ladies' Mile shopping district]] along Fifth and Sixth Avenues above 14th Street had the effect of pulling the playhouses uptown, so that a \"Rialto\" theatrical strip came about on Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets, between Union Square and [[Madison Square]].<ref name=\"gotham946\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:View of Union Square, New York.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Union Square in 1908]]\n\nAt the same time, a transition from stock companies, in which a resident acting company was based around a star or impresario, to a \"combination\" system, in which productions were put together on a one-time basis to mount a specific play, expanded the amount of outside support needed to service the theatrical industry. Thus, suppliers of props, costumes, wigs, scenery, and other theatrical necessities grew up around the new theatres.  The new system also needed an organized way to engage actors for these one-off productions, so talent brokers and theatrical agents sprang up, as did theatrical boardinghouses, stage photographers, publicity agencies, theatrical printers and play publishers. Along with the hotels and restaurants which serviced the theatregoers and shoppers of the area, the Union Square Rialto was, by the end of the century, a thriving theatrical neighborhood, which would soon nonetheless migrate uptown to what became known as \"[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]\" as the Rialto became subsumed into the more vice-oriented [[Tenderloin, Manhattan|Tenderloin]] entertainment district.<ref name=\"gotham946\">Burrows & Wallace, pp. 946\u2013948.</ref>\n\n=== Office and wholesale district ===\nBy the first decade of the 20th century, Union Square had grown into a major transportation hub with several [[Elevated railway|elevated]] and [[Tram|surface]] railroad lines running nearby, and the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[14th Street\u2013Union Square station]] having opened in 1904.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|2}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 20, 1908|title=Plans for Everett House Site Improvement|url=https://rerecord.library.columbia.edu/pdf_files/ldpd_7031148_041_26.pdf|journal=The Real Estate Record: Real estate record and builders' guide|volume=81|page=|pages=1178|via=[[Columbia University|columbia.edu]]|number=2101}}</ref> With the northward relocation of the theater district, Union Square also became a major wholesaling district with several loft buildings, as well as numerous office buildings.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|2}}<ref name=\":0\" /> The office structures included the [[Everett Building (Manhattan)|Everett Building]], erected at the northwest corner of Park Avenue South and 17th Street in 1908;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|4}} the [[W New York Union Square|Germania Life Insurance Company Building]], erected at the northeast corner of the same intersection in 1910-1911;<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|6}} and the [[Consolidated Edison Building]], constructed three blocks south at 14th Street between 1910 and 1914.<ref name=\":4\" />{{Rp|5, 8}}\n\nDuring this era, many of the older homes on Union Square were converted into [[tenement]]s for immigrants and industrial workers.

At the time, non-emergency vehicles were temporarily banned and pedestrian travel was restricted in [[Lower Manhattan]] below 14th Street. The Square's tradition as a meeting place in times of upheaval was also a factor in its being used as a vigil gathering site.\n\n[[File:Union Square Park pavilion.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The renovated pavilion at the north end of the park in February 2011.]]\n\n====North end renovation====\n\nIn March 2008, an eighteen-month renovation began on the northern end of the park. Proponents of the plan described it as the completion of a renovation of Union Square Park that began in the mid-1980s that would improve the park by increasing the amount and quality of playground space, improving the quality and function of the public plaza, rehabilitating the badly deteriorating bandshell structure, improving the working conditions for park employees, and maintaining the \"eyes on the street\" presence of a restaurant at the heart of the park.  Protests and political action in response to the original renovation plans resulted in a reduction in the degree to which the pavilion was to be renovated, a reduction in the total amount of space that the restaurant would occupy, and an increase in the amount of dedicated play space, but stiff opposition remains to the idea that any commercial uses might occupy the pavilion.  Despite the fact that the overall amount of play space in the park would be increased as a result of the renovation, those critical of the plan claimed that the bandshell pavilion itself ought to be converted to play space.<ref>{{cite news |title=Opponents Pile on Union Sq.

The inclusion of trees was made possible without reducing the usable gathering space of the plaza by the simultaneous decision to remove a painted median strip, that had separated eastbound and westbound traffic along 17th Street, thus increasing the northern limits of the plaza by several feet. The \"temporary\" metal rails, welded together to make a continuous fence along the north side of the site, were removed as part of the renovation of the plaza.

Union Square has been used as a platform to raise awareness about the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.\n\nThe Square's shopping district saw strikes in the S.

Her sister [[Aibell]] competed for his affections but Cl\u00edodhna ultimately triumphed using sorcery.\n\nFor all of their history the family has been strongly associated with [[County Cork]]. Originally the territory of the family lay along the banks of the [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater river]], near modern [[Fermoy]], and were active in the wars of the twelfth century between the [[O'Conor]]s and the [[Eoghanacht]] dynasties of [[Munster]].\n\nHowever, the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|arrival of the Normans]] displaced them, like so many others, and they moved west into the barony of [[Duhallow]], where their territory became known, and is still known, as Pobal O'Keeffe, where the senior branch of the family had their seat at Dromagh in Dromtarriff Parish.\n\nThe last chiefs of this branch were Domhnall O'Keeffe of Dromagh (d. c. 1655), who was prominent in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|Catholic Rebellion of the 1640s]], and his son [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Daniel O'Keeffe, who was killed fighting for [[James II of England|King James]] at the [[Battle of Aughrim]] in 1691. The family estates were confiscated in 1703, and sold to the Hollow Blades Company.\n\nEven today, Pobal O'Keeffe is still the area in which the name is most common, with surrounding areas of County Cork also including many of the name. It remains relatively rare outside that county. In 1890, more than two-thirds of the births under the name are recorded in County Cork.\n\nLike many of the [[Flight of the Wild Geese|dispossessed Irish nobility]], the O'Keeffes were active in the service of the Catholic monarchs of Europe. In 1740 Constantine O'Keeffe (born c. 1670) was admitted to the French aristocracy on the basis of his Irish pedigree, and his long service. The bearers of the surname \"Cuif\", found in the [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] district of northern France, are descendants of O'Keeffe soldiers.\n\nThe original spelling is with two fs (O'Keeffe), and church officials recorded names as they were wrongly spelled, then often resulting in the name of a single person being recorded under several spelling variations, such as ''O'Keefe'', ''Keefe'', ''Keeffe'', ''Keiffe'', and others\n\n==\u00d3 Caoimh==\n* [[Brian \u00d3 Cu\u00edv]] (\u00d3 Caoimh)\n\n==People named O'Keeffe==\n*[[Aslan Lawrence O\u2019Keeffe]] (2007-(still living)), Australian schoolboy\n* [[Alfred Henry O'Keeffe]] (1858\u20131941), New Zealand artist and art teacher\n* [[Batt O'Keeffe]], (born 1945), Irish politician\n* [[Ben O'Keeffe]], (born 1989), Doctor and New Zealand Professional Rugby Referee\n* [[Bob O'Keeffe]] (1881\u20131949), Irish hurler\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe]] (born 1971), English psychologist specialising in parapsychology and forensic psychology\n* [[Corey O'Keeffe]] (born 1998), footballer\n* [[Daniel O'Keeffe (judge)]] (born 1943), barrister and Irish High Court judge<ref>http://www.clarechampion.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13075:high-court-judge-steps-down-from-the-bench&catid=55:ennis&Itemid=56</ref>\n* [[Dan O'Keeffe]] (1907\u20131967), Irish footballer \n* [[Danny O'Keefe]] (born 1943), American singer-songwriter based in Seattle, Washington\n* [[David O'Keeffe (academic)]], Irish jurist, professor of European law\n* [[David O'Keeffe (footballer)]] (born 1962), former Australian rules footballer\n* [[Declan O'Keeffe]] (born 1972), retired Irish footballer\n* [[Denis O'Keeffe]], Irish hurler\n* [[Dennis O'Keeffe]], British professor of social science\n* [[Eamonn O'Keefe]], (born 1953) English-born Irish former footballer\n* [[Eileen O'Keeffe]] (born 1981), Irish former international hammer and discus thrower\n* [[Elo\u00efse Mae O\u2019Keeffe]], (2007-(still living)) funny, nice little sister\n* [[Eoin O'Keeffe]] (born 1979), Irish composer based in the UK\n* [[Frank O'Keeffe]] (1896\u20131924), Australian cricketer\n* [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] (1887\u20131986), American artist\n* [[Ger O'Keeffe]] (born 1952), retired Irish footballer\n* [[Graham O'Keeffe]], Irish football player\n* [[Hank O'Keeffe]] (1923\u20132011), American basketball player\n* [[Irene O'Keeffe]], Irish camogie player\n* [[Jessy Keeffe]] (born 1996), Australian rules footballer\n* [[James O'Keeffe]] (1912\u20131986), Irish Fine Gael politician\n* [[Jim O'Keeffe]] (born 1941), Irish politician\n* [[Joseph Michael O\u2019Keeffe]] (1983-(still living)), music teacher\n* [[John O'Keeffe (disambiguation)]]\n* Jonathan O'Keeffe (born 1977), birth name of Irish actor [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]]\n* [[Kain O'Keeffe]] (born 1987), Australian actor\n* [[Kerry O'Keeffe]] (born 1949), Australian cricketer and sports commentator\n* [[Kevin O'Keeffe (footballer)]] (born 1952), former Australian rules footballer\n* [[Kristin Bair O'Keeffe]] (born 1966) American novelist\n* [[Lachlan Keeffe]] (born 1990), Australian rules footballer\n* [[Laurence O'Keeffe]] (1931\u20132003), British diplomat, ambassador to Czechoslovakia during the 'Velvet Revolution'\n* [[Miles O'Keeffe]] (born 1954), American actor\n* [[Molly O'Keefe]] (born 1986), American author\n* [[Natasha O'Keeffe]] (born 1987), English actress\n* [[Ned O'Keeffe]] (born 1942), Irish politician\n* [[Paddy O'Keeffe]] (born 1864), Irish hurler\n* [[Padraig O'Keeffe]] (1887\u20131963), Irish traditional musician\n* [[Pat O'Keeffe]] (1883 - 1960), English boxer\n* [[Patrick O'Keeffe (politician)]] (died 1973), Irish politician\n* [[Patrick O'Keeffe (writer)]] (born 1964), Irish-American short story writer\n* [[Rhys O'Keeffe]] (born 1990), Australian rules footballer\n* [[Sean O'Keeffe]] (born 1982), Australian rules footballer\n* [[Susan O'Keeffe]], Irish politician and journalist\n* [[Timothy O'Keeffe]] (1926\u20131994), Irish editor and publisher\n* [[Trevor O'Keeffe]] (1968\u20131987), Irish man who was murdered while hitchhiking in France\n\n==Fictional characters==\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cl\u00eddna]]\n* [[E\u00f3ganachta]]\n* [[E\u00f3ganacht Glendamnach]]\n* [[His Majesty O'Keefe]], a 1954 [[adventure film]], as well as the 1952 book of the same name, from which the film derives\n* [[Irish nobility]]\n* [[Irish royal families]]\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n* Byrne, Francis J., ''Irish Kings and High-Kings''.
