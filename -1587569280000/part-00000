Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including [[Paul Hart]] at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[David Pleat]] at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\n[[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the Premier League from 1996 to his retirement at the conclusion of the 2017\u201318 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by [[Alex Ferguson]], who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including [[Paul Hart]] at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[David Pleat]] at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\n[[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the Premier League from 1996 to his retirement at the conclusion of the 2017\u201318 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by [[Alex Ferguson]], who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.
