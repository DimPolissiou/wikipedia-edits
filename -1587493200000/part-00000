Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.

They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  While it is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk or cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), its orbit is not completely nested within the debris disk<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.\n\nAt the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup> times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4&nbsp;to&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight<ref name=\"Currie\"/>.  Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to [[planetary accretion]], later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable,<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Galicher\"/> <ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion.   However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths and in the most recently-analyzed HST data, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger<ref name=\"Galicher\"/> <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain.

Lobb mounted his first exhibition as director at the beginning of 1975. He and Heimerman became co-directors of the gallery from the beginning of 1976. Beside some government funding and sales, both financially supported their roles through teaching, Heimerman being next employed at Brighton Technical College, where he and other staff members established a photography program, and then at the Council of Adult Education. Critic and photography lecturer Tony Perry noted Heimerman's 'detached, informed view of photography'.<ref>Tony Perry, 'Striking quality from 22 top photographers.'

In ''The Melbourne Times'', 24 February 1982, p.11</ref>\n\n=== Workshop ===\nAs well as exhibitions, and from the outset, workshops were held in the gallery building from which part of the funding for the enterprise was derived. The two floors of the [[Terraced house|terrace building]] accommodated a two-person [[darkroom]] available for film development and printing, and a demonstration room with 6-8 student capacity. Printing for exhibitions was offered. Technical instruction for beginners and in the [[Zone System]] for those more advanced was provided at first by Australian photographer Steven Lojewski in 1976. Evening classes ran for ten weeks. By 1977 Heimerman and Lobb had organised the first workshop to be conducted in Australia by an American photographer, [[Ralph Gibson]], and sponsored another, of 6 days by [[William Clift (photographer)|William Clift]] in May 1978 (costing participants $200),<ref>Gallery brochure, 1978</ref> before Lobb left to pursue his own photography later that year. Jeff Busby, who also exhibited at the gallery, took over later as Heimerman's assistant.<ref name=\"Harmer11\" />\n\nAmong the more recent workshops was 'How Joshua Greene Saved Marilyn Monroe: Techniques to Rehabilitate Ageing Photographs and the Art of Digital Printing', held on 26 November 2002 by the son of  [[Milton H. Greene]] who photographed [[Marilyn Monroe|Monroe]].\n\nIn addition to its activities at its own premises was the Gallery's organisation and sponsorship of seminars by international photographers, which began with Ralph Gibson's on 11 August 1977 at Prahran College, then that of [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]], held on 20 November 1979 at the Prahran Recreational Centre, 147 High Street with also a workshop at the Gallery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://photocurating.net/?page_id=194|title=Timeline: Curating Photography|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\n\n== Ethos ==\nBy showcasing the [[Gelatin silver process|silver gelatin]] 'fine print\u2019  Lobb and Heimerman hoped to improve Australian work by example,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=https://photocurating.net/?page_id=194 |title=Timeline {{!}} Curating Photography |language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> as Lobb observed, \n<blockquote>\"From 1975, every second show was an international show [. . .]<ref name=\":0\">Tony Perry, \u2018Australia: Longing for a photographic identity\u2019.

Noted women's activist [[Beatrice Faust]], who reviewed many of the gallery's shows from 1976-88 in [[The Age|''The Age'' newspaper]], was supportive in her critiques, and in September 1987 hosted ''Beatrice Faust Curates: From Boubat to Fereday'' at the gallery featuring male and female photographers.<ref>{{Citation |last=Wolfe, Ross |title=Samstag : the 1995 Anne & Gordon Samstag International Visual Arts Scholarships |date=1995 |publisher=University of South Australia |isbn=978-0-86803-134-7}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Moorhouse, Kaye |title=Palimpsest |date=1990 |publisher=University of Tasmania |isbn=978-0-85901-455-7}}</ref>\n\nCertainly women exhibiting were outnumbered by men in a ratio of nearly 10:1 until the 90s, after which they appear on a more equal footing (see below).\n\nThe Gallery's concentration on American photography in its early years was not in isolation and was prompted as much by interest in international photography amongst Australians as by Heimerman's own contacts in the US, and paralleled international touring exhibitions of [[Bill Brandt]] in 1971, and the French Foreign Ministry\u2019s major exhibition of [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] in 1974. Joyce Evans' Church Street also presented work by American's [[Minor White]], [[Jerry Uelsmann]], [[Les Krims]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.photo-web.com.au/robertdeane/papers/deane-ForeignInfluences.pdf|title=Foreign Influences in Australian Photography 1930-80: A lecture delivered at APSCON, Canberra|last=Deane|first=Robert|date=10 October 2000|website=Photo-web}}</ref> \n\nIn mid-1978, the gallery extended a call in the pages of the magazine ''[[Light Vision]]'' to Australian photographers to submit work for a survey that was to be a traveling exhibition.

Lobb mounted his first exhibition as director at the beginning of 1975. He and Heimerman became co-directors of the gallery from the beginning of 1976. Beside some government funding and sales, both financially supported their roles through teaching, Heimerman being next employed at Brighton Technical College, where he and other staff members established a photography program, and then at the Council of Adult Education.

In ''The Melbourne Times'', 24 February 1982, p.11</ref>\n\n=== Workshop ===\nAs well as exhibitions, and from the outset, workshops were held in the gallery building from which part of the funding for the enterprise was derived. The two floors of the [[Terraced house|terrace building]] accommodated a two-person [[darkroom]] available for film development and printing, and a demonstration room with 6-8 student capacity. Printing for exhibitions was offered. Technical instruction for beginners and in the [[Zone System]] for those more advanced was provided at first by Australian photographer Steven Lojewski in 1976. Evening classes ran for ten weeks. By 1977 Heimerman and Lobb had organised the first workshop to be conducted in Australia by an American photographer, [[Ralph Gibson]], and sponsored another, of 6 days by [[William Clift (photographer)|William Clift]] in May 1978 (costing participants $200),<ref>Gallery brochure, 1978</ref> before Lobb left to pursue his own photography later that year. Jeff Busby, who also exhibited at the gallery, took over later as Heimerman's assistant.<ref name=\"Harmer11\" />\n\nAmong the more recent workshops was 'How Joshua Greene Saved Marilyn Monroe: Techniques to Rehabilitate Ageing Photographs and the Art of Digital Printing', held on 26 November 2002 by the son of  [[Milton H. Greene]] who photographed [[Marilyn Monroe|Monroe]].\n\nIn addition to its activities at its own premises was the Gallery's organisation and sponsorship of seminars by international photographers, which began with Ralph Gibson's on 11 August 1977 at Prahran College, then that of [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]], held on 20 November 1979 at the Prahran Recreational Centre, 147 High Street with also a workshop at the Gallery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://photocurating.net/?page_id=194|title=Timeline: Curating Photography|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\n\n== Ethos ==\nBy showcasing the [[Gelatin silver process|silver gelatin]] 'fine print\u2019  Lobb and Heimerman hoped to improve Australian work by example,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=https://photocurating.net/?page_id=194 |title=Timeline {{!}} Curating Photography |language=en-US |access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> as Lobb observed, \n<blockquote>\"From 1975, every second show was an international show [. . .]<ref name=\":0\">Tony Perry, \u2018Australia: Longing for a photographic identity\u2019.

Noted women's activist [[Beatrice Faust]], who reviewed many of the gallery's shows from 1976-88 in [[The Age|''The Age'' newspaper]], was supportive in her critiques, and in September 1987 hosted ''Beatrice Faust Curates: From Boubat to Fereday'' at the gallery featuring male and female photographers.<ref>{{Citation |last=Wolfe, Ross |title=Samstag : the 1995 Anne & Gordon Samstag International Visual Arts Scholarships |date=1995 |publisher=University of South Australia |isbn=978-0-86803-134-7}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Moorhouse, Kaye |title=Palimpsest |date=1990 |publisher=University of Tasmania |isbn=978-0-85901-455-7}}</ref>\n\nCertainly women exhibiting were outnumbered by men in a ratio of nearly 10:1 until the 90s, after which they appear on a more equal footing (see below).\n\nThe Gallery's concentration on American photography in its early years was not in isolation and was prompted as much by interest in international photography amongst Australians as by Heimerman's own contacts in the US, and paralleled international touring exhibitions of [[Bill Brandt]] in 1971, and the French Foreign Ministry\u2019s major exhibition of [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] in 1974.

Owned by [[Good Karma Brands]], WWGK currently airs programming from [[Doctor Radio]] (due to the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]]), but prior to that had served as a secondary [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate, alongside [[sister station]] [[WKNR]]\n\nThe WWGK studios are located in [[Downtown Cleveland]].   The transmitter tower is located on Euclid Avenue at East 81st Street in the [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]] section of Cleveland. In addition to a standard [[analog transmission]], WWGK is available online.\n\n==History==\n\n===WJMO (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Cleveland radio station [[WJMO]]}}\nThe station's roots trace back to WJMO, which went on the air on June 1, 1947 licensed to Cleveland as a daytime-only broadcaster at 1540&nbsp;kHz<ref>{{cite news|title=WJMO in Cleveland Started Yesterday|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-06-02-BC.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=June 1, 1947}}</ref> with studios at 2157 Euclid Avenue and a power of 1000 watts. The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with [[Painesville, Ohio]] station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E Communications - on October 24, 2006.\n\nFour days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" with a [[sports talk radio|sports/talk]] format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7.\n\nWWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire [[ESPN Radio]] daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station [[WAUK]]. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on [[WERE]] in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, ''Crain's Cleveland Business'' reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase [[WKNR]] for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at [[The Galleria at Erieview]].\n\nOn February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK would take the branding AM 1540 KNR2, (a play on [[ESPN2]]) in keeping with its sister station.  In April 2010, the station began branding itself as ESPN 1540 KNR2.  Today, WWGK and WKNR are often promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland.\n\nThe new schedule also made WWGK the [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Dan Patrick]] and the final hour of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, [[WKRK-FM]] 92.3 switched from [[alternative rock]] to a [[sports talk]] format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland.  AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped all sports programming and switched to a medical news/talk format, airing programming from [[Sirius XM]]'s [[Doctor Radio]] service.  This was done to provide a health-related service during the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]].  Good Karma management has stated sports programming will eventually resume as events warrant.<ref>[http://www.radioinsight.com/headlines/186287/1540-wwgk-cleveland-to-add-siriusxms-coronavirus-programming/ 1540 WWGK Cleveland to add Sirius XM coronavirus programming - Radio Inisight.com]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|https://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}\n*{{FCC letter|callsign=FCC History Cards for WWGK|letterid=46285}}{{AM station data|WWGK}}\n\n{{Cleveland Radio}}\n{{Sports Radio Stations in Ohio}}\n{{Daytime-only radio stations in Ohio}}\n{{ESPN Ohio}}\n{{Good Karma Broadcasting}}\n\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:ESPN Radio stations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1947]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Cleveland|WGK]]\n[[Category:Daytime-only radio stations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sports radio station in Cleveland, Ohio}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name = WWGK\n| image = \n| city = [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]\n| area = [[Greater Cleveland]] (limited)\n| branding = '''Doctor Radio'''\n| frequency = 1540 [[Kilohertz|kHz]]\n| airdate = {{start date and age|1947|6|1}}\n| format = Medical news/talk\n| power = 1,000 [[watt]]s (daytime only)\n| class = D\n| facility_id = 70659\n| coordinates = {{nowrap|{{coord|41|30|10.00|N|81|37|57.00|W|region:US-OH_type:landmark_source:FCC}}}}\n| callsign_meaning = owner Good Karma Brands\n| former_callsigns = WJMO (1947&ndash;58)<br>WABQ (1958&ndash;2006)<br>WBKC (2006)\n| affiliations = [[Doctor Radio]]\n| owner = [[Good Karma Brands]]\n| licensee = {{nowrap|Good Karma Broadcasting, LLC}}\n| sister_stations = [[WKNR]]\n| webcast = [http://espn.go.com/espnradio/affPopup?s=wwgk-am Listen Live]\n| website = {{URL|http://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}<br>{{URL|http://thelandondemand.com}}\n}}\n\n'''WWGK''' (1540 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a commercial [[Clear-channel station#Daytimers|daytime-only]] medical news/talk [[radio station]] licensed to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], providing limited coverage to [[Greater Cleveland]].  Owned by [[Good Karma Brands]], WWGK currently airs programming from [[Doctor Radio]] (due to the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]]), but prior to that had served as a secondary [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate, alongside [[sister station]] [[WKNR]]\n\nThe WWGK studios are located in [[Downtown Cleveland]].   The transmitter tower is located on Euclid Avenue at East 81st Street in the [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]] section of Cleveland. In addition to a standard [[analog transmission]], WWGK is available online.\n\n==History==\n\n===WJMO (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Cleveland radio station [[WJMO]]}}\nThe station's roots trace back to WJMO, which went on the air on June 1, 1947 licensed to Cleveland as a daytime-only broadcaster at 1540&nbsp;kHz<ref>{{cite news|title=WJMO in Cleveland Started Yesterday|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-06-02-BC.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=June 1, 1947}}</ref> with studios at 2157 Euclid Avenue and a power of 1000 watts. The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.

{"title_page": "Released time", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=November 2011}}\nIn the United States [[Education in the United States|public school]] system, '''released time''' or '''release time''' is time set aside during school hours, typically an hour a day or a week, for students to receive off-campus private religious education.\n\n==Early history==\nThe original idea of released time in the [[United States]] was first discussed in 1905 at a school conference in New York City. The proposal was that public elementary schools should be closed one day a week, in addition to Sunday, so that parents could have their children receive religious instruction outside the school premises. This idea was later implemented by Dr. [[William Albert Wirt (educationalist)|William Albert Wirt]], an educator and superintendent of the school district of [[Gary, Indiana]], in 1914. In the first years of Wirt's implementation, over 600 students participated in off-campus religious education.\n\nMost released time programs were held outside school property, and the public school system had no involvement in the religious programs taught there.\n\nReleased time began to grow rapidly. In 1922, programs were active in 23 states. Approximately 40,000 students, from 200 school districts, were enrolled in such programs. In 1932, 30 states had active programs in 400 communities with enrollment of 250,000 students. In 1942, participation reached 1.5 million students in 46 states. Released time reached its peak enrollment totals in 1947, when 2 million students were enrolled in some 2,200 communities. Legislation paving the way for released time programs had been adopted by 12 states. [http://www.releasedtime.org/besthtml/best_history.htm]\n\n==Legal challenge==\nIn 1945, [[Vashti McCollum]] brought legal action against the [[Champaign, Illinois]] public school district. McCollum was the mother of a student in the district. McCollum's suit stated that her eight-year-old son had been coerced and ostracized by school officials because her family had chosen to not participate in the district's in-school religious instruction program. The Champaign district's religious instruction was held during regular school hours in the classrooms in Champaign's public schools and was taught by members of a local religious association, with the approval of school officials.\n\nMcCollum's suit argued that religious instruction held during regular school hours on public school property constituted an [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]], in violation of the [[US Constitution]], and violated also the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nThe state district court ruled against McCollum, as did the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] upon appeal. However, in 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled 8-1 in favor of McCollum, reversing the lower courts' decision. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=333&invol=203]. It ruled that the Champaign program was unconstitutional since it used the state's compulsory education system to aid in the teaching of religious doctrine and tax-supported school buildings were being used.\n\nIn the aftermath of that decision, ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'', the number of released time classes dropped by 12 percent across the nation. [http://www.bestnetwork.org/history.htm]\n\n===Zorach v. Clauson===\nIn 1952, the case of [[Zorach v. Clauson]] came before the Supreme Court. The case involved the education law of [[New York State]], particularly a regulation by which a public school was permitted to release students during school hours for religious instruction or devotional exercises. In a 6 to 3 ruling, the high court upheld the New York law.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote that New York's program \"involves neither religious instruction in public schools nor the expenditure of public funds\", unlike the earlier McCollum case that the Zorach plaintiffs had cited as precedent.\n\nDouglas wrote that a public school \"may not coerce anyone to attend church, to observe a religious holiday, or to take religious instruction. But it can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction. No more than that is undertaken here.\"\n\nThe Court's opinion stated that\n\n: In the McCollum case the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction. Here, as we have said, the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules to a program of outside religious instruction. We follow the McCollum case. But we cannot expand it to cover the present released time program unless separation of Church and State means that public institutions can make no adjustments of their schedules to accommodate the religious needs of the people. We cannot read into the Bill of Rights such a philosophy of hostility to religion.[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=343&invol=306]\n\n===Moss v. Spartanburg County School District Seven===\nIn 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld a South Carolina school district\u2019s practice of awarding academic credit through a religiously-affiliated private school in the case of Moss v. Spartanburg County School District Seven. The court reiterating that Zorach is good law and held that Released Time programs, and the academic credit received for them, is an accommodation of the parents\u2019 right to choose the type of education their child receives. The court found that:\n\n: Far from establishing a state religion, the acceptance of transfer credits (including religious credits) by public schools sensibly accommodates the genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious. <ref>http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/111448.P.pdf</ref>\n\n==Today==\nThere are approximately 1,000 released time programs in operation today, ranging from kindergarten to high school, with 250,000 students enrolled. In some areas, including most public school districts in the state of [[Utah]], released time programs allow students a daily class period, which may be used for extracurricular religious studies.\n\n===School Ministries===\nA multi-denominational Christian organization that supports Released Time Bible Education across the country is School Ministries, Inc. It was created in 1990 to act as an association that assists local communities in the creation of Released Time Bible Education and to provide support for existing programs.  Although initially envisioned to have a South Carolina focus, School Ministries soon was undertaking a national role in responding to RTBE interests, addressing legal challenges, raising national visibility and addressing research needs.  Since 2003, School Ministries has experienced an annual growth rate of 10% in students served. (See School Ministries, Inc. [http://www.schoolministries.org])\n\nIn 2006, School Ministries lead an effort in South Carolina to allow Released Time for high school credit.

The proposal was that public elementary schools should be closed one day a week, in addition to Sunday, so that parents could have their children receive religious instruction outside the school premises. This idea was later implemented by Dr. [[William Albert Wirt (educationalist)|William Albert Wirt]], an educator and superintendent of the school district of [[Gary, Indiana]], in 1914. In the first years of Wirt's implementation, over 600 students participated in off-campus religious education.\n\nMost released time programs were held outside school property, and the public school system had no involvement in the religious programs taught there.\n\nReleased time began to grow rapidly. In 1922, programs were active in 23 states. Approximately 40,000 students, from 200 school districts, were enrolled in such programs. In 1932, 30 states had active programs in 400 communities with enrollment of 250,000 students. In 1942, participation reached 1.5 million students in 46 states. Released time reached its peak enrollment totals in 1947, when 2 million students were enrolled in some 2,200 communities. Legislation paving the way for released time programs had been adopted by 12 states. [http://www.releasedtime.org/besthtml/best_history.htm]\n\n==Legal challenge==\nIn 1945, [[Vashti McCollum]] brought legal action against the [[Champaign, Illinois]] public school district. McCollum was the mother of a student in the district. McCollum's suit stated that her eight-year-old son had been coerced and ostracized by school officials because her family had chosen to not participate in the district's in-school religious instruction program. The Champaign district's religious instruction was held during regular school hours in the classrooms in Champaign's public schools and was taught by members of a local religious association, with the approval of school officials.\n\nMcCollum's suit argued that religious instruction held during regular school hours on public school property constituted an [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]], in violation of the [[US Constitution]], and violated also the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nThe state district court ruled against McCollum, as did the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] upon appeal. However, in 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled 8-1 in favor of McCollum, reversing the lower courts' decision. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=333&invol=203]. It ruled that the Champaign program was unconstitutional since it used the state's compulsory education system to aid in the teaching of religious doctrine and tax-supported school buildings were being used.\n\nIn the aftermath of that decision, ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'', the number of released time classes dropped by 12 percent across the nation. [http://www.bestnetwork.org/history.htm]\n\n===Zorach v. Clauson===\nIn 1952, the case of [[Zorach v. Clauson]] came before the Supreme Court. The case involved the education law of [[New York State]], particularly a regulation by which a public school was permitted to release students during school hours for religious instruction or devotional exercises. In a 6 to 3 ruling, the high court upheld the New York law.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote that New York's program \"involves neither religious instruction in public schools nor the expenditure of public funds\", unlike the earlier McCollum case that the Zorach plaintiffs had cited as precedent.\n\nDouglas wrote that a public school \"may not coerce anyone to attend church, to observe a religious holiday, or to take religious instruction. But it can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction. No more than that is undertaken here.\"\n\nThe Court's opinion stated that\n\n: In the McCollum case the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction. Here, as we have said, the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules to a program of outside religious instruction. We follow the McCollum case. But we cannot expand it to cover the present released time program unless separation of Church and State means that public institutions can make no adjustments of their schedules to accommodate the religious needs of the people. We cannot read into the Bill of Rights such a philosophy of hostility to religion.[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=343&invol=306]\n\n===Moss v. Spartanburg County School District Seven===\nIn 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld a South Carolina school district\u2019s practice of awarding academic credit through a religiously-affiliated private school in the case of Moss v. Spartanburg County School District Seven. The court reiterating that Zorach is good law and held that Released Time programs, and the academic credit received for them, is an accommodation of the parents\u2019 right to choose the type of education their child receives. The court found that:\n\n: Far from establishing a state religion, the acceptance of transfer credits (including religious credits) by public schools sensibly accommodates the genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious. <ref>http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/111448.P.pdf</ref>\n\n==Today==\nThere are approximately 1,000 released time programs in operation today, ranging from kindergarten to high school, with 250,000 students enrolled. In some areas, including most public school districts in the state of [[Utah]], released time programs allow students a daily class period, which may be used for extracurricular religious studies.\n\nA multi-denominational Christian organization that supports Released Time Bible Education across the country is School Ministries, Inc. It was created in 1990 to act as an association that assists local communities in the creation of Released Time Bible Education and to provide support for existing programs.  Although initially envisioned to have a South Carolina focus, School Ministries soon was undertaking a national role in responding to RTBE interests, addressing legal challenges, raising national visibility and addressing research needs.  Since 2003, School Ministries has experienced an annual growth rate of 10% in students served. (See School Ministries, Inc. [http://www.schoolministries.org])\n\nIn 2006, School Ministries lead an effort in South Carolina to allow Released Time for high school credit.

This is surrounded by feeding arms, and is linked to a U-shaped gut, with the anus being located on the oral disc near the mouth. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognised, in most crinoids the five arms are subdivided into ten or more. These have feathery pinnules and are spread wide to gather [[plankton]]ic particles from the water. At some stage in their life, most crinoids have a stem used to attach themselves to the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults.\n\nThere are only about 600 living species of crinoid,<ref name=adw>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Crinoidea.html |title=Animal Diversity Web: Crinoidea|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> but the class was much more abundant and diverse in the past. Some thick [[limestone]] beds dating to the mid- to late-[[Paleozoic]] era are almost entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Crinoidea\" comes from the Greek word ''\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2'', \"a lily\", with the suffix ''\u2013oid'' meaning \"like\".<ref>''Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary.'' 2nd ed. 1979.</ref><ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite dictionary|title=crinoid|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crinoid&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref> They live in both shallow water<ref name=\"Zmarzly85\">{{cite journal | url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/941 | title=The Shallow-Water Crinoid Fauna of Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands: Ecological Observations, Interatoll Comparisons, and Zoogeographic Affinities | author=Zmarzly, D.L. | journal=Pacific Science | year=1985 | volume=39 | pages=340\u2013358}}</ref> and in depths as great as {{convert|9000|meters}}.<ref name=\"IzuDeep\">{{cite journal | title=Discovery of Dense Aggregations of Stalked Crinoids in Izu-Ogasawara Trench, Japan | author=Oji, T. | author2=Ogawa, Y. | author3=Hunter, A.

It attaches to the substrate with a flattened [[holdfast]] or with whorls of jointed, root-like structures known as [[Cirrus (biology)|cirri]]. Further cirri may occur higher up the stem. In crinoids that attach to hard surfaces, the cirri may be robust and curved, resembling birds' feet, but when crinoids live on soft sediment, the cirri may be slender and rod-like. Juvenile feather stars have a stem, but this is later lost, with many species retaining a few cirri at the base of the crown. The majority of living crinoids are free-swimming and have only a [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] stalk. In those deep-sea species that still retain a stalk, it may reach up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length (although usually much smaller), and fossil species are known with {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} stems.<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=917\u2013927 }}</ref>\n\nThe theca is [[Symmetry in biology#Pentamerism|pentamerous]] (has five-part symmetry) and is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the body or disc of other echinoderms. The base of the theca is formed from a cup-shaped set of ossicles (bony plates), the [[Calyx (anatomy)|calyx]], while the upper surface is formed by the weakly-calcified [[tegmen]], a membranous disc. The tegmen is divided into five \"ambulacral areas\", including a deep groove from which the [[tube feet]] project, and five \"interambulacral areas\" between them. The mouth is near the centre or on the margin of the tegmen, and [[ambulacral]] grooves lead from the base of the arms to the mouth. The [[anus]] is also located on the tegmen, often on a small elevated cone, in an [[Ambulacral|interambulacral]] area. The theca is relatively small and contains the crinoid's digestive organs.<ref name=IZ/> \n\nThe arms are supported by a series of articulating ossicles similar to those in the stalk. Primitively, crinoids had only five arms, but in most modern forms these are divided into two at ossicle II, giving ten arms in total. In most living species, especially the free-swimming feather stars, the arms branch several more times, producing up to two hundred branches in total. Being jointed, the arms can curl up. They are lined, on either side alternately, by smaller jointed appendages known as \"pinnules\" which give them their feather-like appearance. Both arms and pinnules have [[tube feet]] along the margins of the ambulacral grooves. The tube feet come in groups of three of different size; they have no suction pads and are used to hold and manipulate food particles. The grooves are equipped with [[Organelle|cilia]] which facilitate feeding by moving the organic particles along the arm and into the mouth.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n<gallery style=\"text-align:center;\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Crinoide vraie.jpg|Stem, theca and arms of a \"true\" (stalked) crinoid (family [[Isselicrinidae]])\nImage:Comasteridae - Oxycomanthus bennetti-001.jpg|''[[Oxycomanthus bennetti]]'' (comatulid)\nImage:Lamprometra palmata hgsus03.JPG|Tegmen of a ''[[Lamprometra palmata]]''.

The arms are raised to form a fan-shape which is held perpendicular to the current. Mobile crinoids move to perch on rocks, coral heads or other eminences to maximise their feeding opportunities. The food particles are caught by the primary (longest) tube feet, which are fully extended and held erect from the pinnules, forming a food-trapping mesh, while the secondary and tertiary tube feet are involved in manipulating anything encountered.<ref name=IZ/> \n\nThe tube feet are covered with sticky [[mucus]] that traps any particles which come in contact. Once they have caught a particle of food, the tube feet flick it into the [[ambulacral]] groove, where the cilia propel the mucus and food particles towards the mouth. Lappets at the side of the groove help keep the mucus stream in place. The total length of the food-trapping surface may be very large; the 56 arms of a [[Metacrinus rotundus|Japanese sea lily]] with  {{convert|24|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} arms, have a total length of {{convert|80|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} including the pinnules. Generally speaking, crinoids living in environments with relatively little [[plankton]] have longer and more highly branched arms than those living in food-rich environments.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe mouth descends into a short [[oesophagus]]. There is no true stomach, so the oesophagus connects directly to the [[intestine]], which runs in a single loop right around the inside of the calyx. The intestine often includes numerous [[Diverticulum|diverticulae]], some of which may be long or branched. The end of the intestine opens into a short muscular [[rectum]]. This ascends towards the [[anus]], which projects from a small conical protuberance at the edge of the tegmen. Faecal matter is formed into large, mucous-cemented pellets which fall onto the tegmen and thence the substrate.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n=== Predation ===\nSpecimens of the sea urchin ''[[Calocidaris micans]]'' found in the vicinity of the crinoid ''[[Endoxocrinus parrae]]'', have been shown to contain large quantities of stem portions in their guts. These consist of articulated ossicles with soft tissue, whereas the local sediment contained only disarticulated ossicles without soft tissue. This makes it highly likely that these sea urchins are [[Predation|predators]] of the crinoids, and that the crinoids flee, offering part of their stem in the process.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1666/07031.1 |title=Urchins in the meadow: Paleobiological and evolutionary implications of cidaroid predation on crinoids |journal=Paleobiology |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=22\u201334 |year=2008 |last1=Baumiller |first1=Tomasz K. |last2=Mooi |first2=Rich |last3=Messing |first3=Charles G. |jstor=20445573|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b5778af4db2b00571a163df193deec72eae247b }}</ref>\n\nVarious crinoid fossils hint at possible prehistoric predators.

This is not connected to external sea water via a [[madreporite]], as in other echinoderms, but only connected through a large number of pores to the [[coelom]] (body cavity). The main fluid reservoir is the muscular-walled ring canal which is connected to the coelom by stone canals lined with calcareous material. The coelom is divided into a number of interconnecting spaces by [[Mesentery (zoology)|mesenteries]]. It surrounds the viscera in the disc and has branches within the stalk and arms, with smaller branches extending into the pinnules. It is the contraction of the ring canal that extends the tube feet. Three narrow branches of the coelom enter each arm, two on the oral side and one aborally, and pinnules. The action of cilia cause there to be a slow flow of fluid (1mm per second) in these canals, outward in the oral branches and inward in the aboral ones, and this is the main means of transport of nutrients and waste products. There is no heart and separate circulatory system but at the base of the disc there is a large blood vessel known as the axial organ, containing some slender blind-ended tubes of unknown function, which extends into the stalk.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThese various fluid-filled spaces, in addition to transporting nutrients around the body, also function as both a respiratory and an excretory system. Oxygen is absorbed primarily through the tube feet, which are the most thin-walled parts of the body, with further gas exchange taking place over the large surface area of the arms. There are no specialised organs for excretion while waste is collected by [[phagocyte|phagocytic]] coelomocytes.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Nervous system===\n\nThe crinoid nervous system is divided into three parts, with numerous connections between them. The oral or uppermost portion is the only one [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the nervous systems of other echinoderms. It consists of a central nerve ring surrounding the mouth, and radial nerves branching into the arms and is sensory in function. Below this lies an intermediate nerve ring, giving off radial nerves supplying the arms and pinnules. These nerves are motor in nature, and control the musculature of the tube feet. The third portion of the nervous system lies aborally, and is responsible for the flexing and movement actions of the arms, pinnules and cirri. This is centred on a mass of neural tissue near the base of the calyx, and provides a single nerve to each arm and a number of nerves to the stalk.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Reproduction and life cycle===\n\nCrinoids are not capable of clonal reproduction as are some [[starfish]] and [[brittle star]]s, but are capable of regenerating lost body parts. Arms torn off by predators or damaged by adverse environmental conditions can regrow, and even the visceral mass can regenerate over the course of a few weeks. This regeneration may be vital in surviving attacks by predatory fish.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nCrinoids are [[Dioecy|dioecious]], with individuals being either male or female. In most species, the [[gonad]]s are located in the pinnules but in a few, they are located in the arms. Not all the pinnules are reproductive, just those closest to the crown. The [[gamete]]s are produced in genital canals enclosed in genital coeloms. The pinnules eventually rupture to release the [[sperm]] and [[ovum|eggs]] into the surrounding sea water. In certain genera, such as ''[[Antedon]]'', the fertilised eggs are cemented to the arms with secretions from epidermal glands; in others, especially cold water species from Antarctica, the eggs are [[Egg incubation|brooded]] in specialised sacs on the arms or pinnules.<ref name=IZ/> \n\nThe fertilised eggs hatch to release free-swimming [[Echinoderm#Larval_development|vitellaria larvae]]. The bilaterally symmetrical larva is barrel-shaped with rings of [[Cilium|cilia]] running round the body, and a tuft of sensory hairs at the upper pole. While both feeding (planktotrophic) and non-feeding (lecithotrophic) larvae exist among the four other extant echinoderm classes, all present day crinoids appear to be descendants from a surviving clade that went through a [[Population bottleneck|bottleneck]] after the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction]], at that time losing the feeding larval stage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800866 |pmid=16850040 |title=The active evolutionary lives of echinoderm larvae |journal=Heredity |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=244\u201352 |year=2006 |last1=Raff |first1=R A |last2=Byrne |first2=M|doi-access=free }}</ref> The larva's free-swimming period lasts for only a few days before it settles on the bottom and attaches itself to the underlying surface using an adhesive gland on its underside. The larva then undergoes an extended period of [[metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] into a stalked [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], becoming radially symmetric in the process. Even the free-swimming feather stars go through this stage, with the adult eventually breaking away from the stalk.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n==Locomotion==\n[[File:Crinoid and comatule.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A stalked crinoid (white) and a comatulid (red) in deep sea, showing the differences between these two sister groups]]\nMost modern crinoids, i.e., the feather stars, are free-moving and lack a stem as adults.

This is surrounded by feeding arms, and is linked to a U-shaped gut, with the anus being located on the oral disc near the mouth. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognised, in most crinoids the five arms are subdivided into ten or more. These have feathery pinnules and are spread wide to gather [[plankton]]ic particles from the water. At some stage in their life, most crinoids have a stem used to attach themselves to the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults.\n\nThere are only about 600 living species of crinoid,<ref name=adw>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Crinoidea.html |title=Animal Diversity Web: Crinoidea|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> but the class was much more abundant and diverse in the past.

In crinoids that attach to hard surfaces, the cirri may be robust and curved, resembling birds' feet, but when crinoids live on soft sediment, the cirri may be slender and rod-like. Juvenile feather stars have a stem, but this is later lost, with many species retaining a few cirri at the base of the crown. The majority of living crinoids are free-swimming and have only a [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] stalk. In those deep-sea species that still retain a stalk, it may reach up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length (although usually much smaller), and fossil species are known with {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} stems.<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=917\u2013927 }}</ref>\n\nThe theca is [[Symmetry in biology#Pentamerism|pentamerous]] (has five-part symmetry) and is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the body or disc of other echinoderms. The base of the theca is formed from a cup-shaped set of ossicles (bony plates), the [[Calyx (anatomy)|calyx]], while the upper surface is formed by the weakly-calcified [[tegmen]], a membranous disc. The tegmen is divided into five \"ambulacral areas\", including a deep groove from which the [[tube feet]] project, and five \"interambulacral areas\" between them. The mouth is near the centre or on the margin of the tegmen, and [[ambulacral]] grooves lead from the base of the arms to the mouth. The [[anus]] is also located on the tegmen, often on a small elevated cone, in an [[Ambulacral|interambulacral]] area. The theca is relatively small and contains the crinoid's digestive organs.<ref name=IZ/> \n\nThe arms are supported by a series of articulating ossicles similar to those in the stalk. Primitively, crinoids had only five arms, but in most modern forms these are divided into two at ossicle II, giving ten arms in total. In most living species, especially the free-swimming feather stars, the arms branch several more times, producing up to two hundred branches in total. Being jointed, the arms can curl up. They are lined, on either side alternately, by smaller jointed appendages known as \"pinnules\" which give them their feather-like appearance. Both arms and pinnules have [[tube feet]] along the margins of the ambulacral grooves. The tube feet come in groups of three of different size; they have no suction pads and are used to hold and manipulate food particles. The grooves are equipped with [[Organelle|cilia]] which facilitate feeding by moving the organic particles along the arm and into the mouth.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n<gallery style=\"text-align:center;\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Crinoide vraie.jpg|Stem, theca and arms of a \"true\" (stalked) crinoid (family [[Isselicrinidae]])\nImage:Comasteridae - Oxycomanthus bennetti-001.jpg|''[[Oxycomanthus bennetti]]'' (comatulid)\nImage:Lamprometra palmata hgsus03.JPG|Tegmen of a ''[[Lamprometra palmata]]''.

The arms are raised to form a fan-shape which is held perpendicular to the current. Mobile crinoids move to perch on rocks, coral heads or other eminences to maximise their feeding opportunities. The food particles are caught by the primary (longest) tube feet, which are fully extended and held erect from the pinnules, forming a food-trapping mesh, while the secondary and tertiary tube feet are involved in manipulating anything encountered.<ref name=IZ/> \n\nThe tube feet are covered with sticky [[mucus]] that traps any particles which come in contact. Once they have caught a particle of food, the tube feet flick it into the [[ambulacral]] groove, where the cilia propel the mucus and food particles towards the mouth. Lappets at the side of the groove help keep the mucus stream in place. The total length of the food-trapping surface may be very large; the 56 arms of a [[Metacrinus rotundus|Japanese sea lily]] with  {{convert|24|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} arms, have a total length of {{convert|80|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} including the pinnules. Generally speaking, crinoids living in environments with relatively little [[plankton]] have longer and more highly branched arms than those living in food-rich environments.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe mouth descends into a short [[oesophagus]]. There is no true stomach, so the oesophagus connects directly to the [[intestine]], which runs in a single loop right around the inside of the calyx. The intestine often includes numerous [[Diverticulum|diverticulae]], some of which may be long or branched. The end of the intestine opens into a short muscular [[rectum]]. This ascends towards the [[anus]], which projects from a small conical protuberance at the edge of the tegmen. Faecal matter is formed into large, mucous-cemented pellets which fall onto the tegmen and thence the substrate.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n=== Predation ===\nSpecimens of the sea urchin ''[[Calocidaris micans]]'' found in the vicinity of the crinoid ''[[Endoxocrinus parrae]]'', have been shown to contain large quantities of stem portions in their guts. These consist of articulated ossicles with soft tissue, whereas the local sediment contained only disarticulated ossicles without soft tissue. This makes it highly likely that these sea urchins are [[Predation|predators]] of the crinoids, and that the crinoids flee, offering part of their stem in the process.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1666/07031.1 |title=Urchins in the meadow: Paleobiological and evolutionary implications of cidaroid predation on crinoids |journal=Paleobiology |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=22\u201334 |year=2008 |last1=Baumiller |first1=Tomasz K. |last2=Mooi |first2=Rich |last3=Messing |first3=Charles G. |jstor=20445573|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b5778af4db2b00571a163df193deec72eae247b }}</ref>\n\nVarious crinoid fossils hint at possible prehistoric predators.

This is not connected to external sea water via a [[madreporite]], as in other echinoderms, but only connected through a large number of pores to the [[coelom]] (body cavity). The main fluid reservoir is the muscular-walled ring canal which is connected to the coelom by stone canals lined with calcareous material. The coelom is divided into a number of interconnecting spaces by [[Mesentery (zoology)|mesenteries]]. It surrounds the viscera in the disc and has branches within the stalk and arms, with smaller branches extending into the pinnules. It is the contraction of the ring canal that extends the tube feet. Three narrow branches of the coelom enter each arm, two on the oral side and one aborally, and pinnules. The action of cilia cause there to be a slow flow of fluid (1mm per second) in these canals, outward in the oral branches and inward in the aboral ones, and this is the main means of transport of nutrients and waste products. There is no heart and separate circulatory system but at the base of the disc there is a large blood vessel known as the axial organ, containing some slender blind-ended tubes of unknown function, which extends into the stalk.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThese various fluid-filled spaces, in addition to transporting nutrients around the body, also function as both a respiratory and an excretory system. Oxygen is absorbed primarily through the tube feet, which are the most thin-walled parts of the body, with further gas exchange taking place over the large surface area of the arms. There are no specialised organs for excretion while waste is collected by [[phagocyte|phagocytic]] coelomocytes.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Nervous system===\n\nThe crinoid nervous system is divided into three parts, with numerous connections between them. The oral or uppermost portion is the only one [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the nervous systems of other echinoderms. It consists of a central nerve ring surrounding the mouth, and radial nerves branching into the arms and is sensory in function. Below this lies an intermediate nerve ring, giving off radial nerves supplying the arms and pinnules. These nerves are motor in nature, and control the musculature of the tube feet. The third portion of the nervous system lies aborally, and is responsible for the flexing and movement actions of the arms, pinnules and cirri. This is centred on a mass of neural tissue near the base of the calyx, and provides a single nerve to each arm and a number of nerves to the stalk.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Reproduction and life cycle===\n\nCrinoids are not capable of clonal reproduction as are some [[starfish]] and [[brittle star]]s, but are capable of regenerating lost body parts. Arms torn off by predators or damaged by adverse environmental conditions can regrow, and even the visceral mass can regenerate over the course of a few weeks. This regeneration may be vital in surviving attacks by predatory fish.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nCrinoids are [[Dioecy|dioecious]], with individuals being either male or female. In most species, the [[gonad]]s are located in the pinnules but in a few, they are located in the arms. Not all the pinnules are reproductive, just those closest to the crown. The [[gamete]]s are produced in genital canals enclosed in genital coeloms. The pinnules eventually rupture to release the [[sperm]] and [[ovum|eggs]] into the surrounding sea water. In certain genera, such as ''[[Antedon]]'', the fertilised eggs are cemented to the arms with secretions from epidermal glands; in others, especially cold water species from Antarctica, the eggs are [[Egg incubation|brooded]] in specialised sacs on the arms or pinnules.<ref name=IZ/> \n\nThe fertilised eggs hatch to release free-swimming [[Echinoderm#Larval_development|vitellaria larvae]]. The bilaterally symmetrical larva is barrel-shaped with rings of [[Cilium|cilia]] running round the body, and a tuft of sensory hairs at the upper pole. While both feeding (planktotrophic) and non-feeding (lecithotrophic) larvae exist among the four other extant echinoderm classes, all present day crinoids appear to be descendants from a surviving clade that went through a [[Population bottleneck|bottleneck]] after the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction]], at that time losing the feeding larval stage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800866 |pmid=16850040 |title=The active evolutionary lives of echinoderm larvae |journal=Heredity |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=244\u201352 |year=2006 |last1=Raff |first1=R A |last2=Byrne |first2=M|doi-access=free }}</ref> The larva's free-swimming period lasts for only a few days before it settles on the bottom and attaches itself to the underlying surface using an adhesive gland on its underside. The larva then undergoes an extended period of [[metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] into a stalked [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], becoming radially symmetric in the process. Even the free-swimming feather stars go through this stage, with the adult eventually breaking away from the stalk.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n==Locomotion==\n[[File:Crinoid and comatule.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A stalked crinoid (white) and a comatulid (red) in deep sea, showing the differences between these two sister groups]]\nMost modern crinoids, i.e., the feather stars, are free-moving and lack a stem as adults.

It has two stacked levels, each of which has two tracks and two [[side platform]]s. The upper level is used by local trains, and the lower level is used by express trains. The levels are separated by the [[BMT Broadway Line]]'s platform directly underneath the local platforms and a mezzanine between the BMT platform and the express level. Long escalators connect the local and express platforms directly.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=horizontal\n|width=150\n|image1=59 Street IRT 001.JPG\n|image2=59th Street-IRT Lex Upper Level 59 Mosaics.jpg\n|caption1=Station mosaic name tablet on the upper level\n|caption2=Mosaic frieze on the upper level platform's wall\n}}\nThe station used to have all green tile which has been covered up except for one \"59th Street\" sign near the south end of the northbound platform. There are whimsical stylized mosaics of coffee cups and slippers in varied colors at random spacing near the stairways to the Broadway and IRT local trains. This station was renovated in conjunction with the construction of the [[Bloomberg Tower]] at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue. Although a new entrance was constructed within the building, it has remained closed due to fears of icicle formation on a railing that is part of the building's design, directly above the street entrance. A legal battle between the city and the building's management over who is responsible for modifying the design has caused the entrance to be temporarily closed between 2003 and 2006.\n\nThere is a direct exit to [[Bloomingdale's]] from the uptown local platform's [[fare control]] (this exit was used in the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]''). The underpass near the south end of the station was originally the northbound platform for the extension of the BMT Broadway Line to Queens. That line had been planned as two separate, one-track tunnels, one each under 59th and 60th Streets. Later on, it was decided to alter this layout in favor of a single two-track tunnel under 60th Street. The semi-completed platform under 59th Street was then converted to an underpass between the north and southbound platforms of the Lexington Avenue Line local tracks.\n\nOn the upper level, north of the station, there is a storage/lay up track between the two tracks. It ends at a [[bumper block]] at its north end. It merges with the two local tracks on its southern end.\n\nIn 2019, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] announced that the station would become [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] as part of the agency's 2020\u20132024 Capital Program.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/mta-announces-20-additional-subway-stations-receive-accessibility|title=Press Release - MTA Headquarters - MTA Announces 20 Additional Subway Stations to Receive Accessibility Improvements Under Proposed 2020-2024 Capital Plan|date=December 19, 2019|website=MTA|access-date=December 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Addition of express platforms ===\nThe station originally served local trains only.<ref>\"East Side Subway to Get Express Stop at 59th St.\", ''[[New York Times]]''; April 8, 1959; page 1</ref> On November 4, 1954, the New York City Transit Authority approved plans to convert 59th Street into an express station.

Two high speed escalators were added to connect the local and express platforms. Two additional high speed escalators were built to connect the local platforms with the new mezzanine. The express station opened three months earlier than originally planned. As part of the plan, the local platforms were extended to accommodate 10-car trains. In addition, new entrances and booths were added to the 59th Street ends of the northbound and southbound sides.

The Lexington Avenue mezzanine has two staircases to each of the IRT local platforms, an escalator to the downtown platform, and three staircases down to the center level. The [[Third Avenue (Manhattan)|Third Avenue]] side was constructed in the late 1960s, with the same red tile that was used during renovation of [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] in 1978. It has up and down escalators and an adjoining staircase, and is open part-time only, with four street staircases on Third Avenue. The new entrance is a result of the platform extension along the same side during the 1960s.\n\nThe distinctive \"Lex\" mosaics were preserved during the renovation, by installing pre-arranged blocks along the station wall that cup the Lexington Avenue Line above it. The wall tiles have the red \"Lex\" evenly spaced out, similar to the [[Independent Subway System|IND]] style, with blue background, green borders, and white lettering. In 2002, the station received a major overhaul. It received a state of repairs with the original late 1910s tiling being restored. The MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiled the walls, added new tiling on the floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, and installed ADA yellow safety threads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Despite this, the project did not make the station ADA-accessible. In 2019, the MTA announced that the station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020\u20132024 Capital Program.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite its name, the station is located on Lexington Avenue and 60th Street, one block north of 59th Street. Originally, the Broadway subway was to run to Queens over the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Because the side streets are so narrow, the Queens-bound track was to run under 59th Street and the downtown-bound track under 60th Street.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/lexbmt.html Lexington Ave (BMT) unfinished platforms]</ref> The Broadway subway plan was changed in 1915 to route both tracks into 60th Street and to cross the East River by a tunnel just north of the Queensboro Bridge. The 59th Street crossing was now useless, and at 60th Street, the subway would have to be at a lower grade on its way to the [[60th Street Tunnel]]. The 59th Street crossing was converted into a pedestrian underpass for the IRT station, and is still in use for that purpose; its floor level is that of the never-completed BMT station. The 60th Street crossing was mostly destroyed when the existing station was built at a lower grade. A door in the southern wall across from the platform opens into a remaining unused space,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QphrZ06AXJE |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 30,

It has two stacked levels, each of which has two tracks and two [[side platform]]s. The upper level is used by local trains, and the lower level is used by express trains. The levels are separated by the [[BMT Broadway Line]]'s platform directly underneath the local platforms and a mezzanine between the BMT platform and the express level. Long escalators connect the local and express platforms directly.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=horizontal\n|width=150\n|image1=59 Street IRT 001.JPG\n|image2=59th Street-IRT Lex Upper Level 59 Mosaics.jpg\n|caption1=Station mosaic name tablet on the upper level\n|caption2=Mosaic frieze on the upper level platform's wall\n}}\nThe station used to have all green tile which has been covered up except for one \"59th Street\" sign near the south end of the northbound platform. There are whimsical stylized mosaics of coffee cups and slippers in varied colors at random spacing near the stairways to the Broadway and IRT local trains. This station was renovated in conjunction with the construction of the [[Bloomberg Tower]] at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue. Although a new entrance was constructed within the building, it has remained closed due to fears of icicle formation on a railing that is part of the building's design, directly above the street entrance. A legal battle between the city and the building's management over who is responsible for modifying the design has caused the entrance to be temporarily closed between 2003 and 2006.\n\nThere is a direct exit to [[Bloomingdale's]] from the uptown local platform's [[fare control]] (this exit was used in the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]''). The underpass near the south end of the station was originally the northbound platform for the extension of the BMT Broadway Line to Queens. That line had been planned as two separate, one-track tunnels, one each under 59th and 60th Streets. Later on, it was decided to alter this layout in favor of a single two-track tunnel under 60th Street. The semi-completed platform under 59th Street was then converted to an underpass between the north and southbound platforms of the Lexington Avenue Line local tracks.\n\nOn the upper level, north of the station, there is a storage/lay up track between the two tracks. It ends at a [[bumper block]] at its north end. It merges with the two local tracks on its southern end.\n\nIn 2019, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] announced that the station would become [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] as part of the agency's 2020\u20132024 Capital Program.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/mta-announces-20-additional-subway-stations-receive-accessibility|title=Press Release - MTA Headquarters - MTA Announces 20 Additional Subway Stations to Receive Accessibility Improvements Under Proposed 2020-2024 Capital Plan|date=December 19, 2019|website=MTA|access-date=December 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Addition of express platforms ===\nThe station originally served local trains only.<ref>\"East Side Subway to Get Express Stop at 59th St.\", ''[[New York Times]]''; April 8, 1959; page 1</ref> On November 4, 1954, the New York City Transit Authority approved plans to convert 59th Street into an express station. The project was proposed by the executive director of the NYCTA, Sidney Bingham, to improve connections between the Lexington Avenue Line and the Broadway Line. Construction was expected to take two years and cost $5 million. The new express stop was expected to reduce transfer congestion at [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Grand Central\u201342nd Street]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/11/05/archives/east-59th-street-i-r-t-station-to-be-express-stop-in-2-years-east.html|title=East 59th Street I.

Along with the new express platforms, a new mezzanine was built above it to connect it to the local station, and the Broadway Line station. Two high speed escalators were added to connect the local and express platforms. Two additional high speed escalators were built to connect the local platforms with the new mezzanine. The express station opened three months earlier than originally planned. As part of the plan, the local platforms were extended to accommodate 10-car trains. In addition, new entrances and booths were added to the 59th Street ends of the northbound and southbound sides. The whole cost of the project was $6.5 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = New 59th Street Express Station brochure|url = http://www.thejoekorner.com/lines/lex59/index.html|website = www.thejoekorner.com|access-date = January 25, 2016|publisher = New York City Transit Authority|date = November 15, 1962}}</ref> Work on the express station at 59th Street, required express trains to run local during late nights.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900E7DF143DE333A2575AC2A9649C946191D6CF&legacy=true|title=IRT WILL CURTAIL EAST SIDE SERVICE|date=February 29, 1960|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref> The express platforms were opened on November 15, 1962. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{-|left}}\n\n=== Image gallery ===\n<gallery>\nImage:59 Street IRT 004.JPG|The Lexington Avenue lower-level express station, opened in 1962\nFile:Lexington Avenue-59th Street New Turnstile.jpg|A new, still unused entrance/exit.

The Lexington Avenue mezzanine has two staircases to each of the IRT local platforms, an escalator to the downtown platform, and three staircases down to the center level. The [[Third Avenue (Manhattan)|Third Avenue]] side was constructed in the late 1960s, with the same red tile that was used during renovation of [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] in 1978. It has up and down escalators and an adjoining staircase, and is open part-time only, with four street staircases on Third Avenue. The new entrance is a result of the platform extension along the same side during the 1960s.\n\nThe distinctive \"Lex\" mosaics were preserved during the renovation, by installing pre-arranged blocks along the station wall that cup the Lexington Avenue Line above it. The wall tiles have the red \"Lex\" evenly spaced out, similar to the [[Independent Subway System|IND]] style, with blue background, green borders, and white lettering. In 2002, the station received a major overhaul. It received a state of repairs with the original late 1910s tiling being restored. The MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiled the walls, added new tiling on the floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, and installed ADA yellow safety threads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Despite this, the project did not make the station ADA-accessible. In 2019, the MTA announced that the station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020\u20132024 Capital Program.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite its name, the station is located on Lexington Avenue and 60th Street, one block north of 59th Street. Originally, the Broadway subway was to run to Queens over the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Because the side streets are so narrow, the Queens-bound track was to run under 59th Street and the downtown-bound track under 60th Street.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/lexbmt.html Lexington Ave (BMT) unfinished platforms]</ref> The Broadway subway plan was changed in 1915 to route both tracks into 60th Street and to cross the East River by a tunnel just north of the Queensboro Bridge. The 59th Street crossing was now useless, and at 60th Street, the subway would have to be at a lower grade on its way to the [[60th Street Tunnel]]. The 59th Street crossing was converted into a pedestrian underpass for the IRT station, and is still in use for that purpose; its floor level is that of the never-completed BMT station. The 60th Street crossing was mostly destroyed when the existing station was built at a lower grade. A door in the southern wall across from the platform opens into a remaining unused space,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QphrZ06AXJE |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305140558/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QphrZ06AXJE |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}</ref> and suggests the platform level of the original grade, which is the same as the 59th Street underpass.\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Lexington Avenue/59th Street (New York City Subway)}}\n* {{NYCS ref|http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?5:3106|IRT East Side Line|59th Street}}\n* {{NYCS ref|http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?202:1825|BMT Broadway Subway|Lexington Avenue/59th Street}}\n* nycsubway.org \u2014 [http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/artwork_show?8 Blooming Artwork by Elizabeth Murray (1996)]\n* Station Reporter \u2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070315000028/http://www.stationreporter.net/59lex.htm 59th Street and Lexington Avenue Complex]\n* MTA's Arts For Transit \u2014 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110606071338/http://mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=4&station=15&xdev=1572 59 Street/Lexington Avenue \u2014 59th Street]\n\n'''Google Maps Street View:'''\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ll=40.762317,-73.968394&spn=0.00131,0.002411&layer=c&cbll=40.762376,-73.968533&panoid=jXJI8Ob_AQLQVq5mzkbm1g&cbp=12,160.51,,0,1.48&t=m&z=19 Lexington Avenue and 59th Street entrance]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.762853,-73.967729&spn=0,0.013314&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.762895,-73.967828&panoid=yTYNzb_UCLkaPMllj7RTJA&cbp=12,349.39,,0,10 Lexington Avenue and 60th Street entrance]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ll=40.762073,-73.966205&spn=0.005241,0.009645&layer=c&cbll=40.761999,-73.96626&panoid=Tg5-o7lqhNtOPHHSTv-VDg&cbp=12,118.58,,0,3.35&t=m&z=17 Third Avenue and 60th Street entrance]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ll=40.762707,-73.967385&spn=0.002852,0.009645&layer=c&cbll=40.762668,-73.96729&panoid=Vf1eynp39Y33fNQhKUsfuA&cbp=12,224.43,,0,-0.23&t=m&z=17 60th Street entrance]\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7629858,-73.9677068,3a,75y,182.3h,83.96t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipP82QwKWOBWqkBdG1US82FyyPlL3fNPEoosLzVK!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipP82QwKWOBWqkBdG1US82FyyPlL3fNPEoosLzVK%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya82.61036-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352 Upper IRT level]\n* [http://www.google.com/maps/@40.7631471,-73.9674369,3a,75y,224.56h,87.84t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-mvMRLZKOC0E%2FViEJo6J6OmI%2FAAAAAAAA6L0%2FA1gIgnS9QOY!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2F-mvMRLZKOC0E%2FViEJo6J6OmI%2FAAAAAAAA6L0%2FA1gIgnS9QOY%2Fw203-h100-n-k-no%2F!7i8704!8i4352!6m1!1e1 Lower IRT level]\n* [http://www.google.com/maps/@40.7621618,-73.967687,3a,75y,130.8h,77.87t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-MOxpFhPVGhg%2FViRUPzuXkhI%2FAAAAAAAA7nw%2FVvjTLj5BVcg!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh6.googleusercontent.com%2F-MOxpFhPVGhg%2FViRUPzuXkhI%2FAAAAAAAA7nw%2FVvjTLj5BVcg%2Fw203-h100-n-k-no%2F!7i8704!8i4352!6m1!1e1 BMT platfom]\n* [http://www.google.com/maps/@40.76266,-73.967258,3a,75y,323.65h,85.75t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s--i2og-2hKTw%2FV4baMn06E3I%2FAAAAAAAAJpk%2FgB1UqGIdcqoJ0fvGKLVN8bKVo0SGEj2LQCLIB!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2F--i2og-2hKTw%2FV4baMn06E3I%2FAAAAAAAAJpk%2FgB1UqGIdcqoJ0fvGKLVN8bKVo0SGEj2LQCLIB%2Fw203-h100-p-k-no%2F!7i9728!8i4864!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1!6m1!1e1 Third Avenue Lobby]\n{{refend}}\n\n{{NYCS stations navbox by service|ln=y|lr=y|lw=y|l4=y|l5=y|l6=y|l6x=y}}\n{{NYCS stations navbox by line|broadway=yes|lexington=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lexington Avenue  59th Street (New York City Subway)}}\n[[Category:IRT Lexington Avenue Line stations]]\n[[Category:BMT Broadway Line stations]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway transfer stations]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway stations in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway stations located underground]]\n[[Category:Upper East Side]]\n[[Category:Midtown Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Lexington Avenue]]\n", "name_user": "Epicgenius", "label": "safe", "comment": "format ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Avenue/59th_Street_station"}

Born and raised in [[Iowa]], LaFrentz attended [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] and was drafted in [[1998 NBA Draft|1998]] by the [[Denver Nuggets]]. He was known for his perimeter shooting and his [[Block (basketball)|shot blocking]] abilities. LaFrentz is currently {{when?|date=March 2020}} an assistant basketball coach at [[Decorah High School]] in [[Decorah, Iowa]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===High school===\n\nRaef LaFrentz attended MFL MarMac High School located in [[Monona, Iowa]]. His father, Ron, was an assistant coach on LaFrentz's high school team.

It was there at [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] that LaFrentz was on the receiving end of [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]]' legendary \"elbow pass\". LaFrentz was unable to score on the play due to being fouled. In his third year (2000\u201301), he started 74 of the 78 games he played in and averaged 12.9 ppg., while ranking seventh in the league in blocks at 2.6 bpg., tied for 25th in rebounding with a 7.8 rpg. average, and tied for 27th in field goal percentage (career high .477).\n\nLaFrentz was traded by the Nuggets with [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Avery Johnson]], and [[Tariq Abdul-Wahad]] to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for [[Juwan Howard]], [[Donnell Harvey]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and a [[2002 NBA Draft|2002 first-round]] pick on February 21, 2002. He finished the 2001\u201302 season second in the NBA in blocked shots per game.\n\nLaFrentz played for the [[United States men's national basketball team|US national team]] in the [[2002 FIBA World Championship]].<ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_2002.html 2002 USA Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714000000/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_2002.html |date=July 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe Celtics acquired LaFrentz from the Dallas Mavericks, along with [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch|Jiri Welsch]] and a first-round draft choice, in exchange for [[Tony Delk]] and [[Antoine Walker]] on October 20, 2003.

[[Basketball|basketball]] [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and [[Center (basketball)|center]] who played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] from 1998 to 2009. Born and raised in [[Iowa]], LaFrentz attended [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] and was drafted in [[1998 NBA Draft|1998]] by the [[Denver Nuggets]]. He was known for his perimeter shooting and his [[Block (basketball)|shot blocking]] abilities. LaFrentz is currently {{when?|date=March 2020}} an assistant basketball coach at [[Decorah High School]] in [[Decorah, Iowa]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===High school===\n\nRaef LaFrentz attended MFL MarMac High School located in [[Monona, Iowa]]. His father, Ron, was an assistant coach on LaFrentz's high school team. He was named to the [[USA Today]] All-USA 1st Team in 1994 and was a high school [[McDonald's All-American]].\n\nDuring the summer before his freshman year at the [[University of Kansas]], LaFrentz was selected to the 1994 U.S. Olympic Festival North Team and averaged 11.8 ppg. and 6.8 rpg.\n\n===College===\n\nLaFrentz played basketball at the [[University of Kansas]], finishing in 1998. He played with [[Paul Pierce]] while at Kansas. He was a four-year starter and an All-American in his junior and senior seasons. He joined [[Tim Duncan]] and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as the only players in the 1990s to earn first team [[Associated Press|AP]] [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|All-America]] honors twice.\n\nCompiling career averages of 15.8 ppg. and 9.1 rpg., while shooting 55.5 percent from the floor overall, he concluded his career ranked second all-time at Kansas in points with 2,066 and rebounds with 1,186, and left trailing only [[Danny Manning]] in both categories.\n\nAccumulating a record of 123\u201317 (87.9 winning percentage) over his four seasons, he was part of a senior class that won more games over a four-year period than any class in KU history.\n\nNamed by the A.P. in 1997 and 1998 the Big 12 Conference Player of the Year, he was also tabbed All-Big 12 Conference first team by both the media and coaches his final two seasons.\n\nLaFrentz became the first KU player in 27 years to average a double-double over an entire season when he posted 19.8 ppg. and 11.4 rpg. averages as a senior in 1997-98, leading the Jayhawks to a 35\u20134 record.\n\n===NBA===\n\nThe third overall pick by the [[Denver Nuggets]] in the [[1998 NBA Draft]], LaFrentz averaged 13.8 ppg., 7.6 rpg. and 1.4 bpg. but played in just 12 games as a rookie and missed the majority of the season after suffering a torn ACL in his left knee against Dallas on February 25, 1999. Successfully returning from the torn ACL to start 80 of his 81 appearances in 1999\u20132000, he averaged 12.4 ppg., an NBA 25th best 7.9 rpg. and ranked eighth in the NBA in blocked shots, averaging 2.2 bpg. LaFrentz also played in the 2000 [[NBA All-Star Weekend]]. He played on the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge]] Sophomore Roster. It was the first ever Sophomore team to play in the rookie challenge. It was there at [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] that LaFrentz was on the receiving end of [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]]' legendary \"elbow pass\". LaFrentz was unable to score on the play due to being fouled. In his third year (2000\u201301), he started 74 of the 78 games he played in and averaged 12.9 ppg., while ranking seventh in the league in blocks at 2.6 bpg., tied for 25th in rebounding with a 7.8 rpg. average, and tied for 27th in field goal percentage (career high .477).\n\nLaFrentz was traded by the Nuggets with [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Avery Johnson]], and [[Tariq Abdul-Wahad]] to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for [[Juwan Howard]], [[Donnell Harvey]], [[Tim Hardaway]] and a [[2002 NBA Draft|2002 first-round]] pick on February 21, 2002. He finished the 2001\u201302 season second in the NBA in blocked shots per game.\n\nLaFrentz played for the [[United States men's national basketball team|US national team]] in the [[2002 FIBA World Championship]].<ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_2002.html 2002 USA Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714000000/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_2002.html |date=July 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe Celtics acquired LaFrentz from the Dallas Mavericks, along with [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch|Jiri Welsch]] and a first-round draft choice, in exchange for [[Tony Delk]] and [[Antoine Walker]] on October 20, 2003. On June 28, 2006, the Boston Celtics traded LaFrentz, guard [[Dan Dickau]], and the number seven pick in the 2006 NBA draft to the Portland Trail Blazers for center [[Theo Ratliff]] and guard [[Sebastian Telfair]].<ref>[http://www.sportsline.com/nba/players/playerpage/20612 Raef LaFrentz NBA Basketball at CBSSports.com]</ref>  The number 7 pick ([[Randy Foye]]) was later traded by the
