These empires were later replaced in the [[Iron Age]] by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian empires]]. Widely considered to be the [[cradle of civilization]], [[Mesopotamia]] brought significant cultural developments, including the oldest examples of writing. \n\nThe art of Mesopotamia rivalled [[Art of Ancient Egypt|that of Ancient Egypt]] as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western [[Eurasia]] from the 4th millennium BC until the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that, with some exceptions,<ref>Frankfort, 124-126</ref>  painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculptures were also painted. [[Cylinder seal]]s have survived in large numbers, many including complex and detailed scenes despite their small size. \n\nMesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.<ref>Frankfort, Chapters 2\u20135</ref> Favourite subjects include deities, alone or with worshippers, and animals in several types of scenes: repeated in rows,  single, fighting each other or a human, [[confronted animals]] by themselves or flanking a human or god in the [[Master of Animals]] motif, or a [[Tree of Life]].<ref>Convenient summaries of the typical motifs of cylinder seals in the main periods are found throughout in Teissier</ref>\n\nStone [[stela]]e, [[votive offering]]s, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374</ref> the fragmentary [[Stele of the Vultures]] is an early example of the inscribed type,<ref>Frankfort, 71\u201373</ref> and the Assyrian [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]] a large and well preserved late one.<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374; 167</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nOne fundamental intention of Mesopotamian art was to honour the gods and goddesses who ruled over different aspects of nature and important life events. The central place of worship was the ''[[ziggurat]]'', a stepped pyramid with stairs leading to an altar where worshipers would elevate themselves closer to the heavens. Much like the Egyptians, the Mesopotamians believed that their rulers had a direct link to their gods, and many artworks depict rulers shown in a glorified manner.\n\nAs in other ancient civilizations, for the, sculptures, mostly rather small, are the main type of artwork to survive. In the late period [[Assyrian sculpture]] for palaces was often very large.  Most of the Sumerian and Akkadian statues of figures are in a position of prayer. The main types of stone used are [[limestone]] and [[alabaster]].\n\n==Prehistoric Mesopotamia==\n[[File:Fertile crescent Neolithic B circa 7500 BC.jpg|thumb|Area of the [[Fertile Crescent]], circa 7500 BC, with main sites of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] period.

After the [[invention of agriculture]], farmers worked in the valley, but the community lived in the more easily fortifiable hills. Unlike in [[Ancient China|China]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], the villages had two economic orientations, downhill to the fields of grain and uphill into the mountains of [[Anatolia]] with their rich mines of gold and copper.

Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the [[Elam]]ite forces of [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin.

During the period Babylon became a great city, which was often the seat of the dominant power.

From around 879 BC the Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone or [[gypsum]] [[alabaster]], originally painted, for palaces. The precisely delineated reliefs concern royal affairs, chiefly hunting and war making. Predominance is given to animal forms, particularly horses and lions, which are magnificently represented in great detail. \n\nHuman figures are comparatively rigid and static but are also minutely detailed, as in triumphal scenes of sieges, battles, and individual combat. Among the best known Assyrian reliefs are the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' scenes in alabaster, and the [[Lachish reliefs]] showing a war campaign in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], both of which are of the 7th century BC, from Nineveh and now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref> Reliefs were also carved [[rock relief|into rock faces]], as at [[Shikaft-e Gulgul]], a style which the Persians continued.\n\nThe Assyrians produced relatively little sculpture in the round, with the partial exception of colossal human-headed ''[[lamassu]]'' guardian figures, with the bodies of lions or bulls, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and often also five legs, so that both views seem complete).  These marked fortified royal gateways, an architectural form common throughout Asia Minor.  A [[Assyrian statue (BM 124963)|single statue of a nude female is known]].  The Assyrian form of the [[winged genie]], winged spirits with bearded human heads seen in reliefs, influenced Ancient Greek art, which in its \"[[orientalizing period]]\" added various winged mythological beasts including the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[griffin]] and winged horses ([[Pegasus]]) and men ([[Talos]]).<ref>Frankfort, 205</ref>  Many carry the [[bucket and cone]].\n\nEven before dominating the region the Assyrians had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref>  At [[Nimrud]] the carved [[Nimrud ivories]] and bronze bowls were found that are decorated in the Assyrian style but were produced in several parts of the Near East including many by [[Phoenicia]]n and Aramaean artisans.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nHermitage Nimrud 5.jpg|Winged figure near a sacred tree; 9th century BC; from the palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] ([[Nimrud]], Iraq); [[Hermitage Museum]]\nOpenwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds MET DP110622.jpg|Openwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds; 9th\u20138th century BC; ivory; 12.7\u00d711.91\u00d71.09 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nBritishmuseumassyrianrelieftwohorsemennimrud.jpg|Relief with two Assyrian cavalrymen charging against enemies; circa 728 BC; gypsum; height: 129 cm, width: 183; [[British Museum]] (London)\nCylinder seal and modern impression- scorpion-man, deities, one on winged lion MET DP-13006-001 (cropped).jpg|Cylinder seal and with deities, on of them being on a winged lion; 8th\u20137th century BC; quartz, crypto-crystalline; 4.09 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFile:A glazed terracotta tile from Nimrud, Iraq, depicting a court scene, currently housed in the British Museum, London.jpg|Glazed terracotta tile from [[Nimrud]], with a court scene, British Museum\nTransport cedar Dur Sharrukin Louvre AO19890.jpg|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar; 713\u2013716 BC; height: 2.41 m, width: 38 cm; [[Louvre]]\nGenie benisseur (3565923284).jpg|Relief with a [[winged genie]] with [[bucket and cone]]; 713-706 BC; height: 3.3 m\nLion-shaped weight-Sb 2718-P5280901-gradient (cropped).jpg|[[Assyrian lion weights|Lion weight]]; 6th-4th century BC; bronze; height: 29.5 cm, [[Louvre]]\nAncient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations (1920) (14741970056).jpg|Assyrian ornaments and patterns, illustrated in a book from 1920\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-Babylonian period (626\u2013539 BC)===\n[[Image:Ishtar gate in Pergamon museum in Berlin..jpg|thumb|The [[reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]] of the Ishtar Gate in the [[Pergamon Museum]] ([[Berlin]])]]\n\nThe famous [[Ishtar Gate]], part of which is now reconstructed in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], was the main entrance into [[Babylon]], built in about 575 BC by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the king of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], who exiled the Jews; the empire lasted from 626 BC to 539 BC.  The walls surrounding the entrance way are decorated with rows of large relief animals in glazed brick, which has therefore retained its colours.  Lions, dragons and bulls are represented.  The gate was part of a much larger scheme for a processional way into the city, from which there are sections in many other museums.<ref>Frankfort, 203\u2013205</ref>  Large wooden gates throughout the period were strengthened and decorated with large horizontal metal bands, often decorated with reliefs, several of which have survived, such as the various [[Balawat Gates]].\n\nOther traditional types of art continued to be produced, and the Neo-Babylonians were very keen to stress their ancient heritage.  Many sophisticated and finely carved seals survive.  After Mesopotamia fell to the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], which had much simpler artistic traditions, Mesopotamian art was, with [[Ancient Greek art]], the main influence on the cosmopolitan Achaemenid style that emerged,<ref>Frankfort, 348-349</ref> and many ancient elements were retained in the area even in the [[Hellenistic art]] that succeeded the conquest of the region by [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nSeal Hero fighting two winged deamons-MBA Lyon E306-IMG 0086.jpg|Seal with a modern impression in which is depicted a hero fighting two female winged deamons; 8th\u20137th century BC; [[chalcedony]]; [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] (France)\nConical seal MET vsz1999 325 097.jpg|Conical seal; 7th\u20136th century BC; lapis lazuli; height: 2.7 cm, diameter: 2.1 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nPassing lion Babylon AO21118.jpg|Brick panel of a passing lion, from the ''[[Gate of Ishtar]]''; 605\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta; from Iraq; [[Louvre]]\nFile:20131205 Istanbul 056 (cropped).jpg|One of the [[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]] dragons from the ''Gate of Ishtar''; 604\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta, now [[Istanbul]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Jewellery==\n[[File:Necklace MET an33.35.47.jpg|thumb|Necklace; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and [[lapis lazuli]]; length: 22.5 cm; [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]], Iraq]]\nThe preferred jewellery designs used in [[Mesopotamia]] were natural and geometric motifs such as leaves, cones, spirals, and bunches of grapes.

A number of documents have been found that relate to the trade and production of jewellery from Sumerian sites. \n\nLater Mesopotamian jewellers and craftsmen employed metalworking techniques such as [[cloisonn\u00e9]], [[engraving]], granulation, and [[filigree]]. The large variety and size of necklaces, bracelets, anklets, pendants, and pins found may be due to the fact that jewellery was worn by both men and women, and perhaps even children.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nEarring MET DP104223.jpg|Pair of earrings; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nNecklace beads MET DP104225.jpg|Necklace beads; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and lapis lazuli; length: 54 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEarrings from Shulgi.JPG|Pair or earrings with cuneiform inscriptions, 2093\u20132046 BC; gold; [[Sulaymaniyah Museum]] ([[Sulaymaniyah]], Iraq)\nReconstructed sumerian headgear necklaces british museum.JPG|Sumerian necklaces and headgear discovered in the royal (and individual) graves of the Royal Cemetery at Ur, showing the way they may have been worn, in [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n==Collections==\n{{main|List of museums of ancient Near Eastern art}}\n[[File:Room 300-IMG 7644.JPG|thumb|350px|A room with Mesopotamian art, from the [[Louvre]]]] \nBy some margin, the most important collections are those of (in no particular order) the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum]] (Berlin, Germany), the [[British Museum]] (London), the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City), and the [[National Museum of Iraq]] (Baghdad).

These empires were later replaced in the [[Iron Age]] by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian empires]]. Widely considered to be the [[cradle of civilization]], [[Mesopotamia]] brought significant cultural developments, including the oldest examples of writing. \n\nThe art of Mesopotamia rivalled [[Art of Ancient Egypt|that of Ancient Egypt]] as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western [[Eurasia]] from the 4th millennium BC until the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that, with some exceptions,<ref>Frankfort, 124-126</ref>  painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculptures were also painted. [[Cylinder seal]]s have survived in large numbers, many including complex and detailed scenes despite their small size. \n\nMesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.<ref>Frankfort, Chapters 2\u20135</ref> Favourite subjects include deities, alone or with worshippers, and animals in several types of scenes: repeated in rows,  single, fighting each other or a human, [[confronted animals]] by themselves or flanking a human or god in the [[Master of Animals]] motif, or a [[Tree of Life]].<ref>Convenient summaries of the typical motifs of cylinder seals in the main periods are found throughout in Teissier</ref>\n\nStone [[stela]]e, [[votive offering]]s, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374</ref> the fragmentary [[Stele of the Vultures]] is an early example of the inscribed type,<ref>Frankfort, 71\u201373</ref> and the Assyrian [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]] a large and well preserved late one.<ref>Frankfort, 66\u201374; 167</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nOne fundamental intention of Mesopotamian art was to honour the gods and goddesses who ruled over different aspects of nature and important life events. The central place of worship was the ''[[ziggurat]]'', a stepped pyramid with stairs leading to an altar where worshipers would elevate themselves closer to the heavens. Much like the Egyptians, the Mesopotamians believed that their rulers had a direct link to their gods, and many artworks depict rulers shown in a glorified manner.\n\nAs in other ancient civilizations, for the, sculptures, mostly rather small, are the main type of artwork to survive. In the late period [[Assyrian sculpture]] for palaces was often very large.  Most of the Sumerian and Akkadian statues of figures are in a position of prayer. The main types of stone used are [[limestone]] and [[alabaster]].\n\n==Prehistoric Mesopotamia==\n[[File:Fertile crescent Neolithic B circa 7500 BC.jpg|thumb|Area of the [[Fertile Crescent]], circa 7500 BC, with main sites of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] period.

Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the [[Elam]]ite forces of [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin.

He is famous for his [[code of Hammurabi|law code]] and conquests, but he is also famous due to the large amount of records that exist from the period of his reign. During the period Babylon became a great city, which was often the seat of the dominant power.

This was generally not a period of the highest quality for cylinder seal images; at different times the inscription took prominence over the image, and the variety of scenes shown reduced, with the \"presentation scene\" of a king before a god, or an official before a seated king, becoming the norm at times.<ref>Frankfort, 102-126</ref>  Especially from the [[Kassite]] period several stone [[kudurru]] stelae survive, mostly taken up with inscriptions recording grants of land, boundary lines, and other official records, but often with figures and emblems of the gods or the king as well; a [[Land grant to Marduk-apla-iddina I by Meli-Shipak II|land grant by Meli-Shipak II]] is an example.<ref>Frankfort, 130</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Kudurru_Melishipak_Louvre_Sb23_n02.jpg|[[Kassite]] king [[Meli-Shipak II]] on his throne on a [[kudurru]]-Land grant to \u1e2aunnubat-Nanaya.

From around 879 BC the Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone or [[gypsum]] [[alabaster]], originally painted, for palaces. The precisely delineated reliefs concern royal affairs, chiefly hunting and war making. Predominance is given to animal forms, particularly horses and lions, which are magnificently represented in great detail. \n\nHuman figures are comparatively rigid and static but are also minutely detailed, as in triumphal scenes of sieges, battles, and individual combat. Among the best known Assyrian reliefs are the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' scenes in alabaster, and the [[Lachish reliefs]] showing a war campaign in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], both of which are of the 7th century BC, from Nineveh and now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref> Reliefs were also carved [[rock relief|into rock faces]], as at [[Shikaft-e Gulgul]], a style which the Persians continued.\n\nThe Assyrians produced relatively little sculpture in the round, with the partial exception of colossal human-headed ''[[lamassu]]'' guardian figures, with the bodies of lions or bulls, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and often also five legs, so that both views seem complete).  These marked fortified royal gateways, an architectural form common throughout Asia Minor.  A [[Assyrian statue (BM 124963)|single statue of a nude female is known]].  The Assyrian form of the [[winged genie]], winged spirits with bearded human heads seen in reliefs, influenced Ancient Greek art, which in its \"[[orientalizing period]]\" added various winged mythological beasts including the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[griffin]] and winged horses ([[Pegasus]]) and men ([[Talos]]).<ref>Frankfort, 205</ref>  Many carry the [[bucket and cone]].\n\nEven before dominating the region the Assyrians had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.<ref>Frankfort, 141\u2013193</ref>  At [[Nimrud]] the carved [[Nimrud ivories]] and bronze bowls were found that are decorated in the Assyrian style but were produced in several parts of the Near East including many by [[Phoenicia]]n and Aramaean artisans.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nHermitage Nimrud 5.jpg|Winged figure near a sacred tree; 9th century BC; from the palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] ([[Nimrud]], Iraq); [[Hermitage Museum]]\nOpenwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds MET DP110622.jpg|Openwork furniture plaque with a grazing oryx in a forest of fronds; 9th\u20138th century BC; ivory; 12.7\u00d711.91\u00d71.09 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nBritishmuseumassyrianrelieftwohorsemennimrud.jpg|Relief with two Assyrian cavalrymen charging against enemies; circa 728 BC; gypsum; height: 129 cm, width: 183; [[British Museum]] (London)\nCylinder seal and modern impression- scorpion-man, deities, one on winged lion MET DP-13006-001 (cropped).jpg|Cylinder seal and with deities, on of them being on a winged lion; 8th\u20137th century BC; quartz, crypto-crystalline; 4.09 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFile:A glazed terracotta tile from Nimrud, Iraq, depicting a court scene, currently housed in the British Museum, London.jpg|Glazed terracotta tile from [[Nimrud]], with a court scene, British Museum\nTransport cedar Dur Sharrukin Louvre AO19890.jpg|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar; 713\u2013716 BC; height: 2.41 m, width: 38 cm; [[Louvre]]\nGenie benisseur (3565923284).jpg|Relief with a [[winged genie]] with [[bucket and cone]]; 713-706 BC; height: 3.3 m\nLion-shaped weight-Sb 2718-P5280901-gradient (cropped).jpg|[[Assyrian lion weights|Lion weight]]; 6th-4th century BC; bronze; height: 29.5 cm, [[Louvre]]\nAncient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations (1920) (14741970056).jpg|Assyrian ornaments and patterns, illustrated in a book from 1920\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-Babylonian period (626\u2013539 BC)===\n[[Image:Ishtar gate in Pergamon museum in Berlin..jpg|thumb|The [[reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]] of the Ishtar Gate in the [[Pergamon Museum]] ([[Berlin]])]]\n\nThe famous [[Ishtar Gate]], part of which is now reconstructed in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], was the main entrance into [[Babylon]], built in about 575 BC by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the king of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], who exiled the Jews; the empire lasted from 626 BC to 539 BC.  The walls surrounding the entrance way are decorated with rows of large relief animals in glazed brick, which has therefore retained its colours.  Lions, dragons and bulls are represented.  The gate was part of a much larger scheme for a processional way into the city, from which there are sections in many other museums.<ref>Frankfort, 203\u2013205</ref>  Large wooden gates throughout the period were strengthened and decorated with large horizontal metal bands, often decorated with reliefs, several of which have survived, such as the various [[Balawat Gates]].\n\nOther traditional types of art continued to be produced, and the Neo-Babylonians were very keen to stress their ancient heritage.  Many sophisticated and finely carved seals survive.  After Mesopotamia fell to the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], which had much simpler artistic traditions, Mesopotamian art was, with [[Ancient Greek art]], the main influence on the cosmopolitan Achaemenid style that emerged,<ref>Frankfort, 348-349</ref> and many ancient elements were retained in the area even in the [[Hellenistic art]] that succeeded the conquest of the region by [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nSeal Hero fighting two winged deamons-MBA Lyon E306-IMG 0086.jpg|Seal with a modern impression in which is depicted a hero fighting two female winged deamons; 8th\u20137th century BC; [[chalcedony]]; [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] (France)\nConical seal MET vsz1999 325 097.jpg|Conical seal; 7th\u20136th century BC; lapis lazuli; height: 2.7 cm, diameter: 2.1 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nPassing lion Babylon AO21118.jpg|Brick panel of a passing lion, from the ''[[Gate of Ishtar]]''; 605\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta; from Iraq; [[Louvre]]\nFile:20131205 Istanbul 056 (cropped).jpg|One of the [[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]] dragons from the ''Gate of Ishtar''; 604\u2013562 BC; glazed terracotta, now [[Istanbul]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Jewellery==\n[[File:Necklace MET an33.35.47.jpg|thumb|Necklace; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and [[lapis lazuli]]; length: 22.5 cm; [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]], Iraq]]\nThe preferred jewellery designs used in [[Mesopotamia]] were natural and geometric motifs such as leaves, cones, spirals, and bunches of grapes. Sumerian and Akkadian jewellery was created from [[gold leaf|gold]] and silver leaf and set with many [[semiprecious stone]]s (mostly [[agate]], [[carnelian]], [[jasper]], [[lapis lazuli]] and [[chalcedony]]). A number of documents have been found that relate to the trade and production of jewellery from Sumerian sites. \n\nLater Mesopotamian jewellers and craftsmen employed metalworking techniques such as [[cloisonn\u00e9]], [[engraving]], granulation, and [[filigree]]. The large variety and size of necklaces, bracelets, anklets, pendants, and pins found may be due to the fact that jewellery was worn by both men and women, and perhaps even children.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nEarring MET DP104223.jpg|Pair of earrings; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nNecklace beads MET DP104225.jpg|Necklace beads; 2600\u20132500 BC; gold and lapis lazuli; length: 54 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEarrings from Shulgi.JPG|Pair or earrings with cuneiform inscriptions, 2093\u20132046 BC; gold; [[Sulaymaniyah Museum]] ([[Sulaymaniyah]], Iraq)\nReconstructed sumerian headgear necklaces british museum.JPG|Sumerian necklaces and headgear discovered in the royal (and individual) graves of the Royal Cemetery at Ur, showing the way they may have been worn, in [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n==Collections==\n{{main|List of museums of ancient Near Eastern art}}\n[[File:Room 300-IMG 7644.JPG|thumb|350px|A room with Mesopotamian art, from the [[Louvre]]]] \nBy some margin, the most important collections are those of (in no particular order) the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum]] (Berlin, Germany), the [[British Museum]] (London), the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City), and the [[National Museum of Iraq]] (Baghdad). The last was extensively looted after the breakdown of law and order following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but the most important objects have largely been recovered. \n\nSeveral other museums have good collections, especially of the very numerous cylinder seals. Syrian museums have important collections from sites in modern Syria. Other museums with important collections of Mesopotamian art are: the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute of Chicago]], [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]] ([[Istanbul]], Turkey), [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] ([[Leiden]], the Netherlands) and the [[Israel Museum]] ([[Jerusalem]]).
