They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state. From this idea emerged [[Yugoslavia]], which however did not include [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==History==\n{{Hatnote|'Slavic invasion of the Balkans' redirects here.}}\n===Early South Slavs===\n {{main article|Early Slavs|Sclaveni}}\n\nThe Proto-Slavic [[Urheimat|homeland]] is the area of Slavic settlement in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|pp=525\u2013526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=37}}</ref> None of the proposed homelands reaches the [[Volga River]] in the east, over the [[Dinaric Alps]] in the southwest or the [[Balkan Mountains]] in the south, or past [[Bohemia]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|p=526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=332}}</ref> Traditionally, scholars put it in the marshes of Ukraine, or alternatively between the [[Bug River|Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]];{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=25}} however, according to F. Curta, the homeland of the southern Slavs mentioned by 6th-century writers was just north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=56}} Little is known about the Slavs before the 5th century, when they began to spread out in all directions.\n\n[[Jordanes]], [[Procopius]] and other [[Late Antiquity|late Roman]] authors provide the probable earliest references to southern Slavs in the second half of the 6th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=71\u201373}} Procopius described the [[Sclaveni]] and [[Antes (people)|Antes]] as two barbarian peoples with the same institutions and customs since ancient times, not ruled by a single leader but living under democracy,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}</ref> while Pseudo-Maurice called them a numerous people, undisciplined, unorganized and leaderless, who did not allow enslavement and conquest, and resistant to hardship, bearing all weathers.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|pp=524\u2013525}} They were portrayed by Procopius as unusually tall and strong, of dark skin and \"reddish\" hair (neither [[blond]] nor [[black hair|black]]), leading a primitive life and living in scattered huts, often changing their residence.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} Procopius said they were [[henotheistic]], believing in the god of lightning ([[Perun]]), the ruler of all, to whom they sacrificed cattle.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} They went into battle on foot, charging straight at their enemy, armed with spears and small shields, but they did not wear armour.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}\n\nWhile archaeological evidence for a large-scale migration is lacking, most present-day historians claim that Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=26\u201341}} According to this dominant narrative, up until the late 560s their main activity across the Danube was raiding, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine colonies of ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=33}} What is today [[central Serbia]] was an important geo-strategical province, through which the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' crossed.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} This area was frequently intruded upon by [[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} From the Danube, the Slavs commenced raiding the Byzantine Empire on an annual basis from the 520s, spreading destruction, taking loot and herds of cattle, seizing prisoners and taking fortresses. Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work. They created the [[Glagolitic script]] and the first Slavic written language, [[Old Church Slavonic]], which they used to translate Biblical works.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

There are an estimated 35 million South Slavs and their descendants living worldwide. Among South Slavic ethnic groups that are also nations are the [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Slovenes]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats are the three constituent nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among South Slavic minorities or self-identifications are the [[Yugoslavs]] (former Yugoslavia), [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] (former Yugoslavia), [[Macedonian Muslims|Torbeshi]] (North Macedonia), [[Pomaks]] (Bulgaria, Greece) and [[Gorani people|Gorani]] (Kosovo). The Catholic [[Bunjevci]] and [[\u0160okci]], concentrated in [[Vojvodina|northern Serbia]] and eastern Croatia, are divided between Croat and local identities. There are also smaller communities of West and East Slavic peoples in northern Serbia.\n\n;Countries\nThere are seven countries in which South Slavs are the main population:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}</ref>\n*{{BUL}} (85.0% [[Bulgarians]])\n*{{SRB}} (83.3% [[Serbs]], 2.3% [[Bosniaks of Serbia|Bosniaks]], 0.8% [[Croats of Serbia|Croats]], 0.5% [[Montenegrins of Serbia|Montenegrins]], 0.3% [[Macedonians in Serbia|Macedonians]], 0.3% [[Bulgarians in Serbia|Bulgarians]])\n*{{CRO}} (90.4% [[Croats]], 4.4% [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], 0.9% [[Bosniaks of Croatia|Bosniaks]], 0.2% [[Slovenes of Croatia|Slovenes]], 0.1% [[Montenegrins of Croatia|Montenegrins]], 0.1% [[Macedonians of Croatia|Macedonians]])\n*{{BIH}} (50.1% [[Bosniaks]], 30.8% [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]], 15.4% [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]])<ref>{{cite book|title=Sarajevo, juni 2016.

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state. From this idea emerged [[Yugoslavia]], which however did not include [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==History==\n{{Hatnote|'Slavic invasion of the Balkans' redirects here.}}\n===Early South Slavs===\n {{main article|Early Slavs|Sclaveni}}\n\nThe Proto-Slavic [[Urheimat|homeland]] is the area of Slavic settlement in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|pp=525\u2013526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=37}}</ref> None of the proposed homelands reaches the [[Volga River]] in the east, over the [[Dinaric Alps]] in the southwest or the [[Balkan Mountains]] in the south, or past [[Bohemia]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|p=526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=332}}</ref> Traditionally, scholars put it in the marshes of Ukraine, or alternatively between the [[Bug River|Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]];{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=25}} however, according to F. Curta, the homeland of the southern Slavs mentioned by 6th-century writers was just north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=56}} Little is known about the Slavs before the 5th century, when they began to spread out in all directions.\n\n[[Jordanes]], [[Procopius]] and other [[Late Antiquity|late Roman]] authors provide the probable earliest references to southern Slavs in the second half of the 6th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=71\u201373}} Procopius described the [[Sclaveni]] and [[Antes (people)|Antes]] as two barbarian peoples with the same institutions and customs since ancient times, not ruled by a single leader but living under democracy,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}</ref> while Pseudo-Maurice called them a numerous people, undisciplined, unorganized and leaderless, who did not allow enslavement and conquest, and resistant to hardship, bearing all weathers.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|pp=524\u2013525}} They were portrayed by Procopius as unusually tall and strong, of dark skin and \"reddish\" hair (neither [[blond]] nor [[black hair|black]]), leading a primitive life and living in scattered huts, often changing their residence.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} Procopius said they were [[henotheistic]], believing in the god of lightning ([[Perun]]), the ruler of all, to whom they sacrificed cattle.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} They went into battle on foot, charging straight at their enemy, armed with spears and small shields, but they did not wear armour.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}\n\nWhile archaeological evidence for a large-scale migration is lacking, most present-day historians claim that Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=26\u201341}} According to this dominant narrative, up until the late 560s their main activity across the Danube was raiding, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine colonies of ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=33}} What is today [[central Serbia]] was an important geo-strategical province, through which the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' crossed.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} This area was frequently intruded upon by [[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} From the Danube, the Slavs commenced raiding the Byzantine Empire on an annual basis from the 520s, spreading destruction, taking loot and herds of cattle, seizing prisoners and taking fortresses. Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work. They created the [[Glagolitic script]] and the first Slavic written language, [[Old Church Slavonic]], which they used to translate Biblical works. At the time, the West and South Slavs still spoke a similar language.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period.

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

Despite the plummeting oil prices in the world market, the regime argues Al-Sholi, could attract foreign investment and still refill its coffers. On the other hand, although the Algerians showed an impressive energy and perseverance in mobilisation, \"it would be a mistake to expect hundreds of thousands of people to show up to protest indefinitely.\"\n\n{{quote|Some popular organization has to emerge now and present a roadmap that the masses could rally around, giving them a chance to catch their breath. The ruling regime is desperate to draw a red line against the protests and is intent on engaging in mass arrests. Fortunately, Algerians have significant industrial leverage to wield against their ruling class.

Despite the plummeting oil prices in the world market, the regime argues Al-Sholi, could attract foreign investment and still refill its coffers. On the other hand, although the Algerians showed an impressive energy and perseverance in mobilisation, \"it would be a mistake to expect hundreds of thousands of people to show up to protest indefinitely.\"\n\n{{quote|Some popular organization has to emerge now and present a roadmap that the masses could rally around, giving them a chance to catch their breath. The ruling regime is desperate to draw a red line against the protests and is intent on engaging in mass arrests. Fortunately, Algerians have significant industrial leverage to wield against their ruling class.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the city had a total population of 45,877 people. Farmington (and surrounding San Juan County) makes up one of the four Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in New Mexico. The [[U.S. Census Bureau]]'s population estimate in 2018 for Farmington was 44,788.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nFarmington is located at the junction of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]], the [[Animas River]], and the La Plata River, and is located on the [[Colorado Plateau]]. Farmington is the largest city of San Juan County, one of the geographically largest counties in the United States covering {{convert|5538|sqmi}}. The [[county seat]] and the other city in San Juan County is [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]]. Farmington serves as the commercial hub for most of northwestern New Mexico and the [[Four Corners]] region of four states. Farmington lies at or near the junction of three important highways: [[U.S. Highway 550]], [[U.S. Highway 64]], and New Mexico Highway 371.\n\nIt is on the [[Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway (New Mexico)|Trails of the Ancients Byway]], one of the designated [[New Mexico Scenic Byways]].<ref name=\"NM TOA\">[http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ Trail of the Ancients.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821002106/http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ |date=August 21, 2014 }} New Mexico Tourism Department.

Major coal mines are the Navajo and San Juan mines, operated by BHP Billiton {{convert|15|to|19|mi|km}} southwest of Farmington. The coal mined from the Navajo and San Juan mines is used entirely for fuel for the nearby [[Four Corners Generating Station]] and San Juan Power Plant to produce [[electric power]].\n\n==History==\nThe area that is now Farmington was settled by [[Ancestral Pueblo people]] in the 7th Century.

In 1868, the [[Navajo Nation]] was created, taking up the western half of [[San Juan County, New Mexico|San Juan County]]. Six years later, the U.S. government offered territory in the rest of San Juan County to the [[Jicarilla Apache]] but they refused. As a result, the area was opened for settlement and a number of settlers moved into the region from Southern Colorado.<ref name=Smith /> The area was originally known as \"Junction City\" because of the access to the three rivers.<ref name=Hudnall />\n\nIn 1901 the town was incorporated and named Farmington with a population of 548.<ref name=Smith /> By September 19, 1905, the railroad was finished connecting Farmington to [[Durango, Colorado]], expanding economic and settlement opportunities. It was unusual in that it was a standard gauge railroad that connected to the Denver & Rio Grande Western narrow gauge lines of southwestern Colorado.  The railroad converted the line to narrow gauge in 1923.  The line was abandoned in 1968 and the line was dismantled to Durango in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionroad.net/DRGW-Relics/DRGW-Relics-FMN.htm|title=Farmington Branch|author=|date=|website=www.actionroad.net|access-date=April 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703041116/http://www.actionroad.net/DRGW-Relics/DRGW-Relics-FMN.htm|archive-date=July 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition, in the 1920s there was significant investment in natural gas and oil in the area, although actual production remained low until the 1950s.

In 1868, the [[Navajo Nation]] was created, taking up the western half of [[San Juan County, New Mexico|San Juan County]]. Six years later, the U.S. government offered territory in the rest of San Juan County to the [[Jicarilla Apache]] but they refused. As a result, the area was opened for settlement and a number of settlers moved into the region from Southern Colorado.<ref name=Smith /> The area was originally known as \"Junction City\" because of the access to the three rivers.<ref name=Hudnall />\n\nIn 1901 the town was incorporated and named Farmington with a population of 548.<ref name=Smith /> By September 19, 1905, the railroad was finished connecting Farmington to [[Durango, Colorado]], expanding economic and settlement opportunities. It was unusual in that it was a standard gauge railroad that connected to the Denver & Rio Grande Western narrow gauge lines of southwestern Colorado.  The railroad converted the line to narrow gauge in 1923.

{"title_page": "Belt (mechanical)", "text_new": "{{Short description|Method of connecting two rotating shafts or pulleys}}\n[[File:Flachriemen.png|thumb|Flat belt]]\n[[File:HagleyBeltDrive01.jpg|thumb|Flat belt drive in the machine shop at the [[Hagley Museum and Library|Hagley Museum]]]]\nA '''belt''' is a loop of flexible material used to link two or more rotating [[Drive shaft|shafts]] mechanically, most often parallel. Belts may be used as a source of motion, to [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmit power]] efficiently or to track relative movement. Belts are looped over [[pulley]]s and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel.\n\nIn a two pulley system, the belt can either drive the pulleys normally in one direction (the same if on parallel shafts), or the belt may be crossed, so that the direction of the driven shaft is reversed (the opposite direction to the driver if on parallel shafts). As a source of motion, a [[conveyor belt]] is one application where the belt is adapted to carry a load continuously between two points. The belt drive can also be used to change the speed of rotation, either up or down, by using different sized pulleys.\n\n==History==\nThe mechanical belt drive, using a [[pulley]] machine, was first mentioned in the text the ''Dictionary of Local Expressions'' by the Han Dynasty philosopher, poet, and politician [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53\u201318 BC) in 15 BC, used for a [[quilling]] machine that wound [[silk]] fibers on to [[bobbin]]s for [[Weaving|weavers']] shuttles.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 207208\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 207\u2013208.</ref> The belt drive is an essential component to the invention of the [[spinning wheel]].<ref name=\"Needham 1986\">Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 108.</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 160163\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 160\u2013163.</ref> The belt drive was not only used in textile technologies, it was also applied to hydraulic-powered bellows dated from the 1st century AD.<ref name=\"Needham 1986\"/>\n\n== Power transmission ==\nBelts are the cheapest utility for power transmission between shafts that may not be axially aligned.  Power transmission is achieved by purposely designed belts and pulleys. The variety of power transmission needs that can be met by a belt-drive transmission system are numerous, and this has led to many variations on the theme. Belt drives run smoothly and with little noise, and provide shock absorption for motors, loads, and bearings when the force and power needed changes.  A drawback to belt drives is that they transmit less power than gears or chain drives.  However, improvements in belt engineering allow use of belts in systems that only formerly allowed chain drives or gears.\n\nPower transmitted between a belt and a pulley is expressed as the product of difference of tension and belt velocity:\n\n:<math>P = (T_1 - T_2)v,</math>\n\nwhere, ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt respectively. They are related as\n\n:<math>\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = e^{\\mu\\alpha},</math>\n\nwhere, \u03bc is the coefficient of friction, and \u03b1 is the angle (in radians) subtended by contact surface at the centre of the pulley.\n\n===Pros and cons===\nBelt drives are simple, inexpensive, and do not require axially aligned shafts.  They help protect machinery from overload and jam, and damp and isolate noise and vibration.  Load fluctuations are shock-absorbed (cushioned).  They need no lubrication and minimal maintenance.  They have high efficiency (90\u201398%, usually 95%), high tolerance for misalignment, and are of relatively low cost if the shafts are far apart.  Clutch action is activated by releasing belt tension.  Different speeds can be obtained by stepped or tapered pulleys.\n\nThe angular-velocity ratio may not be constant or equal to that of the pulley diameters, due to slip and stretch. However, this problem has been largely solved by the use of toothed belts. Working temperatures range from - 35\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C.  Adjustment of center distance or addition of an idler pulley is crucial to compensate for wear and stretch.\n\n=== Flat belts ===\n[[File:Transmissionsriemen.jpg|thumb|right|The drive belt: used to transfer power from the engine's flywheel. Here shown driving a [[threshing machine]].]]\n[[File:Wide flat belt.JPG|thumb|A small section of a wide flat belt made of layers of leather with the fastener on one end, shown in an exhibit at the [[Suffolk Mills]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]]]\nFlat belts were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in [[line shaft]]ing to transmit power in factories.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" >By Rhys Jenkins, Newcomen Society, (1971). ''Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times'', Ayer Publishing. Page 34, {{ISBN|0-8369-2167-4}}.</ref> They were also used in countless [[agriculture|farming]], [[mining]], and [[logging]] applications, such as [[bucksaw]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[threshing machine|threshers]], [[silo|silo blowers]], [[conveyor system|conveyors]] for filling [[corn crib]]s or [[hayloft]]s, [[baler]]s, water [[pump]]s (for [[water well|wells]], mines, or [[swamp]]y farm fields), and [[electrical generator]]s. Flat belts are still used today, although not nearly as much as in the line-shaft era. The flat belt is a simple system of power transmission that was well suited for its day. It can deliver high power at high speeds&nbsp;(373&nbsp;kW at 51&nbsp;m/s), in cases of wide belts and large pulleys. But these wide-belt-large-pulley drives are bulky, consuming lots of space while requiring high tension, leading to high loads, and are poorly suited to close-centers applications, so V-belts have mainly replaced flat belts for short-distance power transmission; and longer-distance power transmission is typically no longer done with belts at all. For example, factory machines now tend to have individual electric motors.\n\nBecause flat belts tend to climb towards the higher side of the pulley, pulleys were made with a slightly convex or \"crowned\" surface (rather than flat) to allow the belt to self-center as it runs. Flat belts also tend to slip on the pulley face when heavy loads are applied, and many proprietary [[#Belt dressing|belt dressings]] were available that could be applied to the belts to increase friction, and so power transmission.\n\nFlat belts were traditionally made of leather or fabric. Today most are made of rubber or synthetic polymers. Grip of leather belts is often better if they are assembled with the hair side (outer side) of the leather against the pulley, although some belts are instead given a half-twist before joining the ends (forming a [[M\u00f6bius strip]]), so that wear can be evenly distributed on both sides of the belt. Belts ends are joined by lacing the ends together with leather thonging (the oldest of the methods),<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.farmcollector.com/Looking-Back/How-To-Lace-A-Flat-Belt.aspx\n | title = How to lace a flat belt\n | author = James N.

Flat belts were traditionally jointed, and still usually are, but they can also be made with endless construction.\n\n=== Rope drives ===\nIn the mid 19th century, British millwrights discovered that multi-grooved pulleys connected by [[rope]]s outperformed flat pulleys connected by leather belts.  [[Wire rope]]s were occasionally used, but [[cotton]], [[hemp]], [[Manila rope|manila hemp]] and [[flax]] rope saw the widest use.  Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a [[Helix|helical]] path before being returned to its starting position by an [[idler pulley]] that also served to maintain the tension on the rope.  Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove drive pulley to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.\n\nIn general, as with flat belts, rope drives were used for connections from [[Stationary steam engine|stationary engines]] to the [[jack shaft]]s and [[line shaft]]s of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery.  Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances.  Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the \"flying rope\", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.<ref>Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission] [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219\u2013224.</ref><ref>John J.

Note:  This journal is the house organ of the Dodge Manufacturing Company and is mostly devoted rope-power systems.</ref>\n\n=== Round belts ===\nRound belts are a circular cross section belt designed to run in a pulley with a 60 degree V-groove. Round grooves are only suitable for idler pulleys that guide the belt, or when (soft) O-ring type belts are used. The V-groove transmits torque through a wedging action, thus increasing friction. Nevertheless, round belts are for use in relatively low [[torque]] situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of [[polyurethane]]). Early [[sewing machine]]s utilized a leather belt, joined either by a metal staple or glued, to great effect.\n\n=== Spring belts ===\n[[File:Rew3k04-002 spring belt transmission.jpg|thumb|A two-stage transmission using spring belts on a toy vehicle]]\nSpring belts are similar to rope or round belts but consist of a long steel helical spring. They are commonly found on toy or small model engines, typically steam engines driving other toys or models or providing a transmission between the crankshaft and other parts of a vehicle. The main advantage over rubber or other elastic belts is that they last much longer under poorly controlled operating conditions. The distance between the pulleys is also less critical. Their main disadvantage is that slippage is more likely due to the lower coefficient of friction. The ends of a spring belt can be joined either by bending the last turn of the helix at each end by 90 degrees to form hooks, or by reducing the diameter of the last few turns at one end so that it \"screws\" into the other end.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|V belts}} ===<!-- Other articles link here -->\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Belts on a [[Yanmar 2GM20]] marine [[diesel engine]]]]\n[[File:Multiple-V-belt drive 001.jpg|thumb|A multiple-V-belt drive on an [[air compressor]]]]\nV belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) solved the slippage and alignment problem. It is now the basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly [[trapezoid]]al (hence the name \"V\"). The \"V\" shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the [[pulley]] (or sheave), with the result that the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases\u2014the greater the load, the greater the wedging action\u2014improving [[torque]] transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios.  The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys.  Optimal speed range is {{convert|1000|\u2013|7000|ft/min|abbr=on}}. V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.\n\nFor high-power requirements, two or more V-belts can be joined side-by-side in an arrangement called a multi-V, running on matching multi-groove sheaves. This is known as a multiple-V-belt drive (or sometimes a \"classical V-belt drive\").\n\nV-belts may be homogeneously rubber or polymer throughout, or there may be fibers embedded in the rubber or polymer for strength and reinforcement. The fibers may be of textile materials such as cotton, [[polyamide]] (such as [[Nylon]]) or polyester or, for greatest strength, of steel or [[aramid]] (such as [[Technora]], [[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]]).\n\nWhen an endless belt does not fit the need, jointed and link V-belts may be employed. Most models offer the same power and speed ratings as equivalently-sized endless belts and do not require special pulleys to operate. A link v-belt is a number of polyurethane/polyester composite links held together, either by themselves, such as Fenner Drives' PowerTwist, or Nu-T-Link (with metal studs). These provide easy installation and superior environmental resistance compared to rubber belts and are length-adjustable by disassembling and removing links when needed.\n\n====V-belt history====\nTrade journal coverage of V-belts in automobiles from 1916 mentioned leather as the belt material,<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p324\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=Radiator fans and their design |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA324#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> and mentioned that the V angle was not yet well standardized.<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p322\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=S.A.E. divisions exhibit activity |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=322 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA322#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> The endless rubber V-belt was developed in 1917 by John Gates of the [[Charles Gates, Jr.|Gates Rubber Company]]. Multiple-V-belt drive was first arranged a few years later by Walter Geist of the [[Allis-Chalmers]] corporation, who was inspired to replace the single rope of multi-groove-sheave [[#Rope drives|rope drives]] with multiple V-belts running parallel. Geist filed for a patent in 1925, and Allis-Chalmers began marketing the drive under the \"Texrope\" brand; the patent was granted in 1928 ({{US Patent|1662511}}). The \"Texrope\" brand still exists, although it has changed ownership and no longer refers to multiple-V-belt drive alone.\n\n=== Multi-groove belts ===\nA multi-groove, V-Ribbed, or polygroove belt<ref>DIN 7867.</ref> is made up of usually between 3 and 24 \"V\" shaped sections alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for the same drive surface, thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in service. Belts are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56&nbsp;mm is commonly used for automotive applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gates.com/~/media/files/gates/industrial/power-transmission/chart/gatescorporationbeltidchart.pdf|title=Gates Belt I.D. Chart}}</ref>\n\nA further advantage of the polygroove belt that makes them popular is that they can run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a single idler pulley for tensioning, a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\">{{cite book\n  |title=Automotive Handbook\n  |publisher=[[Robert Bosch GmbH]]\n  |year=1993\n  |page=304\n  |edition=3rd\n  |isbn=0-8376-0330-7\n  |ref=Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed\n}}</ref>\n\nAny V-belt's ability to drive pulleys depends on wrapping the belt around a sufficient angle of the pulley to provide grip. Where a single-V-belt is limited to a simple convex shape, it can adequately wrap at most three or possibly four pulleys, so can drive at most three accessories. Where more must be driven, such as for modern cars with power steering and air conditioning, multiple belts are required. As the polygroove belt can be bent into concave paths by external idlers, it can wrap any number of driven pulleys, limited only by the power capacity of the belt.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\" />\n\nThis ability to bend the belt at the designer's whim allows it to take a complex or \"[[serpentine belt|serpentine]]\" path. This can assist the design of a compact engine layout, where the accessories are mounted more closely to the engine block and without the need to provide movable tensioning adjustments. The entire belt may be tensioned by a single idler pulley.\n\n=== Ribbed belt ===\nA ribbed belt is a power transmission belt featuring lengthwise grooves. It operates from contact between the ribs of the belt and the grooves in the pulley. Its single-piece structure is reported to offer an even distribution of tension across the width of the pulley where the belt is in contact, a power range up to 600&nbsp;kW, a high speed ratio, serpentine drives (possibility to drive off the back of the belt), long life, stability and homogeneity of the drive tension, and reduced vibration. The ribbed belt may be fitted on various applications: compressors, fitness bikes, agricultural machinery, food mixers, washing machines, lawn mowers, etc.\n\n===Film belts===\nThough often grouped with flat belts, they are actually a different kind.  They consist of a very thin belt (0.5\u201315 millimeters or 100\u20134000 micrometres) strip of plastic and occasionally rubber.  They are generally intended for low-power (less than 10 watts), high-speed uses, allowing high efficiency (up to 98%) and long life.  These are seen in business machines, printers, tape recorders, and other light-duty operations.\n\n=== Timing belts ===\n[[File:Timing belt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Timing belt]]\n[[File:F8hub.jpg|thumb|Belt-drive cog on a [[belt-driven bicycle]]]]\n[[Toothed belt|Timing belt]]s (also known as '''toothed''', '''notch''', '''cog''', or '''synchronous''' belts) are a ''positive'' transfer belt and can track relative movement. These belts have teeth that fit into a matching toothed pulley. When correctly tensioned, they have no slippage, run at constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used instead of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.  [[Camshaft]]s of automobiles, miniature timing systems, and [[stepper motor]]s often utilize these belts.  Timing belts need the least tension of all belts and are among the most efficient. They can bear up to {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} at speeds of {{convert|16,000|ft/min|abbr=on}}.\n\nTiming belts with a helical offset tooth design are available.  The helical offset tooth design forms a chevron pattern and causes the teeth to engage progressively.  The chevron pattern design is self-aligning and does not make the noise that some timing belts make at certain speeds, and is more efficient at transferring power (up to 98%).\n\nDisadvantages include a relatively high purchase cost, the need for specially fabricated toothed pulleys, less protection from overloading, jamming, and vibration due to their continuous tension cords, the lack of clutch action (only possible with friction-drive belts), and the fixed lengths, which do not allow length adjustment (unlike link V-belts or chains).\n\n=== Specialty belts ===\nBelts normally transmit power on the tension side of the loop.  However, designs for [[continuously variable transmission]]s exist that use belts that are a series of solid metal blocks, linked together as in a chain, transmitting power on the compression side of the loop.\n\n===Rolling roads===\nBelts used for [[Dynamometer#Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)|rolling roadsl\n]] for wind tunnelss can be capable of {{convert|250|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arc.pininfarina.it/english/news.html |title=Pininfarina Aerodynamic and Aeroacoustic Research Center |publisher=Arc.pininfarina.it |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Standards for use==\n\nThe open belt drive has parallel shafts rotating in the same direction, whereas the cross-belt drive also bears parallel shafts but rotate in opposite direction.  The former is far more common, and the latter not appropriate for timing and standard V-belts unless there is a twist between each pulley so that the pulleys only contact the same belt surface. Nonparallel shafts can be connected if the belt's center line is aligned with the center plane of the pulley.  Industrial belts are usually reinforced rubber but sometimes leather types.  Non-leather, non-reinforced belts can only be used in light applications.\n\nThe pitch line is the line between the inner and outer surfaces that is neither subject to tension (like the outer surface) nor compression (like the inner).  It is midway through the surfaces in film and flat belts and dependent on cross-sectional shape and size in timing and V-belts. [[standard reference pitch diameter]] can be estimated by taking average of gear teeth tips diameter and gear teeth base diameter. The angular speed is inversely proportional to size, so the larger the one wheel, the less angular velocity, and vice versa.  Actual pulley speeds tend to be 0.5\u20131% less than generally calculated because of belt slip and stretch. In timing belts, the inverse ratio teeth of the belt contributes to the exact measurement.\nThe speed of the belt is:\n\nSpeed = Circumference based on [[Standard reference pitch diameter|pitch diameter]] \u00d7 angular speed in rpm\n\n===Selection criteria===\nBelt drives are built under the following required conditions: speeds of and power transmitted between drive and driven unit; suitable distance between shafts; and appropriate operating conditions. The equation for power is\n\n:power [kW] = ([[torque]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[newton-meter|N\u00b7m]]]) \u00d7 ([[rotational speed]] [rev/[[minute|min]]]) \u00d7 (2\u03c0 radians) / (60 [[second|s]] \u00d7 1000 W).\n\nFactors of power adjustment include speed ratio; shaft distance (long or short); type of drive unit (electric motor, internal combustion engine); service environment (oily, wet, dusty); driven unit loads (jerky, shock, reversed); and pulley-belt arrangement (open, crossed, turned).  These are found in engineering handbooks and manufacturer's literature. When corrected, the power is compared to rated powers of the standard belt cross-sections at particular belt speeds to find a number of arrays that perform best. Now the pulley diameters are chosen. It is generally either large diameters or large cross-section that are chosen, since, as stated earlier, larger belts transmit this same power at low belt speeds as smaller belts do at high speeds. To keep the driving part at its smallest, minimal-diameter pulleys are desired. Minimum pulley diameters are limited by the elongation of the belt's outer fibers as the belt wraps around the pulleys. Small pulleys increase this elongation, greatly reducing belt life. Minimal pulley diameters are often listed with each cross-section and speed, or listed separately by belt cross-section. After the cheapest diameters and belt section are chosen, the belt length is computed. If endless belts are used, the desired shaft spacing may need adjusting to accommodate standard-length belts. It is often more economical to use two or more juxtaposed V-belts, rather than one larger belt.\n\nIn large speed ratios or small central distances, the angle of contact between the belt and pulley may be less than 180\u00b0. If this is the case, the drive power must be further increased, according to manufacturer's tables, and the selection process repeated. This is because power capacities are based on the standard of a 180\u00b0 contact angle. Smaller contact angles mean less area for the belt to obtain traction, and thus the belt carries less power.\n\n===Belt friction===\n{{main|Belt friction}}\nBelt drives depend on [[friction]] to operate, but excessive friction wastes energy and rapidly wears the belt. Factors that affect belt friction include belt tension, contact angle, and the materials used to make the belt and pulleys.\n\n===Belt tension===\nPower transmission is a function of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads.  Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.\n\n===Belt wear===\nFatigue, more so than abrasion, is the culprit for most belt problems. This wear is caused by stress from rolling around the pulleys.  High belt tension; excessive slippage; adverse environmental conditions; and belt overloads caused by shock, vibration, or belt slapping all contribute to belt fatigue.\n\n===Belt vibration===\n[[Vibration]] signatures are widely used for studying belt drive malfunctions. Some of the common malfunctions or faults include the effects of belt [[Tension (physics)|tension]], speed, [[sheave]] [[Eccentricity (mechanics)|eccentricity]] and misalignment conditions. The effect of sheave Eccentricity on vibration signatures of the belt drive is quite significant. Although, vibration magnitude is not necessarily increased by this it will create strong amplitude modulation. When the top section of a belt is in [[Resonance energy transfer|resonance]], the vibrations of the machine is increased. However, an increase in the machine vibration is not significant when only the bottom section of the belt is in resonance. The vibration spectrum has the tendency to move to higher frequencies as the tension force of the belt is increased.\n\n===Belt dressing===\nBelt slippage can be addressed in several ways. Belt replacement is an obvious solution, and eventually the mandatory one (because no belt lasts forever). Often, though, before the replacement option is executed, retensioning (via pulley centerline adjustment) or dressing (with any of various coatings) may be successful to extend the belt's lifespan and postpone replacement. Belt dressings are typically liquids that are poured, brushed, dripped, or sprayed onto the belt surface and allowed to spread around; they are meant to recondition the belt's driving surfaces and increase friction between the belt and the pulleys. Some belt dressings are dark and sticky, resembling [[tar]] or [[syrup]]; some are thin and clear, resembling [[white spirit|mineral spirits]]. Some are sold to the public in [[aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] at auto parts stores; others are sold in drums only to industrial users.\n\n===Specifications===\nTo fully specify a belt, the material, length, and cross-section size and shape are required. Timing belts, in addition, require that the size of the teeth be given.\nThe length of the belt is the sum of the central length of the system on both sides, half the circumference of both pulleys, and the square of the sum (if crossed) or the difference (if open) of the radii. Thus, when dividing by the central distance, it can be visualized as the central distance times the height that gives the same squared value of the radius difference on, of course, both sides.  When adding to the length of either side, the length of the belt increases, in a similar manner to the Pythagorean theorem.  One important concept to remember is that as D<sub>1</sub> gets closer to D<sub>2</sub> there is less of a distance (and therefore less addition of length) until its approaches zero.\n\nOn the other hand, in a crossed belt drive the ''sum'' rather than the difference of radii is the basis for computation for length.  So the wider the small drive increases, the belt length is higher.\n\n==V-belt profiles==\n[[File:BeltProfiles.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[File:V-belt angle.jpg|thumb|right|v-belt angle, XPZ & SPZ profile]]\nMetric v-belt profiles:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Belts may be used as a source of motion, to [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmit power]] efficiently or to track relative movement. Belts are looped over [[pulley]]s and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel.\n\nIn a two pulley system, the belt can either drive the pulleys normally in one direction (the same if on parallel shafts), or the belt may be crossed, so that the direction of the driven shaft is reversed (the opposite direction to the driver if on parallel shafts). As a source of motion, a [[conveyor belt]] is one application where the belt is adapted to carry a load continuously between two points. The belt drive can also be used to change the speed of rotation, either up or down, by using different sized pulleys.\n\n==History==\nThe mechanical belt drive, using a [[pulley]] machine, was first mentioned in the text the ''Dictionary of Local Expressions'' by the Han Dynasty philosopher, poet, and politician [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53\u201318 BC) in 15 BC, used for a [[quilling]] machine that wound [[silk]] fibers on to [[bobbin]]s for [[Weaving|weavers']] shuttles.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 207208\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 207\u2013208.</ref> The belt drive is an essential component to the invention of the [[spinning wheel]].<ref name=\"Needham 1986\">Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 108.</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 160163\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 160\u2013163.</ref> The belt drive was not only used in textile technologies, it was also applied to hydraulic-powered bellows dated from the 1st century AD.<ref name=\"Needham 1986\"/>\n\n== Power transmission ==\nBelts are the cheapest utility for power transmission between shafts that may not be axially aligned.  Power transmission is achieved by purposely designed belts and pulleys. The variety of power transmission needs that can be met by a belt-drive transmission system are numerous, and this has led to many variations on the theme. Belt drives run smoothly and with little noise, and provide shock absorption for motors, loads, and bearings when the force and power needed changes.  A drawback to belt drives is that they transmit less power than gears or chain drives.  However, improvements in belt engineering allow use of belts in systems that only formerly allowed chain drives or gears.\n\nPower transmitted between a belt and a pulley is expressed as the product of difference of tension and belt velocity:\n\n:<math>P = (T_1 - T_2)v,</math>\n\nwhere, ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt respectively. They are related as\n\n:<math>\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = e^{\\mu\\alpha},</math>\n\nwhere, \u03bc is the coefficient of friction, and \u03b1 is the angle (in radians) subtended by contact surface at the centre of the pulley.\n\n===Pros and cons===\nBelt drives are simple, inexpensive, and do not require axially aligned shafts.  They help protect machinery from overload and jam, and damp and isolate noise and vibration.  Load fluctuations are shock-absorbed (cushioned).  They need no lubrication and minimal maintenance.  They have high efficiency (90\u201398%, usually 95%), high tolerance for misalignment, and are of relatively low cost if the shafts are far apart.  Clutch action is activated by releasing belt tension.  Different speeds can be obtained by stepped or tapered pulleys.\n\nThe angular-velocity ratio may not be constant or equal to that of the pulley diameters, due to slip and stretch. However, this problem has been largely solved by the use of toothed belts. Working temperatures range from - 35\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C.  Adjustment of center distance or addition of an idler pulley is crucial to compensate for wear and stretch.\n\n=== Flat belts ===\n[[File:Transmissionsriemen.jpg|thumb|right|The drive belt: used to transfer power from the engine's flywheel. Here shown driving a [[threshing machine]].]]\n[[File:Wide flat belt.JPG|thumb|A small section of a wide flat belt made of layers of leather with the fastener on one end, shown in an exhibit at the [[Suffolk Mills]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]]]\nFlat belts were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in [[line shaft]]ing to transmit power in factories.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" >By Rhys Jenkins, Newcomen Society, (1971). ''Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times'', Ayer Publishing. Page 34, {{ISBN|0-8369-2167-4}}.</ref> They were also used in countless [[agriculture|farming]], [[mining]], and [[logging]] applications, such as [[bucksaw]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[threshing machine|threshers]], [[silo|silo blowers]], [[conveyor system|conveyors]] for filling [[corn crib]]s or [[hayloft]]s, [[baler]]s, water [[pump]]s (for [[water well|wells]], mines, or [[swamp]]y farm fields), and [[electrical generator]]s. Flat belts are still used today, although not nearly as much as in the line-shaft era. The flat belt is a simple system of power transmission that was well suited for its day. It can deliver high power at high speeds&nbsp;(373&nbsp;kW at 51&nbsp;m/s), in cases of wide belts and large pulleys. But these wide-belt-large-pulley drives are bulky, consuming lots of space while requiring high tension, leading to high loads, and are poorly suited to close-centers applications, so V-belts have mainly replaced flat belts for short-distance power transmission; and longer-distance power transmission is typically no longer done with belts at all. For example, factory machines now tend to have individual electric motors.\n\nBecause flat belts tend to climb towards the higher side of the pulley, pulleys were made with a slightly convex or \"crowned\" surface (rather than flat) to allow the belt to self-center as it runs. Flat belts also tend to slip on the pulley face when heavy loads are applied, and many proprietary [[#Belt dressing|belt dressings]] were available that could be applied to the belts to increase friction, and so power transmission.\n\nFlat belts were traditionally made of leather or fabric. Today most are made of rubber or synthetic polymers. Grip of leather belts is often better if they are assembled with the hair side (outer side) of the leather against the pulley, although some belts are instead given a half-twist before joining the ends (forming a [[M\u00f6bius strip]]), so that wear can be evenly distributed on both sides of the belt. Belts ends are joined by lacing the ends together with leather thonging (the oldest of the methods),<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.farmcollector.com/Looking-Back/How-To-Lace-A-Flat-Belt.aspx\n | title = How to lace a flat belt\n | author = James N.

Flat belts were traditionally jointed, and still usually are, but they can also be made with endless construction.\n\n=== Rope drives ===\nIn the mid 19th century, British millwrights discovered that multi-grooved pulleys connected by [[rope]]s outperformed flat pulleys connected by leather belts.  [[Wire rope]]s were occasionally used, but [[cotton]], [[hemp]], [[Manila rope|manila hemp]] and [[flax]] rope saw the widest use.  Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a [[Helix|helical]] path before being returned to its starting position by an [[idler pulley]] that also served to maintain the tension on the rope.  Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove drive pulley to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.\n\nIn general, as with flat belts, rope drives were used for connections from [[Stationary steam engine|stationary engines]] to the [[jack shaft]]s and [[line shaft]]s of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery.  Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances.  Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the \"flying rope\", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.<ref>Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission] [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219\u2013224.</ref><ref>John J.

Note:  This journal is the house organ of the Dodge Manufacturing Company and is mostly devoted rope-power systems.</ref>\n\n=== Round belts ===\nRound belts are a circular cross section belt designed to run in a pulley with a 60 degree V-groove. Round grooves are only suitable for idler pulleys that guide the belt, or when (soft) O-ring type belts are used. The V-groove transmits torque through a wedging action, thus increasing friction. Nevertheless, round belts are for use in relatively low [[torque]] situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of [[polyurethane]]). Early [[sewing machine]]s utilized a leather belt, joined either by a metal staple or glued, to great effect.\n\n=== Spring belts ===\n[[File:Rew3k04-002 spring belt transmission.jpg|thumb|A two-stage transmission using spring belts on a toy vehicle]]\nSpring belts are similar to rope or round belts but consist of a long steel helical spring. They are commonly found on toy or small model engines, typically steam engines driving other toys or models or providing a transmission between the crankshaft and other parts of a vehicle. The main advantage over rubber or other elastic belts is that they last much longer under poorly controlled operating conditions. The distance between the pulleys is also less critical. Their main disadvantage is that slippage is more likely due to the lower coefficient of friction. The ends of a spring belt can be joined either by bending the last turn of the helix at each end by 90 degrees to form hooks, or by reducing the diameter of the last few turns at one end so that it \"screws\" into the other end.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|V belts}} ===<!-- Other articles link here -->\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Belts on a [[Yanmar 2GM20]] marine [[diesel engine]]]]\n[[File:Multiple-V-belt drive 001.jpg|thumb|A multiple-V-belt drive on an [[air compressor]]]]\nV belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) solved the slippage and alignment problem. It is now the basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly [[trapezoid]]al (hence the name \"V\"). The \"V\" shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the [[pulley]] (or sheave), with the result that the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases\u2014the greater the load, the greater the wedging action\u2014improving [[torque]] transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios.  The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys.  Optimal speed range is {{convert|1000|\u2013|7000|ft/min|abbr=on}}. V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.\n\nFor high-power requirements, two or more V-belts can be joined side-by-side in an arrangement called a multi-V, running on matching multi-groove sheaves. This is known as a multiple-V-belt drive (or sometimes a \"classical V-belt drive\").\n\nV-belts may be homogeneously rubber or polymer throughout, or there may be fibers embedded in the rubber or polymer for strength and reinforcement. The fibers may be of textile materials such as cotton, [[polyamide]] (such as [[Nylon]]) or polyester or, for greatest strength, of steel or [[aramid]] (such as [[Technora]], [[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]]).\n\nWhen an endless belt does not fit the need, jointed and link V-belts may be employed. Most models offer the same power and speed ratings as equivalently-sized endless belts and do not require special pulleys to operate. A link v-belt is a number of polyurethane/polyester composite links held together, either by themselves, such as Fenner Drives' PowerTwist, or Nu-T-Link (with metal studs). These provide easy installation and superior environmental resistance compared to rubber belts and are length-adjustable by disassembling and removing links when needed.\n\n====V-belt history====\nTrade journal coverage of V-belts in automobiles from 1916 mentioned leather as the belt material,<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p324\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=Radiator fans and their design |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA324#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> and mentioned that the V angle was not yet well standardized.<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p322\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=S.A.E. divisions exhibit activity |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=322 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA322#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> The endless rubber V-belt was developed in 1917 by John Gates of the [[Charles Gates, Jr.|Gates Rubber Company]]. Multiple-V-belt drive was first arranged a few years later by Walter Geist of the [[Allis-Chalmers]] corporation, who was inspired to replace the single rope of multi-groove-sheave [[#Rope drives|rope drives]] with multiple V-belts running parallel. Geist filed for a patent in 1925, and Allis-Chalmers began marketing the drive under the \"Texrope\" brand; the patent was granted in 1928 ({{US Patent|1662511}}). The \"Texrope\" brand still exists, although it has changed ownership and no longer refers to multiple-V-belt drive alone.\n\n=== Multi-groove belts ===\nA multi-groove, V-Ribbed, or polygroove belt<ref>DIN 7867.</ref> is made up of usually between 3 and 24 \"V\" shaped sections alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for the same drive surface, thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in service. Belts are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56&nbsp;mm is commonly used for automotive applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gates.com/~/media/files/gates/industrial/power-transmission/chart/gatescorporationbeltidchart.pdf|title=Gates Belt I.D. Chart}}</ref>\n\nA further advantage of the polygroove belt that makes them popular is that they can run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a single idler pulley for tensioning, a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\">{{cite book\n  |title=Automotive Handbook\n  |publisher=[[Robert Bosch GmbH]]\n  |year=1993\n  |page=304\n  |edition=3rd\n  |isbn=0-8376-0330-7\n  |ref=Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed\n}}</ref>\n\nAny V-belt's ability to drive pulleys depends on wrapping the belt around a sufficient angle of the pulley to provide grip. Where a single-V-belt is limited to a simple convex shape, it can adequately wrap at most three or possibly four pulleys, so can drive at most three accessories. Where more must be driven, such as for modern cars with power steering and air conditioning, multiple belts are required. As the polygroove belt can be bent into concave paths by external idlers, it can wrap any number of driven pulleys, limited only by the power capacity of the belt.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\" />\n\nThis ability to bend the belt at the designer's whim allows it to take a complex or \"[[serpentine belt|serpentine]]\" path. This can assist the design of a compact engine layout, where the accessories are mounted more closely to the engine block and without the need to provide movable tensioning adjustments. The entire belt may be tensioned by a single idler pulley.\n\n=== Ribbed belt ===\nA ribbed belt is a power transmission belt featuring lengthwise grooves. It operates from contact between the ribs of the belt and the grooves in the pulley. Its single-piece structure is reported to offer an even distribution of tension across the width of the pulley where the belt is in contact, a power range up to 600&nbsp;kW, a high speed ratio, serpentine drives (possibility to drive off the back of the belt), long life, stability and homogeneity of the drive tension, and reduced vibration. The ribbed belt may be fitted on various applications: compressors, fitness bikes, agricultural machinery, food mixers, washing machines, lawn mowers, etc.\n\n===Film belts===\nThough often grouped with flat belts, they are actually a different kind.  They consist of a very thin belt (0.5\u201315 millimeters or 100\u20134000 micrometres) strip of plastic and occasionally rubber.  They are generally intended for low-power (less than 10 watts), high-speed uses, allowing high efficiency (up to 98%) and long life.  These are seen in business machines, printers, tape recorders, and other light-duty operations.\n\n=== Timing belts ===\n[[File:Timing belt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Timing belt]]\n[[File:F8hub.jpg|thumb|Belt-drive cog on a [[belt-driven bicycle]]]]\n[[Toothed belt|Timing belt]]s (also known as '''toothed''', '''notch''', '''cog''', or '''synchronous''' belts) are a ''positive'' transfer belt and can track relative movement. These belts have teeth that fit into a matching toothed pulley. When correctly tensioned, they have no slippage, run at constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used instead of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.  [[Camshaft]]s of automobiles, miniature timing systems, and [[stepper motor]]s often utilize these belts.  Timing belts need the least tension of all belts and are among the most efficient. They can bear up to {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} at speeds of {{convert|16,000|ft/min|abbr=on}}.\n\nTiming belts with a helical offset tooth design are available.  The helical offset tooth design forms a chevron pattern and causes the teeth to engage progressively.  The chevron pattern design is self-aligning and does not make the noise that some timing belts make at certain speeds, and is more efficient at transferring power (up to 98%).\n\nDisadvantages include a relatively high purchase cost, the need for specially fabricated toothed pulleys, less protection from overloading, jamming, and vibration due to their continuous tension cords, the lack of clutch action (only possible with friction-drive belts), and the fixed lengths, which do not allow length adjustment (unlike link V-belts or chains).\n\n=== Specialty belts ===\nBelts normally transmit power on the tension side of the loop.  However, designs for [[continuously variable transmission]]s exist that use belts that are a series of solid metal blocks, linked together as in a chain, transmitting power on the compression side of the loop.\n\n===Rolling roads===\nBelts used for [[Dynamometer#Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)|rolling roads]] for wind tunnels can be capable of {{convert|250|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arc.pininfarina.it/english/news.html |title=Pininfarina Aerodynamic and Aeroacoustic Research Center |publisher=Arc.pininfarina.it |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Standards for use==\n\nThe open belt drive has parallel shafts rotating in the same direction, whereas the cross-belt drive also bears parallel shafts but rotate in opposite direction.  The former is far more common, and the latter not appropriate for timing and standard V-belts unless there is a twist between each pulley so that the pulleys only contact the same belt surface. Nonparallel shafts can be connected if the belt's center line is aligned with the center plane of the pulley.  Industrial belts are usually reinforced rubber but sometimes leather types.  Non-leather, non-reinforced belts can only be used in light applications.\n\nThe pitch line is the line between the inner and outer surfaces that is neither subject to tension (like the outer surface) nor compression (like the inner).  It is midway through the surfaces in film and flat belts and dependent on cross-sectional shape and size in timing and V-belts. [[standard reference pitch diameter]] can be estimated by taking average of gear teeth tips diameter and gear teeth base diameter. The angular speed is inversely proportional to size, so the larger the one wheel, the less angular velocity, and vice versa.  Actual pulley speeds tend to be 0.5\u20131% less than generally calculated because of belt slip and stretch. In timing belts, the inverse ratio teeth of the belt contributes to the exact measurement.\nThe speed of the belt is:\n\nSpeed = Circumference based on [[Standard reference pitch diameter|pitch diameter]] \u00d7 angular speed in rpm\n\n===Selection criteria===\nBelt drives are built under the following required conditions: speeds of and power transmitted between drive and driven unit; suitable distance between shafts; and appropriate operating conditions. The equation for power is\n\n:power [kW] = ([[torque]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[newton-meter|N\u00b7m]]]) \u00d7 ([[rotational speed]] [rev/[[minute|min]]]) \u00d7 (2\u03c0 radians) / (60 [[second|s]] \u00d7 1000 W).\n\nFactors of power adjustment include speed ratio; shaft distance (long or short); type of drive unit (electric motor, internal combustion engine); service environment (oily, wet, dusty); driven unit loads (jerky, shock, reversed); and pulley-belt arrangement (open, crossed, turned).  These are found in engineering handbooks and manufacturer's literature. When corrected, the power is compared to rated powers of the standard belt cross-sections at particular belt speeds to find a number of arrays that perform best. Now the pulley diameters are chosen. It is generally either large diameters or large cross-section that are chosen, since, as stated earlier, larger belts transmit this same power at low belt speeds as smaller belts do at high speeds. To keep the driving part at its smallest, minimal-diameter pulleys are desired. Minimum pulley diameters are limited by the elongation of the belt's outer fibers as the belt wraps around the pulleys. Small pulleys increase this elongation, greatly reducing belt life. Minimal pulley diameters are often listed with each cross-section and speed, or listed separately by belt cross-section. After the cheapest diameters and belt section are chosen, the belt length is computed. If endless belts are used, the desired shaft spacing may need adjusting to accommodate standard-length belts. It is often more economical to use two or more juxtaposed V-belts, rather than one larger belt.\n\nIn large speed ratios or small central distances, the angle of contact between the belt and pulley may be less than 180\u00b0. If this is the case, the drive power must be further increased, according to manufacturer's tables, and the selection process repeated. This is because power capacities are based on the standard of a 180\u00b0 contact angle. Smaller contact angles mean less area for the belt to obtain traction, and thus the belt carries less power.\n\n===Belt friction===\n{{main|Belt friction}}\nBelt drives depend on [[friction]] to operate, but excessive friction wastes energy and rapidly wears the belt. Factors that affect belt friction include belt tension, contact angle, and the materials used to make the belt and pulleys.\n\n===Belt tension===\nPower transmission is a function of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads.  Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.\n\n===Belt wear===\nFatigue, more so than abrasion, is the culprit for most belt problems. This wear is caused by stress from rolling around the pulleys.  High belt tension; excessive slippage; adverse environmental conditions; and belt overloads caused by shock, vibration, or belt slapping all contribute to belt fatigue.\n\n===Belt vibration===\n[[Vibration]] signatures are widely used for studying belt drive malfunctions. Some of the common malfunctions or faults include the effects of belt [[Tension (physics)|tension]], speed, [[sheave]] [[Eccentricity (mechanics)|eccentricity]] and misalignment conditions. The effect of sheave Eccentricity on vibration signatures of the belt drive is quite significant. Although, vibration magnitude is not necessarily increased by this it will create strong amplitude modulation. When the top section of a belt is in [[Resonance energy transfer|resonance]], the vibrations of the machine is increased. However, an increase in the machine vibration is not significant when only the bottom section of the belt is in resonance. The vibration spectrum has the tendency to move to higher frequencies as the tension force of the belt is increased.\n\n===Belt dressing===\nBelt slippage can be addressed in several ways. Belt replacement is an obvious solution, and eventually the mandatory one (because no belt lasts forever). Often, though, before the replacement option is executed, retensioning (via pulley centerline adjustment) or dressing (with any of various coatings) may be successful to extend the belt's lifespan and postpone replacement. Belt dressings are typically liquids that are poured, brushed, dripped, or sprayed onto the belt surface and allowed to spread around; they are meant to recondition the belt's driving surfaces and increase friction between the belt and the pulleys. Some belt dressings are dark and sticky, resembling [[tar]] or [[syrup]]; some are thin and clear, resembling [[white spirit|mineral spirits]]. Some are sold to the public in [[aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] at auto parts stores; others are sold in drums only to industrial users.\n\n===Specifications===\nTo fully specify a belt, the material, length, and cross-section size and shape are required. Timing belts, in addition, require that the size of the teeth be given.\nThe length of the belt is the sum of the central length of the system on both sides, half the circumference of both pulleys, and the square of the sum (if crossed) or the difference (if open) of the radii. Thus, when dividing by the central distance, it can be visualized as the central distance times the height that gives the same squared value of the radius difference on, of course, both sides.  When adding to the length of either side, the length of the belt increases, in a similar manner to the Pythagorean theorem.  One important concept to remember is that as D<sub>1</sub> gets closer to D<sub>2</sub> there is less of a distance (and therefore less addition of length) until its approaches zero.\n\nOn the other hand, in a crossed belt drive the ''sum'' rather than the difference of radii is the basis for computation for length.  So the wider the small drive increases, the belt length is higher.\n\n==V-belt profiles==\n[[File:BeltProfiles.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[File:V-belt angle.jpg|thumb|right|v-belt angle, XPZ & SPZ profile]]\nMetric v-belt profiles:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He currently co-drives in the [[Enduro Cup|Pirtek Enduro Cup]] alongside [[Will Davison]] in the No. 23 [[Ford Mustang (sixth generation)|Ford Mustang GT]] for [[23Red Racing]]. He is the son of retired Australian race driver and former team owner [[Larry Perkins]], in whose team [[Perkins Engineering]], he drove between 2006 and 2008. Initially competing as an endurance race only driver in 2006, in 2007 Perkins graduated to the full-time drive in the No. 11 [[Perkins Engineering]] car, the number made [[Perkins Engineering#Racing Number 11|famous]] in Australian racing by his father.\n\nPerkins stepped back from full-time driving in [[Supercars]]' top category in 2015 to sign with the [[Holden Racing Team]] as a co-driver for the [[Enduro Cup|Pirtek Enduro Cup]].\n\nIn 2019, Perkins collected his first Bathurst podium, finishing in third place alongside [[James Courtney]] in the No. 22 [[Holden ZB Commodore]] for [[Walkinshaw Andretti United]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Perkins Engineering===\nThe [[Perkins Engineering]] team run by his father [[Larry Perkins|Larry]], ran a two-car Fujitsu Development Series racing program in 2006, leading to Perkins getting the drive in the second No. 78 car, with [[Shane Price]] getting the lead drive in No. 77.<ref name='2006-fujitsu-launch'>{{cite news|title=Jack and Shane Race Here|publisher=V8 Supercars Australia|date=19 March 2006|url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/content/latest_news/22252-Jack-and-Shane-race-here/|accessdate=2009-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018033008/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/content/latest_news/22252-Jack-and-Shane-race-here/|archive-date=18 October 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The cars were largely unsponsored, though had a clear association with the main series Jack Daniel's-sponsored Perkins Engineering cars.

The new Kelly Racing team was the only four-car team in the series and results were thin. By season's end team leaders Rick and Todd Kelly were beginning to gain results but results for Perkins and the team's fourth car did not come and Perkins was not retained into 2010.\n\n===Paul Morris Motorsport===\nPerkins was without a drive for the 2010 season leaving him to pursue a role with [[Paul Morris Motorsport]] as a signwriter. This eventually led to a part-time return to the second-tier [[Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series]] in a spare PMM Commodore chassis with limited support from the main team. Perkins's performances in the second tier series where strong enough to earn him a call-up to James Rosenberg Racing for the 2010 Philip Island 500 and Bathurst 1000, pairing with Tim Slade.\n\nJack's continued strong 2010 form led to Paul Morris Motorsports team owner, Paul Morris, deciding to personally step down from his own driving duties at the Gold Coast round of the championship where he was scheduled to drive with Russell Ingall to allow Perkins to take over the drive. This stirred the sports traditionalists as it re-ignited the famous \"Perkins&nbsp;\u2013 Ingall\" partnership which Jack's father Larry shared with Russell Ingall, which led to 2 Bathurst 1000 crowns. The two drivers worked well together and performed strongly at the event which led to Paul Morris deciding to sign Perkins to compete in the 2011 Philip Island 500 and Bathurst 1000, again pairing with Russell Ingall.\n\n===James Rosenberg Racing===\nPerkins' strong performances in the Fujitsu series in 2010 led to a drive with [[James Rosenberg Racing]] for the 2010 endurance races. Perkins and [[Tim Slade]] finished the Phillip Island 500 in a strong fifth position equalling the team's best sprint race performance from earlier in the season.\n\n===Sonic Motor Racing===\nPerkins signed a deal with Sonic Motor Racing to compete in the [[2011 Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series]] with support from Bob Jane T-Marts, Supercheap Auto, Acu-check and Castrol, using a [[Ford BF Falcon|BF Falcon]] built by [[Triple Eight Race Engineering]].\n\n===Garry Rogers Motorsport===\nPerkins signed with [[Garry Rogers Motorsport]], to partner [[Alexandre Premat]] for the 2012 V8 Supercar endurance events at the Dick Smith Sandown 500 and Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000.\n\nPerkins returned to GRM for the 2013 V8 Supercars Pirtek Endurance Cup alongside full-time rookie, [[Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)|Scott McLaughlin]]. The duo matched Perkins previous best result with an 8th at Bathurst. The No. 33 Commodore was looking strong in the Pirtek Endurance Cup until an electrical issue dogged there challenge at the Armor All Gold Coast 600.\n\n===Eggleston Motorsport===\nFollowing the opening round of the [[2013 Dunlop V8 Supercar Series]] at the Clipsal 500, it was announced that Perkins would drive an Eggleston Motorsport Commodore at the second round at Barbagallo Raceway. Perkins finished the championship 4th in the Driver's Standing even though he missed the opening round in Adelaide.\n\n===Charlie Schwerkolt Racing===\n[[File:Jack Perkins 2014.JPG|thumb|The [[Ford FG Falcon]] of Perkins at the [[2014 Coates Hire Ipswich 400]]]]\nOn December 19, 2013, it was announced that Perkins would pilot the No. 18 Jeld Wen [[Ford FG Falcon]] for the [[2014 International V8 Supercars Championship]] Series. The [[2014 Clipsal 500]] marked his return to full-time driving since 2009. He was dropped at the end of the season in favour of [[Lee Holdsworth]]. Bathurst was the main highlight of the year, with Perkins qualifying in the top ten and making the shootout. A mistake made on the final corner took him to grid position 9, although he was on track to be around position 6.

Although he was generally keeping pace with the more highly rated [[Shane Price]], Jack's performances behind the wheel were suffering towards the end of long stints behind the wheel.

The new Kelly Racing team was the only four-car team in the series and results were thin. By season's end team leaders Rick and Todd Kelly were beginning to gain results but results for Perkins and the team's fourth car did not come and Perkins was not retained into 2010.\n\n===Paul Morris Motorsport===\nPerkins was without a drive for the 2010 season leaving him to pursue a role with [[Paul Morris Motorsport]] as a signwriter. This eventually led to a part-time return to the second-tier [[Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series]] in a spare PMM Commodore chassis with limited support from the main team. Perkins's performances in the second tier series where strong enough to earn him a call-up to James Rosenberg Racing for the 2010 Philip Island 500 and Bathurst 1000, pairing with Tim Slade.\n\nJack's continued strong 2010 form led to Paul Morris Motorsports team owner, Paul Morris, deciding to personally step down from his own driving duties at the Gold Coast round of the championship where he was scheduled to drive with Russell Ingall to allow Perkins to take over the drive. This stirred the sports traditionalists as it re-ignited the famous \"Perkins&nbsp;\u2013 Ingall\" partnership which Jack's father Larry shared with Russell Ingall, which led to 2 Bathurst 1000 crowns. The two drivers worked well together and performed strongly at the event which led to Paul Morris deciding to sign Perkins to compete in the 2011 Philip Island 500 and Bathurst 1000, again pairing with Russell Ingall.\n\n===James Rosenberg Racing===\nPerkins' strong performances in the Fujitsu series in 2010 led to a drive with [[James Rosenberg Racing]] for the 2010 endurance races. Perkins and [[Tim Slade]] finished the Phillip Island 500 in a strong fifth position equalling the team's best sprint race performance from earlier in the season.\n\n===Sonic Motor Racing===\nPerkins signed a deal with Sonic Motor Racing to compete in the [[2011 Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series]] with support from Bob Jane T-Marts, Supercheap Auto, Acu-check and Castrol, using a [[Ford BF Falcon|BF Falcon]] built by [[Triple Eight Race Engineering]].\n\n===Garry Rogers Motorsport===\nPerkins signed with [[Garry Rogers Motorsport]], to partner [[Alexandre Premat]] for the 2012 V8 Supercar endurance events at the Dick Smith Sandown 500 and Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000.\n\nPerkins returned to GRM for the 2013 V8 Supercars Pirtek Endurance Cup alongside full-time rookie, [[Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)|Scott McLaughlin]]. The duo matched Perkins previous best result with an 8th at Bathurst. The No. 33 Commodore was looking strong in the Pirtek Endurance Cup until an electrical issue dogged there challenge at the Armor All Gold Coast 600.\n\n===Eggleston Motorsport===\nFollowing the opening round of the [[2013 Dunlop V8 Supercar Series]] at the Clipsal 500, it was announced that Perkins would drive an Eggleston Motorsport Commodore at the second round at Barbagallo Raceway. Perkins finished the championship 4th in the Driver's Standing even though he missed the opening round in Adelaide.\n\n===Charlie Schwerkolt Racing===\n[[File:Jack Perkins 2014.JPG|thumb|The [[Ford FG Falcon]] of Perkins at the [[2014 Coates Hire Ipswich 400]]]]\nOn December 19, 2013, it was announced that Perkins would pilot the No. 18 Jeld Wen [[Ford FG Falcon]] for the [[2014 International V8 Supercars Championship]] Series. The [[2014 Clipsal 500]] marked his return to full-time driving since 2009. He was dropped at the end of the season in favour of [[Lee Holdsworth]]. Bathurst was the main highlight of the year, with Perkins qualifying in the top ten and making the shootout. A mistake made on the final corner took him to grid position 9, although he was on track to be around position 6. In the late stages of the race, the car was running in the top five, with a chance for a podium result. However, due to a mistake in pit lane whilst re-entering traffic, they were given a penalty. They later finished 12th.\n\n==Type 1 diabetes==\nShortly before the penultimate round of the 2007 V8 Supercars Championship Series, Perkins was diagnosed with [[diabetes|Type One Diabetes]],<ref name='type-1-diag'>{{cite news |title=Diabetes puts brakes on Jack Perkins' career|publisher=Herald Sun|date=13 November 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22746709-39478,00.html|accessdate=2009-03-05 | first=Ray | last=Kershler}}</ref> which forced him to step down from the full-time drive of the No. 11 [[Perkins Engineering]] [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]].
