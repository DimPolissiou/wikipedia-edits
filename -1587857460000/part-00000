Their name \"Scythians\" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]], \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 ''Skuthoi'', meaning the \"archers\", a skill for which they were known and feared. They left a rich cultural legacy, particularly in the form of gold jewellery, frequently found in the \"[[kurgan]]\" burials associated with them. They practised the [[ancient Iranian religion]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=314\u2013315}}\n\nA group of Scythian tribes, the [[Sarmatians]], known as the [[Alans]] (i.e. \"[[Aryans]]\", through a common internal consonant shift, i.e. \"Iranians\"{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315, note 1}}) from the first century onwards, migrated into [[Europe]]. Allied with the Germanic [[Goths]], the Alans penetrated west into [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and other territories under the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans tried to manage the threat by hiring them as mercenaries in the cavalry, or, particularly in France, by buying them off as landed gentry. Many toponyms in France, such as Alainville, Alaincourt, Alen\u00e7on, and others, testify that they were territorial possessions of Alan families. Alan equestrian culture formed the basis of Medieval [[chivalry]], and thus had a significant role in the development of western European culture.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315}}\n\nWhile most of the Scythians assimilated into other ethnic groups by the Middle Ages, the Alans of the [[Caucasus]] maintained a distinct identity and continued to dominate the area, so that the [[Byzantine Empire]] recognised them as an independent allied kingdom. Through their relations with the Byzantines and missionaries from [[Georgia]] in the south, the Alan aristocracy adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] during the tenth century. This, however, had little effect on the general Alan population, so that the thirteenth-century Flemish traveller [[William of Rubruck]] reported that \"they knew nothing (of Christianity) apart from the name of Christ\". The [[Ossetians]] are the sole modern population culturally and linguistically descending from the Alans, and they have preserved beliefs and rituals likely dating back to Scythian religion, even though through waves of partial [[syncretism|syncretisation]] with Christianity.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=316}}\n\nAfter the conquests of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the Caucasus during the mid-thirteenth century, contacts between the Alans and Eastern Orthodox religious authorities ceased completely, and their superficial Christianisation was stopped. There is evidence that between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, shrines which were apparently built in honour of Christian saints were converted to indigenous Pagan use.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}} The [[Russian Empire]]'s expansion in the Caucasus by the end of the eighteenth century brought with itself Russian Orthodox missionaries who sought to \"re-Christianise\" the Ossetians. Their efforts had had limited success by the time when they were completely obliterated by the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, which introduced the peoples of the Caucasus into the rapid processes of industrialisation, modernisation and urbanisation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Between the traditional and the new religion===\nThe Ossetian people are today split between two states: [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]], a constituent federal republic within [[Russia]], and the neighbouring only partially recognised state of [[South Ossetia]]. The incipient collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s triggered projects of identity-building among many of its constituent nations. In Ossetia, as in other nations, this involved the recovery of an \"authentic national religion\" harkening back to pre-Christian times. Ossetian nationalism also played a role, powered by ethnic conflicts for lands and resources with neighbouring peoples in North Ossetia, and for independence in [[South Ossetia]], which is a part of [[Georgia]] and still a matter of international controversy (cf. the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]]).{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=317}}\n\nAccording to [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor Shnirelman]], in the Ossetian case certain traditions had survived with unbroken continuity and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revived religious associated with ethnic nationalism and with the opposition to both [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] Orthodox Christianity, perceived as foreign, and to [[Islam]], professed by the neighboring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and by a small minority of Ossetians.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=202\u2013207|ps=: \"Since the turn of the 1980s, a growth of Neo-Paganism has been observed in the Middle Volga region, in North Ossetia-Alaniia, and in Abkhazia. Pagan traditions had never disappeared there completely and, in contrast to the Slavic and Baltic regions, there was no need to invent too much by reference to books, as almost all the resources were intact there. Thus, in these regions, interest in Paganism developed in two different environments: firstly, in the countryside with its unbroken continuity of traditional folk beliefs, and secondly, in the urbanized areas where local, highly secularized intellectuals began to construct a new synthetic religion in order to overcome a crisis of identity. In the latter case, this was a manifestation of local ethnic nationalism resisting Russian Orthodoxy as a \"religion of exploiters\". [...] Contemporary Neo-Paganism is constituted by two different branches\u2014one of a \"bookish\" approach which is artificially cultivated by urbanized intellectuals who have lost their links with folk tradition, and the other, more authentic, is of a rural movement based on a continuity rooted in the remote past. The first dominates among the Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Armenians and can be defined as an \"invention of tradition\", after Eric Hobsbawm (1983). A more complex pattern can be observed among the ethnic groups of the Middle Volga River region as well as among the Ossetians and Abkhazians, where both tendencies are interacting with one another.\"}}\n\nThe scholar [[Richard Foltz]] reconstructs the development of Ossetian religion through seven phases: 1. An original Scythian Paganism; 2. a first wave of Christianisation under Byzantine and Georgian influence from the tenth to the thirteenth century; 3. a \"re-Paganization\" during the fourteenth and fifteenth century following the Mongol invasions and the disruption of the contacts with the Byzantines; 4. a partial re-Christianisation during the sixteenth and seventeenth century conducted by Georgian missionaries; 5. a further re-Christianisation conducted by Russian missionaries beginning in the late eighteenth century; 6. enforced [[state atheism]] during the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1991; and 7. a resurgence of \"traditional Ossetian religion\". According to Foltz, the narrative of the contemporary promoters of Scythian Neopaganism is that the religiosity of the Ossetians maintained a strong underlying continuity while absorbing and adapting superficial influences from Christianity, and to a lesser extent from Islam and neighbouring Caucasian traditions, superficial influences which may be easily stripped away to reveal its essential, distinct \"Iranian character\".{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=320\u2013321}}\n\nThere are attempts to turn traditional local gods into objects of national worship in North Ossetia\u2013Alania. For example, in former times, a grove was devoted to the local god Khetag. After the [[1991\u201392 South Ossetia War|clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991\u20131992]], a glade near the wood was turned into a place for pan-Ossetian worship, including religious and political rituals, with activities supervised by the Great Council of Ossetian Priests (''Styr-nykhas''), a non-governmental committee established in 1993.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}} The Khetag celebration was approved by the 1990s president of North Ossetia\u2013Alania as a national holiday. A special foundation was established in order to raise funds for the reconstruction of the site, and since 1994 a big yearly sacrifice is arranged at the Khetag shrine.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==Relevance for Slavs and other Indo-Europeans==\n[[File:089 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Rekom Temple in the [[Tsey]] area, [[Alagirsky District]], [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]].]]\nIn 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of [[Moscow State University]], led by the Russian thinker [[Alexander Dugin]], a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history. Among participants there was, among others, Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' religious organisation of Assianism. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far.

In ancient Ossetian, the seven days of the week were still named after the seven deities. According to Foltz, \"Ares\" was probably [[Mithra]], and the modern [[Uastyrdzhi]]; he was widely worshipped through altars in the form of a sword planted in a pile of stones or brushwood, a cult perhaps reflected in the [[Arthurian legend]] of the sword in the stone, likely brought to Britain by Alan regiments settled there by the Romans in the first century. The cult of the sword continued among the Alans as late as the first century CE.

Their name \"Scythians\" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]], \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 ''Skuthoi'', meaning the \"archers\", a skill for which they were known and feared. They left a rich cultural legacy, particularly in the form of gold jewellery, frequently found in the \"[[kurgan]]\" burials associated with them. They practised the [[ancient Iranian religion]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=314\u2013315}}\n\nA group of Scythian tribes, the [[Sarmatians]], known as the [[Alans]] (i.e. \"[[Aryans]]\", through a common internal consonant shift, i.e. \"Iranians\"{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315, note 1}}) from the first century onwards, migrated into [[Europe]]. Allied with the Germanic [[Goths]], the Alans penetrated west into [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and other territories under the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans tried to manage the threat by hiring them as mercenaries in the cavalry, or, particularly in France, by buying them off as landed gentry. Many toponyms in France, such as Alainville, Alaincourt, Alen\u00e7on, and others, testify that they were territorial possessions of Alan families. Alan equestrian culture formed the basis of Medieval [[chivalry]], and thus had a significant role in the development of western European culture.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315}}\n\nWhile most of the Scythians assimilated into other ethnic groups by the Middle Ages, the Alans of the [[Caucasus]] maintained a distinct identity and continued to dominate the area, so that the [[Byzantine Empire]] recognised them as an independent allied kingdom. Through their relations with the Byzantines and missionaries from [[Georgia]] in the south, the Alan aristocracy adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] during the tenth century. This, however, had little effect on the general Alan population, so that the thirteenth-century Flemish traveller [[William of Rubruck]] reported that \"they knew nothing (of Christianity) apart from the name of Christ\". The [[Ossetians]] are the sole modern population culturally and linguistically descending from the Alans, and they have preserved beliefs and rituals likely dating back to Scythian religion, even though through waves of partial [[syncretism|syncretisation]] with Christianity.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=316}}\n\nAfter the conquests of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the Caucasus during the mid-thirteenth century, contacts between the Alans and Eastern Orthodox religious authorities ceased completely, and their superficial Christianisation was stopped. There is evidence that between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, shrines which were apparently built in honour of Christian saints were converted to indigenous Pagan use.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}} The [[Russian Empire]]'s expansion in the Caucasus by the end of the eighteenth century brought with itself Russian Orthodox missionaries who sought to \"re-Christianise\" the Ossetians. Their efforts had had limited success by the time when they were completely obliterated by the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, which introduced the peoples of the Caucasus into the rapid processes of industrialisation, modernisation and urbanisation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Between the traditional and the new religion===\nThe Ossetian people are today split between two states: [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]], a constituent federal republic within [[Russia]], and the neighbouring only partially recognised state of [[South Ossetia]]. The incipient collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s triggered projects of identity-building among many of its constituent nations. In Ossetia, as in other nations, this involved the recovery of an \"authentic national religion\" harkening back to pre-Christian times. Ossetian nationalism also played a role, powered by ethnic conflicts for lands and resources with neighbouring peoples in North Ossetia, and for independence in [[South Ossetia]], which is a part of [[Georgia]] and still a matter of international controversy (cf. the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]]).{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=317}}\n\nAccording to [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor Shnirelman]], in the Ossetian case certain traditions had survived with unbroken continuity and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revived religious associated with ethnic nationalism and with the opposition to both [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] Orthodox Christianity, perceived as foreign, and to [[Islam]], professed by the neighboring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and by a small minority of Ossetians.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=202\u2013207|ps=: \"Since the turn of the 1980s, a growth of Neo-Paganism has been observed in the Middle Volga region, in North Ossetia-Alaniia, and in Abkhazia. Pagan traditions had never disappeared there completely and, in contrast to the Slavic and Baltic regions, there was no need to invent too much by reference to books, as almost all the resources were intact there. Thus, in these regions, interest in Paganism developed in two different environments: firstly, in the countryside with its unbroken continuity of traditional folk beliefs, and secondly, in the urbanized areas where local, highly secularized intellectuals began to construct a new synthetic religion in order to overcome a crisis of identity. In the latter case, this was a manifestation of local ethnic nationalism resisting Russian Orthodoxy as a \"religion of exploiters\". [...] Contemporary Neo-Paganism is constituted by two different branches\u2014one of a \"bookish\" approach which is artificially cultivated by urbanized intellectuals who have lost their links with folk tradition, and the other, more authentic, is of a rural movement based on a continuity rooted in the remote past. The first dominates among the Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Armenians and can be defined as an \"invention of tradition\", after Eric Hobsbawm (1983). A more complex pattern can be observed among the ethnic groups of the Middle Volga River region as well as among the Ossetians and Abkhazians, where both tendencies are interacting with one another.\"}}\n\nThe scholar [[Richard Foltz]] reconstructs the development of Ossetian religion through seven phases: 1. An original Scythian Paganism; 2. a first wave of Christianisation under Byzantine and Georgian influence from the tenth to the thirteenth century; 3. a \"re-Paganization\" during the fourteenth and fifteenth century following the Mongol invasions and the disruption of the contacts with the Byzantines; 4. a partial re-Christianisation during the sixteenth and seventeenth century conducted by Georgian missionaries; 5. a further re-Christianisation conducted by Russian missionaries beginning in the late eighteenth century; 6. enforced [[state atheism]] during the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1991; and 7. a resurgence of \"traditional Ossetian religion\". According to Foltz, the narrative of the contemporary promoters of Scythian Neopaganism is that the religiosity of the Ossetians maintained a strong underlying continuity while absorbing and adapting superficial influences from Christianity, and to a lesser extent from Islam and neighbouring Caucasian traditions, superficial influences which may be easily stripped away to reveal its essential, distinct \"Iranian character\".{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=320\u2013321}}\n\nThere are attempts to turn traditional local gods into objects of national worship in North Ossetia\u2013Alania. For example, in former times, a grove was devoted to the local god Khetag. After the [[1991\u201392 South Ossetia War|clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991\u20131992]], a glade near the wood was turned into a place for pan-Ossetian worship, including religious and political rituals, with activities supervised by the Great Council of Ossetian Priests (''Styr-nykhas''), a non-governmental committee established in 1993.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}} The Khetag celebration was approved by the 1990s president of North Ossetia\u2013Alania as a national holiday. A special foundation was established in order to raise funds for the reconstruction of the site, and since 1994 a big yearly sacrifice is arranged at the Khetag shrine.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==Relevance for Slavs and other Indo-Europeans==\n[[File:089 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Rekom Temple in the [[Tsey]] area, [[Alagirsky District]], [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]].]]\nIn 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of [[Moscow State University]], led by the Russian thinker [[Alexander Dugin]], a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history. Among participants there was, among others, Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' religious organisation of Assianism. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' organisation was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because \"what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage\".<ref name=\"Dugin-Assianism\">{{cite web |title=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0414\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d: \u041e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0443 |trans-title=Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit |date=7 October 2009 |website=iratta.com |url=http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}}</ref> Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth \"addressed to the whole world\".<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n==Theology and cosmology==\n[[File:North Ossetia.

On the contrary, if a man's actions are driven by material ends, ''Dalimon'' and demons own him and he becomes a source of evil, lie and ugliness.<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n===The seven deities===\nLike other [[ancient Iranian religion]]s, the ancient Scythian religion had seven deities (Ossetian: \u0430\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d \u0434\u0430\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0430, ''arvon daujita''), each of which associated to a planet and to certain natural phenomena.<ref name=wacdin.com/>{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=318\u2013320}} [[Herodotus]] attested the seven Scythian gods as: Papaios (corresponding to [[Zeus]]), the sky god; Tabiti ([[Hestia]]), the hearth goddess (today called Safa); Api ([[Gaia]]), the earth goddess; Oitosyros ([[Apollo]]), the sun god; Argimpasa ([[Aphrodite]]), the fertility goddess; and \"[[Herakles]]\" and \"[[Ares]]\" for whom Herodotus did not provide the Scythian name. In ancient Ossetian, the seven days of the week were still named after the seven deities. According to Foltz, \"Ares\" was probably [[Mithra]], and the modern [[Uastyrdzhi]]; he was widely worshipped through altars in the form of a sword planted in a pile of stones or brushwood, a cult perhaps reflected in the [[Arthurian legend]] of the sword in the stone, likely brought to Britain by Alan regiments settled there by the Romans in the first century. The cult of the sword continued among the Alans as late as the first century CE. Herodotus also mentioned an eighth deity worshipped among the Royal Scythians, Thagimasidas, the water god, equated with [[Poseidon]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=318\u2013320}}\n\nThe modern Ossetians have preserved the sevenfold-eighthfold structure, though the deities have changed as have their names, which in some cases are adaptations of the names of Christian saints: Uastyrdzhi (whose name derives from \"[[Saint George]]\"), the god of contracts and war (the Iranian Mithra); Uatsilla (\"[[Saint Elijah]]\"), the thunder god; Tutyr (Saint \"Theodore\"), the protector of wolves; F\u00e6lv\u00e6ra (maybe the conflation of \"[[Florus and Laurus]]\"), the protector of livestock; Kurdal\u00e6gon, the blacksmith god (the Iranian Kaveh, Kawa); Donbettyr, the water god; Mikaelgabyrta (conflation of \"[[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]]\"), the fertility and underworld god; and \u00c6fsati, the hunt god.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=320\u2013323}}\n\n==Demography and institutions==\nScythian Native Faith is popular in Russia and Ukraine among [[Cossacks]], especially those who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. Some of them identify within the category of [[Rodnovery]], the general \"Slavic Native Faith\".{{sfn|McKay|2009|pp=275\u2013276}} Assianism is also practised without connection to Cossack ethnicism.\n\n===Russia===\n* Dzuary L\u00e6gt\u00e6 (\u0414\u0437\u0443\u0430\u0440\u044b \u041b\u00e6\u0433\u0442\u00e6) \u2014 an organisation for the coordination of the Ossetian clergy established in 2016 in [[Vladikavkaz]], North Ossetia\u2013Alania, on the initiative of the public organisation Yudzinad (\u0418\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434);{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* Ats\u00e6t\u00e6 (\u0410\u0446\u00e6\u0442\u00e6) \u2014 an organisation registered in 2009 in the city of [[Mozdok]], North Ossetia\u2013Alania;{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* \u00c6ts\u00e6g Din (\u00c6\u0446\u00e6\u0433 \u0414\u0438\u043d) \u2014 an organisation registered in Vladikavkaz in 2009 and related to the Ats\u00e6t\u00e6 community.{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n\n===Ukraine===\n* North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire{{sfn|Lesiv|2013|pp=167\u2013169}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rodnovery]]\n* [[Heathenism (new religious movement)|Heathenism]]\n* [[Iranian religions]]\n\n==Citations==\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite article |last=Foltz |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Foltz |title=Scythian Neo-Paganism in the Caucasus: The Ossetian Uatsdin as a 'Nature Religion' |journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture |volume=13 |number=3 |year=2019 |pages=314\u2013332 |doi=10.1558/jsrnc.39114 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338821308 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lesiv |first=Mariya |year=2013 |title=The Return of Ancestral Gods: Modern Ukrainian Paganism as an Alternative Vision for a Nation |series=McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion |volume=2 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP |isbn=077358966X |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite conference |last=Makeyev |first=Daurbek |contribution=\u0410\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 [Assianism and world culture] |year=2007 |title=Traditional Religious Views of Ossetians and Modernity |institution=Ministry of National Affairs and the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania;
