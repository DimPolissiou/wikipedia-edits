The two highways travel together for eleven blocks in downtown Fredericksburg before US&nbsp;87 splits south of US&nbsp;290 at an intersection directly south of the [[National Museum of the Pacific War]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> Traveling due south, US&nbsp;290 returns to an eastward path after crossing the [[Pedernales River]], where it serves as a major artery for Fredericksburg's agricultural district, including [[Wildseed Farms]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> The highway then runs parallel to the Pedernales River, and after passing [[Stonewall, Texas|Stonewall]], serves the south side of [[Lyndon B.

US&nbsp;290 then curves south to serve downtown [[Dripping Springs, Texas|Dripping Springs]], and then serves various residential areas as it crosses into southwest [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> The highway then begins a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 71|SH&nbsp;71]] at a series of traffic lights and travels through Austin's Oak Hill district before becoming a five-to-six-lane freeway. In the community of [[Sunset Valley, Texas|Sunset Valley]], US&nbsp;290 has interchanges with [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Loop&nbsp;1]] (MoPac Expressway) and [[Texas State Highway Loop 360|Loop&nbsp;360]] (Capital of Texas Highway) providing access to the [[Barton Creek Greenbelt]], and is then designated as Ben White Boulevard while it travels through south-central Austin, crossing the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] in the process.

After crossing the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], I-35 and US 290 cut between downtown Austin and the East Cesar Chavez district, being the only major highways to serve the [[Austin Convention Center]] and the [[Texas State Capitol]]. Just prior to bordering the east side of the main [[University of Texas at Austin]] campus, I-35 and US&nbsp;290 split into two decks for about {{convert|2|mi|km}}, resurfacing close to the former [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport|Mueller Airport]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> US&nbsp;290 then splits due east from I-35 southeast of the former [[Highland Mall]] as a four-lane freeway. Not long after, US&nbsp;290 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 183 in Texas|US&nbsp;183]] and promptly becomes a tolled freeway designated as the Manor Expressway.

Passing through the town of [[McDade, Texas|McDade]], US&nbsp;290 cuts through piney woods north of the [[Lost Pines Forest]] and has an interchange with [[Texas State Highway 21|SH&nbsp;21]] west of [[Paige, Texas|Paige]]. US&nbsp;290 continues east, running parallel to the [[Austin and Northwestern Railroad]] east branch until approaching [[Giddings, Texas|Giddings]], where the highway travels along Austin Street, intersecting [[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|US&nbsp;77]] near the town's center.<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/>\n\n[[File:Houston, TX - IH610 US290 - exit12 w18th st - Hempstead rd.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;290 approaching its eastern terminus at I-610 in Houston.]]\nUS&nbsp;290 travels southeast to [[Ledbetter, Texas|Ledbetter]], where it then travels through additional grassland before bounding northeast to [[Burton, Texas|Burton]]. The highway then enters [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]], where it briefly joins [[Texas State Highway 36|SH&nbsp;36]] to serve [[Blinn College]] and bypass the city as a four-lane freeway. After exiting Brenham, US&nbsp;290 runs parallel to the old [[Washington County Railroad (1856\u20131868)|Washington County Railroad]] and goes through [[Chappell Hill, Texas|Chappell Hill]] to serve every historic landmark there, then crosses the [[Brazos River]] to move through a rural auto-industrial area.<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> [[Texas State Highway 6|SH&nbsp;6]] joins US&nbsp;290 north of [[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]], where the two highways become a four-lane freeway notable for its role as a [[hurricane evacuation route]].

The route was designated as '''Texas State Highway Loop 318''' throughout its entire length on January 18, 1960. On February 28, 1973, the section from then-SH 90 westward became part of SH 105. It was established in 1990 when the mainline of US&nbsp;290 was rerouted along with [[Texas State Highway 36|SH&nbsp;36]] around the western and southern sides of Brenham.<ref name=\"TxDOT BU 290-F\"/> The routing begins to the west of town at an intersection with SH&nbsp;36. The business route continues east into downtown on Main Street. Before reaching downtown, the route splits into two parallel one-way streets: Main Street carrying westbound traffic and Alamo Street carrying eastbound traffic. It passes through downtown, meeting the business routing of State Highway 36 and the western terminus of [[Texas State Highway 105|SH&nbsp;105]]. At this intersection, the business route turns south on Market Street, and continues out of Brenham, rejoining the mainline US&nbsp;290 near an intersection with [[Farm to Market Road 577|FM&nbsp;577]].<ref name=\"Mapbook 452\">{{Texas Mapbook|year=2014|page=452|accessdate=December 3, 2014|link=no}}</ref><ref name=\"Mapbook 453\">{{Texas Mapbook|year=2014|page=453|accessdate=December 3, 2014|link=no}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n===Hempstead\u2013Hockley===\n{{infobox road small\n|state=TX\n|type=US\n|route=290\n|subtype=BUS\n|name=Business US Highway 290-H\n|location=[[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]]\u2013[[Hockley, Texas|Hockley]]\n|length_mi=16.991\n|length_round=3\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"TxDOT BU 290-H\" />\n|formed=1995\n}}\n'''Business U.S. Highway 290-H (Bus.

Rather, he willed that citizens should embrace all cultures of Sudan, and to unify under the one commonality they all share, being Sudanese.\n\n==Rebel leader==\nIn 1983, Garang went to [[Bor town, Sudan|Bor]], ostensibly to pacify 500 southern government soldiers in Battalion 105 who were resisting being rotated to posts in the north. However, Garang was already part of a conspiracy among some officers in the Southern Command arranging for the defection of Battalion 105 to the anti-government rebels.  When the government attacked Bor in May and the battalion pulled out, Garang rode by an alternate route to join them in the rebel stronghold in Ethiopia.  By the end of July, Garang had brought over 3000 rebel soldiers under his control through the newly created  [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]/Movement (SPLA/M), which was opposed to military rule and Islamic dominance of the country, and encouraged other army garrisons to mutiny against the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] imposed on the country by the government.<ref name=\"battalion 105\">[[Douglas H. Johnson|Johnson, D.]] ''The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars'', Indiana University Press, 2003, pp. 61\u20132.</ref>  This action marked the commonly agreed upon the beginning of the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], which resulted in one and a half million deaths over twenty years of conflict. Although Garang was Christian and most of southern Sudan is non-Muslim (mostly [[animist]]), he did not initially focus on the religious aspects of the war.\n[[File:John Garang of Sudan.jpg|thumb|John Garang of Sudan]]\n\nGarang had been fighting for a \"New Sudan\" since 1983. He was a strong advocate for national unity: minorities together formed a majority and therefore should rule. Together, Garang believed, they could replace President [[Omar al-Bashir]] with a government made up of representatives from \u201call tribes and religions in Sudan.\" His first real effort for the cause, under his command, occurred in July 1985 with the SPLA\u2019s incursion into Kordofan.<ref name=\"tester\">Cockett, R., 2010, Sudan: Darfur and the Failure of an African State, Yale UP.</ref>\n\nThe SPLA gained the backing of Libya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Garang and his army controlled a large part of the southern regions of the country, named ''New Sudan''. He claimed his troops' courage came from \"the conviction that we are fighting a just cause. That is something North Sudan and its people don't have.\" Critics suggested financial motivations to his rebellion, noting that much of Sudan's [[Petroleum|oil]] wealth lies in the south of the country.<ref name=\"tester\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1991, [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s regime (in Ethiopia) was overthrown by the Khartoum backed Ethiopian rebels ([[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]]). Upon the rebels\u2019 seizure of the government, they closed all SPLA training camps in Ethiopia and cut off the SPLA's arms supply, forcing the SPLA to return hundreds of thousands of Sudanese back to [[South Sudan]]. This disrupted military operations and leadership within the SPLA. However, this caused the West to reconsider relations with the SPLA \u2013 justifying their providing the SPLA with \"non-lethal help.\"<ref name=\"test\">Flint, J. and Alex de Waal, 2008 (2nd Edn), Darfur: A New History of a Long War, Zed Books.</ref>\n\nShortly after, there was an attempted coup to oust Garang by senior SPLA commanders, [[Riek Machar]] and [[Lam Akol]], in August 1991. The splinter group led by Machar and Akol was named the [[SPLA-Nasir]]. The coup turned out to be premature \u2013 however, it did expose the deep ethnic divides within the SPLA.  The Southern Sudanese communities became more divided than ever before in their history. These organic divides among the Southern Sudanese communities were exacerbated by the deliberate \"divide and rule\" policies instituted by the regimes in Khartoum, in order to maintain their power over the Southern Sudanese peoples.\n\n[[Image:John Garang in crowd.jpg|thumb|left|Garang in a crowd of supporters]]\nGarang refused to participate in the 1985 interim government or the 1986 elections, remaining a rebel leader. However, the SPLA and government signed a peace agreement on January 9, 2005, in [[Nairobi]], in Kenya. On July 9, 2005, he was sworn in as the First-Vice-President - the second most powerful person in the country - following a ceremony in which he and President [[Omar al-Bashir]] signed a power-sharing constitution. Simultaneously, he became the premier in southern Sudan. This administration had limited autonomy for six years, at the end of which there would be a scheduled referendum regarding secession.  No Christian or southerner had ever held such a high government post. Commenting after this ceremony, Garang stated, \"I congratulate the Sudanese people, this is not my peace or the peace of al-Bashir, it is the peace of the Sudanese people.\"\n\nIn the Hillcrest Hotel in [[Nairobi]] on New Year's Day 2003, there was a meeting between the SPLA and the [[Fur people]].

He had been returning from a meeting in [[Rwakitura]] with long-time ally President [[Yoweri Museveni]] of Uganda. He did not tell the Sudanese government that he was going to this meeting and therefore did not take the presidential plane. In fact, Garang had said he was going to spend the weekend in [[New Kush|New Cush]], a small village near the Kenyan borders founded by Garang himself. To this day neither the identity of any other participants at the meeting nor its purpose, are known. \n\nAfter the helicopter had been missing for more than 24 hours, the Ugandan president notified the Sudanese government, which in turn contacted the SPLM for information. The SPLM responded that the helicopter Garang was taking had landed safely on an old SPLA training camp. The Sudanese state television duly reported this. A few hours later, Abdel Basset Sabdarat, Sudan's Information Minister, then appeared on TV to refute the earlier report that Garang's helicopter landed safely. It was, in fact, Yasir Arman, the SPLA/M spokesperson, who had told the government that Garang's plane had landed safely and his intention, in doing so, was to buy time for internal succession arrangements within the SPLA, before Garang's death was to be declared. Garang's helicopter crashed on Friday and he remained 'missing' throughout Saturday. During this time, the government believed he was still resolving his affairs in Southern Sudan. Finally, a statement released by the office of the Sudanese President, [[Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir|Omar el-Bashir]], confirmed that the Ugandan presidential helicopter had crashed into \"a mountain range in southern Sudan because of poor visibility and this resulted in the death of Dr. John Garang DeMabior, six of his colleagues and seven Ugandan crew members.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudanese-vice-president-13-others,10893 |title=Sudanese vice president, 13 others, killed in air crash\n |author=Mohamed Osman  |work=South Tribune |date= 1 August 2005 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\nAccording to the Sudan Tribune John Garang's legacy was a major cornerstone in South Sudan's fight for independence.

Nhial Deng Nhial was the son of the famous leader of the southern Sudanese, [[William Deng Nhial]], who had been assassinated by the Sudanese army in 1968. William Deng Nhial had led the [[Sudan African National Union]] (SANU) in exile, but had returned to Sudan to take part in the 1968 elections, shortly before he was killed. It has been reported that Salva Kiir disagreed with the amnesty afforded to Riek Machar and Lam Akol after their coup attempt against Garang in 2003; he also disliked Garang's decision to give Machar a leadership position as his deputy. It is rumored that in response to these actions by Garang, Kiir threatened to lead an armed revolt against South Sudan's leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://southsudannewsagency.org/index.php/2014/03/10/who-killed-dr-john-garang/ |title=Who Killed Hero Dr John Garang? |author=Jesus Deng Chaui |work=South Sudan News Agency |date= 9 March 2014 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[First Sudanese Civil War]]\n*[[Second Sudanese Civil War]]\n*[[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* ''Aufstand in der Dreistadt'' by Thomas Schimidinger in ''Jungle World'' Nr.32: August 10, 2005; ISSN 1613-0766\n\n==Publications==\n*Garang, John, 1987 ''John Garang Speaks''.

He believed, for the people of Sudan to live in cohesion, they must not separate themselves into the many existing ethnic factions present within the nation but, rather, to collectively renounce the belief that Arabness, Black African-ness, Islam or Christianity were to be the ultimate defining characteristics of Sudan. Rather, he willed that citizens should embrace all cultures of Sudan, and to unify under the one commonality they all share, being Sudanese.\n\n==Rebel leader==\nIn 1983, Garang went to [[Bor town, Sudan|Bor]], ostensibly to pacify 500 southern government soldiers in Battalion 105 who were resisting being rotated to posts in the north. However, Garang was already part of a conspiracy among some officers in the Southern Command arranging for the defection of Battalion 105 to the anti-government rebels.  When the government attacked Bor in May and the battalion pulled out, Garang rode by an alternate route to join them in the rebel stronghold in Ethiopia.  By the end of July, Garang had brought over 3000 rebel soldiers under his control through the newly created  [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]/Movement (SPLA/M), which was opposed to military rule and Islamic dominance of the country, and encouraged other army garrisons to mutiny against the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] imposed on the country by the government.<ref name=\"battalion 105\">[[Douglas H.

Although Garang was Christian and most of southern Sudan is non-Muslim (mostly [[animist]]), he did not initially focus on the religious aspects of the war.\n[[File:John Garang of Sudan.jpg|thumb|John Garang of Sudan]]\n\nGarang had been fighting for a \"New Sudan\" since 1983. He was a strong advocate for national unity: minorities together formed a majority and therefore should rule. Together, Garang believed, they could replace President [[Omar al-Bashir]] with a government made up of representatives from \u201call tribes and religions in Sudan.\" His first real effort for the cause, under his command, occurred in July 1985 with the SPLA\u2019s incursion into Kordofan.<ref name=\"tester\">Cockett, R., 2010, Sudan: Darfur and the Failure of an African State, Yale UP.</ref>\n\nThe SPLA gained the backing of Libya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Garang and his army controlled a large part of the southern regions of the country, named ''New Sudan''. He claimed his troops' courage came from \"the conviction that we are fighting a just cause. That is something North Sudan and its people don't have.\" Critics suggested financial motivations to his rebellion, noting that much of Sudan's [[Petroleum|oil]] wealth lies in the south of the country.<ref name=\"tester\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1991, [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s regime (in Ethiopia) was overthrown by the Khartoum backed Ethiopian rebels ([[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]]). Upon the rebels\u2019 seizure of the government, they closed all SPLA training camps in Ethiopia and cut off the SPLA's arms supply, forcing the SPLA to return hundreds of thousands of Sudanese back to [[South Sudan]]. This disrupted military operations and leadership within the SPLA. However, this caused the West to reconsider relations with the SPLA \u2013 justifying their providing the SPLA with \"non-lethal help.\"<ref name=\"test\">Flint, J. and Alex de Waal, 2008 (2nd Edn), Darfur: A New History of a Long War, Zed Books.</ref>\n\nShortly after, there was an attempted coup to oust Garang by senior SPLA commanders, [[Riek Machar]] and [[Lam Akol]], in August 1991. The splinter group led by Machar and Akol was named the [[SPLA-Nasir]]. The coup turned out to be premature \u2013 however, it did expose the deep ethnic divides within the SPLA.  The Southern Sudanese communities became more divided than ever before in their history. These organic divides among the Southern Sudanese communities were exacerbated by the deliberate \"divide and rule\" policies instituted by the regimes in Khartoum, in order to maintain their power over the Southern Sudanese peoples.\n\n[[Image:John Garang in crowd.jpg|thumb|left|Garang in a crowd of supporters]]\nGarang refused to participate in the 1985 interim government or the 1986 elections, remaining a rebel leader. However, the SPLA and government signed a peace agreement on January 9, 2005, in [[Nairobi]], in Kenya.

Without Garang, many marginalized people of Africa, including that of Sudan would still be largely forgotten about in the modern world. \n\n[[File:Sudan Juba grave of John Garang 17jun2006.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Garang in [[Juba]], [[South Sudan]] - guarded by [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]]-soldiers]]\nHis body was flown to New Cush, a southern Sudanese settlement near the scene of the crash, where former rebel fighters and civilian supporters gathered to pay their respects to Garang.

There are, however, doubts as to whether this was the true cause, especially among the rank and file of the SPLA.  Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President, stated that the possibility of \"external factors\" having played a role could not be eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe SPLM/SPLA Rumbek crisis, which took place in Rumbek from November 29 to December 1, 2004; one month before the signing of the CPA is also believed to have been a factor relevant to John Garang's death.\n\nWhile the Sudanese people followed the Naivasha peace talks closely, with high hopes of freedom and democratic transformation, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement (SPLM) was rife with rumors and accusations of conspiracy relating to the removal of SPLM deputy Chairman, [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]], and his replacement with the young [[Nhial Deng Nhial]]. Nhial Deng Nhial was the son of the famous leader of the southern Sudanese, [[William Deng Nhial]], who had been assassinated by the Sudanese army in 1968. William Deng Nhial had led the [[Sudan African National Union]] (SANU) in exile, but had returned to Sudan to take part in the 1968 elections, shortly before he was killed. It has been reported that Salva Kiir disagreed with the amnesty afforded to Riek Machar and Lam Akol after their coup attempt against Garang in 2003; he also disliked Garang's decision to give Machar a leadership position as his deputy. It is rumored that in response to these actions by Garang, Kiir threatened to lead an armed revolt against South Sudan's leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://southsudannewsagency.org/index.php/2014/03/10/who-killed-dr-john-garang/ |title=Who Killed Hero Dr John Garang? |author=Jesus Deng Chaui |work=South Sudan News Agency |date= 9 March 2014 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[First Sudanese Civil War]]\n*[[Second Sudanese Civil War]]\n*[[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* ''Aufstand in der Dreistadt'' by Thomas Schimidinger in ''Jungle World'' Nr.32: August 10, 2005; ISSN 1613-0766\n\n==Publications==\n*Garang, John, 1987 ''John Garang Speaks''.

His childhood love of wrestling would go on to inspire the Mountain Goats' album ''[[Beat the Champ]]''.\n\nDarnielle attended [[Claremont High School (California)|Claremont High School]], located in the [[Pomona Valley]] region of [[Southern California]]. For a short time after high school, he lived in [[Portland, Oregon]],  where he developed an addiction to intravenous [[methamphetamine]] and other hard drugs (as referenced in ''[[We Shall All Be Healed]]''). Darnielle  worked in the psychiatric ward at the [[Metropolitan State Hospital (California)|Metropolitan State Hospital]] in [[Norwalk, California]].<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-slow-climb-how-the-mountain-goats-john-darnielle-became-the-best-storyteller-in-rock-227793/</ref> Darnielle attended [[Pitzer College]] from 1991 to 1995, earning a degree in English.\n\nThroughout his college education, he continued to record music. In 1992, Dennis Callaci, a friend of Darnielle's and owner of [[Shrimper Records]], released a tape of Darnielle\u2019s songs called ''[[Taboo VI: The Homecoming]]''. Around that time, the Mountain Goats were born and began touring with just Darnielle on guitar and a bassist, first Rachel Ware and then [[Peter Hughes (musician)|Peter Hughes]].\n\n==Musical career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2018}}\nDarnielle is best known for his role in the band [[the Mountain Goats]]. Since starting the band in 1991, he has gained a cult following. Despite being dubbed a [[lo-fi music|low fidelity]] artist, Darnielle has always dubbed his work \"bi-fi\", pointing out that recordings such as his couldn't be made without modern technology. He is known for his prolific output and literary lyrics. [[Sasha Frere-Jones]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', referred to him as \"America\u2019s best non-hip-hop lyricist\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Frere-Jones |first=Sasha |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crmu_music |title=The Declaimers |publisher=The New Yorker |date=May 16, 2005 |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref> In its June 2006 issue, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine named Darnielle one of the \"100 Best Living Songwriters\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Paste's 100 Best Living Songwriters #81-90|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2006/06/pastes-100-best-living-songwriters-8190.html|publisher=Paste|accessdate=December 26, 2011|date=June 14, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDarnielle has several series of songs with similar titles or storylines. A series entitled \"Going To...\" features small stories about various places and includes songs such as \"Going to Cleveland\", \"Going to Maryland\", \"Going to Georgia\", and \"Going to Queens\". This series explores the futility of running away from one's problems in stark and cryptic detail. His \"Alpha\" series is about a distressed couple's marriage and history, with such song titles as \"Alpha Incipiens\", \"Alphabetizing\", and \"Alpha Rats Nest\". The band's 2002 album ''[[Tallahassee (album)|Tallahassee]]'' was exclusively about the couple; there have subsequently been no more \"Alpha\" songs.\n\nDarnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on ''[[Tallahassee (album)|Tallahassee]]'' are fictional, but that ''[[We Shall All Be Healed]]'', ''[[The Sunset Tree]]'', and other more recent works are partially autobiographical.\n\n===Collaborations===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2018}}\nDarnielle is featured on [[Aesop Rock]]'s song \"Coffee\" (from the hip-hop artist's 2007 album ''[[None Shall Pass]]'') and appears in the corresponding music video. Additionally, Aesop Rock remixed the Mountain Goats' \"[[Lovecraft in Brooklyn]]\".\n\nHe collaborated with [[John Vanderslice]] on lyrics for the 2005 album ''[[Pixel Revolt]]'', and in 2009, Darnielle released a collaborative recording titled ''[[Moon Colony Bloodbath]]'', after a shared tour with Vanderslice. They toured under the collective name The Comedians, though their recording is attributed to \"the Mountain Goats and John Vanderslice\".\n\nIn 2008, Darnielle released a tour-exclusive EP entitled ''[[Black Pear Tree EP]]'', the result of a collaboration with tourmate [[Kaki King]].\n\nOn September 20, 2010, Darnielle appeared on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' with the band [[Superchunk]] (whose drummer, Jon Wurster, is also in the Mountain Goats). They performed the song \"[[Digging for Something]]\" with a positive reception.\n\nDarnielle appeared on [[Kimya Dawson]]'s 2011 album ''[[Thunder Thighs]]'', featured on the song \"Walk Like Thunder.\"\n\n==Writing==\nDarnielle's first book, ''Black Sabbath: Master of Reality'', was published in April 2008 as part of the [[33\u2153]] series.<ref>https://openlibrary.org/books/OL16897294M/Master_of_reality</ref> Unlike other entries in the series, which are non-fiction books that focus on an album's production or legacy, Darnielle's book on ''[[Master of Reality]]'' was instead a fictional narrative in the form of a [[novella]], centering around a young man held in a psychiatric facility in the mid-1980s who is attempting to retrieve his confiscated [[Walkman]] and tape of the album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Review: 33 1/3: Black Sabbath's Master of Reality by John

His childhood love of wrestling would go on to inspire the Mountain Goats' album ''[[Beat the Champ]]''.\n\nDarnielle attended [[Claremont High School (California)|Claremont High School]], located in the [[Pomona Valley]] region of [[Southern California]]. For a short time after high school, he lived in [[Portland, Oregon]],  where he developed an addiction to intravenous [[methamphetamine]] and other hard drugs (as referenced in ''[[We Shall All Be Healed]]''). Darnielle  worked in the psychiatric ward at the [[Metropolitan State Hospital (California)|Metropolitan State Hospital]] in [[Norwalk, California]]<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-slow-climb-how-the-mountain-goats-john-darnielle-became-the-best-storyteller-in-rock-227793/</ref>. Darnielle attended [[Pitzer College]] from 1991 to 1995, earning a degree in English.\n\nThroughout his college education, he continued to record music. In 1992, Dennis Callaci, a friend of Darnielle's and owner of [[Shrimper Records]], released a tape of Darnielle\u2019s songs called ''[[Taboo VI: The Homecoming]]''. Around that time, the Mountain Goats were born and began touring with just Darnielle on guitar and a bassist, first Rachel Ware and then [[Peter Hughes (musician)|Peter Hughes]].\n\n==Musical career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2018}}\nDarnielle is best known for his role in the band [[the Mountain Goats]]. Since starting the band in 1991, he has gained a cult following. Despite being dubbed a [[lo-fi music|low fidelity]] artist, Darnielle has always dubbed his work \"bi-fi\", pointing out that recordings such as his couldn't be made without modern technology. He is known for his prolific output and literary lyrics. [[Sasha Frere-Jones]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', referred to him as \"America\u2019s best non-hip-hop lyricist\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Frere-Jones |first=Sasha |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crmu_music |title=The Declaimers |publisher=The New Yorker |date=May 16, 2005 |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref> In its June 2006 issue, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine named Darnielle one of the \"100 Best Living Songwriters\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Paste's 100 Best Living Songwriters #81-90|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2006/06/pastes-100-best-living-songwriters-8190.html|publisher=Paste|accessdate=December 26, 2011|date=June 14, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDarnielle has several series of songs with similar titles or storylines. A series entitled \"Going To...\" features small stories about various places and includes songs such as \"Going to Cleveland\", \"Going to Maryland\", \"Going to Georgia\", and \"Going to Queens\". This series explores the futility of running away from one's problems in stark and cryptic detail. His \"Alpha\" series is about a distressed couple's marriage and history, with such song titles as \"Alpha Incipiens\", \"Alphabetizing\", and \"Alpha Rats Nest\". The band's 2002 album ''[[Tallahassee (album)|Tallahassee]]'' was exclusively about the couple; there have subsequently been no more \"Alpha\" songs.\n\nDarnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on ''[[Tallahassee (album)|Tallahassee]]'' are fictional, but that ''[[We Shall All Be Healed]]'', ''[[The Sunset Tree]]'', and other more recent works are partially autobiographical.\n\n===Collaborations===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2018}}\nDarnielle is featured on [[Aesop Rock]]'s song \"Coffee\" (from the hip-hop artist's 2007 album ''[[None Shall Pass]]'') and appears in the corresponding music video. Additionally, Aesop Rock remixed the Mountain Goats' \"[[Lovecraft in Brooklyn]]\".\n\nHe collaborated with [[John Vanderslice]] on lyrics for the 2005 album ''[[Pixel Revolt]]'', and in 2009, Darnielle released a collaborative recording titled ''[[Moon Colony Bloodbath]]'', after a shared tour with Vanderslice. They toured under the collective name The Comedians, though their recording is attributed to \"the Mountain Goats and John Vanderslice\".\n\nIn 2008, Darnielle released a tour-exclusive EP entitled ''[[Black Pear Tree EP]]'', the result of a collaboration with tourmate [[Kaki King]].\n\nOn September 20, 2010, Darnielle appeared on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' with the band [[Superchunk]] (whose drummer, Jon Wurster, is also in the Mountain Goats). They performed the song \"[[Digging for Something]]\" with a positive reception.\n\nDarnielle appeared on [[Kimya Dawson]]'s 2011 album ''[[Thunder Thighs]]'', featured on the song \"Walk Like Thunder.\"\n\n==Writing==\nDarnielle's first book, ''Black Sabbath: Master of Reality'', was published in April 2008 as part of the [[33\u2153]] series.<ref>https://openlibrary.org/books/OL16897294M/Master_of_reality</ref> Unlike other entries in the series, which are non-fiction books that focus on an album's production or legacy, Darnielle's book on ''[[Master of Reality]]'' was instead a fictional narrative in the form of a [[novella]], centering around a young man held in a psychiatric facility in the mid-1980s who is attempting to retrieve his confiscated [[Walkman]] and tape of the album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Review: 33 1/3: Black Sabbath's Master of Reality by John

He was hired at [[Wellington Fund]] and promoted to an assistant manager position in 1955, where he obtained a broader access to analyze the company and the investment department. Bogle demonstrated initiative and creativity by challenging the Wellington management to change its strategy of concentration on a single fund, and did his best to make his point in creating a new fund. Eventually he succeeded, and the new fund became a turning point in his career. After successfully climbing through the ranks, in 1970 he replaced Morgan as chairman of Wellington,{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} but was later fired for an \"extremely unwise\" merger that he approved.

Bogle's idea was that instead of beating the index and charging high costs, the index fund would mimic the index performance over the long run\u2014thus achieving higher returns with lower costs than the costs associated with actively managed funds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-thing-can-money-rebroadcast/|title=The Stupidest Thing You Can Do With Your Money (Ep. 297 Rebroadcast)|first=Greg|last=Rosalsky}}</ref>\n\nBogle's idea of index investing offers a clear yet prominent distinction between investment and speculations. The main difference between investment and speculation lies in the time horizon and the risk of capital. Investment is concerned with capturing returns on the long-run with lower risk of destruction of capital, while speculation is concerned with achieving returns over a short period of time, with potentially destructive risk to capital. The speculator is often only concerned with the price of a security and not the underlying business as a whole, the investor is concerned with the underlying business and not the price of the security. Even if a business is steady in cash flow, the market quotations of a security are anything but, as a result of speculators driving up prices and bringing down prices based on hope, fear and greed. Bogle believed this is an important analysis to be taken into account as short-term, risky investments have been flooding the financial markets.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Clash of Cultures: Investment vs. Speculation.|last = Bogle|first = John|publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nBogle is known for his insistence, in numerous media appearances and in writing, on the superiority of [[index fund]]s over traditional actively managed [[mutual funds]]. He contends that it is folly to attempt to pick actively managed mutual funds and expect their performance to beat a low-cost index fund over a long period of time, after accounting for the fees that actively managed funds charge.<ref name=BBC/>\n\nBogle argued for an approach to investing defined by simplicity and [[common sense]].

In 1947, Bogle graduated from Blair Academy ''[[cum laude]]'' and was accepted at [[Princeton University]], where he studied economics and investment. During his university years, Bogle studied the mutual fund industry.

He was hired at [[Wellington Fund]] and promoted to an assistant manager position in 1955, where he obtained a broader access to analyze the company and the investment department. Bogle demonstrated initiative and creativity by challenging the Wellington management to change its strategy of concentration on a single fund, and did his best to make his point in creating a new fund. Eventually he succeeded, and the new fund became a turning point in his career. After successfully climbing through the ranks, in 1970 he replaced Morgan as chairman of Wellington,{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} but was later fired for an \"extremely unwise\" merger that he approved. It was a poor decision that he considers his biggest mistake, stating, \"The great thing about that mistake, which was shameful and inexcusable and a reflection of immaturity and confidence beyond what the facts justified, was that I learned a lot.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Fortune Magazine interview |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/12/24/101939724/index.htm?postversion=2007121711 |accessdate=2007-12-17 | work=CNN | date=December 17, 2007 | first=Matthew | last=Boyle}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Bogle founded the Vanguard Company which is now one of the most respected and successful companies in the investment world.

Brennan]], his handpicked successor and second-in-command whom he had hired in 1982. Bogle had a successful heart transplant in 1996.

Bogle's idea was that instead of beating the index and charging high costs, the index fund would mimic the index performance over the long run\u2014thus achieving higher returns with lower costs than the costs associated with actively managed funds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-thing-can-money-rebroadcast/|title=The Stupidest Thing You Can Do With Your Money (Ep. 297 Rebroadcast)|first=Greg|last=Rosalsky}}</ref>\n\nBogle's idea of index investing offers a clear yet prominent distinction between investment and speculations. The main difference between investment and speculation lies in the time horizon and the risk of capital. Investment is concerned with capturing returns on the long-run with lower risk of destruction of capital, while speculation is concerned with achieving returns over a short period of time, with potentially destructive risk to capital. The speculator is often only concerned with the price of a security and not the underlying business as a whole, the investor is concerned with the underlying business and not the price of the security. Even if a business is steady in cash flow, the market quotations of a security are anything but, as a result of speculators driving up prices and bringing down prices based on hope, fear and greed. Bogle believed this is an important analysis to be taken into account as short-term, risky investments have been flooding the financial markets.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Clash of Cultures: Investment vs. Speculation.|last = Bogle|first = John|publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nBogle is known for his insistence, in numerous media appearances and in writing, on the superiority of [[index fund]]s over traditional actively managed [[mutual funds]]. He contends that it is folly to attempt to pick actively managed mutual funds and expect their performance to beat a low-cost index fund over a long period of time, after accounting for the fees that actively managed funds charge.<ref name=BBC/>\n\nBogle argued for an approach to investing defined by simplicity and [[common sense]].
