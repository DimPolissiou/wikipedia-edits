India. The [[Executive (government)|executive]] decisions are implemented by the Indian civil servants.\n\nIn the [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. These ministers are accountable to the legislatures which are also elected by the people on the basis of [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]]. The ministers are indirectly responsible to the people themselves. But the handful of ministers are not expected to deal personally with the various problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants to enforce it.\n\n====Cabinet secretary====\n{{Main|Cabinet Secretary of India}}\nThe cabinet secretary ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: {{IAST|Ma\u1e43trima\u1e47\u1e0dala Saciva}}) is the top-most executive official and [[Civil Services of India|senior-most civil servant]] of the Government of India. The cabinet secretary is the ''[[ex-officio]]'' head of the Civil Services Board, the [[Cabinet Secretariat of India|Cabinet Secretariat]], the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) and head of all civil services under the rules of business of the government.\n\nThe cabinet secretary is generally the senior-most officer of the [[Indian Administrative Service]].

The [[Supreme Court of India]] consists of the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice]] and 30 associate justices, all appointed by the president on the advice of the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice of India]]. The jury trials were abolished in India in the early 1960s, after the famous case ''[[KM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra|KM Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra]]'', for reasons of being vulnerable to media and public pressure, as well as to being misled.\n\nUnlike its United States counterpart, the Indian justice system consists of a unitary system at both state and union level.

It safeguards [[fundamental rights]] of citizens and settles disputes between various governments in the country. As an advisory court, it hears matters which may specifically be referred to it under the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] by the president. It also may take cognisance of matters on its own (or 'suo moto'), without anyone drawing its attention to them.

It is empowered to issue directions, orders or writs, including [[writ]]s in the nature of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[prohibition]]'', ''[[quo warranto]]'' and ''[[certiorari]]'' to enforce them. The supreme court has been conferred with power to direct transfer of any civil or criminal case from one state high court to another state high court, or from a court subordinate to another state high court and the supreme court. Although the proceedings in the supreme court arise out of the judgment or orders made by the subordinate courts, of late the supreme court has started entertaining matters in which interest of the public at large is involved. This may be done by any individual or group of persons either by filing a ''[[writ]] petition'' at the filing counter of the court, or by addressing a letter to the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice of India]], highlighting the question of public importance for redress.

These ministers are accountable to the legislatures which are also elected by the people on the basis of [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]]. The ministers are indirectly responsible to the people themselves. But the handful of ministers are not expected to deal personally with the various problems of modern administration.

(a subsidiary of Radio-Keith-Orpheum, aka: RKO)<ref>{{cite web |title=RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/RKO-Radio-Pictures-Inc |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=2018-11-07 |language=en |df=mdy-all}}</ref> it was one of the [[studio system|Big Five]] [[major film studio|studios]] of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s [[Cinema of the United States#Portrait of Classical Hollywood Cinema (1917\u20131960)|Golden Age]]. The business was formed after the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) theater chain and [[Joseph P. Kennedy|Joseph P. Kennedy's]] [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) studio were brought together under the control of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) in October 1928.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} RCA chief [[David Sarnoff]] engineered the merger to create a market for the company's [[sound-on-film]] technology, [[RCA Photophone]]. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor [[Floyd Odlum]].\n\nRKO has long been renowned for its cycle of musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors [[Katharine Hepburn]] and, later, [[Robert Mitchum]] had their first major successes at the studio. [[Cary Grant]] was a mainstay for years. The work of producer [[Val Lewton]]'s low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as [[film noir]] have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced two of the most famous films in motion picture history: ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. RKO was also responsible for notable co-productions such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and it also distributed many celebrated films by animation producer [[Walt Disney]] (from 1937 to the mid-1950s) and leading independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions|Samuel Goldwyn]].\n\nMaverick industrialist [[Howard Hughes]] took over RKO in 1948. After years of disarray and decline under his control, the studio was acquired by the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] in 1955. The original RKO Pictures ceased production in 1957 and was effectively dissolved two years later. In 1981, broadcaster [[RKO General]], the corporate heir, revived the studio as a production subsidiary, '''RKO Pictures Inc.''' In 1989, this business, with its remaining assets, including the [[trademarks]] and [[remake]] rights to many classic RKO films, was sold to new owners, who now operate the small independent company '''RKO Pictures LLC'''.\n\n==Origin of company==\nIn October 1927, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to convert from silent to [[sound film]] production en masse. The [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) controlled an advanced optical [[sound-on-film]] system, [[RCA Photophone|Photophone]], recently developed by [[General Electric]], RCA's parent company. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], Hollywood's other vanguard sound studio, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of [[AT&T (1885-2005)|AT&T]]'s [[Western Electric]] division. The industry's two largest companies, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's]]/[[MGM]], with two other [[major film studio|major studios]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]], were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 9; Lasky (1989), pp. 22\u201324; Gomery (1985), p. 60; Crafton (1997), pp. 129\u201331.</ref>\n\n[[Image:RadioKeithOrpheum.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Early Radio-Keith-Orpheum logo]]\nSeeking a customer for Photophone, in late 1927 [[David Sarnoff]], then general manager of RCA, approached [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO; Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of a plan for the company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live [[vaudeville]], was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of [[Path\u00e9 Exchange|Path\u00e9 (U.S.)]] and [[Cecil B. De Mille]] had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Path\u00e9, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] (PDC). This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.<ref name=Start>Goodwin (1987), pp. 375\u201379; Jewell (1982), pp. 9\u201310; Lasky (1989), pp. 25\u201327; Gomery (1985), pp. 63\u201365; Crafton (1997), pp. 136\u201339, 193\u201394.</ref><ref>\"Cinemerger\", ''Time'', May 2, 1927 (available [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,751696,00.html online]).</ref>{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}\n\nAfter an aborted attempt by Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had turned to him for help, First National, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company acquired Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced the creation of the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp. holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Path\u00e9 separate from RKO and under his personal control.<ref name=Start/><ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 28\u201329.</ref> RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent (in the early 1930s, its share would rise as high as 60 percent).<ref name=\"Crafton 1997, p. 210\">Crafton (1997), p. 210.</ref> On January 25, 1929, the new company's production arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I.

From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 279.</ref> RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, ''[[The Runaround (1931 film)|The Runaround]]'' and ''[[Fanny Foley Herself]]'' (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.<ref>Jewell (1982), pp. 38, 41.

''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1931), produced by LeBaron himself, would become the only RKO production to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]; nonetheless, having cost a profligate $1.4 million to make, it was a money-loser on original domestic release.<ref>Crafton (1997), p. 552; Lasky (1989), p. 55.</ref>{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} The most popular RKO star of this [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] era was [[Irene Dunne]], who made her debut as the lead in the 1930 musical ''[[Leathernecking]]'' and was a headliner at the studio for the entire decade.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 30.</ref> Other major performers included [[Joel McCrea]], [[Ricardo Cortez]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Mary Astor]].

Selznick]] to replace LeBaron as production chief.<ref>Lasky (1989), pp. 67\u201370.</ref> In addition to implementing rigorous cost-control measures, Selznick championed the unit production system, which gave the [[Film producer|producers]] of individual movies much greater independence than they had under the prevailing central producer system. \"Under the factory system of production you rob the director of his individualism\", said Selznick, \"and this being a creative industry that is harmful to the quality of the product made.\"<ref name=Bord321>Bordwell et al.

The British government imposed a 75 percent tax on films produced abroad; along with similarly confiscatory taxes and quota laws enacted by other countries, this led to a sharp decline in foreign revenues.<ref>Schatz (1999), pp. 299, 331; Lasky (1989), p. 202.</ref><ref name=J216>Jewell (1982), p. 216.</ref> The postwar attendance boom peaked sooner than expected and television emerged as a competitor for audience interest.

Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' Under the [[consent decree]] he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations\u2014RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.\u2014with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other.

In 1952, the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together under the rubric of RKO Teleradio Pictures. In 1959, following the breakup of the movie studio, the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire's (and, after its parent company's reorganization, [[GenCorp]]'s) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink bottling, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen years, the original [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]].<ref name=FU>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/GenCorp-Inc-Company-History.html|title=GenCorp Inc.\u2014Company History|publisher=Funding Universe|date=|access-date=2010-04-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe RKO General radio lineup included some of the highest rated, most influential popular music stations in North America. In May 1965, [[KHJ (AM)]] in Los Angeles introduced the [[Boss Radio]] variation of the [[top 40]] format. The restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO's other stations and imitated by non-RKO broadcasters around the country.<ref>Fong-Torres (2001), pp. 172\u201376; Denisoff (1986), pp. 242\u201351.</ref> RKO's FM station in New York pioneered numerous formats under a variety of call letters, including [[WRKS-FM#WOR-FM|WOR]] and [[WRKS-FM#WXLO 99X|WXLO]] (\"99X\"); in 1983, as [[WRKS-FM#WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM|WRKS]] (\"98.7 Kiss FM\"), it became one of the first major stations to regularly program [[hip hop music|rap music]].<ref>Keyes (2004), p. 99.</ref> In 1979, RKO General created the [[RKO Radio Network]], reportedly the first broadcasting web linked via satellite.<ref>Cox (2009), p. 198.</ref>\n\nThe company's television stations, for the most part non\u2013network affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of ''Million Dollar Movie'', launched by New York's [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]] in 1954.<ref>For the early history of ''Million Dollar Movie'' and WOR's film programming, see Segrave (1999), pp. 40, 48; \"News of TV and Radio; 'Studio One' Returns for the Winter Season\", ''New York Times'', September 19, 1954 (excerpted [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/million_dollar_movie/ online]); \"WOR-TV Acquires 10 Selznick Films; It Pays Record $198,000 for 'Package'\u2014Will Be Shown on 'Million Dollar Movie' Discord Theme of Show\", ''New York Times'', February 25, 1956; \"2 Feature Films Bought By WOR-TV; Station Adds 'Champion' and 'Home of the Brave' to its 'Million Dollar Movie,'\" ''New York Times'', June 16, 1956.</ref> In June 1962, RKO General and [[Zenith Electronics]] initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's [[WUVN|WHCT-TV]] aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges.<ref>\"Fee-Vee,\" ''Time'', July 6, 1962 (available [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940031,00.html online]); \"Payday, Some Day,\" ''Time'', December 27, 1968 (available [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900475,00.html online]); Mullen, Megan, \"The Prehistory of Pay Cable Television: An Overview and Analysis,\" ''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'', vol. 19, no. 1 (January 1, 1999).</ref> However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] pressure.

Crafton (1997) claims KAO had \"200 theaters\" at the time of RKO's founding (p.&nbsp;141), though he references no contemporary source. He does cite ''Film Daily'' in a description of RKO as controlling 250 theaters in 1930, following a \"buying binge\" (p.&nbsp;256). Schatz (1998) describes an \"RKO chain of 161 theaters\" around the time David O. Selznick became production chief in October 1931 (p.&nbsp;128). Schatz (1999) writes that as of 1940, RKO had \"slightly more than 100 theaters\" (p.&nbsp;17). He explains that \"the figures on studio-affiliated theaters vary considerably, owing to the number of houses in which the studios held only partial interest\u2014as little as 5 percent in some cases\" (p.&nbsp;484, n. 24). A 1944 book, ''Economic Control of the Motion Picture Industry'', includes the table \"Theater holdings of the major companies are approximately as follows\"\u2014RKO is listed as holding 222 theaters.<ref>Huettig (1944), p. 296.</ref> Lasky (1989) indicates that a 1953 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article tallied the RKO circuit in 1948, at the time of Hughes's purchase, at \"124 theaters, plus a share in about 75 others\" (p.&nbsp;205).\n|{{Note label|C|c|none}} The standard history and reference guide to the studio's films, ''The RKO Story'', by Richard B.

It is not listed in Schatz's (1999) appendix of annual top box-office films of the 1940s (p.&nbsp;466), based on a 1992 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reckoning, perhaps because of its unusual production history. Assuming Jewell's figure is accurate, and the Schatz/''Variety'' list is otherwise accurate and complete, ''Hitler's Children'' was the ninth biggest earner of 1943, a very impressive feat for a movie with a B budget and star (Tim Holt).\n|{{Note label|L|l|none}} Many online sources give RKO General's year of inception as 1958, without evidence; O'Neill's 1959 dating is supported by the fact that there is no mention of RKO General in either the ''New York Times'' or the ''Los Angeles Times'' before February 1960.\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Ballinger, Alexander, and Danny Graydon (2007).

In its original incarnation, as '''RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.''' (a subsidiary of Radio-Keith-Orpheum, aka: RKO)<ref>{{cite web |title=RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/RKO-Radio-Pictures-Inc |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=2018-11-07 |language=en |df=mdy-all}}</ref> it was one of the [[studio system|Big Five]] [[major film studio|studios]] of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s [[Cinema of the United States#Portrait of Classical Hollywood Cinema (1917\u20131960)|Golden Age]]. The business was formed after the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) theater chain and [[Joseph P. Kennedy|Joseph P. Kennedy's]] [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) studio were brought together under the control of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) in October 1928.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} RCA chief [[David Sarnoff]] engineered the merger to create a market for the company's [[sound-on-film]] technology, [[RCA Photophone]]. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor [[Floyd Odlum]].\n\nRKO has long been renowned for its cycle of musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors [[Katharine Hepburn]] and, later, [[Robert Mitchum]] had their first major successes at the studio. [[Cary Grant]] was a mainstay for years. The work of producer [[Val Lewton]]'s low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as [[film noir]] have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced two of the most famous films in motion picture history: ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. RKO was also responsible for notable co-productions such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and it also distributed many celebrated films by animation producer [[Walt Disney]] (from 1937 to the mid-1950s) and leading independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions|Samuel Goldwyn]].\n\nMaverick industrialist [[Howard Hughes]] took over RKO in 1948. After years of disarray and decline under his control, the studio was acquired by the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] in 1955. The original RKO Pictures ceased production in 1957 and was effectively dissolved two years later. In 1981, broadcaster [[RKO General]], the corporate heir, revived the studio as a production subsidiary, '''RKO Pictures Inc.''' In 1989, this business, with its remaining assets, including the [[trademarks]] and [[remake]] rights to many classic RKO films, was sold to new owners, who now operate the small independent company '''RKO Pictures LLC'''.\n\n==Origin of company==\nIn October 1927, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to convert from silent to [[sound film]] production en masse. The [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) controlled an advanced optical [[sound-on-film]] system, [[RCA Photophone|Photophone]], recently developed by [[General Electric]], RCA's parent company. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], Hollywood's other vanguard sound studio, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of [[AT&T (1885-2005)|AT&T]]'s [[Western Electric]] division. The industry's two largest companies, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's]]/[[MGM]], with two other [[major film studio|major studios]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]], were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 9; Lasky (1989), pp. 22\u201324; Gomery (1985), p. 60; Crafton (1997), pp. 129\u201331.</ref>\n\n[[Image:RadioKeithOrpheum.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Early Radio-Keith-Orpheum logo]]\nSeeking a customer for Photophone, in late 1927 [[David Sarnoff]], then general manager of RCA, approached [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO; Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of a plan for the company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live [[vaudeville]], was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of [[Path\u00e9 Exchange|Path\u00e9 (U.S.)]] and [[Cecil B. De Mille]] had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Path\u00e9, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] (PDC). This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.<ref name=Start>Goodwin (1987), pp. 375\u201379; Jewell (1982), pp. 9\u201310; Lasky (1989), pp. 25\u201327; Gomery (1985), pp. 63\u201365; Crafton (1997), pp. 136\u201339, 193\u201394.</ref><ref>\"Cinemerger\", ''Time'', May 2, 1927 (available [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,751696,00.html online]).</ref>{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}\n\nAfter an aborted attempt by Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had turned to him for help, First National, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company acquired Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business.

Retrieved 2010-05-03. Many other online resources make the same false claim or similar ones (e.g., that the RCA Photophone business was made part of RKO).<br />\nNote also the following:\n{{bulleted list\n| Many sources incorrectly describe Keith-Albee-Orpheum as the union of three theater chains; in fact the name describes the union of just two chains, B. F. Keith Corp. (doing business as Keith-Albee) and [[Orpheum Circuit Inc.]] [[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward F. Albee]] was [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Benjamin F. Keith]]'s right-hand man. He took over the company after the deaths of its founder, in 1914, and his son, A. Paul Keith, four years later.<ref>Haupert (2006), p. 17.</ref>\n| Many sources incorrectly give FBO's full name as \"Film Booking Office of America\"; the proper name is Film Booking Offices of America, which may be confirmed by examining its [[:Image:FBOlogo1926.jpg|official logo]].<ref>See also Sherwood (1923), pp. 150, 156, 158\u201359.</ref>\nAs an example of the many erroneous descriptions of RKO's early history that are routine even in reputable sources, take the summary history of the company's origins in ''Grand Design: Hollywood as a Modern Business Enterprise, 1930\u20131939'', by Tino Balio (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1995 [1993]), p.&nbsp;16. The following corrections must be made to a single paragraph:\n| FBO's full name was ''not'' \"Film Booking Office\" (see above).\n| RCA Photophone was ''not'' \"amalgamated\" with FBO and KAO under the Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company.<ref>See, e.g., Lasky (1989), p. 120.</ref>\n| The company did ''not'' \"contain\" anything close to \"three hundred theaters\" (see note b, below).\n| Until its acquisition of Path\u00e9 in 1931, RKO did ''not'' \"contain ... four studios\" in either sense of the term\u2014production company (it \"contained\" one: FBO) or permanent production facility (it had, even by a generous count, three: FBO's Hollywood studio, the small New York studio FBO shared with Path\u00e9, and the [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino]] [[movie ranch]] RKO established in 1929).\n}}\n|{{Note label|B|b|none}} The reference in Jewell (1982) to \"the 700 K-A-O Theatres in the US and Canada\" (p.&nbsp;10) is inaccurate. ''Time'' (1927) indicates that as of May 1927, Keith-Albee (legally the B. F. Keith Corp.) had 50 theaters and Orpheum had 47. Crafton (1997) claims KAO had \"200 theaters\" at the time of RKO's founding (p.&nbsp;141), though he references no contemporary source. He does cite ''Film Daily'' in a description of RKO as controlling 250 theaters in 1930, following a \"buying binge\" (p.&nbsp;256). Schatz (1998) describes an \"RKO chain of 161 theaters\" around the time David O. Selznick became production chief in October 1931 (p.&nbsp;128). Schatz (1999) writes that as of 1940, RKO had \"slightly more than 100 theaters\" (p.&nbsp;17). He explains that \"the figures on studio-affiliated theaters vary considerably, owing to the number of houses in which the studios held only partial interest\u2014as little as 5 percent in some cases\" (p.&nbsp;484, n. 24). A 1944 book, ''Economic Control of the Motion Picture Industry'', includes the table \"Theater holdings of the major companies are approximately as follows\"\u2014RKO is listed as holding 222 theaters.<ref>Huettig (1944), p. 296.</ref> Lasky (1989) indicates that a 1953 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article tallied the RKO circuit in 1948, at the time of Hughes's purchase, at \"124 theaters, plus a share in about 75 others\" (p.&nbsp;205).\n|{{Note label|C|c|none}} The standard history and reference guide to the studio's films, ''The RKO Story'', by Richard B. Jewell, with Vernon Harbin (New York: Arlington House/Crown, 1982) is used as the final arbiter of whether specific films made between 1929 and 1957 were RKO solo productions, coproductions, or completely independent productions. Official year of release is also per ''The RKO Story''.\n|{{Note label|D|d|none}} Only one previous sound film had cost more than $1 million, and just barely: ''Noah's Ark'' (1929), from Warner Bros.<ref>Crafton (1997), p. 549.</ref>\n|{{Note label|E|e|none}} For the switch to the RKO Radio Pictures brand at the beginning of the 1932\u201333 exhibition season for U.S. print advertising, see, e.g., [[:File:Most Dangerous Game poster.jpg|this original poster]] for ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', which premiered September 9, 1932.<ref>Senn (1996), p. 109.</ref>\n|{{Note label|F|f|none}} Among still-ascendant male stars, Grant was preceded by the more established [[Fredric March]] as a freelancer. For other freelance Hollywood performers of the mid-1930s, see Balio (1995), p.&nbsp;155.\n|{{Note label|G|g|none}} By August 1940, the lease was no longer exclusive\u2014see \"Screen News Here and in Hollywood,\" ''New York Times'', August 28, 1940. By mid-1949, Selznick had left the studio entirely\u2014see two articles by Thomas F. Brady: \"Republic to Make Film on Baseball,\" ''New York Times'', April 8, 1949; and \"Hollywood Buys More Stories,\" ''New York Times'', May 1, 1949.\n|{{Note label|H|h|none}} Schatz's (1999) brief description of ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' as a \"critical and commercial failure\" (p.&nbsp;89) is evidently incorrect. According to historian Leonard Leff, \"''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' had a happy ending: good reviews and modest box office success.\"<ref>Leff (1999), p. 92.</ref> Ed Sikov agrees, calling it a \"solid commercial hit\".<ref>Sikov (1996), p. 152.</ref> Donald Spoto's report on its release lends further support to this position.<ref>Spoto (1983), p. 250.</ref>\n|{{Note label|I|i|none}} Though ''Citizen Kane'' was technically structured through a set of three contracts originally drawn up in 1939 as a coproduction between RKO and Welles's then newly formed Mercury Productions Inc. (and, indeed, was billed on a title card as \"A Mercury Production\"), in bottom-line terms it was an RKO production: the studio provided the entire budget and production facilities, assumed all the financial risk, and held all the rights once Welles delivered his final, inviolable cut.<ref name=\"CKAFI\"/><ref>Carringer (1985), pp. 1, p. 151 n. I-1.</ref>\n|{{Note label|J|j|none}} ''Citizen Kane'' lost $150,000\u2013$160,000 on original release (the production cost was precisely $805,527.53); ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' lost $624,000 (production cost $1.125 million); and the unreleased ''It's All True'' cost the studio an estimated $1.2 million.<ref>For ''Citizen Kane'': Brady (1990), pp. 288, 311; Jewell (1982), p. 164. For ''The Magnificent Ambersons'': Jewell (1982), p. 173. For ''It's All True'': Brady (1990), p. 346. For corporate deficit and profit: Jewell (1982), pp. 144, 156.</ref> Note that the studio operation itself was almost certainly a bigger money-loser than the cited figures suggest, with profits coming from the corporation's theatrical division.<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 168.</ref>\n|{{Note label|K|k|none}} Jewell (1982) states that it \"attracted $3,355,000 in film rentals\" (p.&nbsp;181); Lasky (1989) refers to an article in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' on the film, published seven months after its premiere, predicting it \"would do better than $3 million in the U.S. alone\" (p.&nbsp;185). It is not listed in Schatz's (1999) appendix of annual top box-office films of the 1940s (p.&nbsp;466), based on a 1992 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reckoning, perhaps because of its unusual production history. Assuming Jewell's figure is accurate, and the Schatz/''Variety'' list is otherwise accurate and complete, ''Hitler's Children'' was the ninth biggest earner of 1943, a very impressive feat for a movie with a B budget and star (Tim Holt).\n|{{Note label|L|l|none}} Many online sources give RKO General's year of inception as 1958, without evidence; O'Neill's 1959 dating is supported by the fact that there is no mention of RKO General in either the ''New York Times'' or the ''Los Angeles Times'' before February 1960.\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Ballinger, Alexander, and Danny Graydon (2007).

She was one of 20 women slaves given to the Spaniards by the natives of [[Tabasco]] in 1519.{{sfn|Thomas|1993|p=171\u2013172}} Later, she gave birth to Cort\u00e9s's first son, [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s (son of Malinche)|Mart\u00edn]], who is considered one of the first [[Mestizos]] (people of mixed [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[indigenous American]] ancestry).\n\nThe historical figure of Marina has been intermixed with Aztec legends (such as that of [[La Llorona]], a ghost woman who weeps for her lost children).{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=7}} Her reputation has been altered over the years according to changing social and political perspectives, especially after the Mexican Revolution, when she was portrayed in dramas, novels, and paintings as an evil or scheming temptress.{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=12-13}} In Mexico today, La Malinche remains iconically potent. She is understood in various and often conflicting aspects as the embodiment of treachery, the quintessential victim, or simply as symbolic mother of the new Mexican people.\n\nThe term ''[[malinchista]]'' refers to a disloyal compatriot, especially in Mexico.\n\nBecause of her controversial signification, a statue of La Malinche, Cort\u00e9s, and their son Mart\u00edn was removed soon after it was erected in Coyoacan, in the outskirts of Mexico City, in 1982. The statue was intended to be respectful of her trials and to emphasize the mestizo (or mixed-blood) character of the nation. However, student protests erupted: the protesters wanted no monument that presented La Malinche in a positive light, for in their minds she was too closely associated with domination by outsiders and with betrayal.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]] (2006).

Although the shortened form \u201cMalintze\u201d is unusual, it appears repeatedly in the ''[[Anales de Tlatelolco|Annals of Tlatelolco]]'', alongside \u201cMalintzine\u201d.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=242}}}} Another possibility is that the Spaniards simply did not hear the 'whispered' {{lang|nah|-n}} of the name ''Malintzin''.{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=353}}\n\nHer name at birth is unknown.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=352}}{{sfn|Restall|2018|p=xiii}} It has been popularly assumed since at least the 19th century{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}} that she was originally named 'Malinalli'{{efn|Also Malinal,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=33}} Ce-Malinalli,{{sfn|Herrera-Sobek|2005|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Valde\u00f3n|2013|pp=163\u2013164}} and so forth.}} (Nahuatl for 'grass'), after the [[Aztec calendar#Day signs|day sign]] on which she was supposedly born,{{sfn|Downs|2008|p=398}} and that Marina was chosen as her [[Christian name]] on account of [[Phonetics|phonetic]] similarity,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=33}} but modern historians have rejected these propositions.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}} The Nahuas associate the day sign 'Malinalli' with bad or even 'evil' connotations,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Downs|2008|p=398}}{{sfn|Cypess|1991|pp=60\u201361}} and they are known to avoid using such day signs as personal names.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=191}} Moreover, there would be little reason for the Spaniards to ask the natives what their personal names were before christening them with similar-sounding [[Spanish name]]s.{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=6}}\n\nAnother title that is often assumed to be part of her original name is \u201cTenepal\u201d. This, according to the linguist and historian [[Frances Karttunen]], originated as an annotation made by the Nahua historian [[Chimalpahin]] on his copy of G\u00f3mara's biography of Cort\u00e9s, which says that Marina was also known as \"Malintzin Tenepal\".{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}} Tenepal is probably derived from the Nahuatl [[Root (linguistics)|root]] {{lang|nah|tene}} which means \u201clip-possessor, one who speaks vigorously\u201d{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=352}} or \u201cone who has a facility with words\u201d,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=181}} and [[postposition]] {{lang|nah|-pal}}, which means \u201cby means of\u201d.{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=352}} Thus, Malintzin Tenepal is most likely intended to be a direct translation of Spanish {{lang|es|do\u00f1a Marina la lengua}},{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=353}} with {{lang|es|la lengua}} (\"the interpreter\", literally \"the tongue\"{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=4}}) being her Spanish [[sobriquet]].{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}}\n\n== Life ==\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Codex azcatitlan222.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|[[Codex Azcatitlan]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and Malinche (far right), early 16th-century indigenous pictorial manuscript of the conquest of Mexico]]\nMalinche's birthdate is unknown,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=33}} but it is estimated to be around 1500, and likely no later than 1505.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=11}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=1}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Karttunen|1994|p=1}} gives \"{{abbr|ca.|circa}} 1500\" for her birth year, while {{harvtxt|Townsend|2006|p=11}} writes that she was born before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (who was born in February 1500) turned five.}} She was born in an {{lang|nah|[[altepetl]]}} that was either a part or a [[tributary state|tributary]] of a Mesoamerican state whose center was located on the bank of the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] to the east of the Aztec Empire.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=13\u201314}}{{efn|Malinche's homeland never became part of the Aztec Empire.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=522}}{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=13\u201314}} Around the time of the conquest, the region probably consisted of \u201csmall, loosely allied city-states\u201d{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=522}} with some degree of influences from the Aztecs and various Maya states, but most are relatively autonomous and paid tribute to no one.{{sfn|Chapman|1957|pp=116\u2013117}}}} Records disagree about the exact name of the {{lang|nah|altepetl}} where she was born into.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}} In three unrelated legal proceedings that occurred not long after her death, various witnesses who claimed to have known her personally, including her own daughter, said that she was born in [[Oluta|Olutla]]. The {{lang|es|probanza}} of her grandson also mentioned Olutla as her birthplace.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}} Her daughter also added that the {{lang|nah|altepetl}} of Olutla was related to Tetiquipaque, although the nature of this relationship is unclear.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=13\u201314}} In the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', Malinche's homeland is mentioned as \"Teticpac\", which could be the singular form of Tetiquipaque.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}} G\u00f3mara writes that she came from \"Uiluta\" (presumably a variant of ''Olutla''), although he departs from other sources by writing that it was in the region of [[Jalisco]]. D\u00edaz, on the other hand, gives \"Painalla\" as her birthplace.{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}}{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}}\n\nHer family is reported to be of noble background;{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}} G\u00f3mara writes that her father was related to a local ruler,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=16\u201317, 233}} while D\u00edaz recounts that her parents themselves were rulers.{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=5}} Townsend notes that while Olutla at the time probably had a [[Popoluca]] majority, the ruling elite, which Malinche supposedly belonged to, would have been Nahuatl-speaking.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=16\u201317, 233}} Another hint that supports her noble origin is her apparent ability to understand the courtly language of {{lang|nah|[[Nahuatl#Stylistics|tecpillahtolli]]}} (\u201clordly speech\u201d), a Nahuatl [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] that is significantly different from the commoner's speech and has to be learned.{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}}{{sfn|Restall|2003|pp=97\u201398}} The fact that she was often referred to as a {{lang|es|do\u00f1a}}, at the time when it was not commonly used even in Spain, also indicates that she was viewed as a noblewoman,{{sfn|Valde\u00f3n|2013|pp=163\u2013164}} although it is also possible that the honorific was attributed to her because of her important role in the conquest.{{sfn|Restall|2018|p=xiii}}\n\nProbably between the age of 8 and 12,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=22\u201324}} Malinche was either sold or kidnapped into slavery.{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=353}}{{sfn|Restall|2003|p=82}} D\u00edaz famously wrote that after her father's death, she was given away to merchants by her mother and stepfather so that their own son (Malinche's stepbrother) could succeed as [[heir]].{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=22\u201324}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}} Some scholars, historians and literary critics alike, have cast doubt upon D\u00edaz's account of her origin.{{sfn|Valde\u00f3n|2013|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=23\u201324}}{{sfn|Franco|1999|pp=76\u201378}} Nevertheless, Townsend considers it likely that some of her people were complicit in [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] her, regardless of the reason.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=22}} Malinche was taken to Xicalango,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=25\u201326}} a major port city in the region.{{sfn|Chapman|1957|pp=135\u2013136}} She was later purchased by a group of Chontal Maya who brought her to the town of Potonch\u00e1n.

She was one of 20 women slaves given to the Spaniards by the natives of [[Tabasco]] in 1519.{{sfn|Thomas|1993|p=171\u2013172}} Later, she gave birth to Cort\u00e9s's first son, [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s (son of Malinche)|Mart\u00edn]], who is considered one of the first [[Mestizos]] (people of mixed [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[indigenous American]] ancestry).\n\nThe historical figure of Marina has been intermixed with Aztec legends (such as that of [[La Llorona]], a ghost woman who weeps for her lost children).{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=7}} Her reputation has been altered over the years according to changing social and political perspectives, especially after the Mexican Revolution, when she was portrayed in dramas, novels, and paintings as an evil or scheming temptress.{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=12-13}} In Mexico today, La Malinche remains iconically potent. She is understood in various and often conflicting aspects as the embodiment of treachery, the quintessential victim, or simply as symbolic mother of the new Mexican people.\n\nThe term ''[[malinchista]]'' refers to a disloyal compatriot, especially in Mexico.\n\nBecause of her controversial signification, a statue of La Malinche, Cort\u00e9s, and their son Mart\u00edn was removed soon after it was erected in Coyoacan, in the outskirts of Mexico City, in 1982. The statue was intended to be respectful of her trials and to emphasize the mestizo (or mixed-blood) character of the nation. However, student protests erupted: the protesters wanted no monument that presented La Malinche in a positive light, for in their minds she was too closely associated with domination by outsiders and with betrayal.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]] (2006).

Although the shortened form \u201cMalintze\u201d is unusual, it appears repeatedly in the ''[[Anales de Tlatelolco|Annals of Tlatelolco]]'', alongside \u201cMalintzine\u201d.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=242}}}} Another possibility is that the Spaniards simply did not hear the 'whispered' {{lang|nah|-n}} of the name ''Malintzin''.{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=353}}\n\nHer name at birth is unknown.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=352}}{{sfn|Restall|2018|p=xiii}} It has been popularly assumed since at least the 19th century{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}} that she was originally named 'Malinalli'{{efn|Also Malinal,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=33}} Ce-Malinalli,{{sfn|Herrera-Sobek|2005|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Valde\u00f3n|2013|pp=163\u2013164}} and so forth.}} (Nahuatl for 'grass'), after the [[Aztec calendar#Day signs|day sign]] on which she was supposedly born,{{sfn|Downs|2008|p=398}} and that Marina was chosen as her [[Christian name]] on account of [[Phonetics|phonetic]] similarity,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=33}} but modern historians have rejected these propositions.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}} The Nahuas associate the day sign 'Malinalli' with bad or even 'evil' connotations,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Downs|2008|p=398}}{{sfn|Cypess|1991|pp=60\u201361}} and they are known to avoid using such day signs as personal names.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=12}}{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=191}} Moreover, there would be little reason for the Spaniards to ask the natives what their personal names were before christening them with similar-sounding [[Spanish name]]s.{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=6}}\n\nAnother title that is often assumed to be part of her original name is \u201cTenepal\u201d. This, according to the linguist and historian [[Frances Karttunen]], originated as an annotation made by the Nahua historian [[Chimalpahin]] on his copy of G\u00f3mara's biography of Cort\u00e9s, which says that Marina was also known as \"Malintzin Tenepal\".{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}} Tenepal is probably derived from the Nahuatl [[Root (linguistics)|root]] {{lang|nah|tene}} which means \u201clip-possessor, one who speaks vigorously\u201d{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=352}} or \u201cone who has a facility with words\u201d,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=181}} and [[postposition]] {{lang|nah|-pal}}, which means \u201cby means of\u201d.{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=352}} Thus, Malintzin Tenepal is most likely intended to be a direct translation of Spanish {{lang|es|do\u00f1a Marina la lengua}},{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=353}} with {{lang|es|la lengua}} (\"the interpreter\", literally \"the tongue\"{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=4}}) being her Spanish [[sobriquet]].{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|p=302}}\n\n== Life ==\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Codex azcatitlan222.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|[[Codex Azcatitlan]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and Malinche (far right), early 16th-century indigenous pictorial manuscript of the conquest of Mexico]]\nMalinche's birthdate is unknown,{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=33}} but it is estimated to be around 1500, and likely no later than 1505.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|p=11}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=1}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Karttunen|1994|p=1}} gives \"{{abbr|ca.|circa}} 1500\" for her birth year, while {{harvtxt|Townsend|2006|p=11}} writes that she was born before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (who was born in February 1500) turned five.}} She was born in an {{lang|nah|[[altepetl]]}} that was either a part or a [[tributary state|tributary]] of a Mesoamerican state whose center was located on the bank of the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] to the east of the Aztec Empire.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=13\u201314}}{{efn|Malinche's homeland never became part of the Aztec Empire.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=522}}{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=13\u201314}} Around the time of the conquest, the region probably consisted of \u201csmall, loosely allied city-states\u201d{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=522}} with some degree of influences from the Aztecs and various Maya states, but most are relatively autonomous and paid tribute to no one.{{sfn|Chapman|1957|pp=116\u2013117}}}} Records disagree about the exact name of the {{lang|nah|altepetl}} where she was born into.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}} In three unrelated legal proceedings that occurred not long after her death, various witnesses who claimed to have known her personally, including her own daughter, said that she was born in [[Oluta|Olutla]]. The {{lang|es|probanza}} of her grandson also mentioned Olutla as her birthplace.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}} Her daughter also added that the {{lang|nah|altepetl}} of Olutla was related to Tetiquipaque, although the nature of this relationship is unclear.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=13\u201314}} In the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', Malinche's homeland is mentioned as \"Teticpac\", which could be the singular form of Tetiquipaque.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}} G\u00f3mara writes that she came from \"Uiluta\" (presumably a variant of ''Olutla''), although he departs from other sources by writing that it was in the region of [[Jalisco]]. D\u00edaz, on the other hand, gives \"Painalla\" as her birthplace.{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}}{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=230\u2013232}}\n\nHer family is reported to be of noble background;{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}} G\u00f3mara writes that her father was related to a local ruler,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=16\u201317, 233}} while D\u00edaz recounts that her parents themselves were rulers.{{sfn|Karttunen|1994|p=5}} Townsend notes that while Olutla at the time probably had a [[Popoluca]] majority, the ruling elite, which Malinche supposedly belonged to, would have been Nahuatl-speaking.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=16\u201317, 233}} Another hint that supports her noble origin is her apparent ability to understand the courtly language of {{lang|nah|[[Nahuatl#Stylistics|tecpillahtolli]]}} (\u201clordly speech\u201d), a Nahuatl [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] that is significantly different from the commoner's speech and has to be learned.{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}}{{sfn|Restall|2003|pp=97\u201398}} The fact that she was often referred to as a {{lang|es|do\u00f1a}}, at the time when it was not commonly used even in Spain, also indicates that she was viewed as a noblewoman,{{sfn|Valde\u00f3n|2013|pp=163\u2013164}} although it is also possible that the honorific was attributed to her because of her important role in the conquest.{{sfn|Restall|2018|p=xiii}}\n\nProbably between the age of 8 and 12,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=22\u201324}} Malinche was either sold or kidnapped into slavery.{{sfn|Karttunen|2001|p=353}}{{sfn|Restall|2003|p=82}} D\u00edaz famously wrote that after her father's death, she was given away to merchants by her mother and stepfather so that their own son (Malinche's stepbrother) could succeed as [[heir]].{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=22\u201324}}{{sfn|Karttunen|1997|pp=299\u2013301}} Some scholars, historians and literary critics alike, have cast doubt upon D\u00edaz's account of her origin.{{sfn|Valde\u00f3n|2013|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=23\u201324}}{{sfn|Franco|1999|pp=76\u201378}} Nevertheless, Townsend considers it likely that some of her people were complicit in [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] her, regardless of the reason.{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=22}} Malinche was taken to Xicalango,{{sfn|Townsend|2006|pp=25\u201326}} a major port city in the region.{{sfn|Chapman|1957|pp=135\u2013136}} She was later purchased by a group of Chontal Maya who brought her to the town of Potonch\u00e1n.

Throughout the history of the program, nearly 63,000 undergraduate students<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/contact/about-us/|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> from more than 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.\n\nDuring the spring and fall semesters, up to 600 undergraduates<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/life-at-sea/our-ship/|title=Our Ship|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Semester at Sea|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> participate in the approximately 100\u2013110-day program. During this semester, the ship circumnavigates the globe, traveling from [[North America]] and heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Previously, the program had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.\n\nFor many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that focused on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrollment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or traveling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are also required to take an interdisciplinary core course, called [[Global studies|Global Studies.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223032/https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-12-15|title=Course Information|format=PDF}}</ref> While in port, no classes are held and students can travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently in the country,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes & program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> however, travel outside the country of a port is strictly prohibited, resulting in the student's dismissal from the program.\n\nAlthough [[Colorado State University]] is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world, including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[George Washington University]], [[Boston University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[California Lutheran University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Bentley University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]], [[Cornell University]], [[Jacksonville University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Michigan]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Virginia]], [[University of Colorado]], [[University of Maine]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].\n\nBefore arriving at a port, students receive a pre-port briefing regarding the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. Upon arrival at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and the guest lectures are intended to help prepare students for their time in the country.\n\n== Notable lecturers and guests<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/experts/|title=Faculty & Staff - your expert education team {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> ==\n*[[Fidel Castro]], Cuban President\n*[[Anwar Sadat]], Egyptian President\n*[[Indira Gandhi]], Indian Prime Minister\n*[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], USSR President\n*[[Corazon Aquino]], President of the Philippines\n*[[King Mohammed VI of Morocco]], King of Morocco\n*[[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]], Prince of Morocco\n*[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Mother Teresa]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Nelson Mandela]], First Black President of South Africa, Nobel Laureate\n*[[Arthur C.

Students are transformed from \"[[Polywog|polywogs]]\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travelers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The students on board the MV ''World Odyssey'' were rerouted to Vietnam where students received an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.

During this semester, the ship circumnavigates the globe, traveling from [[North America]] and heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Previously, the program had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.\n\nFor many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that focused on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrollment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or traveling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary.

In Fall 2019, Semester at Sea embarked on a new voyage that included ports such as the Netherlands, [[Poland]], the [[Kiel Canal]] Transit, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Croatia]], Morocco, Ghana, [[Brazil]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Panama Canal]] Transit, [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey|website=Semester At Sea|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n \nThe ship docked in [[Denmark]] during Summer 2008,<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Semester at Sea \u2013 Summer 2008 Itinerary/Calendar\n |url         = http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703042836/http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |archivedate = 2008-07-03\n}}</ref> [[Namibia]] during Fall 2008, [[Bulgaria]] during Summer 2009, and [[Senegal]] during Fall 2015, the first time in the history of the program that Semester at Sea had visited these countries.\n\n== Traditions ==\n=== Neptune Day celebration ===\nWhen the ship crosses the equator, the students, faculty and crew of the vessel celebrate [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] Day, a maritime [[line-crossing ceremony]]. Students are transformed from \"[[Polywog|polywogs]]\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay. The teams compete for the opportunity to disembark the ship first in its final port of call as well as a celebration in the faculty/staff-only lounge.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n*[[Joan Lunden]], F67 \u2013 TV Host\n*[[Joel Douglas]], F67 \u2013 Film Producer \u2013 ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''\n*[[Stephen Gaghan]], F86 \u2013 Emmy and Oscar Winning Screenwriter, ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''\n*[[Cynthia Nixon]], S86 \u2013 Emmy Winning Actress \u2013 \"Miranda\" on TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and challenged Andrew Cuomo<ref>[[Andrew Cuomo]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} in the 2018 New York Gubernatorial Election.\n*[[Richard Lamm]], S91 \u2013 Former Governor of [[Colorado]]\n*[[Arthur C.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travelers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of quarantine when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.

There are plans to link the Maputo Reserve with [[Tembe Elephant Park]] of South Africa in the large cross-border [[Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area]], which would allow elephants to roam more freely. There is little game left along this coast outside of the reserves.\n[[image:Ndumo Game Reserve (32232413682).jpg|thumb|left|750px|Woodlands of [[Ndumo Game Reserve]]]]\n{{-}}\n==External links==\n*{{WWF ecoregion|name=Maputaland coastal forest mosaic|id=at0119}}\n\n[[Category:Afrotropic ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Eswatini]]\n[[Category:Flora of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southern Africa]]\n[[Category:Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]]\n\n\n{{ecoregion-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Tom Radulovich", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThreats and preservation:direct link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputaland_coastal_forest_mosaic"}
