So he equipped two hundred boats full of men, as many others full of gold, water and victuals sufficient enough for several years. He ordered the chief (admiral) not to return until they had reached the extremity of the ocean, or if they had exhausted the provisions and the water. They set out. Their absence extended over a long period, and, at last, only one boat returned. On our questioning, the captain said: 'Prince, we have navigated for a long time, until we saw in the midst of the ocean as if a big river was flowing violently. My boat was the last one; others were ahead of me. As soon as any of them reached this place, it drowned in the whirlpool and never came out. I sailed backwards to escape this current.' But the Sultan would not believe him. He ordered two thousand boats to be equipped for him and for his men, and one thousand more for water and victuals.

The creation of a recession of that magnitude could have purposeful. After all, Cairo was the leading gold market at the time (where people went to purchase large amounts of gold). In order to relocate these markets to [[Timbuktu]] or [[Gao]], Musa would have to first affect Cairo's gold economy. While this claim seems to be a stretch,{{cn|date=March 2020}} Musa made a major point of showing off his nation's wealth.

Most notably, the ancient center of learning [[Sankore Madrasah]] (or University of Sankore) was constructed during his reign.\n\nIn Niani, Musa built the Hall of Audience, a building communicating by an interior door to the royal palace. It was \"an admirable Monument\", surmounted by a dome and adorned with [[arabesque]]s of striking colors.

He ordered the chief (admiral) not to return until they had reached the extremity of the ocean, or if they had exhausted the provisions and the water. They set out. Their absence extended over a long period, and, at last, only one boat returned. On our questioning, the captain said: 'Prince, we have navigated for a long time, until we saw in the midst of the ocean as if a big river was flowing violently. My boat was the last one; others were ahead of me. As soon as any of them reached this place, it drowned in the whirlpool and never came out. I sailed backwards to escape this current.' But the Sultan would not believe him. He ordered two thousand boats to be equipped for him and for his men, and one thousand more for water and victuals.

Most notably, the ancient center of learning [[Sankore Madrasah]] (or University of Sankore) was constructed during his reign.\n\nIn Niani, Musa built the Hall of Audience, a building communicating by an interior door to the royal palace. It was \"an admirable Monument\", surmounted by a dome and adorned with [[arabesque]]s of striking colours. The wooden window frames of an upper storey were plated with silver foil; those of a lower storey with gold. Like the Great Mosque, a contemporaneous and grandiose structure in Timbuktu, the Hall was built of cut stone.\n\nDuring this period, there was an advanced level of urban living in the major centers of Mali. Sergio Domian, an Italian scholar of art and architecture, wrote of this period: \"Thus was laid the foundation of an urban civilization.

Gao had already been captured by Musa's general, and Musa quickly regained Timbuktu, built a rampart and stone fort, and placed a standing army to protect the city from future invaders.<ref>De Villiers and Hirtle, pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\nWhile Musa's palace has since vanished, the university and mosque still stand in Timbuktu today.\n\nBy the end of Mansa Musa's reign, the Sankor\u00e9 University had been converted into a fully staffed University with the largest collections of books in Africa since the [[Library of Alexandria]].

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015).

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

{"title_page": "Load balancing (computing)", "text_new": "[[File:Elasticsearch Cluster August 2014.png|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating user requests to an [[Elasticsearch]] cluster being distributed by a load balancer. (Example for [[Wikipedia]].)]]\nIn [[computing]], '''load balancing''' refers to the process of distributing a set of [[Task (computing)|tasks]] over a set of [[System resource|resources]] (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing techniques can optimise the response time for each task, avoiding unevenly overloading compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.\n\nLoad balancing is the subject of research in the field of [[parallel computers]]. Two main approaches exist: static algorithms, which do not take into account the state of the different machines, and dynamic algorithms, which are usually more general and more efficient, but require exchanges of information between the different computing units, at the risk of a loss of efficiency.   \n\n==Problem Overview==\nA load balancing algorithm always tries to answer a specific problem. Among other things, the nature of the tasks, the algorithmic [[Computational complexity|complexity]], the hardware architecture on which the algorithms will run as well as required [[error tolerance]], must be taken into account. Therefore compromise must be found to best meet application-specific requirements. \n\n===Nature of tasks===\nThe efficiency of load balancing algorithms critically depends on the nature of the tasks. Therefore, the more information about the tasks is available at the time of decision making, the greater the potential for optimization. \n\n====Size of tasks====\nA perfect knowledge of the [[execution time]] of each of the tasks allows to reach an optimal load distribution (see algorithm of [[prefix sum]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanders |first1=Peter |last2=Mehlhorn |first2=Kurt |last3=Dietzfelbinger |first3=Martin |last4=Dementiev |first4=Roman |title=Sequential and parallel algorithms and data structures : the basic toolbox |isbn=978-3-030-25208-3}}</ref> Unfortunately, this is in fact an idealized case. Knowing the exact [[execution time]] of each task is an extremely rare situation.  \n\nFor this reason, there are several techniques to get an idea of the different execution times. First of all, in the fortunate scenario of having tasks of relatively homogeneous size, it is possible to consider that each of them will require approximately the average execution time. If, on the other hand, the execution time is very irregular, more sophisticated techniques must be used. One technique is to add some [[metadata]] to each task. Depending on the previous execution time for similar metadata, it is possible to make inferences for a future task based on statistics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Qi |last2=Cai |first2=Weidong |last3=Jin |first3=Dandan |last4=Shen |first4=Jian |last5=Fu |first5=Zhangjie |last6=Liu |first6=Xiaodong |last7=Linge |first7=Nigel |title=Estimation Accuracy on Execution Time of Run-Time Tasks in a Heterogeneous Distributed Environment |journal=Sensors |date=30 August 2016 |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1386 |doi=10.3390/s16091386}}</ref> \n\n====Dependencies====\nIn some cases, tasks depend on each other. These interdependencies can be illustrated by a [[directed acyclic graph]]. Intuitively, some tasks cannot begin until others are not completed. \n\nAssuming that the required time for each of the tasks is known in advance, an optimal execution order must lead to the minimization of the total execution time. Although this is an [[NP-hard]] problem and therefore can be difficult to be solved exactly. There are algorithms, like [[job scheduler]], that calculate optimal task distributions using [[metaheuristic]] methods.  \n\n====Segregation of tasks====\nAnother feature of the tasks critical for the design of a load balancing algorithm is their ability to be broken down into subtasks during execution. The \"Tree-Shaped Computation\" algorithm presented later takes great advantage of this specificity. \n\n===Static and dynamic algorithms===\n\n====Static====\nA load balancing algorithm is \"static\" when it does not take into account the state of the system for the distribution of tasks. There by, the system state includes measures such as the [[Load (computing)|load level]] (and sometimes even overload) of certain processors. Instead, assumptions on the overall system are made beforehand, such as the arrival times and resource requirements of incoming tasks. In addition, the number of processors, their respective power and communication speeds are known. Therefore, static load balancing aims to associate a known set of tasks with the available processors in order to minimize a certain performance function. The trick lies in the concept of this performance function. \n\nStatic load balancing techniques are commonly centralized around a router, or [[Master/slave (technology)|Master]], which distributes the loads and optimizes the performance function. This minimization can take into account information related to the tasks to be distributed, and derive an expected execution time.  \n\nThe advantage of static algorithms is that they are easy to set up and extremely efficient in the case of fairly regular tasks (such as processing HTTP requests from a website). However, there is still some statistical variance in the assignment of tasks which can lead to overloading of some computing units. \n\n====Dynamic====\nUnlike static load distribution algorithms, dynamic algorithms take into account the current load of each of the computing units (also called nodes) in the system. In this approach, tasks can be moved dynamically from an overloaded node to an underloaded node in order to receive faster processing. While these algorithms are much more complicated to design, they can produce excellent results, in particular, when the execution time varies greatly from one task to another. \n\nIn dynamic load balancing the architecture can be more [[modular]] since it is not mandatory to have a specific node dedicated to the distribution of work. When tasks are uniquely assigned to a processor according to its state at a given moment, it is unique assignment. If, on the other hand, the tasks can be permanently redistributed according to the state of the system and its evolution, this is called dynamic assignment <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alakeel |first1=Ali |title=A Guide to Dynamic Load Balancing in Distributed Computer Systems |journal=International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security (IJCSNS) |date=November 2009 |volume=10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268200851_A_Guide_to_Dynamic_Load_Balancing_in_Distributed_Computer_Systems}}</ref>. Obviously, a load balancing algorithm that requires too much communication in order to reach its decisions is not desirable at the risk of slowing down the resolution of the overall problem.\n\n===Hardware architecture===\n====Heterogenous machines====\nParallel computing infrastructures are often composed of units of different [[computing power]], which should be taken into account for the load distribution. \n\nFor example, lower-powered units may receive requests that require a smaller amount of computation, or, in the case of homogeneous or unknown request sizes, receive fewer requests than larger units.   \n\n====Shared and distributed memory====\nParallel computers are often divided into two broad categories: those where all processors share a single common memory on which they read and write in parallel ([[Parallel random-access machine|PRAM]] model), and those where each computing unit has its own memory ([[distributed memory]] model), and where information is exchanged by messages. \n\nFor [[shared-memory]] computers, managing write conflicts greatly slows down the speed of individual execution of each computing unit. However, they can work perfectly well in parallel. Conversely, in the case of message exchange, each of the processors can work at full speed. On the other hand, when it comes to collective message exchange, all processors are forced to wait for the slowest processors to start the communication phase.\n \nIn reality, few systems fall into exactly one of the categories. In general, the processors each have an internal memory to store the data needed for the next calculations, and are organized in successive [[Computer cluster|clusters]]. Often, these processing elements are then coordinated through distributed memory and message passing. Therefore, the load balancing algorithm should be uniquely adapted to a parallel architecture. Otherwise, there is a risk that the efficiency of parallel problem solving will be greatly reduced. \n\n====Hierarchy====\nAdapting to the hardware structures seen above, there are two main categories of load balancing algorithms. On the one hand, the one where tasks are assigned by \u201cmaster\u201d and executed by \u201cworkers\u201d who keep the master informed of the progress of their work, and the master can then take charge of assigning or reassigning the workload in case of dynamic algorithm. The literature refers to this as [[Master/slave (technology)|\"Master-Worker\"]] architecture. On the other hand, the control can be distributed between the different nodes. The load balancing algorithm is then executed on each of them and the responsibility for assigning tasks (as well as re-assigning and splitting as appropriate) is shared. The last category assumes a dynamic load balancing algorithm. \n\nSince the design of each load balancing algorithm is unique, the previous distinction must be qualified. Thus, it is also possible to have an intermediate strategy, with, for example, \"master\" nodes for each sub-cluster, which are themselves subject to a global \"master\". There are also multi-level organizations, with an alternation between master-slave and distributed control strategies. The latter strategies quickly become complex and are rarely encountered. Designers prefer algorithms that are easier to control. \n\n====Adaptation to larger architectures (scalability)====\nIn the context of algorithms that run over the very long term (servers, cloud...), the computer architecture evolves over time. However, it is preferable not to have to design a new algorithm each time.  \n\nAn extremely important parameter of a load balancing algorithm is therefore its ability to adapt to a scalable hardware architecture. This is called the [[scalability]] of the algorithm. An algorithm is called scalable for an input parameter when its performance remains relatively independent of the size of that parameter. \n\nWhen the algorithm is capable of adapting to a varying number of computing units, but the number of computing units must be fixed before execution, it is called moldable. If, on the other hand, the algorithm is capable of dealing with a fluctuating amount of processors during its execution, the algorithm is said to be malleable. Most load balancing algorithms are at least moldable <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Asghar |first1=Sajjad |last2=Aubanel |first2=Eric |last3=Bremner |first3=David |title=A Dynamic Moldable Job Scheduling Based Parallel SAT Solver |journal=2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing |date=October 2013 |pages=110\u2013119 |doi=10.1109/ICPP.2013.20 |url=https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2013.20}}</ref>.\n\n===Fault tolerance===\nEspecially in large-scale [[computing cluster|computing clusters]], it is not tolerable to execute a parallel algorithm which cannot withstand failure of one single component. Therefore, [[fault tolerant]] algorithms are being developed which can detect outages of processors and recover the computation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Punetha Sarmila |first1=G. |last2=Gnanambigai |first2=N. |last3=Dinadayalan |first3=P. |title=Survey on fault tolerant \u2014 Load balancing algorithmsin cloud computing |journal=2nd International Conference on Electronics and Communication Systems (ICECS) |date=2015 |pages=1715-1720 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7124879}}</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\n\n===Static distribution with full knowledge of the tasks: [[prefix sum]]===\nIf the tasks are independent of each other, and if their respective execution time and the tasks can be subdivided, there is a simple and optimal algorithm. \n\nBy dividing the tasks in such a way as to give the same amount of computation to each processor, all that remains to be done is to group the results together. Using a [[prefix sum]] algorithm, this division can be calculated in [[logarithmic time]] with respect to the number of processors. \n\n\n[[File:Load_Balancing_divisible_tasks.png|thumb|Load balancing algorithm depending on divisibility of tasks]]\n\nIf, however, the tasks cannot be subdivided (i.e. they are atomic), although optimizing task assignment is a difficult problem, it is still possible to approximate a relatively fair distribution of tasks, provided that the size of each of them is much smaller than the total amount of computation performed by each of the nodes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanders |first1=Peter |last2=Mehlhorn |first2=Kurt |last3=Dietzfelbinger |first3=Martin |last4=Dementiev |first4=Roman |title=Sequential and parallel algorithms and data structures : the basic toolbox |isbn=978-3-030-25208-3}}</ref> \n\nMost of the time, the execution time of a task is unknown and only rough approximation are available. This algorithm, although particularly efficient, is not viable for these scenarios.  \n\n===Static load distribution without prior knowledge===\nEven if the execution time is not known in advance at all, static load distribution is always possible. \n\n====[[Round-robin scheduling| Round-Robin]]====\nIn this simple algorithm, the first request is sent to the first server, then the next to the second, and so on down to the last. Then it is started again, assigning the next request to the first server, and so on. \n\nThis algorithm can be weighted such that the most powerful units receive the largest number of requests and receive them first. \n\n====Randomized static====\nRandomized static load balancing is simply a matter of randomly assigning tasks to the different servers. This method works quite well. If, on the other hand, the number of tasks is known in advance, it is even more efficient to calculate a random permutation in advance. This avoids communication costs for each assignment. There is no longer a need for a distribution master because everyone knows what task is assigned to him. Even if the number of tasks is unknown, it is still possible to avoid communication with a pseudo-random assignment generation known to all processors. \n\nThe performance of this strategy (measured in total execution time for a given fixed set of tasks) decreases with the maximum size of the tasks. \n\n====Others====\nOf course, there are other methods of assignment as well: \n* Less work: Assign more tasks to the servers by performing less (the method can also be weighted).\n* Hash: allocates queries according to a [[hash table]].\n* ...\n\n===Master-Worker Scheme===\n[[Master/slave (technology)|Master-Worker]] schemes are among the simplest dynamic load balancing algorithms. A master distributes the workload to all workers (also sometimes referred to as \"slaves\"). Initially, all workers are idle and report this to the master. The master answers worker requests and distributes the tasks to them. When he has no more tasks to give, he informs the workers so that they stop asking for tasks. \n\nThe advantage of this system is that it distributes the burden very fairly. In fact, if one does not take into account the time needed for the assignment, the execution time would be comparable to the prefix sum seen above. \n\nThe problem of this algorithm is that it has difficulty to adapt to a large number of processors because of the high amount of necessary communications. This lack of [[scalability]] makes it quickly inoperable in very large servers or very large parallel computers. The master acts as a [[Bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]].\n[[File:Master-Worker_and_bottleneck.png|thumb|Master-Worker and bottleneck]] \n\nHowever, the quality of the algorithm can be greatly improved by replacing the master by a task list which can be used by different processors. Although this algorithm is a little more difficult to implement, it promises much better scalability, although still insufficient for very large computing centers. \n\n===Non-hierarchical architecture, without knowledge of the system: [[work stealing]]===\nAnother technique to overcome scalability problems when the time needed for task completion is unknown is [[work stealing]].\n \nThe approach consists of assigning to each processor a certain number of tasks in a random or predefined manner, then allowing inactive processors to \"steal\" work from active or overloaded processors. Several implementations of this concept exist, defined by a task division model and by the rules determining the exchange between processors. While this technique can be particularly effective, it is difficult to implement because it is necessary to ensure that communication does not become the primary occupation of the processors instead of solving the problem. \n\nIn the case of atomic tasks, two main strategies can be distinguished, those where the processors with low load offer their computing capacity to those with the highest load, and those where the most loaded units wish to lighten the workload assigned to them. It has been shown<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eager |first1=Derek L |last2=Lazowska |first2=Edward D |last3=Zahorjan |first3=John |title=A comparison of receiver-initiated and sender-initiated adaptive load sharing |journal=Performance Evaluation |date=1 March 1986 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=53\u201368 |doi=10.1016/0166-5316(86)90008-8 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-5316(86)90008-8 |language=en |issn=0166-5316}}</ref> that when the network is heavily loaded, it is more efficient for the least loaded units to offer their availability and when the network is lightly loaded, it is the overloaded processors that require support from the most inactive ones. This rule of thumb limits the number of exchanged messages. \n\nIn the case where one starts from a single large task that cannot be divided beyond an atomic level, there is a very efficient algorithm \"Tree-Shaped computation\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sanders |first1=Peter |title=Tree Shaped Computations as a Model for Parallel Applications |date=1998 |doi=10.5445/ir/1000074497}}</ref>, where the parent task is distributed in a work tree.  \n\n====Principle====\nInitially, all processors have an empty task, except one that works sequentially on it. Idle processors issue requests randomly to other processors (not necessarily active). If the latter is able to subdivide the task it is working on, it does so by sending part of its work to the node making the request. Otherwise, it returns an empty task. This induces a tree structure. It is then necessary to send a termination signal to the parent processor when the subtask is completed, so that it in turn sends the message to its parent until it reaches the root of the tree. When the first processor, i.e. the root, has finished, a global termination message can be broadcast. At the end, it is necessary to assemble the results by going back up the tree. \n\n====Efficiency====\nThe efficiency of such an algorithm is close to the prefix sum when the job cutting and communication time is not too high compared to the work to be done. To avoid too high communication costs, it is possible to imagine a list of jobs on shared memory. Therefore, a request is simply reading from a certain position on this shared memory at the request of the master processor. \n\n==Application==\nIn addition to efficient problem solving through parallel computations, load balancing algorithms are widely used in HTTP request management where a site with a large audience must be able to handle requests per second. \n\n===Internet-based services===\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|\n{{cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|article's section|date=December 2010}}\n}}\n\nOne of the most commonly used applications of load balancing is to provide a single Internet service from multiple [[Server (computing)|server]]s, sometimes known as a [[server farm]]. Commonly load-balanced systems include popular [[web site]]s, large [[Internet Relay Chat]] networks, high-bandwidth [[File Transfer Protocol]] sites, [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) servers, [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) servers, and databases.\n\n====Round-robin DNS====\n{{Main|Round-robin DNS}}\n\nAn alternate method of load balancing, which does not require a dedicated software or hardware node, is called ''[[round-robin DNS]]''.\nIn this technique, multiple [[IP address]]es are associated with a single [[domain name]]; clients are given IP in a round-robin fashion. IP is assigned to clients with a short expiration so the client is more likely to use a different IP the next time they access the Internet service being requested.\n\n====DNS delegation====\n\nAnother more effective technique for load-balancing using DNS is to delegate <tt>www.example.org</tt> as a sub-domain whose zone is served by each of the same servers that are serving the web site. This technique works particularly well where individual servers are spread geographically on the Internet. For example:\n<pre>one.example.org A 192.0.2.1\ntwo.example.org A 203.0.113.2\nwww.example.org NS one.example.org\nwww.example.org NS two.example.org\n</pre>\nHowever, the zone file for <tt>www.example.org</tt> on each server is different such that each server resolves its own IP Address as the A-record.<ref>[http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/a.html IPv4 Address Record (A)]</ref> On server ''one'' the zone file for <tt>www.example.org</tt> reports:\n<pre>@ in a 192.0.2.1\n</pre>\nOn server ''two'' the same zone file contains:\n<pre>@ in a 203.0.113.2\n</pre>\nThis way, when a server is down, its DNS will not respond and the web service does not receive any traffic. If the line to one server is congested, the unreliability of DNS ensures less HTTP traffic reaches that server. Furthermore, the quickest DNS response to the resolver is nearly always the one from the network's closest server, ensuring geo-sensitive load-balancing {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. A short [[Time to live|TTL]] on the A-record helps to ensure traffic is quickly diverted when a server goes down. Consideration must be given the possibility that this technique may cause individual clients to switch between individual servers in mid-session.\n\n====Client-side random load balancing====\nAnother approach to load balancing is to deliver a list of server IPs to the client, and then to have client randomly select the IP from the list on each connection.<ref>[https://gameserverarchitecture.com/2015/10/pattern-client-side-load-balancing/ Pattern: Client Side Load Balancing]</ref><ref name=\"ithare\">[http://ithare.com/chapter-vib-server-side-architecture-front-end-servers-and-client-side-random-load-balancing/ MMOG Server-Side Architecture. Front-End Servers and Client-Side Random Load Balancing]</ref> This essentially relies on all clients generating similar loads, and the [[Law of Large Numbers]]<ref name=\"ithare\" /> to achieve a reasonably flat load distribution across servers. It has been claimed that client-side random load balancing tends to provide better load distribution than round-robin DNS; this has been attributed to caching issues with round-robin DNS, that in case of large DNS caching servers, tend to skew the distribution for round-robin DNS, while client-side random selection remains unaffected regardless of DNS caching.<ref name=\"ithare\" />\n\nWith this approach, the method of delivery of list of IPs to the client can vary, and may be implemented as a DNS list (delivered to all the clients without any round-robin), or via hardcoding it to the list. If a \"smart client\" is used, detecting that randomly selected server is down and connecting randomly again, it also provides fault tolerance.\n\n====Server-side load balancers====\nFor Internet services, a server-side load balancer is usually a software program that is listening on the [[TCP and UDP port|port]] where external clients connect to access services.  The load balancer forwards requests to one of the \"backend\" servers, which usually replies to the load balancer. This allows the load balancer to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions. It also prevents clients from contacting back-end servers directly, which may have security benefits by hiding the structure of the internal network and preventing attacks on the kernel's network stack or unrelated services running on other ports.\n\nSome load balancers provide a mechanism for doing something special in the event that all backend servers are unavailable.\nThis might include forwarding to a backup load balancer or displaying a message regarding the outage.\n\nIt is also important that the load balancer itself does not become a [[single point of failure]]. Usually, load balancers are implemented in [[High availability|high-availability]] pairs which may also replicate session persistence data if required by the specific application.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/HighAvailability.html|title= High Availability|publisher=linuxvirtualserver.org | accessdate=2013-11-20}}</ref> Certain applications are programmed with immunity to this problem, by offsetting the load balancing point over differential sharing platforms beyond the defined network. The sequential algorithms paired to these functions are defined by flexible parameters unique to the specific database.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ranjan |first1=R |title=Peer-to-peer cloud provisioning: Service discovery and load-balancing |journal=Cloud Computing |date=2010}}</ref>\n\n=====Scheduling algorithms=====\nNumerous [[scheduling algorithm]]s, also called load-balancing methods, are used by load balancers to determine which back-end server to send a request to.\nSimple algorithms include random choice, [[Round-robin scheduling|round robin]], or least connections.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205223948/https://f5.com/resources/white-papers/load-balancing-101-nuts-and-bolts|title=Load Balancing 101: Nuts and Bolts|date=2017-12-05|publisher=[[F5 Networks]]|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref> More sophisticated load balancers may take additional factors into account, such as a server's reported load, least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic it has recently been assigned.\n\n=====Persistence=====\nAn important issue when operating a load-balanced service is how to handle information that must be kept across the multiple requests in a user's session. If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIdeally, the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should not be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected.  This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database, for example [[Memcached]].\n\nOne basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as \"persistence\" or \"stickiness\". A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic [[failover]]: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost. The same problem is usually relevant to central database servers; even if web servers are \"stateless\" and not \"sticky\", the central database is (see below).\n\nAssignment to a particular server might be based on a username, client IP address, or be random. Because of changes of the client's perceived address resulting from [[DHCP]], [[network address translation]], and [[web proxy|web proxies]] this method may be unreliable. Random assignments must be remembered by the load balancer, which creates a burden on storage. If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a timeout period or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table. The random assignment method also requires that clients maintain some state, which can be a problem, for example when a web browser has disabled storage of cookies. Sophisticated load balancers use multiple persistence techniques to avoid some of the shortcomings of any one method.\n\nAnother solution is to keep the per-session data in a [[database]]. Generally, this is bad for performance because it increases the load on the database: the database is best used to store information less transient than per-session data. To prevent a database from becoming a [[single point of failure]], and to improve [[scalability]], the database is often replicated across multiple machines, and load balancing is used to spread the query load across those replicas.  [[Microsoft]]'s [[ASP.net]] State Server technology is an example of a session database. All servers in a web farm store their session data on State Server and any server in the farm can retrieve the data.\n\nIn the very common case where the client is a web browser, a simple but efficient approach is to store the per-session data in the browser itself. One way to achieve this is to use a [[HTTP cookie|browser cookie]], suitably time-stamped and encrypted. Another is [[URL rewriting]]. Storing session data on the client is generally the preferred solution: then the load balancer is free to pick any backend server to handle a request. However, this method of state-data handling is poorly suited to some complex business logic scenarios, where session state payload is big and recomputing it with every request on a server is not feasible. URL rewriting has major security issues, because the end-user can easily alter the submitted URL and thus change session streams.\n\nYet another solution to storing persistent data is to associate a name with each block of data, and use a [[distributed hash table]] to pseudo-randomly assign that name to one of the available servers, and then store that block of data in the assigned server.\n\n=====Load balancer features=====\nHardware and software load balancers may have a variety of special features. The fundamental feature of a load balancer is to be able to distribute incoming requests over a number of backend servers in the cluster according to a scheduling algorithm. Most of the following features are vendor specific:\n\n; Asymmetric load\n: A ratio can be manually assigned to cause some backend servers to get a greater share of the workload than others. This is sometimes used as a crude way to account for some servers having more capacity than others and may not always work as desired.\n; Priority activation\n: When the number of available servers drops below a certain number, or load gets too high, standby servers can be brought online.\n; [[TLS acceleration|TLS Offload and Acceleration]]\n: TLS (or its predecessor SSL) acceleration is a technique of offloading cryptographic protocol calculations onto a specialized hardware. Depending on the workload, processing the encryption and authentication requirements of an [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] request can become a major part of the demand on the Web Server's CPU; as the demand increases, users will see slower response times, as the TLS overhead is distributed among Web servers. To remove this demand on Web servers, a balancer can terminate TLS connections, passing HTTPS requests as HTTP requests to the Web servers. If the balancer itself is not overloaded, this does not noticeably degrade the performance perceived by end users. The downside of this approach is that all of the TLS processing is concentrated on a single device (the balancer) which can become a new bottleneck. Some load balancer appliances include specialized hardware to process TLS. Instead of upgrading the load balancer, which is quite expensive dedicated hardware, it may be cheaper to forgo TLS offload and add a few Web servers. Also, some server vendors such as Oracle/Sun now incorporate cryptographic acceleration hardware into their CPUs such as the T2000. F5 Networks incorporates a dedicated TLS acceleration hardware card in their local traffic manager (LTM) which is used for encrypting and decrypting TLS traffic. One clear benefit to TLS offloading in the balancer is that it enables it to do balancing or content switching based on data in the HTTPS request.\n; [[Distributed denial of service|Distributed Denial of Service]] (DDoS) attack protection\n: Load balancers can provide features such as [[SYN cookies]] and delayed-binding (the back-end servers don't see the client until it finishes its TCP handshake) to mitigate [[SYN flood]] attacks and generally offload work from the servers to a more efficient platform.\n; [[HTTP compression]]\n: HTTP compression reduces the amount of data to be transferred for HTTP objects by utilising gzip compression available in all modern web browsers.  The larger the response and the further away the client is, the more this feature can improve response times.  The trade-off is that this feature puts additional CPU demand on the load balancer and could be done by web servers instead.\n; TCP offload\n: Different vendors use different terms for this, but the idea is that normally each HTTP request from each client is a different TCP connection.  This feature utilises HTTP/1.1 to consolidate multiple HTTP requests from multiple clients into a single TCP socket to the back-end servers.\n; TCP buffering\n: The load balancer can buffer responses from the server and spoon-feed the data out to slow clients, allowing the web server to free a thread for other tasks faster than it would if it had to send the entire request to the client directly.\n; Direct Server Return\n: An option for asymmetrical load distribution, where request and reply have different network paths.\n; Health checking\n: The balancer polls servers for application layer health and removes failed servers from the pool.\n; [[HTTP caching]]\n: The balancer stores static content so that some requests can be handled without contacting the servers.\n; Content filtering\n: Some balancers can arbitrarily modify traffic on the way through.\n; HTTP security\n: Some balancers can hide HTTP error pages, remove server identification headers from HTTP responses, and encrypt cookies so that end users cannot manipulate them.\n; [[Priority queuing]]\n: Also known as [[rate shaping]], the ability to give different priority to different traffic.\n; Content-aware switching\n: Most load balancers can send requests to different servers based on the URL being requested, assuming the request is not encrypted (HTTP) or if it is encrypted (via HTTPS) that the HTTPS request is terminated (decrypted) at the load balancer.\n; Client authentication\n: Authenticate users against a variety of authentication sources before allowing them access to a website.\n; Programmatic traffic manipulation\n: At least one balancer allows the use of a scripting language to allow custom balancing methods, arbitrary traffic manipulations, and more.\n; [[Firewall (networking)|Firewall]]\n: Firewalls can prevent direct connections to backend servers, for network security reasons.\n; [[Intrusion prevention system]]\n: Intrusion prevention systems offer application layer security in addition to network/transport layer offered by firewall security.\n\n===Use in telecommunications===\nLoad balancing can be useful in applications with redundant communications links.  For example, a company may have multiple Internet connections ensuring network access if one of the connections fails. A [[failover]] arrangement would mean that one link is designated for normal use, while the second link is used only if the primary link fails.\n\nUsing load balancing, both links can be in use all the time.

They use sophisticated load balancing to shift traffic from one path to another to avoid [[network congestion]] on any particular link, and sometimes to minimize the cost of transit across external networks or improve [[Reliability (computer networking)|network reliability]].\n\nAnother way of using load balancing is in [[network monitoring]] activities. Load balancers can be used to split huge data flows into several sub-flows and use several network analyzers, each reading a part of the original data. This is very useful for monitoring fast networks like [[10 Gigabit Ethernet|10GbE]] or STM64, where complex processing of the data may not be possible at [[wire speed]].<ref>Mohammad Noormohammadpour, Cauligi S.

PP, no. 99, pp. 1-1.</ref> It allows more efficient use of network bandwidth and reduces provisioning costs. In general, load balancing in datacenter networks can be classified as either static or dynamic. Static load balancing distributes traffic by computing a hash of the source and destination addresses and port numbers of traffic flows and using it to determine how flows are assigned to one of the existing paths. Dynamic load balancing assigns traffic flows to paths by monitoring bandwidth utilization of different paths. Dynamic assignment can also be proactive or reactive. In the former case, the assignment is fixed once made, while in the latter the network logic keeps monitoring available paths and shifts flows across them as network utilization changes (with arrival of new flows or completion of existing ones). A comprehensive overview of load balancing in datacenter networks has been made available.<ref name=architecture/>\n\n===Relationship to failovers===\nLoad balancing is often used to implement [[failover]]\u2014the continuation of a service after the failure of one or more of its components.  The components are monitored continually (e.g., web servers may be monitored by fetching known pages), and when one becomes non-responsive, the load balancer is informed and no longer sends traffic to it.  When a component comes back online, the load balancer begins to route traffic to it again.  For this to work, there must be at least one component in excess of the service's capacity ([[N+1 redundancy]]).  This can be much less expensive and more flexible than failover approaches where each single live component is paired with a single backup component that takes over in the event of a failure ([[dual modular redundancy]]).  Some types of [[RAID]] systems can also utilize [[hot spare]] for a similar effect.<ref name=\"IBM\">[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSVJJU_6.4.0/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc_6.4/ds_ag_srv_adm_dd_failover_load_balancing.html Failover and load balancing] ''IBM'' 6 January 2019</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Affinity mask]]\n* [[Application Delivery Controller]]\n* [[Autoscaling]]\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Common Address Redundancy Protocol]]\n* [[Edge computing]]\n* [[Fog computing]]\n* [[Network Load Balancing]]\n* [[Network Load Balancing Services]]\n* [[Partition (database)]]\n* [[Processor affinity]]\n* [[SRV record]]\n* [[Transposition-driven scheduling]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Load balancing (computing)}}\n* [http://www.udaparts.com/document/articles/snpisec.htm Server routing for load balancing with full auto failure recovery]\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Load Balancing (Computing)}}\n[[Category:Network management]]\n[[Category:Servers (computing)]]\n[[Category:Routing]]\n[[Category:Load balancing| ]]\n[[Category:Balancing technology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Elasticsearch Cluster August 2014.png|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating user requests to an [[Elasticsearch]] cluster being distributed by a load balancer. (Example for [[Wikipedia]].)]]\nIn [[computing]], '''load balancing''' refers to the process of distributing a set of [[Task (computing)|tasks]] over a set of [[System resource|resources]] (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing techniques can optimise the response time for each task, avoiding unevenly overloading compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.\n\nLoad balancing is the subject of research in the field of [[parallel computers]]. Two main approaches exist: static algorithms, which do not take into account the state of the different machines, and dynamic algorithms, which are usually more general and more efficient, but require exchanges of information between the different computing units, at the risk of a loss of efficiency.   \n\n==Problem Overview==\nA load balancing algorithm always tries to answer a specific problem. Among other things, the nature of the tasks, the algorithmic [[Computational complexity|complexity]], the hardware architecture on which the algorithms will run as well as required [[error tolerance]], must be taken into account. Therefore compromise must be found to best meet application-specific requirements. \n\n===Nature of tasks===\nThe efficiency of load balancing algorithms critically depends on the nature of the tasks. Therefore, the more information about the tasks is available at the time of decision making, the greater the potential for optimization. \n\n====Size of tasks====\nA perfect knowledge of the [[execution time]] of each of the tasks allows to reach an optimal load distribution (see algorithm of [[prefix sum]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanders |first1=Peter |last2=Mehlhorn |first2=Kurt |last3=Dietzfelbinger |first3=Martin |last4=Dementiev |first4=Roman |title=Sequential and parallel algorithms and data structures : the basic toolbox |isbn=978-3-030-25208-3}}</ref> Unfortunately, this is in fact an idealized case. Knowing the exact [[execution time]] of each task is an extremely rare situation.  \n\nFor this reason, there are several techniques to get an idea of the different execution times. First of all, in the fortunate scenario of having tasks of relatively homogeneous size, it is possible to consider that each of them will require approximately the average execution time. If, on the other hand, the execution time is very irregular, more sophisticated techniques must be used. One technique is to add some [[metadata]] to each task. Depending on the previous execution time for similar metadata, it is possible to make inferences for a future task based on statistics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Qi |last2=Cai |first2=Weidong |last3=Jin |first3=Dandan |last4=Shen |first4=Jian |last5=Fu |first5=Zhangjie |last6=Liu |first6=Xiaodong |last7=Linge |first7=Nigel |title=Estimation Accuracy on Execution Time of Run-Time Tasks in a Heterogeneous Distributed Environment |journal=Sensors |date=30 August 2016 |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1386 |doi=10.3390/s16091386}}</ref> \n\n====Dependencies====\nIn some cases, tasks depend on each other. These interdependencies can be illustrated by a [[directed acyclic graph]]. Intuitively, some tasks cannot begin until others are not completed. \n\nAssuming that the required time for each of the tasks is known in advance, an optimal execution order must lead to the minimization of the total execution time. Although this is an [[NP-hard]] problem and therefore can be difficult to be solved exactly. There are algorithms, like [[job scheduler]], that calculate optimal task distributions using [[metaheuristic]] methods.  \n\n====Segregation of tasks====\nAnother feature of the tasks critical for the design of a load balancing algorithm is their ability to be broken down into subtasks during execution. The \"Tree-Shaped Computation\" algorithm presented later takes great advantage of this specificity. \n\n===Static and dynamic algorithms===\n\n====Static====\nA load balancing algorithm is \"static\" when it does not take into account the state of the system for the distribution of tasks. There by, the system state includes measures such as the [[Load (computing)|load level]] (and sometimes even overload) of certain processors. Instead, assumptions on the overall system are made beforehand, such as the arrival times and resource requirements of incoming tasks. In addition, the number of processors, their respective power and communication speeds are known. Therefore, static load balancing aims to associate a known set of tasks with the available processors in order to minimize a certain performance function. The trick lies in the concept of this performance function. \n\nStatic load balancing techniques are commonly centralized around a router, or [[Master/slave (technology)|Master]], which distributes the loads and optimizes the performance function. This minimization can take into account information related to the tasks to be distributed, and derive an expected execution time.  \n\nThe advantage of static algorithms is that they are easy to set up and extremely efficient in the case of fairly regular tasks (such as processing HTTP requests from a website). However, there is still some statistical variance in the assignment of tasks which can lead to overloading of some computing units. \n\n====Dynamic====\nUnlike static load distribution algorithms, dynamic algorithms take into account the current load of each of the computing units (also called nodes) in the system. In this approach, tasks can be moved dynamically from an overloaded node to an underloaded node in order to receive faster processing. While these algorithms are much more complicated to design, they can produce excellent results, in particular, when the execution time varies greatly from one task to another. \n\nIn dynamic load balancing the architecture can be more [[modular]] since it is not mandatory to have a specific node dedicated to the distribution of work. When tasks are uniquely assigned to a processor according to its state at a given moment, it is unique assignment. If, on the other hand, the tasks can be permanently redistributed according to the state of the system and its evolution, this is called dynamic assignment <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alakeel |first1=Ali |title=A Guide to Dynamic Load Balancing in Distributed Computer Systems |journal=International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security (IJCSNS) |date=November 2009 |volume=10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268200851_A_Guide_to_Dynamic_Load_Balancing_in_Distributed_Computer_Systems}}</ref>. Obviously, a load balancing algorithm that requires too much communication in order to reach its decisions is not desirable at the risk of slowing down the resolution of the overall problem.\n\n===Hardware architecture===\n====Heterogenous machines====\nParallel computing infrastructures are often composed of units of different [[computing power]], which should be taken into account for the load distribution. \n\nFor example, lower-powered units may receive requests that require a smaller amount of computation, or, in the case of homogeneous or unknown request sizes, receive fewer requests than larger units.   \n\n====Shared and distributed memory====\nParallel computers are often divided into two broad categories: those where all processors share a single common memory on which they read and write in parallel ([[PRAM]]{{dn|date=March 2020}} model), and those where each computing unit has its own memory ([[distributed memory]] model), and where information is exchanged by messages. \n\nFor [[shared-memory]] computers, managing write conflicts greatly slows down the speed of individual execution of each computing unit. However, they can work perfectly well in parallel. Conversely, in the case of message exchange, each of the processors can work at full speed. On the other hand, when it comes to collective message exchange, all processors are forced to wait for the slowest processors to start the communication phase.\n \nIn reality, few systems fall into exactly one of the categories. In general, the processors each have an internal memory to store the data needed for the next calculations, and are organized in successive [[Computer cluster|clusters]]. Often, these processing elements are then coordinated through distributed memory and message passing. Therefore, the load balancing algorithm should be uniquely adapted to a parallel architecture. Otherwise, there is a risk that the efficiency of parallel problem solving will be greatly reduced. \n\n====Hierarchy====\nAdapting to the hardware structures seen above, there are two main categories of load balancing algorithms. On the one hand, the one where tasks are assigned by \u201cmaster\u201d and executed by \u201cworkers\u201d who keep the master informed of the progress of their work, and the master can then take charge of assigning or reassigning the workload in case of dynamic algorithm. The literature refers to this as [[Master/slave (technology)|\"Master-Worker\"]] architecture. On the other hand, the control can be distributed between the different nodes. The load balancing algorithm is then executed on each of them and the responsibility for assigning tasks (as well as re-assigning and splitting as appropriate) is shared. The last category assumes a dynamic load balancing algorithm. \n\nSince the design of each load balancing algorithm is unique, the previous distinction must be qualified. Thus, it is also possible to have an intermediate strategy, with, for example, \"master\" nodes for each sub-cluster, which are themselves subject to a global \"master\". There are also multi-level organizations, with an alternation between master-slave and distributed control strategies. The latter strategies quickly become complex and are rarely encountered. Designers prefer algorithms that are easier to control. \n\n====Adaptation to larger architectures (scalability)====\nIn the context of algorithms that run over the very long term (servers, cloud...), the computer architecture evolves over time. However, it is preferable not to have to design a new algorithm each time.  \n\nAn extremely important parameter of a load balancing algorithm is therefore its ability to adapt to a scalable hardware architecture. This is called the [[scalability]] of the algorithm. An algorithm is called scalable for an input parameter when its performance remains relatively independent of the size of that parameter. \n\nWhen the algorithm is capable of adapting to a varying number of computing units, but the number of computing units must be fixed before execution, it is called moldable. If, on the other hand, the algorithm is capable of dealing with a fluctuating amount of processors during its execution, the algorithm is said to be malleable. Most load balancing algorithms are at least moldable <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Asghar |first1=Sajjad |last2=Aubanel |first2=Eric |last3=Bremner |first3=David |title=A Dynamic Moldable Job Scheduling Based Parallel SAT Solver |journal=2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing |date=October 2013 |pages=110\u2013119 |doi=10.1109/ICPP.2013.20 |url=https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2013.20}}</ref>.\n\n===Fault tolerance===\nEspecially in large-scale [[computing cluster|computing clusters]], it is not tolerable to execute a parallel algorithm which cannot withstand failure of one single component. Therefore, [[fault tolerant]] algorithms are being developed which can detect outages of processors and recover the computation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Punetha Sarmila |first1=G. |last2=Gnanambigai |first2=N. |last3=Dinadayalan |first3=P. |title=Survey on fault tolerant \u2014 Load balancing algorithmsin cloud computing |journal=2nd International Conference on Electronics and Communication Systems (ICECS) |date=2015 |pages=1715-1720 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7124879}}</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\n\n===Static distribution with full knowledge of the tasks: [[prefix sum]]===\nIf the tasks are independent of each other, and if their respective execution time and the tasks can be subdivided, there is a simple and optimal algorithm. \n\nBy dividing the tasks in such a way as to give the same amount of computation to each processor, all that remains to be done is to group the results together. Using a [[prefix sum]] algorithm, this division can be calculated in [[logarithmic time]] with respect to the number of processors. \n\n\n[[File:Load_Balancing_divisible_tasks.png|thumb|Load balancing algorithm depending on divisibility of tasks]]\n\nIf, however, the tasks cannot be subdivided (i.e. they are atomic), although optimizing task assignment is a difficult problem, it is still possible to approximate a relatively fair distribution of tasks, provided that the size of each of them is much smaller than the total amount of computation performed by each of the nodes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanders |first1=Peter |last2=Mehlhorn |first2=Kurt |last3=Dietzfelbinger |first3=Martin |last4=Dementiev |first4=Roman |title=Sequential and parallel algorithms and data structures : the basic toolbox |isbn=978-3-030-25208-3}}</ref> \n\nMost of the time, the execution time of a task is unknown and only rough approximation are available. This algorithm, although particularly efficient, is not viable for these scenarios.  \n\n===Static load distribution without prior knowledge===\nEven if the execution time is not known in advance at all, static load distribution is always possible. \n\n====[[Round-robin scheduling| Round-Robin]]====\nIn this simple algorithm, the first request is sent to the first server, then the next to the second, and so on down to the last. Then it is started again, assigning the next request to the first server, and so on. \n\nThis algorithm can be weighted such that the most powerful units receive the largest number of requests and receive them first. \n\n====Randomized static====\nRandomized static load balancing is simply a matter of randomly assigning tasks to the different servers. This method works quite well. If, on the other hand, the number of tasks is known in advance, it is even more efficient to calculate a random permutation in advance. This avoids communication costs for each assignment. There is no longer a need for a distribution master because everyone knows what task is assigned to him. Even if the number of tasks is unknown, it is still possible to avoid communication with a pseudo-random assignment generation known to all processors. \n\nThe performance of this strategy (measured in total execution time for a given fixed set of tasks) decreases with the maximum size of the tasks. \n\n====Others====\nOf course, there are other methods of assignment as well: \n* Less work: Assign more tasks to the servers by performing less (the method can also be weighted).\n* Hash: allocates queries according to a [[hash table]].\n* ...\n\n===Master-Worker Scheme===\n[[Master/slave (technology)|Master-Worker]] schemes are among the simplest dynamic load balancing algorithms. A master distributes the workload to all workers (also sometimes referred to as \"slaves\"). Initially, all workers are idle and report this to the master. The master answers worker requests and distributes the tasks to them. When he has no more tasks to give, he informs the workers so that they stop asking for tasks. \n\nThe advantage of this system is that it distributes the burden very fairly. In fact, if one does not take into account the time needed for the assignment, the execution time would be comparable to the prefix sum seen above. \n\nThe problem of this algorithm is that it has difficulty to adapt to a large number of processors because of the high amount of necessary communications. This lack of [[scalability]] makes it quickly inoperable in very large servers or very large parallel computers. The master acts as a [[Bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]].\n[[File:Master-Worker_and_bottleneck.png|thumb|Master-Worker and bottleneck]] \n\nHowever, the quality of the algorithm can be greatly improved by replacing the master by a task list which can be used by different processors. Although this algorithm is a little more difficult to implement, it promises much better scalability, although still insufficient for very large computing centers. \n\n===Non-hierarchical architecture, without knowledge of the system: [[work stealing]]===\nAnother technique to overcome scalability problems when the time needed for task completion is unknown is [[work stealing]].\n \nThe approach consists of assigning to each processor a certain number of tasks in a random or predefined manner, then allowing inactive processors to \"steal\" work from active or overloaded processors. Several implementations of this concept exist, defined by a task division model and by the rules determining the exchange between processors. While this technique can be particularly effective, it is difficult to implement because it is necessary to ensure that communication does not become the primary occupation of the processors instead of solving the problem. \n\nIn the case of atomic tasks, two main strategies can be distinguished, those where the processors with low load offer their computing capacity to those with the highest load, and those where the most loaded units wish to lighten the workload assigned to them. It has been shown<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eager |first1=Derek L |last2=Lazowska |first2=Edward D |last3=Zahorjan |first3=John |title=A comparison of receiver-initiated and sender-initiated adaptive load sharing |journal=Performance Evaluation |date=1 March 1986 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=53\u201368 |doi=10.1016/0166-5316(86)90008-8 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-5316(86)90008-8 |language=en |issn=0166-5316}}</ref> that when the network is heavily loaded, it is more efficient for the least loaded units to offer their availability and when the network is lightly loaded, it is the overloaded processors that require support from the most inactive ones. This rule of thumb limits the number of exchanged messages. \n\nIn the case where one starts from a single large task that cannot be divided beyond an atomic level, there is a very efficient algorithm \"Tree-Shaped computation\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sanders |first1=Peter |title=Tree Shaped Computations as a Model for Parallel Applications |date=1998 |doi=10.5445/ir/1000074497}}</ref>, where the parent task is distributed in a work tree.  \n\n====Principle====\nInitially, all processors have an empty task, except one that works sequentially on it. Idle processors issue requests randomly to other processors (not necessarily active). If the latter is able to subdivide the task it is working on, it does so by sending part of its work to the node making the request. Otherwise, it returns an empty task. This induces a tree structure. It is then necessary to send a termination signal to the parent processor when the subtask is completed, so that it in turn sends the message to its parent until it reaches the root of the tree. When the first processor, i.e. the root, has finished, a global termination message can be broadcast. At the end, it is necessary to assemble the results by going back up the tree. \n\n====Efficiency====\nThe efficiency of such an algorithm is close to the prefix sum when the job cutting and communication time is not too high compared to the work to be done. To avoid too high communication costs, it is possible to imagine a list of jobs on shared memory. Therefore, a request is simply reading from a certain position on this shared memory at the request of the master processor. \n\n==Application==\nIn addition to efficient problem solving through parallel computations, load balancing algorithms are widely used in HTTP request management where a site with a large audience must be able to handle requests per second. \n\n===Internet-based services===\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|\n{{cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|article's section|date=December 2010}}\n}}\n\nOne of the most commonly used applications of load balancing is to provide a single Internet service from multiple [[Server (computing)|server]]s, sometimes known as a [[server farm]]. Commonly load-balanced systems include popular [[web site]]s, large [[Internet Relay Chat]] networks, high-bandwidth [[File Transfer Protocol]] sites, [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) servers, [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) servers, and databases.\n\n====Round-robin DNS====\n{{Main|Round-robin DNS}}\n\nAn alternate method of load balancing, which does not require a dedicated software or hardware node, is called ''[[round-robin DNS]]''.\nIn this technique, multiple [[IP address]]es are associated with a single [[domain name]]; clients are given IP in a round-robin fashion. IP is assigned to clients with a short expiration so the client is more likely to use a different IP the next time they access the Internet service being requested.\n\n====DNS delegation====\n\nAnother more effective technique for load-balancing using DNS is to delegate <tt>www.example.org</tt> as a sub-domain whose zone is served by each of the same servers that are serving the web site. This technique works particularly well where individual servers are spread geographically on the Internet. For example:\n<pre>one.example.org A 192.0.2.1\ntwo.example.org A 203.0.113.2\nwww.example.org NS one.example.org\nwww.example.org NS two.example.org\n</pre>\nHowever, the zone file for <tt>www.example.org</tt> on each server is different such that each server resolves its own IP Address as the A-record.<ref>[http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/a.html IPv4 Address Record (A)]</ref> On server ''one'' the zone file for <tt>www.example.org</tt> reports:\n<pre>@ in a 192.0.2.1\n</pre>\nOn server ''two'' the same zone file contains:\n<pre>@ in a 203.0.113.2\n</pre>\nThis way, when a server is down, its DNS will not respond and the web service does not receive any traffic. If the line to one server is congested, the unreliability of DNS ensures less HTTP traffic reaches that server. Furthermore, the quickest DNS response to the resolver is nearly always the one from the network's closest server, ensuring geo-sensitive load-balancing {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. A short [[Time to live|TTL]] on the A-record helps to ensure traffic is quickly diverted when a server goes down. Consideration must be given the possibility that this technique may cause individual clients to switch between individual servers in mid-session.\n\n====Client-side random load balancing====\nAnother approach to load balancing is to deliver a list of server IPs to the client, and then to have client randomly select the IP from the list on each connection.<ref>[https://gameserverarchitecture.com/2015/10/pattern-client-side-load-balancing/ Pattern: Client Side Load Balancing]</ref><ref name=\"ithare\">[http://ithare.com/chapter-vib-server-side-architecture-front-end-servers-and-client-side-random-load-balancing/ MMOG Server-Side Architecture. Front-End Servers and Client-Side Random Load Balancing]</ref> This essentially relies on all clients generating similar loads, and the [[Law of Large Numbers]]<ref name=\"ithare\" /> to achieve a reasonably flat load distribution across servers. It has been claimed that client-side random load balancing tends to provide better load distribution than round-robin DNS; this has been attributed to caching issues with round-robin DNS, that in case of large DNS caching servers, tend to skew the distribution for round-robin DNS, while client-side random selection remains unaffected regardless of DNS caching.<ref name=\"ithare\" />\n\nWith this approach, the method of delivery of list of IPs to the client can vary, and may be implemented as a DNS list (delivered to all the clients without any round-robin), or via hardcoding it to the list. If a \"smart client\" is used, detecting that randomly selected server is down and connecting randomly again, it also provides fault tolerance.\n\n====Server-side load balancers====\nFor Internet services, a server-side load balancer is usually a software program that is listening on the [[TCP and UDP port|port]] where external clients connect to access services.  The load balancer forwards requests to one of the \"backend\" servers, which usually replies to the load balancer. This allows the load balancer to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions. It also prevents clients from contacting back-end servers directly, which may have security benefits by hiding the structure of the internal network and preventing attacks on the kernel's network stack or unrelated services running on other ports.\n\nSome load balancers provide a mechanism for doing something special in the event that all backend servers are unavailable.\nThis might include forwarding to a backup load balancer or displaying a message regarding the outage.\n\nIt is also important that the load balancer itself does not become a [[single point of failure]]. Usually, load balancers are implemented in [[High availability|high-availability]] pairs which may also replicate session persistence data if required by the specific application.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/HighAvailability.html|title= High Availability|publisher=linuxvirtualserver.org | accessdate=2013-11-20}}</ref> Certain applications are programmed with immunity to this problem, by offsetting the load balancing point over differential sharing platforms beyond the defined network. The sequential algorithms paired to these functions are defined by flexible parameters unique to the specific database.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ranjan |first1=R |title=Peer-to-peer cloud provisioning: Service discovery and load-balancing |journal=Cloud Computing |date=2010}}</ref>\n\n=====Scheduling algorithms=====\nNumerous [[scheduling algorithm]]s, also called load-balancing methods, are used by load balancers to determine which back-end server to send a request to.\nSimple algorithms include random choice, [[Round-robin scheduling|round robin]], or least connections.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205223948/https://f5.com/resources/white-papers/load-balancing-101-nuts-and-bolts|title=Load Balancing 101: Nuts and Bolts|date=2017-12-05|publisher=[[F5 Networks]]|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref> More sophisticated load balancers may take additional factors into account, such as a server's reported load, least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic it has recently been assigned.\n\n=====Persistence=====\nAn important issue when operating a load-balanced service is how to handle information that must be kept across the multiple requests in a user's session. If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIdeally, the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should not be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected.  This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database, for example [[Memcached]].\n\nOne basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as \"persistence\" or \"stickiness\". A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic [[failover]]: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost. The same problem is usually relevant to central database servers; even if web servers are \"stateless\" and not \"sticky\", the central database is (see below).\n\nAssignment to a particular server might be based on a username, client IP address, or be random. Because of changes of the client's perceived address resulting from [[DHCP]], [[network address translation]], and [[web proxy|web proxies]] this method may be unreliable. Random assignments must be remembered by the load balancer, which creates a burden on storage. If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a timeout period or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table. The random assignment method also requires that clients maintain some state, which can be a problem, for example when a web browser has disabled storage of cookies. Sophisticated load balancers use multiple persistence techniques to avoid some of the shortcomings of any one method.\n\nAnother solution is to keep the per-session data in a [[database]]. Generally, this is bad for performance because it increases the load on the database: the database is best used to store information less transient than per-session data. To prevent a database from becoming a [[single point of failure]], and to improve [[scalability]], the database is often replicated across multiple machines, and load balancing is used to spread the query load across those replicas.  [[Microsoft]]'s [[ASP.net]] State Server technology is an example of a session database. All servers in a web farm store their session data on State Server and any server in the farm can retrieve the data.\n\nIn the very common case where the client is a web browser, a simple but efficient approach is to store the per-session data in the browser itself. One way to achieve this is to use a [[HTTP cookie|browser cookie]], suitably time-stamped and encrypted. Another is [[URL rewriting]]. Storing session data on the client is generally the preferred solution: then the load balancer is free to pick any backend server to handle a request. However, this method of state-data handling is poorly suited to some complex business logic scenarios, where session state payload is big and recomputing it with every request on a server is not feasible. URL rewriting has major security issues, because the end-user can easily alter the submitted URL and thus change session streams.\n\nYet another solution to storing persistent data is to associate a name with each block of data, and use a [[distributed hash table]] to pseudo-randomly assign that name to one of the available servers, and then store that block of data in the assigned server.\n\n=====Load balancer features=====\nHardware and software load balancers may have a variety of special features. The fundamental feature of a load balancer is to be able to distribute incoming requests over a number of backend servers in the cluster according to a scheduling algorithm. Most of the following features are vendor specific:\n\n; Asymmetric load\n: A ratio can be manually assigned to cause some backend servers to get a greater share of the workload than others. This is sometimes used as a crude way to account for some servers having more capacity than others and may not always work as desired.\n; Priority activation\n: When the number of available servers drops below a certain number, or load gets too high, standby servers can be brought online.\n; [[TLS acceleration|TLS Offload and Acceleration]]\n: TLS (or its predecessor SSL) acceleration is a technique of offloading cryptographic protocol calculations onto a specialized hardware. Depending on the workload, processing the encryption and authentication requirements of an [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] request can become a major part of the demand on the Web Server's CPU; as the demand increases, users will see slower response times, as the TLS overhead is distributed among Web servers. To remove this demand on Web servers, a balancer can terminate TLS connections, passing HTTPS requests as HTTP requests to the Web servers. If the balancer itself is not overloaded, this does not noticeably degrade the performance perceived by end users. The downside of this approach is that all of the TLS processing is concentrated on a single device (the balancer) which can become a new bottleneck. Some load balancer appliances include specialized hardware to process TLS. Instead of upgrading the load balancer, which is quite expensive dedicated hardware, it may be cheaper to forgo TLS offload and add a few Web servers. Also, some server vendors such as Oracle/Sun now incorporate cryptographic acceleration hardware into their CPUs such as the T2000. F5 Networks incorporates a dedicated TLS acceleration hardware card in their local traffic manager (LTM) which is used for encrypting and decrypting TLS traffic. One clear benefit to TLS offloading in the balancer is that it enables it to do balancing or content switching based on data in the HTTPS request.\n; [[Distributed denial of service|Distributed Denial of Service]] (DDoS) attack protection\n: Load balancers can provide features such as [[SYN cookies]] and delayed-binding (the back-end servers don't see the client until it finishes its TCP handshake) to mitigate [[SYN flood]] attacks and generally offload work from the servers to a more efficient platform.\n; [[HTTP compression]]\n: HTTP compression reduces the amount of data to be transferred for HTTP objects by utilising gzip compression available in all modern web browsers.  The larger the response and the further away the client is, the more this feature can improve response times.  The trade-off is that this feature puts additional CPU demand on the load balancer and could be done by web servers instead.\n; TCP offload\n: Different vendors use different terms for this, but the idea is that normally each HTTP request from each client is a different TCP connection.  This feature utilises HTTP/1.1 to consolidate multiple HTTP requests from multiple clients into a single TCP socket to the back-end servers.\n; TCP buffering\n: The load balancer can buffer responses from the server and spoon-feed the data out to slow clients, allowing the web server to free a thread for other tasks faster than it would if it had to send the entire request to the client directly.\n; Direct Server Return\n: An option for asymmetrical load distribution, where request and reply have different network paths.\n; Health checking\n: The balancer polls servers for application layer health and removes failed servers from the pool.\n; [[HTTP caching]]\n: The balancer stores static content so that some requests can be handled without contacting the servers.\n; Content filtering\n: Some balancers can arbitrarily modify traffic on the way through.\n; HTTP security\n: Some balancers can hide HTTP error pages, remove server identification headers from HTTP responses, and encrypt cookies so that end users cannot manipulate them.\n; [[Priority queuing]]\n: Also known as [[rate shaping]], the ability to give different priority to different traffic.\n; Content-aware switching\n: Most load balancers can send requests to different servers based on the URL being requested, assuming the request is not encrypted (HTTP) or if it is encrypted (via HTTPS) that the HTTPS request is terminated (decrypted) at the load balancer.\n; Client authentication\n: Authenticate users against a variety of authentication sources before allowing them access to a website.\n; Programmatic traffic manipulation\n: At least one balancer allows the use of a scripting language to allow custom balancing methods, arbitrary traffic manipulations, and more.\n; [[Firewall (networking)|Firewall]]\n: Firewalls can prevent direct connections to backend servers, for network security reasons.\n; [[Intrusion prevention system]]\n: Intrusion prevention systems offer application layer security in addition to network/transport layer offered by firewall security.\n\n===Use in telecommunications===\nLoad balancing can be useful in applications with redundant communications links.  For example, a company may have multiple Internet connections ensuring network access if one of the connections fails. A [[failover]] arrangement would mean that one link is designated for normal use, while the second link is used only if the primary link fails.\n\nUsing load balancing, both links can be in use all the time.  A device or program monitors the availability of all links and selects the path for sending packets. The use of multiple links simultaneously increases the available bandwidth.\n\n====Shortest Path Bridging====\n{{Main|Shortest Path Bridging}}\n\nThe IEEE approved the [[IEEE 802.1aq]] standard May 2012,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title = IEEE APPROVES NEW IEEE 802.1aq\u2122 SHORTEST PATH BRIDGING STANDARD\n |publisher = IEEE\n |author = Shuang Yu\n |date = 8 May 2012\n |url = http://standards.ieee.org/news/2012/802.1aq.html\n |accessdate = 2 June 2012\n }}</ref> also known and documented in most books as [[Shortest Path Bridging|Shortest Path Bridging (SPB)]].

They use sophisticated load balancing to shift traffic from one path to another to avoid [[network congestion]] on any particular link, and sometimes to minimize the cost of transit across external networks or improve [[Reliability (computer networking)|network reliability]].\n\nAnother way of using load balancing is in [[network monitoring]] activities. Load balancers can be used to split huge data flows into several sub-flows and use several network analyzers, each reading a part of the original data. This is very useful for monitoring fast networks like [[10 Gigabit Ethernet|10GbE]] or STM64, where complex processing of the data may not be possible at [[wire speed]].<ref>Mohammad Noormohammadpour, Cauligi S.

PP, no. 99, pp. 1-1.</ref> It allows more efficient use of network bandwidth and reduces provisioning costs. In general, load balancing in datacenter networks can be classified as either static or dynamic. Static load balancing distributes traffic by computing a hash of the source and destination addresses and port numbers of traffic flows and using it to determine how flows are assigned to one of the existing paths. Dynamic load balancing assigns traffic flows to paths by monitoring bandwidth utilization of different paths. Dynamic assignment can also be proactive or reactive. In the former case, the assignment is fixed once made, while in the latter the network logic keeps monitoring available paths and shifts flows across them as network utilization changes (with arrival of new flows or completion of existing ones). A comprehensive overview of load balancing in datacenter networks has been made available.<ref name=architecture/>\n\n===Relationship to failovers===\nLoad balancing is often used to implement [[failover]]\u2014the continuation of a service after the failure of one or more of its components.  The components are monitored continually (e.g., web servers may be monitored by fetching known pages), and when one becomes non-responsive, the load balancer is informed and no longer sends traffic to it.  When a component comes back online, the load balancer begins to route traffic to it again.  For this to work, there must be at least one component in excess of the service's capacity ([[N+1 redundancy]]).  This can be much less expensive and more flexible than failover approaches where each single live component is paired with a single backup component that takes over in the event of a failure ([[dual modular redundancy]]).  Some types of [[RAID]] systems can also utilize [[hot spare]] for a similar effect.<ref name=\"IBM\">[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSVJJU_6.4.0/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc_6.4/ds_ag_srv_adm_dd_failover_load_balancing.html Failover and load balancing] ''IBM'' 6 January 2019</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Affinity mask]]\n* [[Application Delivery Controller]]\n* [[Autoscaling]]\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Common Address Redundancy Protocol]]\n* [[Edge computing]]\n* [[Fog computing]]\n* [[Network Load Balancing]]\n* [[Network Load Balancing Services]]\n* [[Partition (database)]]\n* [[Processor affinity]]\n* [[SRV record]]\n* [[Transposition-driven scheduling]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Load balancing (computing)}}\n* [http://www.udaparts.com/document/articles/snpisec.htm Server routing for load balancing with full auto failure recovery]\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Load Balancing (Computing)}}\n[[Category:Network management]]\n[[Category:Servers (computing)]]\n[[Category:Routing]]\n[[Category:Load balancing| ]]\n[[Category:Balancing technology]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:PRAM\u2192Parallel random-access machine", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)"}

Political violence in Germany}}\n{{Campaignbox Revolutions of 1917\u20131923}}\nThe '''German Revolution''' or '''November Revolution''' ({{lang-de|Novemberrevolution}}) was a civil conflict in the [[German Empire]] at the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] that resulted in the replacement of the German [[Federal monarchy|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a democratic [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] that later became known as the [[Weimar Republic]]. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the adoption in August 1919 of the [[Weimar Constitution]].\n\nThe causes of the revolution were the extreme burdens suffered by the population during the four years of war, the strong impact of the defeat on the German Empire and the social tensions between the general population and the elite of [[Aristocracy|aristocrats]] and [[bourgeoisie]] who held power and had just lost the war.\n\nThe roots of the revolution lay in the German Empire's defeat in the First World War and the social tensions that came to a head shortly thereafter. The first acts of revolution were triggered by the policies of the German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Command]] of the Army and its lack of coordination with the [[Seekriegsleitung|Naval Command]]. In the face of defeat, the Naval Command insisted on trying to precipitate a climactic battle with the British [[Royal Navy]] by means of its [[naval order of 24 October 1918]]. The battle never took place. Instead of obeying their orders to begin preparations to fight the British, German sailors led a revolt in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 29 October 1918, followed by the [[Kiel mutiny]] in the first days of November. These disturbances spread the spirit of civil unrest across Germany and ultimately led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918. Shortly thereafter, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]] abdicated his throne and fled the country.\n\nThe revolutionaries, inspired by [[Socialism|socialist]] ideas, did not hand over power to [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]-style councils as the [[Bolsheviks]] had done in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], because the leadership of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) opposed their creation. The SPD opted instead for a national assembly that would form the basis for a parliamentary system of government.<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M\u00fcller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, {{ISBN|978-90-04-21921-2}}, pp. 93\u2013100.</ref> Fearing an all-out civil war in Germany between militant workers and [[reactionary]] [[Conservatism in Germany|conservatives]], the SPD did not plan to strip the old German upper classes completely of their power and privileges. Instead, it sought to integrate them into the new [[social democracy|social democratic]] system. In this endeavour, SPD [[Left-wing politics|leftists]] sought an alliance with the German Supreme Command.  This allowed the army and the [[Freikorps]] ([[German nationalism|nationalist]] militias) to quell the [[Communism|communist]] [[Spartacist uprising]] of 4\u201315 January 1919 by force. The same alliance of political forces succeeded in suppressing uprisings of the left in other parts of Germany, with the result that the country was completely pacified by late 1919.\n\n[[1919 German federal election|Elections]] for the new [[Weimar National Assembly]] were held on 19 January 1919. The revolution ended on 11 August 1919, when the [[Weimar Constitution]] was adopted.\n\n== SPD and the World War ==\nIn the decade after 1900, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was the leading force in Germany's [[labour movement]]. With 35% of the national votes and 110 seats in the [[German federal election, 1912|Reichstag elected in 1912]], the Social Democrats had grown into the largest political party in Germany. Party membership was around one million, and the party newspaper (''[[Vorw\u00e4rts]]'') attracted 1.5 million subscribers. The trade unions had 2.5 million members, most of whom probably supported the Social Democrats. In addition, there were numerous co-operative societies (for example, apartment co-ops, shop co-ops, etc.), and other organizations directly linked to the SPD and the labor unions, or else adhering to Social Democratic ideology. Other notable parties in the Reichstag of 1912 were the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] (91 seats), the [[German Conservative Party]] (43), the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] (45), the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressive People's Party]] (42), the [[Polish Party]] (18), the [[Free Conservative Party|German Reich Party]] (14), the [[Economic Union (political party)|Economic Union]] (10), and the [[Alsace-Lorraine Party]] (9).\n\nAt the congresses of the [[Second International|Second Socialist International]], the SPD had always agreed to resolutions asking for combined action of Socialists in case of a war. Following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], the SPD, like other socialist parties in Europe, organised anti-war demonstrations during the [[July Crisis]]. After [[Rosa Luxemburg]] called for disobedience and rejection of war in the name of the entire party as a representative of the left wing of the party, the Imperial government planned to arrest the party leaders immediately at the onset of war. [[Friedrich Ebert]], one of the two party leaders since 1913, travelled to [[Z\u00fcrich]] with [[Otto Braun]] to save the party's funds from being confiscated.\n\nAfter Germany declared war on the [[Russian Empire]] on 1 August 1914, the majority of the SPD newspapers shared the general enthusiasm for the war (the \"[[Spirit of 1914]]\"), particularly because they viewed the Russian Empire as the most reactionary and anti-socialist power in Europe. In the first days of August, the editors believed themselves to be in line with the late [[August Bebel]], who had died the previous year. In 1904, he declared in the Reichstag that the SPD would support an armed defence of Germany against a foreign attack. In 1907, at a party convention in Essen, he even promised that he himself would \"shoulder the gun\" if it was to fight against Russia, the \"enemy of all culture and all the suppressed\".<ref>Ullrich, ''Die nerv\u00f6se Gro\u00dfmacht'' p. 446</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://geschichte.verdi.de/jahrestage_gedenktage/1._august_1914_beginn_des_ersten_weltkriegs/manfred_scharrer_august_1914_-_patriotismus_und_internationalismus/#das_patriotische_bekenntnis |first=Manfred |last=Scharrer |work=[[ver.di]] |title=Das patriotische Bekenntnis |language=de }}</ref> In the face of the general enthusiasm for the war among the population, which foresaw an attack by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, many SPD deputies worried they might lose many of their voters with their consistent [[pacifism]]. In addition, the government of Imperial Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] threatened to outlaw all parties in case of war. On the other hand, the chancellor exploited the anti-Russian stance of the SPD to procure the party's approval for the war.\n\nThe party leadership and the party's deputies were split on the issue of support for the war: 96 deputies, including [[Friedrich Ebert]], approved the [[war bond]]s demanded by the Imperial government. There were 14 deputies, headed by the second party leader, [[Hugo Haase]], who spoke out against the bonds, but nevertheless followed party voting instructions and raised their hands in favour.\n\nThus, the entire SPD faction in the Reichstag voted in favour of the war bonds on 4 August 1914. It was with those decisions by the party and the unions that the full mobilisation of the German Army became possible. Haase explained the decision against his will with the words: \"We will not let the fatherland alone in the hour of need!\" The Emperor welcomed the so-called \"truce\" (''[[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]]''), declaring: \"''Ich kenne keine Parteien mehr, ich kenne nur noch Deutsche!''\" (\"I no longer see parties, I see only Germans!\").<ref>[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''Der Verrat'' p. 12</ref>\n\nEven [[Karl Liebknecht]], who became one of the most outspoken opponents of the war, initially followed the line of the party that his father, [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], had cofounded: he abstained from voting and did not defy his own political colleagues. However, a few days later he joined the ''Gruppe Internationale'' (Group International) that [[Rosa Luxemburg]] had founded on 5 August 1914 with [[Franz Mehring]], [[Wilhelm Pieck]], and four others from the left wing of the party, which adhered to the prewar resolutions of the SPD. From that group emerged the [[Spartacus League]] (''Spartakusbund'') on 1 January 1916.\n\nOn 2 December 1914, Liebknecht voted against further war bonds, the only deputy of any party in the Reichstag to do so. Although he was not permitted to speak in the Reichstag to explain his vote, what he had planned to say was made public through the circulation of a leaflet that was claimed to be unlawful:\n\n<blockquote>The present war was not willed by any of the nations participating in it and it is not waged in the interest of the Germans or any other people. It is an imperialist war, a war for capitalist control of the world market, for the political domination of huge territories and to give scope to industrial and banking capital.</blockquote>\n\nBecause of high demand, this leaflet was soon printed and evolved into the so-called \"Political Letters\" ({{lang-de|Politische Briefe}}), collections of which were later published in defiance of the censorship laws under the name \"Spartacus Letters\" (''Spartakusbriefe''). As of December 1916, these were replaced by the journal ''Spartakus'', which appeared irregularly until November 1918.\n\nThis open opposition against the party line put Liebknecht at odds with some party members around Haase who were against the war bonds themselves. In February 1915, at the instigation of the SPD party leadership, Liebknecht was conscripted for military service to dispose of him, the only SPD deputy to be so treated. Because of his attempts to organise objectors against the war, he was expelled from the SPD, and in June 1916, he was sentenced on a charge of [[high treason]] to four years in prison. While Liebknecht was in the army, Rosa Luxemburg wrote most of the \"Spartacus Letters\". After serving a prison sentence, she was put back in jail under \"preventive detention\" until the war ended.\n\n=== SPD's split ===\nAs the war dragged on and the death tolls rose, more SPD members began to question the adherence to the ''Burgfrieden'' (the truce in domestic politics) of 1914. The SPD also objected to the domestic misery that followed the dismissal of [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] as Chief of the General Staff in 1916. His replacement, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], introduced the [[Hindenburg Programme]] by which the guidelines of German policy were ''[[de facto]]'' set by the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]] ({{lang-de|Oberste Heeresleitung}}), not the emperor and the chancellor. Hindenburg's subordinate, [[Erich Ludendorff]], took on broad responsibilities for directing wartime policies that were extensive. Although the Emperor and Hindenburg were his nominal superiors, it was Ludendorff who made the important decisions. Hindenburg and Ludendorff persisted with ruthless strategies aimed at achieving military victory, pursued expansionist and aggressive war goals and subjugated civilian life to the needs of the war and the war economy. For the labour force, that often meant 12-hour work days at minimal wages with inadequate food. The [[Auxiliary Services Act (1916)|''Hilfsdienstgesetz'' (Auxiliary Service Law)]] forced all men not in the armed forces to work.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Russian [[February Revolution]] in 1917, the first organised strikes erupted in German armament factories in March and April, with about 300,000 workers going on strike. The strike was organized by a group called the [[Revolutionary Stewards]] (''Revolution\u00e4re Obleute''), led by their spokesman [[Richard M\u00fcller (socialist)|Richard M\u00fcller]]. The group emerged from a network of left-wing unionists who disagreed with the support of the war that came from the union leadership.<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M\u00fcller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, {{ISBN|978-90-04-21921-2}}, pp. 35\u201361.</ref> The [[American entry into World War I]] on 6 April 1917 threatened further deterioration in Germany's military position. Hindenburg and Ludendorff had called for an end to the moratorium on attacks on neutral shipping in the Atlantic, which had been imposed when the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', a British ship carrying US citizens, was sunk off [[Ireland]] in 1915. Their decision signaled a new strategy to stop the flow of US [[materiel]] to France to make a German victory (or at least a peace settlement on German terms) possible before the United States entered the war as a combatant. The emperor tried to appease the population in his Easter address of 7 April by promising democratic elections in Prussia after the war, but lack of progress in bringing the war to a satisfactory end dulled its effect. Opposition to the war among munitions workers continued to rise, and what had been a united front in favour of the war split into two sharply divided groups.<ref>Winkler, ''Der lange Weg nach Westen'', Beck Verlag Munich, 2000, p. 362</ref>\n\nAfter the SPD leadership under [[Friedrich Ebert]] excluded the opponents of the war from his party, the Spartacists joined with so-called [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]] such as [[Eduard Bernstein]] and [[Centrist Marxism|centrists]] such as [[Karl Kautsky]] to found the fully anti-war [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) under the leadership of [[Hugo Haase]] on 9 April 1917. The SPD was now known as the [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (MSPD) and continued to be led by Friedrich Ebert. The USPD demanded an immediate end to the war and a further democratisation of Germany but did not have a unified agenda for social policies. The Spartacist League, which until then had opposed a split of the party, now made up the left wing of the USPD. Both the USPD and the Spartacists continued their anti-war propaganda in factories, especially in the armament plants.\n\n== Impact of the Russian Revolution ==\n{{further|Russian Revolution}}\nAfter the [[February Revolution]] in Russia and the abdication of Tsar [[Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]] as of 21 July 1917, continued the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers. Nevertheless, Russian society was severely strained by the opposing motivations of patriotism and anti-war sentiment. There was sizable support for continuing the war to defend Russia's honour and territory, but also a strong desire to remove Russia from the conflict and let the other countries of Europe destroy one another without Russian involvement.\n\nThe German Imperial Government now saw one more chance for victory. To support the anti-war sentiment in Russia and perhaps turn the tide in Russia toward a [[separate peace]], it permitted the leader of the Russian [[Bolsheviks]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], to pass in a sealed train wagon from his place of exile in Switzerland through Germany, Sweden and Finland to [[Petrograd]].<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\">{{cite book |last=Volkogonov |first=Dmitri |authorlink=Dmitri Volkogonov |year=1994 |title=Lenin: A New Biography |isbn=978-0-02-933435-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/leninnewbiograph00volk }}</ref> Since he had heard about the February Revolution, Lenin had been scheming on how to get back into Russia, but no option previously available to him proved successful.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/> Within months, Lenin led the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks seized power from the moderates and withdrew Russia from the world war. [[Leon Trotsky]] observed that the October Revolution could not have succeeded if Lenin had remained stuck in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/>\n\nThus, the Imperial German government had an important influence in the creation of what would become the [[Soviet Union]] by turning over Russia's socialist transformation decisively into the hands of the Bolsheviks, whereas in February, it had been oriented toward parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn early and mid-1918, many people in both Russia and Germany expected that Russia would now \"return the favor\" by helping to foster a [[communist revolution]] on German soil.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/> European communists had long looked forward to a time when Germany, the homeland of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], would undergo such a revolution. The success of the Russian proletariat and peasantry in overthrowing their ruling classes raised fears among the German bourgeoisie that such a revolution could take place in Germany as well. Furthermore, the [[proletarian internationalism]] of Marx and Engels was still very influential in both Western Europe and Russia at the time, and Marx and Engels had predicted that for a communist revolution to succeed in Russia, there would probably need to be a Western European communist revolution earlier or at least simultaneously. Lenin had high hopes for [[world revolution]] in 1917 and 1918.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/> The communism of Marx and Engels had had a sizable following among German workers for decades, and there were quite a few German revolutionaries eager to see revolutionary success in Russia and have help from Russian colleagues in a German revolution.\n\nThe moderate SPD leadership noted that a determined and well-managed group of the Bolshevik type might well try to seize power in Germany, quite possibly with Bolshevik help, and they moved their behavior towards the left as the German Revolution approached. Otto Braun, board member of the SPD and later Prime Minister of [[Prussia]], clarified the position of his party in a leading article in the SPD newspaper ''[[Vorw\u00e4rts]]'' under the title \"The Bolsheviks and Us\":\n\n<blockquote>Socialism cannot be erected on bayonets and machine guns. If it is to last, it must be realised with democratic means. Therefore of course it is a necessary prerequisite that the economic and social conditions for socializing society are ripe. If this was the case in Russia, the Bolsheviks no doubt could rely on the majority of the people. As this is not the case, they established a reign of the sword that could not have been more brutal and reckless under the disgraceful regime of the Tzar.... Therefore we must draw a thick, visible dividing line between us and the Bolsheviks.<ref>''Schulze, Weimar. Germany 1917\u20131933'', p. 158</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the same month in which Otto Braun's article appeared (October 1918), another series of strikes swept through Germany with the participation of over 1 million workers. For the first time during these strikes, the so-called Revolutionary Stewards took action. They were to play an important part in further developments. They called themselves \"[[Workers' council|Councils]]\" (''R\u00e4te'') after the Russian \"[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]\". To weaken their influence, Ebert joined the Berlin strike leadership and achieved an early termination of the strike.\n\nOn 3 March 1918, the newly established Soviet government agreed to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] negotiated with the Germans by [[Leon Trotsky]]. The settlement arguably contained harsher terms for the Russians than the later [[Treaty of Versailles]] would demand of the Germans. The Bolsheviks' principal motivation for acceding to so many of Germany's demands was to stay in power at any cost amid the backdrop of the [[Russian Civil War]]. Lenin and Trotsky also believed at the time that all of Europe would soon see [[world revolution]] and [[proletarian internationalism]], and [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois nationalistic]] interests as a framework to judge the treaty would become irrelevant.\n\nWith Russia knocked out of the war, the German Supreme Command could now move part of the eastern armies to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Most Germans believed that victory in the west was now at hand.\n\n== Leftist and rightist approaches to peace ==\nIn spite of the optimism created by the surrender of Russia early in 1918, there could be no question that the military situation on the Western Front had become more precarious for the Germans after the United States entered the war in April 1917. In the wake of the United States declaration of war, the SPD in the Reichstag joined the \"Interfactional Committee\" with the Centre Party and the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressive People's Party]]. In summer 1917, these three parties passed a peace resolution providing for a peace through rapprochement without annexations and payments, as opposed to a peace through victory and annexations, as the political right was demanding. Along with almost everyone else in the country, the committee still believed in victory. The Imperial German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]] did not like this resolution, and in the negotiations from December 1917 to March 1918 with Russia, it imposed a harsh peace by victory.\n\nThe Supreme Command also rejected outright the \"[[Fourteen Points]]\" set out by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on 8 January 1918. Wilson wanted peace on the basis of \"self-determination of peoples\" without victors or conquered. Hindenburg and Ludendorff rejected the offer because they believed themselves to be in a stronger position than they were before their victory over Russia. They continued to bet on a \"peace through victory\", with far-reaching annexations at the expense of Germany's enemies.\n\n== Request for ceasefire and change of constitution ==\nAfter the victory in the east, the Supreme Army Command on 21 March 1918 launched its so-called [[Spring Offensive]] in the west to turn the war decisively in Germany's favour, but by July 1918, their last reserves were used up, and Germany's military defeat became certain. The Allied forces scored numerous successive victories in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] between August and November 1918 that yielded huge territorial gains at the expense of Germany. The arrival of large numbers of fresh troops from the United States was a decisive factor.\n\nIn mid-September, the [[Balkan Front]] collapsed. The [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], an ally of the German Empire and [[Austria-Hungary]], capitulated on 27 September. The political collapse of Austria-Hungary itself was now only a matter of days away.\n\nOn 29 September, the Supreme Army Command, at army headquarters in [[Spa, Belgium]], informed Emperor Wilhelm II and the Imperial [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] Count [[Georg von Hertling]] that the military situation was hopeless. Ludendorff said that he could not guarantee to hold the front for another 24 hours and demanded a request to the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers for an immediate [[ceasefire]]. In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demand of Wilson to put the Imperial Government on a democratic footing in hopes of more favourable peace terms. This enabled him to protect the reputation of the Imperial Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely at the feet of the democratic parties and the Reichstag.\n\nAs he said to his staff officers on 1 October: \"They now must lie on the bed that they have made us.\"<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 32f.</ref>\n\nThus, the so-called \"[[stab-in-the-back legend]]\" ({{lang-de|Dolchsto\u00dflegende}}) was born, according to which the revolutionaries had attacked the undefeated army from the rear and turned an almost-certain victory into a defeat.\n\nIn fact, the Imperial Government and the German Army shirked their responsibility for defeat from the very beginning and tried to place the blame for it on the new democratic government. The motivation behind it is verified by the following citation in the autobiography of [[Wilhelm Groener]], Ludendorff's successor:\n\n<blockquote>It was just fine with me when Army and Army Command remained as guiltless as possible in these wretched truce negotiations, from which nothing good could be expected.<ref name=\"Schulze, p. 149\">Schulze, ''Weimar. Deutschland 1917\u20131933'' p. 149</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn nationalist circles, the myth fell on fertile ground. The nationalists soon defamed the revolutionaries (and even politicians like Ebert who never wanted a revolution and did everything to prevent it) as \"November Criminals\" (''Novemberverbrecher''). When [[Adolf Hitler]] planned his [[Beer Hall Putsch|attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 1923]] in collaboration with Ludendorff, the heavily symbolic date of 9 November (the anniversary of the proclamation of the republic he was trying to overthrow) was chosen for its launch.\n\nAlthough shocked by Ludendorff's report and the news of the defeat, the majority parties in the Reichstag, especially the SPD, were willing to take on the responsibility of government at the eleventh hour. As a convinced royalist, Hertling objected to handing over the reins to the Reichstag, thus Emperor Wilhelm II appointed [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] as the new Imperial Chancellor on 3 October. The prince was considered a liberal, but at the same time a representative of the royal family. In his cabinet, Social Democrats dominated. The most prominent and highest-ranking one was [[Philipp Scheidemann]], as under-secretary without portfolio. The following day, the new government offered to the Allies the truce that Ludendorff had demanded.\n\nIt was only on 5 October that the German public was informed of the dismal situation that it faced. In the general state of shock about the defeat, which now had become obvious, the constitutional changes, formally decided by the Reichstag on 28 October, went almost unnoticed. From then on, the Imperial Chancellor and his ministers depended on the confidence of the parliamentary majority. After the Supreme Command had passed from the emperor to the Imperial Government, the German Empire changed from a constitutional to a [[parliamentary monarchy]]. As far as the Social Democrats were concerned, the so-called October Constitution met all the important constitutional objectives of the party. Ebert already regarded 5 October as the birthday of German democracy since the emperor voluntarily ceded power and so he considered a revolution unnecessary.\n\n== Third Wilson note and Ludendorff's dismissal ==\nIn the following three weeks, American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] responded to the request for a truce with three diplomatic notes. As a precondition for negotiations, he demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and (implicitly) the emperor's abdication.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Spencer |title=World War I: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection |publisher=ABC-CLIO |place=Santa Barbara |year=2014 |page=2069 |isbn=978-1-85109-964-1 }}</ref> This last demand was intended to render the process of democratisation irreversible.\n\nAfter the third note of 24 October, General Ludendorff changed his mind and declared the conditions of the Allies to be unacceptable. He now demanded the resumption of the war that he had declared lost only one month earlier. While the request for a truce was being processed, the Allies came to realise Germany's military weakness. The German troops had come to expect the war to end and were anxious to return home. They were scarcely willing to fight more battles, and desertions were increasing.\n\nFor the time being, the Imperial government stayed on course and replaced Ludendorff as First General Quartermaster with General Groener. Ludendorff fled with false papers to neutral Sweden. On 5 November, the Entente Powers agreed to take up negotiations for a truce, but after the third note, many soldiers and the general population believed that the emperor had to abdicate to achieve peace.\n\n== Revolution ==\n{{Revolution sidebar}}\n\n=== Sailors' revolt ===\n{{main|Kiel mutiny}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J0908-0600-002, Novemberrevolution, Matrosenaufstand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kiel mutiny]]: the soldiers' council of {{SMS|Prinzregent Luitpold||2}}.]]\nWhile the war-weary troops and general population of Germany awaited the speedy end of the war, the [[Seekriegsleitung|Imperial Naval Command]] in Kiel under Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] and Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] planned to dispatch the Imperial [[Kaiserliche Marine|Fleet]] for a [[Naval order of 24 October 1918|last battle]] against the [[Royal Navy]] in the southern North Sea. The two admirals sought to lead this military action on their own initiative, without authorization.\n\nThe [[naval order of 24 October 1918]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/german-sailors-begin-to-mutiny |title=1918 German sailors begin to mutiny |website=history.com |accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> and the preparations to sail triggered a [[mutiny]] among the affected sailors. The revolt soon precipitated a general revolution in Germany that would sweep aside the monarchy within a few days. The mutinous sailors had no intention of risking their lives so close to the end of the war. They were also convinced that the credibility of the new democratic government, engaged as it was in seeking an armistice with the victorious Entente, would have been compromised by a naval attack at such a crucial point in negotiations.\n\nThe sailors' revolt started in the [[Schillig Roads]] off [[Wilhelmshaven]], where the German fleet had anchored in expectation of battle. During the night of 29\u201330 October 1918, some crews refused to obey orders. Sailors on board three ships of the Third Navy Squadron refused to weigh anchor. Part of the crew of {{SMS|Th\u00fcringen}} and {{SMS|Helgoland}}, two [[battleship]]s of the [[I Battle Squadron]], committed outright mutiny and sabotage. However, when some [[torpedo boat]]s directed their guns onto these ships a day later, the mutineers gave up and were led away without any resistance. Nonetheless, the Naval Command had to drop its plans for a naval engagement with British naval forces since it was felt that the loyalty of the crews could not be relied upon any more. The [[III Battle Squadron]] was ordered back to Kiel.\n\nThe squadron commander Vice-Admiral Kraft carried out a maneuver with his battleships in [[Heligoland Bight]]. The maneuver was successful, and he believed that he had regained control of his crews. While moving through the [[Kiel Canal]], he had 47 of the crew of {{SMS|Markgraf}}, who were seen as the ringleaders, imprisoned. In Holtenau (the end of the canal in Kiel), they were taken to the ''Arrestanstalt'' (military prison) in Kiel and to Fort Herwarth in the north of Kiel.\n\nThe sailors and stokers were now pulling out all the stops to prevent the fleet setting sail again and to achieve the release of their comrades. Some 250 met in the evening of 1 November in the Union House in Kiel. Delegations sent to their officers requesting the mutineers' release were not heard. The sailors were now looking for closer ties to the unions, the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]] and the SPD. Then, the Union House was closed by police, leading to an even larger joint open air meeting on 2 November. Led by the sailor [[Karl Artelt]], who worked in the torpedo workshop in Kiel-Friedrichsort, and by the mobilised shipyard worker [[Lothar Popp]], both USPD members, the sailors called for a mass meeting the following day at the same place: the ''Gro\u00dfer Exerzierplatz'' (large drill ground).\n\nThis call was heeded by several thousand people on the afternoon of 3 November, with workers' representatives also present. The slogan \"Peace and Bread\" (''Frieden und Brot'') was raised, showing that the sailors and workers demanded not only the release of the prisoners but also the end of the war and the improvement of food provisions. Eventually, the people supported Artelt's call to free the prisoners, and they moved towards the military prison. Sub-Lieutenant Steinh\u00e4user, in order to stop the demonstrators, ordered his patrol to fire warning shots and then to shoot directly into the demonstration; 7 people were killed and 29 severely injured. Some demonstrators also opened fire. Steinh\u00e4user himself was seriously injured by rifle-butt blows and shots, but contrary to later statements, he was not killed.<ref>See Hauptkrankenbuch Festungslazarett Kiel, Nr. 15918, Krankenbuchlager Berlin, zit. bei Dirk, D\u00e4hnhardt, ''Revolution in Kiel''. p. 66.</ref> After this eruption, the demonstrators and the patrol dispersed. Nevertheless, the mass protest turned into a general revolt.\n\nOn the morning of 4 November, groups of mutineers moved through the town of Kiel. Sailors in a large barracks compound in a northern district mutinied: after a divisional inspection by the commander, spontaneous demonstrations took place. Karl Artelt organised the first soldiers' council and soon many more were set up. The governor of the naval station, [[Wilhelm Souchon]], was compelled to negotiate.\n\nThe imprisoned sailors and stokers were freed, and soldiers and workers brought public and military institutions under their control. In breach of Souchon's promise, separate troops advanced to end the rebellion but were intercepted by the mutineers and sent back or decided to join the sailors and workers. By the evening of 4 November, Kiel was firmly in the hands of about 40,000 rebellious sailors, soldiers and workers, as was Wilhelmshaven two days later.\n\nOn the same evening, the SPD deputy [[Gustav Noske]] arrived in Kiel and was welcomed enthusiastically, but he had orders from the new government and the SPD leadership to bring the uprising under control. He had himself elected chairman of the soldiers' council and reinstated peace and order. Some days later he took over the governor's post, and Lothar Popp of the USPD became chairman of the overall soldiers' council.\n\nDuring the following weeks, Noske succeeded in reducing the influence of the councils in Kiel, but he could not prevent the spread of the revolution throughout Germany. The events had already spread far beyond Kiel.\n\n=== Spread of revolution to the entire German Empire ===\nAround 4 November, delegations of the sailors dispersed to all of the major cities in Germany. By 7 November, the revolution had seized all large coastal cities as well as [[Hanover]], [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[Frankfurt on Main]], and [[Munich]]. In Munich, a \"Workers' and Soldiers' Council\" forced the last [[King of Bavaria]], [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]], to issue the [[Anif declaration]]. [[Bavaria]] was the first member state of the German Empire to be declared a ''[[Volksstaat Bayern|Volksstaat]]'', the [[People's State of Bavaria]], by [[Kurt Eisner]] of the USPD who asserted that Ludwig III had abdicated his throne via the Anif declaration. In the following days, the dynastic rulers of all the other German states abdicated; the last was [[G\u00fcnther Victor, Prince of Schwarzburg]], on 23 November.\n\nThe Workers' and Soldiers' Councils were almost entirely made up of MSPD and USPD members. Their program was democracy, pacifism and anti-militarism. Apart from the dynastic families, they deprived only the military commands of their power and privilege. The duties of the imperial civilian administration and office bearers such as police, municipal administrations and courts were not curtailed or interfered with. There were hardly any confiscations of property or [[occupation of factories]], because such measures were expected from the new government. In order to create an executive committed to the revolution and to the future of the new government, the councils for the moment claimed only to take over the supervision of the administration from the military commands.\n\nThus, the MSPD was able to establish a firm base on the local level. But while the councils believed they were acting in the interest of the new order, the party leaders of the MSPD regarded them as disturbing elements for a peaceful changeover of power{{clarify|date=September 2012}} that they imagined already to have taken place. Along with the middle-class parties, they demanded speedy elections for a national assembly that would make the final decision on the constitution of the new state. This soon brought the MSPD into opposition with many of the revolutionaries. It was especially the USPD that took over{{clarify|date=September 2012}} their demands, one of which was to delay elections as long as possible to try to achieve a ''fait accompli'' that met the expectations of a large part of the workforce.\n\nNotably, revolutionary sentiment did not affect the [[former eastern territories of Germany|eastern lands of the Empire]] to any considerable extent, apart from isolated instances of agitation in [[Breslau]] and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]]. But interethnic discontent among Germans and minority Poles in the eastern extremities of [[Silesia]], long suppressed in Wilhelmine Germany, would eventually lead to the [[Silesian Uprisings]].\n\nBy the time the revolution was over in 1918, [[List of German monarchs in 1918|all 21 German monarchs]] had been dethroned.\n\n=== Reactions in Berlin ===\nEbert agreed with Prince Maximilian that a social revolution must be prevented and that state order must be upheld at all costs. In the restructuring of the state, Ebert wanted to win over the middle-class parties that had already cooperated with the SPD in the Reichstag in 1917, as well as the old elites of the German Empire. He wanted to avoid the spectre of radicalisation of the revolution along Russian lines and he also worried that the precarious supply situation could collapse, leading to the takeover of the administration by inexperienced revolutionaries. He was certain that the SPD would be able to implement its reform plans in the future due to its parliamentary majorities.\n\nEbert did his best to act in agreement with the old powers and intended to save the monarchy. In order to demonstrate some success to his followers, he demanded the abdication of the emperor as of 6 November. But Wilhelm II, still in his headquarters in Spa, was playing for time. After the Entente had agreed to truce negotiations on that day, he hoped to return to Germany at the head of the army and to quell the revolution by force.\n\nAccording to notes taken by Prince Maximilian, Ebert declared on 7 November, \"If the Kaiser does not abdicate, the social revolution is unavoidable. But I do not want it, indeed I hate it like sin.\" (''{{lang|de|Wenn der Kaiser nicht abdankt, dann ist die soziale Revolution unvermeidlich. Ich aber will sie nicht, ja, ich hasse sie wie die S\u00fcnde.}}'')<ref>v. Baden: ''Erinnerungen und Dokumente'' p. 599 f.</ref> The chancellor planned to travel to Spa and convince the emperor personally of the necessity to abdicate. But this plan was overtaken by the rapidly deteriorating situation in Berlin.\n\n===Saturday, 9 November 1918: two proclamations of a republic ===\n{{See also|List of German monarchs in 1918#November Revolution abdications{{!}}November Revolution abdications}}\nIn order to remain master of the situation, Friedrich Ebert demanded the chancellorship for himself on the afternoon of 9 November, the day of the emperor's abdication.\n\nThe news of the abdication came too late to make any impression on the demonstrators. Nobody heeded the public appeals. More and more demonstrators demanded the total abolition of the monarchy. Karl Liebknecht, just released from prison, had returned to Berlin and re-founded the Spartacist League the previous day. At lunch in the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], the SPD deputy chairman Philipp Scheidemann learned that Liebknecht planned the proclamation of a socialist republic. Scheidemann did not want to leave the initiative to the Spartacists and without further ado, he stepped out onto a balcony of the Reichstag. From there, he proclaimed a republic before a mass of demonstrating people on his own authority (against Ebert's expressed will). A few hours later, the Berlin newspapers reported that in the Berlin [[Lustgarten]] \u2013 at probably around the same time \u2013  Liebknecht had proclaimed a socialist republic, which he affirmed from a balcony of the [[Berlin City Palace]] to an assembled crowd at around 4 pm.\n\nAt that time, Karl Liebknecht's intentions were little known to the public. The Spartacist League's demands of 7 October for a far-reaching restructuring of the economy, the army and the judiciary \u2013 among other things by abolishing the death penalty \u2013 had not yet been publicised. The biggest bone of contention with the SPD was to be the Spartacists' demand for the establishment of \"unalterable political facts\" on the ground by social and other measures before the election of a constituent assembly, while the SPD wanted to leave the decision on the future economic system to the assembly.\n\n[[File:Ausrufung Republik Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|Crowds outside the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] on 9 November as the creation of the republic was announced.]]\nEbert was faced with a dilemma. The first proclamation he had issued on 9 November was addressed \"to the citizens of Germany\".\n\nEbert wanted to take the sting out of the revolutionary mood and to meet the demands of the demonstrators for the unity of the labour parties. He offered the USPD participation in the government and was ready to accept Liebknecht as a minister. Liebknecht in turn demanded the control of the workers' councils over the army. As USPD chairman Hugo Haase was in Kiel and the deliberations went on. The USPD deputies were unable to reach a decision that day.\n\nNeither the early announcement of the emperor's abdication, Ebert's assumption of the chancellorship, nor Scheidemann's proclamation of the republic were covered by the constitution.  These were all revolutionary actions by protagonists who did not want a revolution, but nevertheless took action. However, a real revolutionary action took place the same evening that would later prove to have been in vain.\n\nAround 8 pm, a group of 100 Revolutionary Stewards from the larger Berlin factories occupied the Reichstag. Led by their spokesmen [[Richard M\u00fcller (socialist)|Richard M\u00fcller]] and [[Emil Barth]], they formed a revolutionary parliament. Most of the participating stewards had already been leaders during the strikes earlier in the year. They did not trust the SPD leadership and had planned a coup for 11 November independently of the sailors' revolt, but were surprised by the revolutionary events since Kiel. In order to snatch the initiative from Ebert, they now decided to announce elections for the following day. On that Sunday, every Berlin factory and every regiment was to elect workers' and soldiers' councils that were then in turn to elect a revolutionary government from members of the two labour parties (SPD and USPD). This [[Council of the People's Deputies]] (''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'') was to execute the resolutions of the revolutionary parliament as the revolutionaries intended to replace Ebert's function as chancellor and president.\n<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M\u00fcller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, pp. 61\u201379.</ref>\n\n===Sunday, 10 November: revolutionary councils elected, Armistice ===\n[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|\"Berlin seized by revolutionists\": ''[[The New York Times]]'' on [[Armistice Day]], 11 November 1918.]]\nThe same evening, the SPD leadership heard of these plans. As the elections and the councils' meeting could not be prevented, Ebert sent speakers to all Berlin regiments and into the factories in the same night and early the following morning. They were to influence the elections in his favour and announce the intended participation of the USPD in the government.\n\nIn turn, these activities did not escape the attention of Richard M\u00fcller and the revolutionary shop stewards.<ref>See: Ralf Hoffrogge, From Unionism to Workers' Councils \u2013 The Revolutionary Shop Stewards in Germany 1914\u20131918, in: Immanuel Ness and Dario Azzellini(Eds): Ours to Master and to Own: Worker's Control from the Commune to the Present, Chicago 2011</ref> Seeing that Ebert would also be running the new government, they planned to propose to the assembly not only the election of a government, but also the appointment of an Action Committee. This committee was to co-ordinate the activities of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils. For this election, the Stewards had already prepared a list of names on which the SPD was not represented. In this manner, they hoped to install a monitoring body acceptable to them watching the government.\n\nIn the assembly that convened on 10 November in the Circus Busch, the majority stood on the side of the SPD: almost all Soldiers' Councils and a large part of the workers representatives. They repeated the demand for the \"Unity of the Working Class\" that had been put forward by the revolutionaries the previous day and now used this motto in order to push through Ebert's line. As planned, three members of each socialist party were elected into the \"Council of People's Representatives\": from the USPD, their chairman [[Hugo Haase]], the deputy Wilhelm Dittmann and [[Emil Barth]] for the Revolutionary Stewards; from the SPD Ebert, Scheidemann and the Magdeburg deputy [[Otto Landsberg]].\n\nThe proposal by the [[shop stewards]] to elect an action committee additionally took the SPD leadership by surprise and started heated debates. Ebert finally succeeded in having this 24-member \"Executive Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils\" equally filled with SPD and USPD members. The Executive Council was chaired by Richard M\u00fcller and Brutus Molkenbuhr.\n\nOn the evening of 10 November, there was a phone call between Ebert and General [[Wilhelm Groener]], the new First General Quartermaster in Spa, Belgium. Assuring Ebert of the support of the army, the general was given Ebert's promise to reinstate the military hierarchy and, with the help of the army, to take action against the councils.\n\nIn the turmoil of this day, the Ebert government's acceptance of the harsh terms of the Entente for a truce, after a renewed demand by the Supreme Command, went almost unnoticed. On 11 November, the Centre Party deputy [[Matthias Erzberger]], on behalf of Berlin, signed [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|the armistice agreement]] in [[Compi\u00e8gne]], France, and World War I came to an end.\n\n=== Double rule ===\nAlthough Ebert had saved the decisive role of the SPD, he was not happy with the results. He did not regard the Council Parliament and the Executive Council as helpful, but only as obstacles impeding a smooth transition from empire to a new system of government. The whole SPD leadership mistrusted the councils rather than the old elites in army and administration, and they considerably overestimated the old elite's loyalty to the new republic. What troubled Ebert most was that he could not now act as chancellor in front of the councils, but only as chairman of a revolutionary government. Though he had taken the lead of the revolution only to halt it, conservatives saw him as a traitor.\n\nIn theory, the Executive Council was the highest-ranking council of the revolutionary regime and therefore M\u00fcller the head of state of the new declared \"Socialist Republic of Germany\". But in practice, the council's initiative was blocked by internal power struggles. The Executive Council decided to summon an \"Imperial Council Convention\" in December to Berlin.  In the eight weeks of double rule of councils and imperial government, the latter always was dominant. Although Haase was formally a chairman in the Council with equal rights, the whole higher level administration reported only to Ebert.\n\nThe SPD worried that the revolution would end in a Council (Soviet) Republic, following the Russian example. However, the secret [[Ebert-Groener pact]] did not win over the Imperial Officer Corps for the republic. As Ebert's behaviour became increasingly puzzling to the revolutionary workers, the soldiers and their stewards, the SPD leadership lost more and more of their supporters' confidence, without gaining any sympathies from the opponents of the revolution on the right.\n\n=== Stinnes\u2013Legien Agreement ===\nThe revolutionaries disagreed among themselves about the future economic and political system. Both SPD and USPD favoured placing at least heavy industry under democratic control. The left wings of both parties and the Revolutionary Stewards wanted to go beyond that and establish a \"direct democracy\" in the production sector, with elected delegates controlling the political power. It was not only in the interest of the SPD to prevent a Council Democracy; even the unions would have been rendered superfluous by the councils.\n\nTo prevent this development, the union leaders under [[Carl Legien]] and the representatives of big industry under [[Hugo Stinnes]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens]] met in Berlin from 9 to 12 November. On 15 November, they signed an agreement with advantages for both sides: the union representatives promised to guarantee orderly production, to end wildcat strikes, to drive back the influence of the councils and to prevent a nationalisation of means of production. For their part, the employers guaranteed to introduce the [[eight-hour day]], which the workers had demanded in vain for years. The employers agreed to the union claim of sole representation and to the lasting recognition of the unions instead of the councils. Both parties formed a \"Central Committee for the Maintenance of the Economy\" (Zentralausschuss f\u00fcr die Aufrechterhaltung der Wirtschaft).\n\nAn \"Arbitration Committee\" (Schlichtungsausschuss) was to mediate future conflicts between employers and unions. From now on, committees together with the management were to monitor the wage settlements in every factory with more than 50 employees.\n\nWith this arrangement, the unions had achieved one of their longtime demands, but undermined all efforts for nationalising means of production and largely eliminated the councils.\n\n=== Interim government and council movement ===\nThe Reichstag had not been summoned since 9 November. The [[Council of the People's Deputies]] and the Executive Council had replaced the old government, but the previous administrative machinery remained unchanged. Imperial servants had only representatives of SPD and USPD assigned to them.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} These servants all kept their positions and continued to do their work in most respects unchanged.\n\nOn 12 November, the Council of People's Representatives published its democratic and social government programme. It lifted the state of siege and censorship, abolished the \"Gesindeordnung\" (\"servant rules\" that governed relations between servant and master) and introduced universal suffrage from 20 years up, for the first time for women. There was an amnesty for all political prisoners. Regulations for the freedom of association, assembly and press were enacted. The eight-hour day became statutory on the basis of the Stinnes\u2013Legien Agreement, and benefits for unemployment, social insurance, and workers' compensation were expanded.\n\nAt the insistence of USPD representatives, the Council of People's Representatives appointed a \"Nationalisation Committee\" including [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]] and Otto Hue, among others. This committee was to examine which industries were \"fit\" for nationalisation and to prepare the nationalisation of the coal and steel industry. It sat until 7 April 1919, without any tangible result. \"Self-Administration Bodies\" were installed only in coal and potash mining and in the steel industry. From these bodies emerged the modern German Works or Factory Committees. Socialist expropriations were not initiated.\n\n[[File:Rathaus Bremen 15111918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the Bremen [[revolutionary republic]], outside the town hall, on 15 November 1918.]]\nThe SPD leadership worked with the old administration rather than with the new Workers' and Soldiers' Councils, because it considered them incapable of properly supplying the needs of the population. As of mid-November, this caused continuing strife with the Executive Council. As the Council continuously changed its position following whoever it just happened to represent, Ebert withdrew more and more responsibilities planning to end the \"meddling and interfering\" of the Councils in Germany for good. But Ebert and the SPD leadership by far overestimated the power not only of the Council Movement but also of the Spartacist League. The Spartacist League, for example, never had control over the Council Movement as the conservatives and parts of the SPD believed.\n\nIn [[Leipzig]], [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]], [[Chemnitz]], and [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils took the city administrations under their control. In addition, in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[M\u00fclheim/Ruhr]], and [[Zwickau]], all civil servants loyal to the emperor were arrested. In Hamburg and Bremen, \"Red Guards\" were formed that were to protect the revolution. The councils deposed the management of the [[Leuna works]], a giant chemical factory near [[Merseburg]]. The new councils were often appointed spontaneously and arbitrarily and had no management experience whatsoever. But a majority of councils came to arrangements with the old administrations and saw to it that law and order were quickly restored. For example, [[Max Weber]] was part of the workers' council of [[Heidelberg]], and was pleasantly surprised that most members were moderate German liberals. The councils took over the distribution of food, the police force, and the accommodation and provisions of the front-line soldiers that were gradually returning home.\n\nFormer imperial administrators and the councils depended on each other: the former had the knowledge and experience, the latter had political clout. In most cases, SPD members had been elected into the councils who regarded their job as an interim solution. For them, as well as for the majority of the German population in 1918\u201319, the introduction of a Council Republic was never an issue, but they were not even given a chance to think about it. Many wanted to support the new government and expected it to abolish militarism and the authoritarian state. Being weary of the war and hoping for a peaceful solution, they partially overestimated the revolutionary achievements.\n\n=== General Council Convention ===\nAs decided by the Executive Committee, the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils in the whole empire sent deputies to Berlin, who were to convene on 16 December in the Circus Busch for the \"First General Convention of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils\" (Erster Allgemeiner Kongress der Arbeiter- und Soldatenr\u00e4te). On 15 December, Ebert and General Groener had troops ordered to Berlin to prevent this convention and to regain control of the capital. On 16 December, one of the regiments intended for this plan advanced too early. In an attempt to arrest the Executive Council, the soldiers opened fire on a demonstration of unarmed \"Red Guards\", representatives of Soldiers' Councils affiliated with the Spartacists; 16 people were killed.\n\nWith this, the potential for violence and the danger of a coup from the right became visible. In response to the incident, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] demanded the peaceful disarmament of the homecoming military units by the Berlin workforce in the daily newspaper of the Spartacist League ''Red Flag'' (''[[Rote Fahne]]'') of 12 December. She wanted the Soldiers' Councils to be subordinated to the Revolutionary Parliament and the soldiers to become \"re-educated\".\n\nOn 10 December, Ebert welcomed ten divisions returning from the front hoping to use them against the councils. As it turned out, these troops also were not willing to go on fighting. The war was over, Christmas was at the door and most of the soldiers just wanted to go home to their families. Shortly after their arrival in Berlin, they dispersed. The blow against the Convention of Councils did not take place.\n\nThis blow would have been unnecessary anyway, because the convention that took up its work 16 December in the Prussian House of Representatives consisted mainly of SPD followers. Not even Karl Liebknecht had managed to get a seat. The Spartacist League was not granted any influence. On 19 December, the councils voted 344 to 98 against the creation of a council system as a basis for a new constitution. Instead, they supported the government's decision to call for elections for a constituent national assembly as soon as possible. This assembly was to decide upon the state system.\n\nThe convention disagreed with Ebert only on the issue of control of the army. The convention was demanding a say for the Central Council that it would elect, in the supreme command of the army, the free election of officers and the disciplinary powers for the Soldiers' Councils. That would have been contrary to the agreement between Ebert and General Groener. They both spared no effort to undo this decision. The Supreme Command (which in the meantime had moved from Spa to [[Kassel]]), began to raise loyal volunteer corps (the [[Freikorps]]) against the supposed Bolshevik menace. Unlike the revolutionary soldiers of November, these troops were monarchist-minded officers and men who feared the return into civil life.\n\n=== Christmas crisis of 1918 ===\n{{Main|Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-067-30A, Revolution in Berlin, Soldaten im Kampf.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Leftist soldiers during Christmas fighting in the Pfeilersaal of the Berlin City Palace]]\nAfter 9 November, the government ordered the newly created [[Volksmarinedivision|People's Navy Division]] (''Volksmarinedivision'') from Kiel to Berlin for its protection and stationed it in the [[Neuer Marstall|Royal Stables]] (''Neuer Marstell'') across from the Berlin City Palace (''Berlin Schloss'' or ''Berlin Stadtschloss''). The division was considered absolutely loyal and had indeed refused to participate in the coup attempt of 6 December. The sailors even deposed their commander because they saw him as involved in the affair. It was this loyalty that now gave them the reputation of being in favor of the Spartacists. Ebert demanded their disbanding and Otto Wels, as of 9 November the Commander of Berlin and in line with Ebert, refused the sailors' pay.\n\nThe dispute escalated on 23 December. After having been put off for days, the sailors occupied the Imperial Chancellery itself, cut the phone lines, put the Council of People's Representatives under house arrest and captured Otto Wels. The sailors did not exploit the situation to eliminate the Ebert government, as would have been expected from Spartacist revolutionaries. Instead, they just insisted on their pay. Nevertheless, Ebert, who was in touch with the Supreme Command in Kassel via a secret phone line, gave orders to attack the Residence with troops loyal to the government on the morning of 24 December. The sailors repelled the attack under their commander Heinrich Dorrenbach, losing about 30 men and civilians in the fight. The government troops had to withdraw from the center of Berlin. They themselves were now disbanded and integrated into the newly formed Freikorps. To make up for their humiliating withdrawal, they temporarily occupied the editor's offices of the ''Red Flag''. But military power in Berlin once more was in the hands of the People's Navy Division. Again, the sailors did not take advantage of the situation.\n\nOn one side, this restraint demonstrates that the sailors were not Spartacists, on the other that the revolution had no guidance. Even if Liebknecht had been a revolutionary leader like Lenin, to which legend later made him, the sailors as well as the councils would not have accepted him as such. Thus the only result of the [[Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss|Christmas Crisis]], which the Spartacists named \"Ebert's Bloody Christmas\", was that the Revolutionary Stewards called for a demonstration on Christmas Day and the USPD left the government in protest on 29 December. They could not have done Ebert a bigger favor, since he had let them participate only under the pressure of revolutionary events. Within a few days, the military defeat of the Ebert government had turned into a political victory.\n\n=== Founding of the Communist Party and the January Revolt of 1919 ===\n{{Main|Spartacist uprising}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1577, Revolution in Berlin.jpg|thumb|The occupation of the Silesian railway station in Berlin by government troops, 1919]]\nAfter their experiences with the SPD and the USPD, the Spartacists concluded that their goals could be met only by forming a party of their own, thus they joined with other left-socialist groups from the whole of Germany to found the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD).<ref>Winkler, ''Weimar'' p. 55 f.</ref>\n\nRosa Luxemburg drew up her founding programme and presented it on 31 December 1918. In this programme, she pointed out that the communists could never take power without the clear will of the people in the majority. On 1 January, she demanded that the KPD participate in the planned nationwide German elections, but was outvoted. The majority still hoped to gain power by continued agitation in the factories and from \"pressure from the streets\". After deliberations with the Spartacists, the Revolutionary Stewards decided to remain in the USPD. This was a first defeat.\n\nThe decisive defeat of the left occurred in the first days of the new year in 1919. As in the previous November, {{weasel inline|date=September 2017}} {{according to whom|date=September 2017}}, a second revolutionary wave developed, but in this case, it was violently suppressed. The wave was started on 4 January, when the government dismissed the chief constable of Berlin, [[Emil Eichhorn]]. The latter was a member of the USPD who had refused to act against the demonstrating workers in the Christmas Crisis. This action resulted in the USPD, Revolutionary Stewards and the KPD chairmen [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Wilhelm Pieck]] to call for a demonstration to take place on the following day.\n\nTo the surprise{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} of the initiators, the demonstration turned into an assembly of huge masses. On Sunday, 5 January, as on 9 November 1918, hundreds of thousands of people poured into the centre of Berlin, many of them armed. In the afternoon, the train stations and the newspaper district with the offices of the middle-class press and ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' were occupied. Some of the middle-class papers in the previous days had called not only for the raising of more Freikorps, but also for the murder of the Spartacists.\n[[File:AlzadosEspartaquistas..png|thumb|left|Spartacist militia in Berlin]]\nThe demonstrators were mainly the same ones who participated in the disturbances two months previously. They now demanded the fulfillment of the hopes expressed in November. The Spartacists by no means had a leading position. The demands came straight from the workforce supported by various groups left of the SPD. The so-called \"[[Spartacist Uprising]]\" that followed originated only partially in the KPD. KPD members were even a minority among the insurgents.\n\nThe initiators assembled at the Police Headquarters elected a 53-member \"Interim Revolutionary Committee\" (Provisorischer Revolutionsausschuss) that failed to make use of its power and was unable to give any clear direction. Liebknecht demanded the overthrow of the government and agreed with the majority of the committee that propagated the armed struggle. Rosa Luxemburg as well as the majority of KPD leaders thought a revolt at this moment to be a catastrophe and spoke out against it.\n\n[[File:Mark IV Berlin.jpg|thumb|A British [[Mark IV tank]], captured during World War I, in use by German government troops. Berlin, January 1919|alt=]]\nOn the following day, 6 January, the Revolutionary Committee again called for a mass demonstration. This time, even more people heeded the call. Again they carried placards and banners that proclaimed, \"Brothers, don't shoot!\" and remained waiting on an assembly square. A part of the Revolutionary Stewards armed themselves and called for the overthrow of the Ebert government. But the KPD activists mostly failed in their endeavour to win over the troops. It turned out that even units such as the People's Navy Division were not willing to support the armed revolt and declared themselves neutral. The other regiments stationed in Berlin mostly remained loyal to the government.\n\nWhile more troops were moving into Berlin on Ebert's order, he accepted an offer by the USPD to mediate between him and the Revolutionary Committee. After the advance of the troops into the city became known, an SPD leaflet appeared saying, \"The hour of reckoning is nigh\". With this, the Committee broke off further negotiations on 8 January. That was opportunity enough for Ebert to use the troops stationed in Berlin against the occupiers. Beginning 9 January, they violently quelled an improvised revolt. In addition to that, on 12 January, the anti-republican Freikorps, which had been raised more or less as [[death squads]] since the beginning of December, moved into Berlin. [[Gustav Noske]], who had been People's Representative for Army and Navy for a few days, accepted the premium command of these troops by saying, \"If you like, someone has to be the bloodhound. I won't shy away from the responsibility.\"<ref>Winkler, ''Weimar'' p. 58</ref>\n\nThe Freikorps brutally cleared several buildings and executed the occupiers on the spot. Others soon surrendered, but some of them were still shot. The January revolt claimed 156 lives in Berlin.\n\n=== Murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg ===\nThe alleged ringleaders of the January Revolt had to go into hiding. In spite of the urgings of their allies, they refused to leave Berlin. On the evening of 15 January 1919, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were discovered in an apartment of the [[Wilmersdorf]] district of Berlin. They were immediately arrested and handed over to the largest Freikorps, the heavily armed Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division. Their commander, Captain [[Waldemar Pabst]], had them questioned. That same night both prisoners were beaten unconscious with rifle butts and shot in the head. Rosa Luxemburg's body was thrown into the [[Landwehr Canal]] that ran through Berlin, where it was found only on 1 July. Karl Liebknecht's body, without a name, was delivered to a morgue.\n\nThe perpetrators for the most part went unpunished. The [[Nazi Party]] later compensated the few that had been tried or even jailed, and they merged the Gardekavallerie into the SA ([[Sturmabteilung]]). In an interview given to \"[[Der Spiegel]]\" in 1962 and in his memoirs, Pabst maintained that he had talked on the phone with Noske in the Chancellery,<ref>''Der Spiegel'' of 18.04.1962</ref> and that Noske and Ebert had approved of his actions. Pabst's statement was never confirmed, especially since neither the Reichstag nor the courts ever examined the case.\n\nAfter the murders of 15 January, the political differences between the SPD and KPD grew even more irreconcilable. In the following years, both parties were unable to agree on joint action against the Nazi Party, which dramatically grew in strength as of 1930.\n\n=== Further revolts in tow of the revolution ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00539, Berlin, Revolution, Standrechtlich Erschossene.jpg|thumb|Dead revolutionaries after summary execution in March 1919|alt=]]\nIn the first months of 1919, there were further armed revolts all over Germany. In some states, [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Councils Republics]] were proclaimed, most prominently in Bavaria (the [[Munich Soviet Republic]]), even if only temporarily.\n\nThese revolts were triggered by Noske's decision at the end of February to take armed action against the [[Bremen Soviet Republic]]. In spite of an offer to negotiate, he ordered his Freikorps units to invade the city. Approximately 400 people were killed in the ensuing fights.\n\nThis caused an eruption of mass strikes in the [[Ruhr]] District, the [[Rhineland]] and in [[Saxony]]. Members of the USPD, the KPD and even the SPD called for a general strike that started on 4 March. Against the will of the strike leadership, the strikes escalated into street fighting in Berlin. The Prussian state government, which in the meantime had declared a state of siege, called the imperial government for help. Again Noske employed the Gardekavallerie-Sch\u00fctzendivision, commanded by Pabst, against the strikers in Berlin. By the end of the fighting on 16 March, they had killed approximately 1,200 people, many of them unarmed and uninvolved. Among others, 29 members of the Peoples Navy Division, who had surrendered, were summarily executed, since Noske had ordered that anybody found armed should be shot on the spot.\n\nThe situation in Hamburg and Thuringia also was very much like a civil war. The council government to hold out the longest was the [[Munich Soviet Republic]]. It was only on 2 May that Prussian and Freikorps units from W\u00fcrttemberg toppled it by using the same violent methods as in Berlin and Bremen.\n\nAccording to the predominant opinion of modern historians,<ref>Schulze, ''Weimar. Deutschland 1917\u20131933'' S. 169 u. 170</ref> the establishment of a Bolshevik-style council government in Germany on 9\u201310 November 1918 was impossible. Yet the Ebert government felt threatened by a coup from the left, and was certainly undermined by the Spartakus movement; thus it co-operated with the Supreme Command and the Freikorps. The brutal actions of the Freikorps during the various revolts estranged many left democrats from the SPD. They regarded the behavior of Ebert, Noske and the other SPD leaders during the revolution as an outright betrayal of their own followers.\n\n=== National Assembly and New Imperial Constitution ===\n{{Main|Weimar National Assembly}}\nOn 19 January 1919, a Constituent National Assembly (Verfassungsgebende Nationalversammlung) was elected. Aside from SPD and USPD, the Catholic Centre Party took part, and so did several middle-class parties that had established themselves since November: the left-liberal [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), the national-liberal [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the conservative, nationalist [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). In spite of Rosa Luxemburg's recommendation, the KPD did not participate in these elections.\n\nWith 37.4% of the vote, the SPD became the strongest party in the Reichstag and secured 165 out of 423 deputies.  The USPD received only 7.6% of the vote and sent 22 deputies into the parliament. The popularity of the USPD temporarily rose one more time after the [[Kapp-L\u00fcttwitz Putsch]] in 1920, but the party dissolved in 1922. The Centre Party was runner-up to the SPD with 91 deputies, the DDP had 75, the DVP 19 and the DNVP 44. As a result of the elections, the SPD formed the so-called [[Weimar Coalition]] with the Centre Party and the DDP.  To get away from the post-revolutionary confusion in Berlin, the National Assembly met on 6 February in the town of [[Weimar]], [[Thuringia]], some 250&nbsp;km to the southwest of Berlin, where Friedrich Ebert was elected temporary Reich President on 11 February. [[Philipp Scheidemann]] was elected as Prime Minister (Ministerpr\u00e4sident) of the newly formed coalition on 13 February.  Ebert was then constitutionally sworn in as Reich President ([[Reichspr\u00e4sident]]) on 21 August 1919.\n\nOn the one hand, the [[Weimar Constitution]] offered more possibilities for a [[direct democracy]] than the present [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], for example by setting up a mechanism for referenda. On the other hand, [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] granted the president the authority to rule against the majority in the Reichstag, with the help of the army if need be.  In 1932\u201333, Article 48 was instrumental in destroying German democracy.<ref>Mosler: ''Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs vom 11. August 1919''</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main|Weimar Republic}}\n\nFrom 1920 to 1923, nationalist forces continued fighting against the Weimar Republic and left-wing political opponents. In 1920, the German government was briefly overthrown in a coup organized by [[Wolfgang Kapp]] (the [[Kapp Putsch]]), and a nationalist government was briefly in power. Mass public demonstrations soon forced this regime out of power. In 1921 and 1922, [[Matthias Erzberger]] and [[Walter Rathenau]] were shot by members of the ultra-nationalist [[Organisation Consul]]. The newly formed [[Nazi Party]], under the leadership of [[Adolf Hitler]] and supported by former German army chief [[Erich Ludendorff]], engaged in political violence against the government and left-wing political forces as well. In 1923, in what is now known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], the Nazis took control of parts of [[Munich]], arrested the president of Bavaria, the chief of police, and others and forced them to sign an agreement in which they endorsed the Nazi takeover and its objective to overthrow the German government. The putsch came to an end when the German army and police were called in to put it down, resulting in an armed confrontation in which a number of Nazis and some police were killed.\n\nThe Weimar Republic was always under great pressure from both left-wing and right-wing extremists. The left-wing extremists accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers' movement by preventing a communist revolution and unleashing the Freikorps upon the workers. Right-wing extremists were opposed to any democratic system, preferring instead an authoritarian state similar to the Empire founded in 1871. To further undermine the Republic's credibility, right-wing extremists (especially certain members of the former officer corps) used the ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'' to blame an alleged conspiracy of Socialists and Jews for Germany's defeat in World War I, largely drawing fuel from the fact that eight out of the ten leaders of the communist revolution were Jewish. Both sides were determined to bring down the Weimar Republic. In the end, the right-wing extremists were successful, and the Weimar Republic came to an end with the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|ascent of Hitler]] and the National Socialist Party.\n\n== Impact on Weimar Republic ==\nThe Revolution of 1918/19 is one of the most important events in the modern history of Germany, yet it is poorly embedded in the historical memory of Germans. The failure of the Weimar Republic that this revolution brought into being and the Nazi era that followed it obstructed the view of these events for a long time. To this very day, the interpretation of these events has been determined more by legends than by facts.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBoth the radical right and the radical left{{snd}}under different circumstances{{snd}}nurtured the idea that a Communist uprising was aiming to establish a Soviet Republic following the Russian example. The democratic centre parties, especially the SPD, were also barely interested in assessing the events which turned Germany into a Republic fairly. At closer look, these events turned out to be a revolution supported by the Social Democrats and stopped by their party leadership. These processes helped to weaken the Weimar Republic from its very beginning.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAfter the imperial government and the Supreme Command shirked their responsibilities for the war and the defeat at an early stage, the majority parties of the Reichstag were left to cope with the resulting burdens. In his autobiography, Ludendorff's successor Groener states, \"It suited me just fine, when the army and the Supreme Command remained as guiltless as possible in these wretched truce negotiations, from which nothing good could be expected\".<ref name=\"Schulze, p. 149\"/>\n\nThus, the \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|Myth of the Stab in the Back]]\" was born, according to which the revolutionaries stabbed the army, \"undefeated on the field\", in the back and only then turned the almost secure victory into a defeat. It was mainly Ludendorff who contributed to the spread of this falsification of history to conceal his own role in the defeat. In nationalistic and national minded circles, the myth fell on fertile ground. They soon defamed the revolutionaries and even politicians like Ebert, who never wanted the revolution and had done everything to channel and contain it, as \"November Criminals\" (Novemberverbrecher). In 1923, Hitler and Ludendorff deliberately chose symbolic 9 November as the date of their attempted \"[[Beer Hall Putsch]]\".\n\nFrom its very beginning, the Weimar Republic was afflicted with the stigma of the military defeat. A large part of the bourgeoisie and the old elites from big industry, landowners, military, judiciary and administration never accepted the democratic republic and hoped to get rid of it at the first opportunity. On the left, the actions of the SPD Leadership during the revolution drove many of its former adherents to the Communists. The contained revolution gave birth to a \"democracy without democrats\".<ref>Sontheimer, ''Antidemokratisches Denken''</ref>\n\n== Contemporary statements ==\nDepending on their political standpoint of view, contemporaries had greatly differing opinions about the revolution.\n\n[[Ernst Troeltsch]], a Protestant theologian and philosopher, rather calmly remarked how the majority of Berlin citizens perceived 10 November:\n<blockquote>On Sunday morning after a frightful night the morning newspapers gave a clear picture: the Kaiser in Holland, the revolution victorious in most urban centres, the royals in the states abdicating. No man dead for Kaiser and Empire! The continuation of duties ensured and no run on the banks! (...) Trams and subways ran as usual which is a pledge that basic needs are cared for. On all faces it could be read: Wages will continue to be paid.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 85</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe liberal publicist [[Theodor Wolff]] wrote on the very day of 10 November in the newspaper ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', lending himself to far too optimistic illusions, which the SPD leadership also might have had:\n<blockquote>Like a sudden storm, the biggest of all revolutions has toppled the imperial regime including everything that belonged to it. It can be called the greatest of all revolutions because never has a more firmly built (...) fortress been taken in this manner at the first attempt. Only one week ago, there was still a military and civil administration so deeply rooted that it seemed to have secured its dominion beyond the change of times. (...) Only yesterday morning, at least in Berlin, all this still existed. Yesterday afternoon it was all gone.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 95</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe extreme right had a completely opposite perception. On 10 November, conservative journalist Paul Baecker wrote an article in ''Deutsche Tageszeitung'' which already contained essential elements of the ''[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]'':\n<blockquote>The work fought for by our fathers with their precious blood \u2013 dismissed by betrayal in the ranks of our own people! Germany, yesterday still undefeated, left to the mercy of our enemies by men carrying the German name, by felony out of our own ranks broken down in guilt and shame.<br>The German Socialists knew that peace was at hand anyway and that it was only about holding out against the enemy for a few days or weeks in order to wrest bearable conditions from them. In this situation they raised the white flag.<br>This is a sin that can never be forgiven and never will be forgiven. This is treason not only against the monarchy and the army but also against the German people themselves who will have to bear the consequences in centuries of decline and of misery.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 96</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn an article on the 10th anniversary of the revolution the publicist [[Kurt Tucholsky]] remarked that neither Wolff nor Baecker were right. Nevertheless, Tucholsky accused Ebert and Noske of betrayal, not of the monarchy but of the revolution. Although he wanted to regard it as only a coup d'\u00e9tat, he analysed the actual course of events more clearly than most of his contemporaries. In 1928 he wrote in \"November Coup\":\n<blockquote>The German Revolution of 1918 took place in a hall.<br>\nThe things taking place were not a revolution. There was no spiritual preparation, no leaders ready in the dark; no revolutionary goals. The mother of this revolution was the soldiers' longing to be home for Christmas. And weariness, disgust and weariness.<br>The possibilities that nevertheless were lying in the streets were betrayed by Ebert and his like. Fritz* Ebert, whom you cannot heighten to a personality by calling him Friedrich opposed the establishment of a republic only until he found there was a post of chairman to be had; comrade Scheidemann \u00e8 tutti quanti all were would-be senior civil servants. (* Fritz is the colloquial term for Friedrich like Willy \u2013 William)<br>\nThe following possibilities were left out: shattering federal states, division of landed property, revolutionary socialization of industry, reform of administrative and judiciary personnel. A republican constitution in which every sentence rescinds the next one, a revolution talking about well acquired rights of the old regime can be only laughed at.<br>\n''The German Revolution is still to take place.''<ref>Kurt Tucholsky: ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Collected Works), Vol. 6, p. 300</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Walter Rathenau]] was of a similar opinion. He called the revolution a \"disappointment\", a \"present by chance\", a \"product of desperation\", a \"revolution by mistake\". It did not deserve the name because it did \"not abolish the actual mistakes\" but \"degenerated into a degrading clash of interests\".\n\n<blockquote>Not a chain was broken by the swelling of spirit and will, but a lock merely rusted through. The chain fell off and the freed stood amazed, helpless, embarrassed and needed to arm against their will. The ones sensing their advantage were the quickest.<ref>S\u00f6semann, ''Demokratie im Widerstreit'', p.13</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian and publicist [[Sebastian Haffner]] in turn came out against Tucholsky and Rathenau. He lived through the revolution in Berlin as a child and wrote 50 years later in his book about one of the myths related to the events of November 1918 that had taken root especially in the bourgeoisie:\n\n<blockquote>It is often said that a true revolution in Germany in 1918 never took place. All that really happened was a breakdown. It was only the temporary weakness of the police and army in the moment of military defeat which let a mutiny of sailors appear as a revolution.\n<br>At first sight, one can see how wrong and blind this is comparing 1918 with 1945. In 1945 there really was a breakdown.<br>Certainly a mutiny of sailors started the revolution in 1918 but it was only a start. What made it extraordinary is that a mere sailors' mutiny triggered an earthquake which shook all of Germany; that the whole home army, the whole urban workforce and in Bavaria a part of the rural population rose up in revolt. This revolt was not just a mutiny anymore, it was a true revolution....<br>As in any revolution, the old order was replaced by the beginnings of a new one. It was not only destructive but also creative....<br>As a revolutionary achievement of masses the German November 1918 does not need to take second place to either the French July 1789 or the Russian March 1917.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 193 f.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Historical research ===\nDuring the Nazi regime, works on the Weimar Republic and the German Revolution published abroad and by exiles in the 1930s and 1940s could not be read in Germany. Around 1935, that affected the first published history of the Weimar Republic by [[Arthur Rosenberg]]. In his view the political situation at the beginning of the revolution was open: the moderate socialist and democratic-oriented work force indeed had a chance to become the actual social foundation of the republic and to drive back the conservative forces. It failed because of the wrong decisions of the SPD leadership and because of the revolutionary tactics employed by the extreme left wing of the work force.\n\nAfter 1945 West German historical research on the Weimar Republic concentrated most of all on its decline. In 1951, Theodor Eschenburg mostly ignored the revolutionary beginning of the republic. In 1955, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] also dealt with the German Revolution from the perspective of the failed republic. [[Erich Eyck]] shows how little the revolution after 1945 was regarded as part of German history. His two-volume ''History of the Weimar Republic'' gave barely 20 pages to these events. The same can be said for Karl Dietrich Erdmann's contribution to the 8th edition of the ''Gebhardt Handbook for German History'' (''Gebhardtsches Handbuch zur Deutschen Geschichte''), whose viewpoint dominated the interpretation of events related to the German Revolution after 1945. According to Erdmann, 1918/19 was about the choice between \"social revolution in line with forces demanding a proletarian dictatorship and parliamentary republic in line with the conservative elements like the German officer corps\".<ref>Kluge, ''Deutsche Revolution 1918/19'', p. 15</ref> As most Social Democrats were forced to join up with the old elites to prevent an imminent council dictatorship, the blame for the failure of the Weimar Republic was to be put on the extreme left, and the events of 1918/19 were successful defensive actions of democracy against Bolshevism.\n\nThis interpretation at the height of the [[Cold War]] was based on the assumption that the extreme left was comparably strong and a real threat to the democratic development. In this point, West German researchers ironically found themselves in line with Marxist historiography in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), which attributed considerable revolutionary potential most of all to the Spartacists.<ref>On East German historiography of the German Revolution see Mario Ke\u00dfler: Die Novemberrevolution in der Geschichtswissenschaft der DDR \u2013 Die Kontroversen des Jahres 1958 und ihre Folgen im internationalen Kontext, in: [[Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. III/2008.</ref>\n\nWhile in the postwar years the majority SPD (MSPD) was cleared of its Nazi odium as \"November Criminals\", GDR historians blamed the SPD for \"betrayal of the working class\" and the USPD leadership for their incompetence. Their interpretation was mainly based on the 1958 theories of the Central Committee of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] according to which the German Revolution was defined as a \"bourgeois-democratic revolution\", led in certain aspects by proletarian means and methods. The fact that a revolution by the working class in Germany never happened could be put down to the \"subjective factor\", especially the absence of a \"[[Marxist-Leninist]] offensive party\". Contrary to the official party line, [[Rudolf Lindau (politician)|Rudolf Lindau]] supported the theory that the German Revolution had a Socialist tendency.\n\nConsistently, the founding of the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) was declared to be the decisive turning point in German history, but in spite of ideological bias, historical research in the GDR expanded detailed knowledge of the German Revolution.<ref>Eberhard Kolb: ''Die Weimarer Republik''. Wien, 1984. p. 154f</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s, West German historians focused their research on the final stages of the Weimar Republic. In the 1960s, they shifted to its revolutionary beginnings, realising that the decisions and developments during the revolution were central to the failure of the first German Republic. The workers' and soldiers' councils especially moved into focus, and their previous appearance as a far-left movement had to be revised extensively. Authors like Ulrich Kluge, [[Eberhard Kolb]] and Reinhard R\u00fcrup argued that in the first weeks of the revolution the social base for a democratic redesign of society was much stronger than previously thought and that the potential of the extreme left was actually weaker than the MSPD's leadership, for example, assumed.\n\nAs \"Bolshevism\" posed no real threat, the scope of action for the Council of the People's Deputies (also supported by the more reform-oriented councils) to democratise the administration, military and society had been relatively large, but the MSPD's leadership did not take that step because it trusted in the loyalty of the old elites and mistrusted the spontaneous mass movements in the first weeks of the revolution. The result was the resignation and radicalisation of the council movement. The theories have been supported by the publications of the minutes of the Council of the People's Deputies. Increasingly, the history of the German Revolution appeared as the history of its gradual reversal.\n\nThis new interpretation of the German Revolution gained acceptance in research rather quickly even though older perceptions remained alive. Research concerning the composition of the Worker's and Soldier's Councils which today can be easily verified by sources is undisputed to a large extent, but the interpretation of the revolutionary events based on this research has been already criticised and partially modified since the end of the 1970s. Criticism was aimed at the partially idealised description of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils which especially was the case in the wake of the [[German Student Movement]] of the 1960s (1968). Peter von Oertzen went particularly far in this respect describing a social democracy based on councils as a positive alternative to the bourgeois republic. In comparison, [[Wolfgang J. Mommsen]] did not regard the councils as a homogeneous focused movement for democracy but as a heterogeneous group with a multitude of different motivations and goals. Jesse and K\u00f6hler even talked about the \"construct of a democratic council movement\". Certainly, the authors also excluded a \"relapse to the positions of the 1950s: \"The councils were neither communist oriented to a large extent nor can the policies of the majority SPD in every aspect be labelled fortuitous and worth praising.\"<ref>Kolb, op. cit. p. 160f</ref>\n\n[[Heinrich August Winkler]] tried to find a compromise, according to which the Social Democrats depended to a limited extent on cooperation with the old elites but went considerably too far: \"With more political willpower they could have changed more and preserved less.\"<ref>Kolb, op. cit. p. 161</ref>\n\nWith all the differences concerning details, historical researchers agree that in the German Revolution, the chances to put the republic on a firm footing were considerably better than the dangers coming from the extreme left. Instead, the alliance of the SPD with the old elites constituted a considerable structural problem for the Weimar Republic.<ref>Kolb, op.cit. pp. 143\u2013162; Kluge, ''Deutsche Revolution'' pp. 10\u201338</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Germany}}\n*[[Finnish Civil War]]\n*[[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)]]\n*[[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]\n*[[Luxemburgism]]\n*[[Anarchism in Germany]]\n*[[Silesian Uprisings]]\n*[[Revolutions of 1917\u201323]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nEnglish language literature:\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* Mark Jones:  ''Founding Weimar.

Revolution''' or '''November Revolution''' ({{lang-de|Novemberrevolution}}) was a civil conflict in the [[German Empire]] at the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] that resulted in the replacement of the German [[Federal monarchy|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a democratic [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] that later became known as the [[Weimar Republic]]. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the adoption in August 1919 of the [[Weimar Constitution]].\n\nThe causes of the revolution were the extreme burdens suffered by the population during the four years of war, the strong impact of the defeat on the German Empire and the social tensions between the general population and the elite of [[Aristocracy|aristocrats]] and [[bourgeoisie]] who held power and had just lost the war.\n\nThe roots of the revolution lay in the German Empire's defeat in the First World War and the social tensions that came to a head shortly thereafter. The first acts of revolution were triggered by the policies of the German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Command]] of the Army and its lack of coordination with the [[Seekriegsleitung|Naval Command]]. In the face of defeat, the Naval Command insisted on trying to precipitate a climactic battle with the British [[Royal Navy]] by means of its [[naval order of 24 October 1918]]. The battle never took place. Instead of obeying their orders to begin preparations to fight the British, German sailors led a revolt in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 29 October 1918, followed by the [[Kiel mutiny]] in the first days of November. These disturbances spread the spirit of civil unrest across Germany and ultimately led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918. Shortly thereafter, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]] abdicated his throne and fled the country.\n\nThe revolutionaries, inspired by [[Socialism|socialist]] ideas, did not hand over power to [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]-style councils as the [[Bolsheviks]] had done in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], because the leadership of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) opposed their creation. The SPD opted instead for a national assembly that would form the basis for a parliamentary system of government.<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M\u00fcller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, {{ISBN|978-90-04-21921-2}}, pp. 93\u2013100.</ref> Fearing an all-out civil war in Germany between militant workers and [[reactionary]] [[Conservatism in Germany|conservatives]], the SPD did not plan to strip the old German upper classes completely of their power and privileges. Instead, it sought to integrate them into the new [[social democracy|social democratic]] system. In this endeavour, SPD [[Left-wing politics|leftists]] sought an alliance with the German Supreme Command.  This allowed the army and the [[Freikorps]] ([[German nationalism|nationalist]] militias) to quell the [[Communism|communist]] [[Spartacist uprising]] of 4\u201315 January 1919 by force. The same alliance of political forces succeeded in suppressing uprisings of the left in other parts of Germany, with the result that the country was completely pacified by late 1919.\n\n[[1919 German federal election|Elections]] for the new [[Weimar National Assembly]] were held on 19 January 1919. The revolution ended on 11 August 1919, when the [[Weimar Constitution]] was adopted.\n\n== SPD and the World War ==\nIn the decade after 1900, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was the leading force in Germany's [[labour movement]]. With 35% of the national votes and 110 seats in the [[German federal election, 1912|Reichstag elected in 1912]], the Social Democrats had grown into the largest political party in Germany. Party membership was around one million, and the party newspaper (''[[Vorw\u00e4rts]]'') attracted 1.5 million subscribers. The trade unions had 2.5 million members, most of whom probably supported the Social Democrats. In addition, there were numerous co-operative societies (for example, apartment co-ops, shop co-ops, etc.), and other organizations directly linked to the SPD and the labor unions, or else adhering to Social Democratic ideology. Other notable parties in the Reichstag of 1912 were the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] (91 seats), the [[German Conservative Party]] (43), the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] (45), the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressive People's Party]] (42), the [[Polish Party]] (18), the [[Free Conservative Party|German Reich Party]] (14), the [[Economic Union (political party)|Economic Union]] (10), and the [[Alsace-Lorraine Party]] (9).\n\nAt the congresses of the [[Second International|Second Socialist International]], the SPD had always agreed to resolutions asking for combined action of Socialists in case of a war. Following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], the SPD, like other socialist parties in Europe, organised anti-war demonstrations during the [[July Crisis]]. After [[Rosa Luxemburg]] called for disobedience and rejection of war in the name of the entire party as a representative of the left wing of the party, the Imperial government planned to arrest the party leaders immediately at the onset of war. [[Friedrich Ebert]], one of the two party leaders since 1913, travelled to [[Z\u00fcrich]] with [[Otto Braun]] to save the party's funds from being confiscated.\n\nAfter Germany declared war on the [[Russian Empire]] on 1 August 1914, the majority of the SPD newspapers shared the general enthusiasm for the war (the \"[[Spirit of 1914]]\"), particularly because they viewed the Russian Empire as the most reactionary and anti-socialist power in Europe. In the first days of August, the editors believed themselves to be in line with the late [[August Bebel]], who had died the previous year. In 1904, he declared in the Reichstag that the SPD would support an armed defence of Germany against a foreign attack. In 1907, at a party convention in Essen, he even promised that he himself would \"shoulder the gun\" if it was to fight against Russia, the \"enemy of all culture and all the suppressed\".<ref>Ullrich, ''Die nerv\u00f6se Gro\u00dfmacht'' p. 446</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://geschichte.verdi.de/jahrestage_gedenktage/1._august_1914_beginn_des_ersten_weltkriegs/manfred_scharrer_august_1914_-_patriotismus_und_internationalismus/#das_patriotische_bekenntnis |first=Manfred |last=Scharrer |work=[[ver.di]] |title=Das patriotische Bekenntnis |language=de }}</ref> In the face of the general enthusiasm for the war among the population, which foresaw an attack by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, many SPD deputies worried they might lose many of their voters with their consistent [[pacifism]]. In addition, the government of Imperial Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] threatened to outlaw all parties in case of war. On the other hand, the chancellor exploited the anti-Russian stance of the SPD to procure the party's approval for the war.\n\nThe party leadership and the party's deputies were split on the issue of support for the war: 96 deputies, including [[Friedrich Ebert]], approved the [[war bond]]s demanded by the Imperial government. There were 14 deputies, headed by the second party leader, [[Hugo Haase]], who spoke out against the bonds, but nevertheless followed party voting instructions and raised their hands in favour.\n\nThus, the entire SPD faction in the Reichstag voted in favour of the war bonds on 4 August 1914. It was with those decisions by the party and the unions that the full mobilisation of the German Army became possible. Haase explained the decision against his will with the words: \"We will not let the fatherland alone in the hour of need!\" The Emperor welcomed the so-called \"truce\" (''[[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]]''), declaring: \"''Ich kenne keine Parteien mehr, ich kenne nur noch Deutsche!''\" (\"I no longer see parties, I see only Germans!\").<ref>[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''Der Verrat'' p. 12</ref>\n\nEven [[Karl Liebknecht]], who became one of the most outspoken opponents of the war, initially followed the line of the party that his father, [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], had cofounded: he abstained from voting and did not defy his own political colleagues. However, a few days later he joined the ''Gruppe Internationale'' (Group International) that [[Rosa Luxemburg]] had founded on 5 August 1914 with [[Franz Mehring]], [[Wilhelm Pieck]], and four others from the left wing of the party, which adhered to the prewar resolutions of the SPD. From that group emerged the [[Spartacus League]] (''Spartakusbund'') on 1 January 1916.\n\nOn 2 December 1914, Liebknecht voted against further war bonds, the only deputy of any party in the Reichstag to do so. Although he was not permitted to speak in the Reichstag to explain his vote, what he had planned to say was made public through the circulation of a leaflet that was claimed to be unlawful:\n\n<blockquote>The present war was not willed by any of the nations participating in it and it is not waged in the interest of the Germans or any other people. It is an imperialist war, a war for capitalist control of the world market, for the political domination of huge territories and to give scope to industrial and banking capital.</blockquote>\n\nBecause of high demand, this leaflet was soon printed and evolved into the so-called \"Political Letters\" ({{lang-de|Politische Briefe}}), collections of which were later published in defiance of the censorship laws under the name \"Spartacus Letters\" (''Spartakusbriefe''). As of December 1916, these were replaced by the journal ''Spartakus'', which appeared irregularly until November 1918.\n\nThis open opposition against the party line put Liebknecht at odds with some party members around Haase who were against the war bonds themselves. In February 1915, at the instigation of the SPD party leadership, Liebknecht was conscripted for military service to dispose of him, the only SPD deputy to be so treated. Because of his attempts to organise objectors against the war, he was expelled from the SPD, and in June 1916, he was sentenced on a charge of [[high treason]] to four years in prison. While Liebknecht was in the army, Rosa Luxemburg wrote most of the \"Spartacus Letters\". After serving a prison sentence, she was put back in jail under \"preventive detention\" until the war ended.\n\n=== The SPD Split ===\nAs the war dragged on and the death tolls rose, more SPD members began to question the adherence to the ''Burgfrieden'' (the truce in domestic politics) of 1914. The SPD also objected to the domestic misery that followed the dismissal of [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] as Chief of the General Staff in 1916. His replacement, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], introduced the [[Hindenburg Programme]] by which the guidelines of German policy were ''[[de facto]]'' set by the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]] ({{lang-de|Oberste Heeresleitung}}), not the emperor and the chancellor. Hindenburg's subordinate, [[Erich Ludendorff]], took on broad responsibilities for directing wartime policies that were extensive. Although the Emperor and Hindenburg were his nominal superiors, it was Ludendorff who made the important decisions. Hindenburg and Ludendorff persisted with ruthless strategies aimed at achieving military victory, pursued expansionist and aggressive war goals and subjugated civilian life to the needs of the war and the war economy. For the labour force, that often meant 12-hour work days at minimal wages with inadequate food. The [[Auxiliary Services Act (1916)|''Hilfsdienstgesetz'' (Auxiliary Service Law)]] forced all men not in the armed forces to work.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Russian [[February Revolution]] in 1917, the first organised strikes erupted in German armament factories in March and April, with about 300,000 workers going on strike. The strike was organized by a group called the [[Revolutionary Stewards]] (''Revolution\u00e4re Obleute''), led by their spokesman [[Richard M\u00fcller (socialist)|Richard M\u00fcller]]. The group emerged from a network of left-wing unionists who disagreed with the support of the war that came from the union leadership.<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M\u00fcller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, {{ISBN|978-90-04-21921-2}}, pp. 35\u201361.</ref> The [[American entry into World War I]] on 6 April 1917 threatened further deterioration in Germany's military position. Hindenburg and Ludendorff had called for an end to the moratorium on attacks on neutral shipping in the Atlantic, which had been imposed when the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', a British ship carrying US citizens, was sunk off [[Ireland]] in 1915. Their decision signaled a new strategy to stop the flow of US [[materiel]] to France to make a German victory (or at least a peace settlement on German terms) possible before the United States entered the war as a combatant. The emperor tried to appease the population in his Easter address of 7 April by promising democratic elections in Prussia after the war, but lack of progress in bringing the war to a satisfactory end dulled its effect. Opposition to the war among munitions workers continued to rise, and what had been a united front in favour of the war split into two sharply divided groups.<ref>Winkler, ''Der lange Weg nach Westen'', Beck Verlag Munich, 2000, p. 362</ref>\n\nAfter the SPD leadership, under [[Friedrich Ebert]], excluded the opponents of the war from his party, the Spartacists joined with so-called \"[[Revisionism (Marxism)|Revisionists]]\" such as [[Eduard Bernstein]] and [[Centrist Marxism|Centrists]] such as [[Karl Kautsky]] to found the fully anti-war [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) under the leadership of [[Hugo Haase]] on 9 April 1917. The SPD was now known as the [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (MSPD) and continued to be led by Friedrich Ebert. The USPD demanded an immediate end to the war and a further democratisation of Germany but did not have a unified agenda for social policies. The Spartacist League, which until then had opposed a split of the party, now made up the left wing of the USPD. Both the USPD and the Spartacists continued their anti-war propaganda in factories, especially in the armament plants.\n\n== Impact of the Russian Revolution ==\n{{further|Russian Revolution}}\nAfter the [[February Revolution]] in Russia and the abdication of Tsar [[Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]] as of 21 July 1917, continued the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers. Nevertheless, Russian society was severely strained by the opposing motivations of patriotism and anti-war sentiment. There was sizable support for continuing the war to defend Russia's honour and territory, but also a strong desire to remove Russia from the conflict and let the other countries of Europe destroy one another without Russian involvement.\n\nThe German Imperial Government now saw one more chance for victory. To support the anti-war sentiment in Russia and perhaps turn the tide in Russia toward a [[separate peace]], it permitted the leader of the Russian [[Bolsheviks]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], to pass in a sealed train wagon from his place of exile in Switzerland through Germany, Sweden and Finland to [[Petrograd]].<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\">{{cite book |last=Volkogonov |first=Dmitri |authorlink=Dmitri Volkogonov |year=1994 |title=Lenin: A New Biography |isbn=978-0-02-933435-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/leninnewbiograph00volk }}</ref> Since he had heard about the February Revolution, Lenin had been scheming on how to get back into Russia, but no option previously available to him proved successful.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/> Within months, Lenin led the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks seized power from the moderates and withdrew Russia from the world war. [[Leon Trotsky]] observed that the October Revolution could not have succeeded if Lenin had remained stuck in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/>\n\nThus, the Imperial German government had an important influence in the creation of what would become the [[Soviet Union]] by turning over Russia's socialist transformation decisively into the hands of the Bolsheviks, whereas in February, it had been oriented toward parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn early and mid-1918, many people in both Russia and Germany expected that Russia would now \"return the favor\" by helping to foster a [[communist revolution]] on German soil.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/> European communists had long looked forward to a time when Germany, the homeland of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], would undergo such a revolution. The success of the Russian proletariat and peasantry in overthrowing their ruling classes raised fears among the German bourgeoisie that such a revolution could take place in Germany as well. Furthermore, the [[proletarian internationalism]] of Marx and Engels was still very influential in both Western Europe and Russia at the time, and Marx and Engels had predicted that for a communist revolution to succeed in Russia, there would probably need to be a Western European communist revolution earlier or at least simultaneously. Lenin had high hopes for [[world revolution]] in 1917 and 1918.<ref name=\"Volkogonov_1994\"/> The communism of Marx and Engels had had a sizable following among German workers for decades, and there were quite a few German revolutionaries eager to see revolutionary success in Russia and have help from Russian colleagues in a German revolution.\n\nThe moderate SPD leadership noted that a determined and well-managed group of the Bolshevik type might well try to seize power in Germany, quite possibly with Bolshevik help, and they moved their behavior towards the left as the German Revolution approached. Otto Braun, board member of the SPD and later Prime Minister of [[Prussia]], clarified the position of his party in a leading article in the SPD newspaper ''[[Vorw\u00e4rts]]'' under the title \"The Bolsheviks and Us\":\n\n<blockquote>Socialism cannot be erected on bayonets and machine guns. If it is to last, it must be realised with democratic means. Therefore of course it is a necessary prerequisite that the economic and social conditions for socializing society are ripe. If this was the case in Russia, the Bolsheviks no doubt could rely on the majority of the people. As this is not the case, they established a reign of the sword that could not have been more brutal and reckless under the disgraceful regime of the Tzar.... Therefore we must draw a thick, visible dividing line between us and the Bolsheviks.<ref>''Schulze, Weimar. Germany 1917\u20131933'', p. 158</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the same month in which Otto Braun's article appeared (October 1918), another series of strikes swept through Germany with the participation of over 1 million workers. For the first time during these strikes, the so-called Revolutionary Stewards took action. They were to play an important part in further developments. They called themselves \"[[Workers' council|Councils]]\" (''R\u00e4te'') after the Russian \"[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]\". To weaken their influence, Ebert joined the Berlin strike leadership and achieved an early termination of the strike.\n\nOn 3 March 1918, the newly established Soviet government agreed to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] negotiated with the Germans by [[Leon Trotsky]]. The settlement arguably contained harsher terms for the Russians than the later [[Treaty of Versailles]] would demand of the Germans. The Bolsheviks' principal motivation for acceding to so many of Germany's demands was to stay in power at any cost amid the backdrop of the [[Russian Civil War]]. Lenin and Trotsky also believed at the time that all of Europe would soon see [[world revolution]] and [[proletarian internationalism]], and [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois nationalistic]] interests as a framework to judge the treaty would become irrelevant.\n\nWith Russia knocked out of the war, the German Supreme Command could now move part of the eastern armies to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Most Germans believed that victory in the west was now at hand.\n\n== Leftist and rightist approaches to peace ==\nIn spite of the optimism created by the surrender of Russia early in 1918, there could be no question that the military situation on the Western Front had become more precarious for the Germans after the United States entered the war in April 1917. In the wake of the United States declaration of war, the SPD in the Reichstag joined the \"Interfactional Committee\" with the Centre Party and the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressive People's Party]]. In summer 1917, these three parties passed a peace resolution providing for a peace through rapprochement without annexations and payments, as opposed to a peace through victory and annexations, as the political right was demanding. Along with almost everyone else in the country, the committee still believed in victory. The Imperial German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]] did not like this resolution, and in the negotiations from December 1917 to March 1918 with Russia, it imposed a harsh peace by victory.\n\nThe Supreme Command also rejected outright the \"[[Fourteen Points]]\" set out by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on 8 January 1918. Wilson wanted peace on the basis of \"self-determination of peoples\" without victors or conquered. Hindenburg and Ludendorff rejected the offer because they believed themselves to be in a stronger position than they were before their victory over Russia. They continued to bet on a \"peace through victory\", with far-reaching annexations at the expense of Germany's enemies.\n\n== Request for ceasefire and change of constitution ==\nAfter the victory in the east, the Supreme Army Command on 21 March 1918 launched its so-called [[Spring Offensive]] in the west to turn the war decisively in Germany's favour, but by July 1918, their last reserves were used up, and Germany's military defeat became certain. The Allied forces scored numerous successive victories in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] between August and November 1918 that yielded huge territorial gains at the expense of Germany. The arrival of large numbers of fresh troops from the United States was a decisive factor.\n\nIn mid-September, the [[Balkan Front]] collapsed. The [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], an ally of the German Empire and [[Austria-Hungary]], capitulated on 27 September. The political collapse of Austria-Hungary itself was now only a matter of days away.\n\nOn 29 September, the Supreme Army Command, at army headquarters in [[Spa, Belgium]], informed Emperor Wilhelm II and the Imperial [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] Count [[Georg von Hertling]] that the military situation was hopeless. Ludendorff said that he could not guarantee to hold the front for another 24 hours and demanded a request to the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers for an immediate [[ceasefire]]. In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demand of Wilson to put the Imperial Government on a democratic footing in hopes of more favourable peace terms. This enabled him to protect the reputation of the Imperial Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely at the feet of the democratic parties and the Reichstag.\n\nAs he said to his staff officers on 1 October: \"They now must lie on the bed that they have made us.\"<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 32f.</ref>\n\nThus, the so-called \"[[stab-in-the-back legend]]\" ({{lang-de|Dolchsto\u00dflegende}}) was born, according to which the revolutionaries had attacked the undefeated army from the rear and turned an almost-certain victory into a defeat.\n\nIn fact, the Imperial Government and the German Army shirked their responsibility for defeat from the very beginning and tried to place the blame for it on the new democratic government. The motivation behind it is verified by the following citation in the autobiography of [[Wilhelm Groener]], Ludendorff's successor:\n\n<blockquote>It was just fine with me when Army and Army Command remained as guiltless as possible in these wretched truce negotiations, from which nothing good could be expected.<ref name=\"Schulze, p. 149\">Schulze, ''Weimar. Deutschland 1917\u20131933'' p. 149</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn nationalist circles, the myth fell on fertile ground. The nationalists soon defamed the revolutionaries (and even politicians like Ebert who never wanted a revolution and did everything to prevent it) as \"November Criminals\" (''Novemberverbrecher''). When [[Adolf Hitler]] planned his [[Beer Hall Putsch|attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 1923]] in collaboration with Ludendorff, the heavily symbolic date of 9 November (the anniversary of the proclamation of the republic he was trying to overthrow) was chosen for its launch.\n\nAlthough shocked by Ludendorff's report and the news of the defeat, the majority parties in the Reichstag, especially the SPD, were willing to take on the responsibility of government at the eleventh hour. As a convinced royalist, Hertling objected to handing over the reins to the Reichstag, thus Emperor Wilhelm II appointed [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] as the new Imperial Chancellor on 3 October. The prince was considered a liberal, but at the same time a representative of the royal family. In his cabinet, Social Democrats dominated. The most prominent and highest-ranking one was [[Philipp Scheidemann]], as under-secretary without portfolio. The following day, the new government offered to the Allies the truce that Ludendorff had demanded.\n\nIt was only on 5 October that the German public was informed of the dismal situation that it faced. In the general state of shock about the defeat, which now had become obvious, the constitutional changes, formally decided by the Reichstag on 28 October, went almost unnoticed. From then on, the Imperial Chancellor and his ministers depended on the confidence of the parliamentary majority. After the Supreme Command had passed from the emperor to the Imperial Government, the German Empire changed from a constitutional to a [[parliamentary monarchy]]. As far as the Social Democrats were concerned, the so-called October Constitution met all the important constitutional objectives of the party. Ebert already regarded 5 October as the birthday of German democracy since the emperor voluntarily ceded power and so he considered a revolution unnecessary.\n\n== Third Wilson note and Ludendorff's dismissal ==\nIn the following three weeks, American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] responded to the request for a truce with three diplomatic notes. As a precondition for negotiations, he demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and (implicitly) the emperor's abdication.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Spencer |title=World War I: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection |publisher=ABC-CLIO |place=Santa Barbara |year=2014 |page=2069 |isbn=978-1-85109-964-1 }}</ref> This last demand was intended to render the process of democratisation irreversible.\n\nAfter the third note of 24 October, General Ludendorff changed his mind and declared the conditions of the Allies to be unacceptable. He now demanded the resumption of the war that he had declared lost only one month earlier. While the request for a truce was being processed, the Allies came to realise Germany's military weakness. The German troops had come to expect the war to end and were anxious to return home. They were scarcely willing to fight more battles, and desertions were increasing.\n\nFor the time being, the Imperial government stayed on course and replaced Ludendorff as First General Quartermaster with General Groener. Ludendorff fled with false papers to neutral Sweden. On 5 November, the Entente Powers agreed to take up negotiations for a truce, but after the third note, many soldiers and the general population believed that the emperor had to abdicate to achieve peace.\n\n== Revolution ==\n{{Revolution sidebar}}\n\n=== Sailors' revolt ===\n{{main|Kiel mutiny}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J0908-0600-002, Novemberrevolution, Matrosenaufstand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kiel mutiny]]: the soldiers' council of {{SMS|Prinzregent Luitpold||2}}.]]\nWhile the war-weary troops and general population of Germany awaited the speedy end of the war, the [[Seekriegsleitung|Imperial Naval Command]] in Kiel under Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] and Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] planned to dispatch the Imperial [[Kaiserliche Marine|Fleet]] for a [[Naval order of 24 October 1918|last battle]] against the [[Royal Navy]] in the southern North Sea. The two admirals sought to lead this military action on their own initiative, without authorization.\n\nThe [[naval order of 24 October 1918]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/german-sailors-begin-to-mutiny |title=1918 German sailors begin to mutiny |website=history.com |accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> and the preparations to sail triggered a [[mutiny]] among the affected sailors. The revolt soon precipitated a general revolution in Germany that would sweep aside the monarchy within a few days. The mutinous sailors had no intention of risking their lives so close to the end of the war. They were also convinced that the credibility of the new democratic government, engaged as it was in seeking an armistice with the victorious Entente, would have been compromised by a naval attack at such a crucial point in negotiations.\n\nThe sailors' revolt started in the [[Schillig Roads]] off [[Wilhelmshaven]], where the German fleet had anchored in expectation of battle. During the night of 29\u201330 October 1918, some crews refused to obey orders. Sailors on board three ships of the Third Navy Squadron refused to weigh anchor. Part of the crew of {{SMS|Th\u00fcringen}} and {{SMS|Helgoland}}, two [[battleship]]s of the [[I Battle Squadron]], committed outright mutiny and sabotage. However, when some [[torpedo boat]]s directed their guns onto these ships a day later, the mutineers gave up and were led away without any resistance. Nonetheless, the Naval Command had to drop its plans for a naval engagement with British naval forces since it was felt that the loyalty of the crews could not be relied upon any more. The [[III Battle Squadron]] was ordered back to Kiel.\n\nThe squadron commander Vice-Admiral Kraft carried out a maneuver with his battleships in [[Heligoland Bight]]. The maneuver was successful, and he believed that he had regained control of his crews. While moving through the [[Kiel Canal]], he had 47 of the crew of {{SMS|Markgraf}}, who were seen as the ringleaders, imprisoned. In Holtenau (the end of the canal in Kiel), they were taken to the ''Arrestanstalt'' (military prison) in Kiel and to Fort Herwarth in the north of Kiel.\n\nThe sailors and stokers were now pulling out all the stops to prevent the fleet setting sail again and to achieve the release of their comrades. Some 250 met in the evening of 1 November in the Union House in Kiel. Delegations sent to their officers requesting the mutineers' release were not heard. The sailors were now looking for closer ties to the unions, the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]] and the SPD. Then, the Union House was closed by police, leading to an even larger joint open air meeting on 2 November. Led by the sailor [[Karl Artelt]], who worked in the torpedo workshop in Kiel-Friedrichsort, and by the mobilised shipyard worker [[Lothar Popp]], both USPD members, the sailors called for a mass meeting the following day at the same place: the ''Gro\u00dfer Exerzierplatz'' (large drill ground).\n\nThis call was heeded by several thousand people on the afternoon of 3 November, with workers' representatives also present. The slogan \"Peace and Bread\" (''Frieden und Brot'') was raised, showing that the sailors and workers demanded not only the release of the prisoners but also the end of the war and the improvement of food provisions. Eventually, the people supported Artelt's call to free the prisoners, and they moved towards the military prison. Sub-Lieutenant Steinh\u00e4user, in order to stop the demonstrators, ordered his patrol to fire warning shots and then to shoot directly into the demonstration; 7 people were killed and 29 severely injured. Some demonstrators also opened fire. Steinh\u00e4user himself was seriously injured by rifle-butt blows and shots, but contrary to later statements, he was not killed.<ref>See Hauptkrankenbuch Festungslazarett Kiel, Nr. 15918, Krankenbuchlager Berlin, zit. bei Dirk, D\u00e4hnhardt, ''Revolution in Kiel''. p. 66.</ref> After this eruption, the demonstrators and the patrol dispersed. Nevertheless, the mass protest turned into a general revolt.\n\nOn the morning of 4 November, groups of mutineers moved through the town of Kiel. Sailors in a large barracks compound in a northern district mutinied: after a divisional inspection by the commander, spontaneous demonstrations took place. Karl Artelt organised the first soldiers' council and soon many more were set up. The governor of the naval station, [[Wilhelm Souchon]], was compelled to negotiate.\n\nThe imprisoned sailors and stokers were freed, and soldiers and workers brought public and military institutions under their control. In breach of Souchon's promise, separate troops advanced to end the rebellion but were intercepted by the mutineers and sent back or decided to join the sailors and workers. By the evening of 4 November, Kiel was firmly in the hands of about 40,000 rebellious sailors, soldiers and workers, as was Wilhelmshaven two days later.\n\nOn the same evening, the SPD deputy [[Gustav Noske]] arrived in Kiel and was welcomed enthusiastically, but he had orders from the new government and the SPD leadership to bring the uprising under control. He had himself elected chairman of the soldiers' council and reinstated peace and order. Some days later he took over the governor's post, and Lothar Popp of the USPD became chairman of the overall soldiers' council.\n\nDuring the following weeks, Noske succeeded in reducing the influence of the councils in Kiel, but he could not prevent the spread of the revolution throughout Germany. The events had already spread far beyond Kiel.\n\n=== Spread of revolution to the entire German Empire ===\nAround 4 November, delegations of the sailors dispersed to all of the major cities in Germany. By 7 November, the revolution had seized all large coastal cities as well as [[Hanover]], [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[Frankfurt on Main]], and [[Munich]]. In Munich, a \"Workers' and Soldiers' Council\" forced the last [[King of Bavaria]], [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]], to issue the [[Anif declaration]]. [[Bavaria]] was the first member state of the German Empire to be declared a ''[[Volksstaat Bayern|Volksstaat]]'', the [[People's State of Bavaria]], by [[Kurt Eisner]] of the USPD who asserted that Ludwig III had abdicated his throne via the Anif declaration. In the following days, the dynastic rulers of all the other German states abdicated; the last was [[G\u00fcnther Victor, Prince of Schwarzburg]], on 23 November.\n\nThe Workers' and Soldiers' Councils were almost entirely made up of MSPD and USPD members. Their program was democracy, pacifism and anti-militarism. Apart from the dynastic families, they deprived only the military commands of their power and privilege. The duties of the imperial civilian administration and office bearers such as police, municipal administrations and courts were not curtailed or interfered with. There were hardly any confiscations of property or [[occupation of factories]], because such measures were expected from the new government. In order to create an executive committed to the revolution and to the future of the new government, the councils for the moment claimed only to take over the supervision of the administration from the military commands.\n\nThus, the MSPD was able to establish a firm base on the local level. But while the councils believed they were acting in the interest of the new order, the party leaders of the MSPD regarded them as disturbing elements for a peaceful changeover of power{{clarify|date=September 2012}} that they imagined already to have taken place. Along with the middle-class parties, they demanded speedy elections for a national assembly that would make the final decision on the constitution of the new state. This soon brought the MSPD into opposition with many of the revolutionaries. It was especially the USPD that took over{{clarify|date=September 2012}} their demands, one of which was to delay elections as long as possible to try to achieve a ''fait accompli'' that met the expectations of a large part of the workforce.\n\nNotably, revolutionary sentiment did not affect the [[former eastern territories of Germany|eastern lands of the Empire]] to any considerable extent, apart from isolated instances of agitation in [[Breslau]] and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]]. But interethnic discontent among Germans and minority Poles in the eastern extremities of [[Silesia]], long suppressed in Wilhelmine Germany, would eventually lead to the [[Silesian Uprisings]].\n\nBy the time the revolution was over in 1918, [[List of German monarchs in 1918|all 21 German monarchs]] had been dethroned.\n\n=== Reactions in Berlin ===\nEbert agreed with Prince Maximilian that a social revolution must be prevented and that state order must be upheld at all costs. In the restructuring of the state, Ebert wanted to win over the middle-class parties that had already cooperated with the SPD in the Reichstag in 1917, as well as the old elites of the German Empire. He wanted to avoid the spectre of radicalisation of the revolution along Russian lines and he also worried that the precarious supply situation could collapse, leading to the takeover of the administration by inexperienced revolutionaries. He was certain that the SPD would be able to implement its reform plans in the future due to its parliamentary majorities.\n\nEbert did his best to act in agreement with the old powers and intended to save the monarchy. In order to demonstrate some success to his followers, he demanded the abdication of the emperor as of 6 November. But Wilhelm II, still in his headquarters in Spa, was playing for time. After the Entente had agreed to truce negotiations on that day, he hoped to return to Germany at the head of the army and to quell the revolution by force.\n\nAccording to notes taken by Prince Maximilian, Ebert declared on 7 November, \"If the Kaiser does not abdicate, the social revolution is unavoidable. But I do not want it, indeed I hate it like sin.\" (''{{lang|de|Wenn der Kaiser nicht abdankt, dann ist die soziale Revolution unvermeidlich. Ich aber will sie nicht, ja, ich hasse sie wie die S\u00fcnde.}}'')<ref>v. Baden: ''Erinnerungen und Dokumente'' p. 599 f.</ref> The chancellor planned to travel to Spa and convince the emperor personally of the necessity to abdicate. But this plan was overtaken by the rapidly deteriorating situation in Berlin.\n\n===Saturday, 9 November 1918: two proclamations of a republic ===\n{{See also|List of German monarchs in 1918#November Revolution abdications{{!}}November Revolution abdications}}\nIn order to remain master of the situation, Friedrich Ebert demanded the chancellorship for himself on the afternoon of 9 November, the day of the emperor's abdication.\n\nThe news of the abdication came too late to make any impression on the demonstrators. Nobody heeded the public appeals. More and more demonstrators demanded the total abolition of the monarchy. Karl Liebknecht, just released from prison, had returned to Berlin and re-founded the Spartacist League the previous day. At lunch in the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], the SPD deputy chairman Philipp Scheidemann learned that Liebknecht planned the proclamation of a socialist republic. Scheidemann did not want to leave the initiative to the Spartacists and without further ado, he stepped out onto a balcony of the Reichstag. From there, he proclaimed a republic before a mass of demonstrating people on his own authority (against Ebert's expressed will). A few hours later, the Berlin newspapers reported that in the Berlin [[Lustgarten]] \u2013 at probably around the same time \u2013  Liebknecht had proclaimed a socialist republic, which he affirmed from a balcony of the [[Berlin City Palace]] to an assembled crowd at around 4 pm.\n\nAt that time, Karl Liebknecht's intentions were little known to the public. The Spartacist League's demands of 7 October for a far-reaching restructuring of the economy, the army and the judiciary \u2013 among other things by abolishing the death penalty \u2013 had not yet been publicised. The biggest bone of contention with the SPD was to be the Spartacists' demand for the establishment of \"unalterable political facts\" on the ground by social and other measures before the election of a constituent assembly, while the SPD wanted to leave the decision on the future economic system to the assembly.\n\n[[File:Ausrufung Republik Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|Crowds outside the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] on 9 November as the creation of the republic was announced.]]\nEbert was faced with a dilemma. The first proclamation he had issued on 9 November was addressed \"to the citizens of Germany\".\n\nEbert wanted to take the sting out of the revolutionary mood and to meet the demands of the demonstrators for the unity of the labour parties. He offered the USPD participation in the government and was ready to accept Liebknecht as a minister. Liebknecht in turn demanded the control of the workers' councils over the army. As USPD chairman Hugo Haase was in Kiel and the deliberations went on. The USPD deputies were unable to reach a decision that day.\n\nNeither the early announcement of the emperor's abdication, Ebert's assumption of the chancellorship, nor Scheidemann's proclamation of the republic were covered by the constitution.  These were all revolutionary actions by protagonists who did not want a revolution, but nevertheless took action. However, a real revolutionary action took place the same evening that would later prove to have been in vain.\n\nAround 8 pm, a group of 100 Revolutionary Stewards from the larger Berlin factories occupied the Reichstag. Led by their spokesmen [[Richard M\u00fcller (socialist)|Richard M\u00fcller]] and [[Emil Barth]], they formed a revolutionary parliament. Most of the participating stewards had already been leaders during the strikes earlier in the year. They did not trust the SPD leadership and had planned a coup for 11 November independently of the sailors' revolt, but were surprised by the revolutionary events since Kiel. In order to snatch the initiative from Ebert, they now decided to announce elections for the following day. On that Sunday, every Berlin factory and every regiment was to elect workers' and soldiers' councils that were then in turn to elect a revolutionary government from members of the two labour parties (SPD and USPD). This [[Council of the People's Deputies]] (''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'') was to execute the resolutions of the revolutionary parliament as the revolutionaries intended to replace Ebert's function as chancellor and president.\n<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge, Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution. Richard M\u00fcller, the Revolutionary Shop Stewards and the Origins of the Council Movement, Brill Publications 2014, pp. 61\u201379.</ref>\n\n===Sunday, 10 November: revolutionary councils elected, Armistice ===\n[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|\"Berlin seized by revolutionists\": ''[[The New York Times]]'' on [[Armistice Day]], 11 November 1918.]]\nThe same evening, the SPD leadership heard of these plans. As the elections and the councils' meeting could not be prevented, Ebert sent speakers to all Berlin regiments and into the factories in the same night and early the following morning. They were to influence the elections in his favour and announce the intended participation of the USPD in the government.\n\nIn turn, these activities did not escape the attention of Richard M\u00fcller and the revolutionary shop stewards.<ref>See: Ralf Hoffrogge, From Unionism to Workers' Councils \u2013 The Revolutionary Shop Stewards in Germany 1914\u20131918, in: Immanuel Ness and Dario Azzellini(Eds): Ours to Master and to Own: Worker's Control from the Commune to the Present, Chicago 2011</ref> Seeing that Ebert would also be running the new government, they planned to propose to the assembly not only the election of a government, but also the appointment of an Action Committee. This committee was to co-ordinate the activities of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils. For this election, the Stewards had already prepared a list of names on which the SPD was not represented. In this manner, they hoped to install a monitoring body acceptable to them watching the government.\n\nIn the assembly that convened on 10 November in the Circus Busch, the majority stood on the side of the SPD: almost all Soldiers' Councils and a large part of the workers representatives. They repeated the demand for the \"Unity of the Working Class\" that had been put forward by the revolutionaries the previous day and now used this motto in order to push through Ebert's line. As planned, three members of each socialist party were elected into the \"Council of People's Representatives\": from the USPD, their chairman [[Hugo Haase]], the deputy Wilhelm Dittmann and [[Emil Barth]] for the Revolutionary Stewards; from the SPD Ebert, Scheidemann and the Magdeburg deputy [[Otto Landsberg]].\n\nThe proposal by the [[shop stewards]] to elect an action committee additionally took the SPD leadership by surprise and started heated debates. Ebert finally succeeded in having this 24-member \"Executive Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils\" equally filled with SPD and USPD members. The Executive Council was chaired by Richard M\u00fcller and Brutus Molkenbuhr.\n\nOn the evening of 10 November, there was a phone call between Ebert and General [[Wilhelm Groener]], the new First General Quartermaster in Spa, Belgium. Assuring Ebert of the support of the army, the general was given Ebert's promise to reinstate the military hierarchy and, with the help of the army, to take action against the councils.\n\nIn the turmoil of this day, the Ebert government's acceptance of the harsh terms of the Entente for a truce, after a renewed demand by the Supreme Command, went almost unnoticed. On 11 November, the Centre Party deputy [[Matthias Erzberger]], on behalf of Berlin, signed [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|the armistice agreement]] in [[Compi\u00e8gne]], France, and World War I came to an end.\n\n=== Double rule ===\nAlthough Ebert had saved the decisive role of the SPD, he was not happy with the results. He did not regard the Council Parliament and the Executive Council as helpful, but only as obstacles impeding a smooth transition from empire to a new system of government. The whole SPD leadership mistrusted the councils rather than the old elites in army and administration, and they considerably overestimated the old elite's loyalty to the new republic. What troubled Ebert most was that he could not now act as chancellor in front of the councils, but only as chairman of a revolutionary government. Though he had taken the lead of the revolution only to halt it, conservatives saw him as a traitor.\n\nIn theory, the Executive Council was the highest-ranking council of the revolutionary regime and therefore M\u00fcller the head of state of the new declared \"Socialist Republic of Germany\". But in practice, the council's initiative was blocked by internal power struggles. The Executive Council decided to summon an \"Imperial Council Convention\" in December to Berlin.  In the eight weeks of double rule of councils and imperial government, the latter always was dominant. Although Haase was formally a chairman in the Council with equal rights, the whole higher level administration reported only to Ebert.\n\nThe SPD worried that the revolution would end in a Council (Soviet) Republic, following the Russian example. However, the secret [[Ebert-Groener pact]] did not win over the Imperial Officer Corps for the republic. As Ebert's behaviour became increasingly puzzling to the revolutionary workers, the soldiers and their stewards, the SPD leadership lost more and more of their supporters' confidence, without gaining any sympathies from the opponents of the revolution on the right.\n\n=== Stinnes\u2013Legien Agreement ===\nThe revolutionaries disagreed among themselves about the future economic and political system. Both SPD and USPD favoured placing at least heavy industry under democratic control. The left wings of both parties and the Revolutionary Stewards wanted to go beyond that and establish a \"direct democracy\" in the production sector, with elected delegates controlling the political power. It was not only in the interest of the SPD to prevent a Council Democracy; even the unions would have been rendered superfluous by the councils.\n\nTo prevent this development, the union leaders under [[Carl Legien]] and the representatives of big industry under [[Hugo Stinnes]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens]] met in Berlin from 9 to 12 November. On 15 November, they signed an agreement with advantages for both sides: the union representatives promised to guarantee orderly production, to end wildcat strikes, to drive back the influence of the councils and to prevent a nationalisation of means of production. For their part, the employers guaranteed to introduce the [[eight-hour day]], which the workers had demanded in vain for years. The employers agreed to the union claim of sole representation and to the lasting recognition of the unions instead of the councils. Both parties formed a \"Central Committee for the Maintenance of the Economy\" (Zentralausschuss f\u00fcr die Aufrechterhaltung der Wirtschaft).\n\nAn \"Arbitration Committee\" (Schlichtungsausschuss) was to mediate future conflicts between employers and unions. From now on, committees together with the management were to monitor the wage settlements in every factory with more than 50 employees.\n\nWith this arrangement, the unions had achieved one of their longtime demands, but undermined all efforts for nationalising means of production and largely eliminated the councils.\n\n=== Interim government and council movement ===\nThe Reichstag had not been summoned since 9 November. The [[Council of the People's Deputies]] and the Executive Council had replaced the old government, but the previous administrative machinery remained unchanged. Imperial servants had only representatives of SPD and USPD assigned to them.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} These servants all kept their positions and continued to do their work in most respects unchanged.\n\nOn 12 November, the Council of People's Representatives published its democratic and social government programme. It lifted the state of siege and censorship, abolished the \"Gesindeordnung\" (\"servant rules\" that governed relations between servant and master) and introduced universal suffrage from 20 years up, for the first time for women. There was an amnesty for all political prisoners. Regulations for the freedom of association, assembly and press were enacted. The eight-hour day became statutory on the basis of the Stinnes\u2013Legien Agreement, and benefits for unemployment, social insurance, and workers' compensation were expanded.\n\nAt the insistence of USPD representatives, the Council of People's Representatives appointed a \"Nationalisation Committee\" including [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]] and Otto Hue, among others. This committee was to examine which industries were \"fit\" for nationalisation and to prepare the nationalisation of the coal and steel industry. It sat until 7 April 1919, without any tangible result. \"Self-Administration Bodies\" were installed only in coal and potash mining and in the steel industry. From these bodies emerged the modern German Works or Factory Committees. Socialist expropriations were not initiated.\n\n[[File:Rathaus Bremen 15111918.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the Bremen [[revolutionary republic]], outside the town hall, on 15 November 1918.]]\nThe SPD leadership worked with the old administration rather than with the new Workers' and Soldiers' Councils, because it considered them incapable of properly supplying the needs of the population. As of mid-November, this caused continuing strife with the Executive Council. As the Council continuously changed its position following whoever it just happened to represent, Ebert withdrew more and more responsibilities planning to end the \"meddling and interfering\" of the Councils in Germany for good. But Ebert and the SPD leadership by far overestimated the power not only of the Council Movement but also of the Spartacist League. The Spartacist League, for example, never had control over the Council Movement as the conservatives and parts of the SPD believed.\n\nIn [[Leipzig]], [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]], [[Chemnitz]], and [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils took the city administrations under their control. In addition, in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[M\u00fclheim/Ruhr]], and [[Zwickau]], all civil servants loyal to the emperor were arrested. In Hamburg and Bremen, \"Red Guards\" were formed that were to protect the revolution. The councils deposed the management of the [[Leuna works]], a giant chemical factory near [[Merseburg]]. The new councils were often appointed spontaneously and arbitrarily and had no management experience whatsoever. But a majority of councils came to arrangements with the old administrations and saw to it that law and order were quickly restored. For example, [[Max Weber]] was part of the workers' council of [[Heidelberg]], and was pleasantly surprised that most members were moderate German liberals. The councils took over the distribution of food, the police force, and the accommodation and provisions of the front-line soldiers that were gradually returning home.\n\nFormer imperial administrators and the councils depended on each other: the former had the knowledge and experience, the latter had political clout. In most cases, SPD members had been elected into the councils who regarded their job as an interim solution. For them, as well as for the majority of the German population in 1918\u201319, the introduction of a Council Republic was never an issue, but they were not even given a chance to think about it. Many wanted to support the new government and expected it to abolish militarism and the authoritarian state. Being weary of the war and hoping for a peaceful solution, they partially overestimated the revolutionary achievements.\n\n=== General Council Convention ===\nAs decided by the Executive Committee, the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils in the whole empire sent deputies to Berlin, who were to convene on 16 December in the Circus Busch for the \"First General Convention of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils\" (Erster Allgemeiner Kongress der Arbeiter- und Soldatenr\u00e4te). On 15 December, Ebert and General Groener had troops ordered to Berlin to prevent this convention and to regain control of the capital. On 16 December, one of the regiments intended for this plan advanced too early. In an attempt to arrest the Executive Council, the soldiers opened fire on a demonstration of unarmed \"Red Guards\", representatives of Soldiers' Councils affiliated with the Spartacists; 16 people were killed.\n\nWith this, the potential for violence and the danger of a coup from the right became visible. In response to the incident, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] demanded the peaceful disarmament of the homecoming military units by the Berlin workforce in the daily newspaper of the Spartacist League ''Red Flag'' (''[[Rote Fahne]]'') of 12 December. She wanted the Soldiers' Councils to be subordinated to the Revolutionary Parliament and the soldiers to become \"re-educated\".\n\nOn 10 December, Ebert welcomed ten divisions returning from the front hoping to use them against the councils. As it turned out, these troops also were not willing to go on fighting. The war was over, Christmas was at the door and most of the soldiers just wanted to go home to their families. Shortly after their arrival in Berlin, they dispersed. The blow against the Convention of Councils did not take place.\n\nThis blow would have been unnecessary anyway, because the convention that took up its work 16 December in the Prussian House of Representatives consisted mainly of SPD followers. Not even Karl Liebknecht had managed to get a seat. The Spartacist League was not granted any influence. On 19 December, the councils voted 344 to 98 against the creation of a council system as a basis for a new constitution. Instead, they supported the government's decision to call for elections for a constituent national assembly as soon as possible. This assembly was to decide upon the state system.\n\nThe convention disagreed with Ebert only on the issue of control of the army. The convention was demanding a say for the Central Council that it would elect, in the supreme command of the army, the free election of officers and the disciplinary powers for the Soldiers' Councils. That would have been contrary to the agreement between Ebert and General Groener. They both spared no effort to undo this decision. The Supreme Command (which in the meantime had moved from Spa to [[Kassel]]), began to raise loyal volunteer corps (the [[Freikorps]]) against the supposed Bolshevik menace. Unlike the revolutionary soldiers of November, these troops were monarchist-minded officers and men who feared the return into civil life.\n\n=== Christmas crisis of 1918 ===\n{{Main|Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-067-30A, Revolution in Berlin, Soldaten im Kampf.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Leftist soldiers during Christmas fighting in the Pfeilersaal of the Berlin City Palace]]\nAfter 9 November, the government ordered the newly created [[Volksmarinedivision|People's Navy Division]] (''Volksmarinedivision'') from Kiel to Berlin for its protection and stationed it in the [[Neuer Marstall|Royal Stables]] (''Neuer Marstell'') across from the Berlin City Palace (''Berlin Schloss'' or ''Berlin Stadtschloss''). The division was considered absolutely loyal and had indeed refused to participate in the coup attempt of 6 December. The sailors even deposed their commander because they saw him as involved in the affair. It was this loyalty that now gave them the reputation of being in favor of the Spartacists. Ebert demanded their disbanding and Otto Wels, as of 9 November the Commander of Berlin and in line with Ebert, refused the sailors' pay.\n\nThe dispute escalated on 23 December. After having been put off for days, the sailors occupied the Imperial Chancellery itself, cut the phone lines, put the Council of People's Representatives under house arrest and captured Otto Wels. The sailors did not exploit the situation to eliminate the Ebert government, as would have been expected from Spartacist revolutionaries. Instead, they just insisted on their pay. Nevertheless, Ebert, who was in touch with the Supreme Command in Kassel via a secret phone line, gave orders to attack the Residence with troops loyal to the government on the morning of 24 December. The sailors repelled the attack under their commander Heinrich Dorrenbach, losing about 30 men and civilians in the fight. The government troops had to withdraw from the center of Berlin. They themselves were now disbanded and integrated into the newly formed Freikorps. To make up for their humiliating withdrawal, they temporarily occupied the editor's offices of the ''Red Flag''. But military power in Berlin once more was in the hands of the People's Navy Division. Again, the sailors did not take advantage of the situation.\n\nOn one side, this restraint demonstrates that the sailors were not Spartacists, on the other that the revolution had no guidance. Even if Liebknecht had been a revolutionary leader like Lenin, to which legend later made him, the sailors as well as the councils would not have accepted him as such. Thus the only result of the [[Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss|Christmas Crisis]], which the Spartacists named \"Ebert's Bloody Christmas\", was that the Revolutionary Stewards called for a demonstration on Christmas Day and the USPD left the government in protest on 29 December. They could not have done Ebert a bigger favor, since he had let them participate only under the pressure of revolutionary events. Within a few days, the military defeat of the Ebert government had turned into a political victory.\n\n=== Founding of the Communist Party and the January Revolt of 1919 ===\n{{Main|Spartacist uprising}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1577, Revolution in Berlin.jpg|thumb|The occupation of the Silesian railway station in Berlin by government troops, 1919]]\nAfter their experiences with the SPD and the USPD, the Spartacists concluded that their goals could be met only by forming a party of their own, thus they joined with other left-socialist groups from the whole of Germany to found the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD).<ref>Winkler, ''Weimar'' p. 55 f.</ref>\n\nRosa Luxemburg drew up her founding programme and presented it on 31 December 1918. In this programme, she pointed out that the communists could never take power without the clear will of the people in the majority. On 1 January, she demanded that the KPD participate in the planned nationwide German elections, but was outvoted. The majority still hoped to gain power by continued agitation in the factories and from \"pressure from the streets\". After deliberations with the Spartacists, the Revolutionary Stewards decided to remain in the USPD. This was a first defeat.\n\nThe decisive defeat of the left occurred in the first days of the new year in 1919. As in the previous November, {{weasel inline|date=September 2017}} {{according to whom|date=September 2017}}, a second revolutionary wave developed, but in this case, it was violently suppressed. The wave was started on 4 January, when the government dismissed the chief constable of Berlin, [[Emil Eichhorn]]. The latter was a member of the USPD who had refused to act against the demonstrating workers in the Christmas Crisis. This action resulted in the USPD, Revolutionary Stewards and the KPD chairmen [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Wilhelm Pieck]] to call for a demonstration to take place on the following day.\n\nTo the surprise{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} of the initiators, the demonstration turned into an assembly of huge masses. On Sunday, 5 January, as on 9 November 1918, hundreds of thousands of people poured into the centre of Berlin, many of them armed. In the afternoon, the train stations and the newspaper district with the offices of the middle-class press and ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' were occupied. Some of the middle-class papers in the previous days had called not only for the raising of more Freikorps, but also for the murder of the Spartacists.\n[[File:AlzadosEspartaquistas..png|thumb|left|Spartacist militia in Berlin]]\nThe demonstrators were mainly the same ones who participated in the disturbances two months previously. They now demanded the fulfillment of the hopes expressed in November. The Spartacists by no means had a leading position. The demands came straight from the workforce supported by various groups left of the SPD. The so-called \"[[Spartacist Uprising]]\" that followed originated only partially in the KPD. KPD members were even a minority among the insurgents.\n\nThe initiators assembled at the Police Headquarters elected a 53-member \"Interim Revolutionary Committee\" (Provisorischer Revolutionsausschuss) that failed to make use of its power and was unable to give any clear direction. Liebknecht demanded the overthrow of the government and agreed with the majority of the committee that propagated the armed struggle. Rosa Luxemburg as well as the majority of KPD leaders thought a revolt at this moment to be a catastrophe and spoke out against it.\n\n[[File:Mark IV Berlin.jpg|thumb|A British [[Mark IV tank]], captured during World War I, in use by German government troops. Berlin, January 1919|alt=]]\nOn the following day, 6 January, the Revolutionary Committee again called for a mass demonstration. This time, even more people heeded the call. Again they carried placards and banners that proclaimed, \"Brothers, don't shoot!\" and remained waiting on an assembly square. A part of the Revolutionary Stewards armed themselves and called for the overthrow of the Ebert government. But the KPD activists mostly failed in their endeavour to win over the troops. It turned out that even units such as the People's Navy Division were not willing to support the armed revolt and declared themselves neutral. The other regiments stationed in Berlin mostly remained loyal to the government.\n\nWhile more troops were moving into Berlin on Ebert's order, he accepted an offer by the USPD to mediate between him and the Revolutionary Committee. After the advance of the troops into the city became known, an SPD leaflet appeared saying, \"The hour of reckoning is nigh\". With this, the Committee broke off further negotiations on 8 January. That was opportunity enough for Ebert to use the troops stationed in Berlin against the occupiers. Beginning 9 January, they violently quelled an improvised revolt. In addition to that, on 12 January, the anti-republican Freikorps, which had been raised more or less as [[death squads]] since the beginning of December, moved into Berlin. [[Gustav Noske]], who had been People's Representative for Army and Navy for a few days, accepted the premium command of these troops by saying, \"If you like, someone has to be the bloodhound. I won't shy away from the responsibility.\"<ref>Winkler, ''Weimar'' p. 58</ref>\n\nThe Freikorps brutally cleared several buildings and executed the occupiers on the spot. Others soon surrendered, but some of them were still shot. The January revolt claimed 156 lives in Berlin.\n\n=== Murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg ===\nThe alleged ringleaders of the January Revolt had to go into hiding. In spite of the urgings of their allies, they refused to leave Berlin. On the evening of 15 January 1919, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were discovered in an apartment of the [[Wilmersdorf]] district of Berlin. They were immediately arrested and handed over to the largest Freikorps, the heavily armed Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzen-Division. Their commander, Captain [[Waldemar Pabst]], had them questioned. That same night both prisoners were beaten unconscious with rifle butts and shot in the head. Rosa Luxemburg's body was thrown into the [[Landwehr Canal]] that ran through Berlin, where it was found only on 1 July. Karl Liebknecht's body, without a name, was delivered to a morgue.\n\nThe perpetrators for the most part went unpunished. The [[Nazi Party]] later compensated the few that had been tried or even jailed, and they merged the Gardekavallerie into the SA ([[Sturmabteilung]]). In an interview given to \"[[Der Spiegel]]\" in 1962 and in his memoirs, Pabst maintained that he had talked on the phone with Noske in the Chancellery,<ref>''Der Spiegel'' of 18.04.1962</ref> and that Noske and Ebert had approved of his actions. Pabst's statement was never confirmed, especially since neither the Reichstag nor the courts ever examined the case.\n\nAfter the murders of 15 January, the political differences between the SPD and KPD grew even more irreconcilable. In the following years, both parties were unable to agree on joint action against the Nazi Party, which dramatically grew in strength as of 1930.\n\n=== Further revolts in tow of the revolution ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00539, Berlin, Revolution, Standrechtlich Erschossene.jpg|thumb|Dead revolutionaries after summary execution in March 1919|alt=]]\nIn the first months of 1919, there were further armed revolts all over Germany. In some states, [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Councils Republics]] were proclaimed, most prominently in Bavaria (the [[Munich Soviet Republic]]), even if only temporarily.\n\nThese revolts were triggered by Noske's decision at the end of February to take armed action against the [[Bremen Soviet Republic]]. In spite of an offer to negotiate, he ordered his Freikorps units to invade the city. Approximately 400 people were killed in the ensuing fights.\n\nThis caused an eruption of mass strikes in the [[Ruhr]] District, the [[Rhineland]] and in [[Saxony]]. Members of the USPD, the KPD and even the SPD called for a general strike that started on 4 March. Against the will of the strike leadership, the strikes escalated into street fighting in Berlin. The Prussian state government, which in the meantime had declared a state of siege, called the imperial government for help. Again Noske employed the Gardekavallerie-Sch\u00fctzendivision, commanded by Pabst, against the strikers in Berlin. By the end of the fighting on 16 March, they had killed approximately 1,200 people, many of them unarmed and uninvolved. Among others, 29 members of the Peoples Navy Division, who had surrendered, were summarily executed, since Noske had ordered that anybody found armed should be shot on the spot.\n\nThe situation in Hamburg and Thuringia also was very much like a civil war. The council government to hold out the longest was the [[Munich Soviet Republic]]. It was only on 2 May that Prussian and Freikorps units from W\u00fcrttemberg toppled it by using the same violent methods as in Berlin and Bremen.\n\nAccording to the predominant opinion of modern historians,<ref>Schulze, ''Weimar. Deutschland 1917\u20131933'' S. 169 u. 170</ref> the establishment of a Bolshevik-style council government in Germany on 9\u201310 November 1918 was impossible. Yet the Ebert government felt threatened by a coup from the left, and was certainly undermined by the Spartakus movement; thus it co-operated with the Supreme Command and the Freikorps. The brutal actions of the Freikorps during the various revolts estranged many left democrats from the SPD. They regarded the behavior of Ebert, Noske and the other SPD leaders during the revolution as an outright betrayal of their own followers.\n\n=== National Assembly and New Imperial Constitution ===\n{{Main|Weimar National Assembly}}\nOn 19 January 1919, a Constituent National Assembly (Verfassungsgebende Nationalversammlung) was elected. Aside from SPD and USPD, the Catholic Centre Party took part, and so did several middle-class parties that had established themselves since November: the left-liberal [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), the national-liberal [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the conservative, nationalist [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). In spite of Rosa Luxemburg's recommendation, the KPD did not participate in these elections.\n\nWith 37.4% of the vote, the SPD became the strongest party in the Reichstag and secured 165 out of 423 deputies.  The USPD received only 7.6% of the vote and sent 22 deputies into the parliament. The popularity of the USPD temporarily rose one more time after the [[Kapp-L\u00fcttwitz Putsch]] in 1920, but the party dissolved in 1922. The Centre Party was runner-up to the SPD with 91 deputies, the DDP had 75, the DVP 19 and the DNVP 44. As a result of the elections, the SPD formed the so-called [[Weimar Coalition]] with the Centre Party and the DDP.  To get away from the post-revolutionary confusion in Berlin, the National Assembly met on 6 February in the town of [[Weimar]], [[Thuringia]], some 250&nbsp;km to the southwest of Berlin, where Friedrich Ebert was elected temporary Reich President on 11 February. [[Philipp Scheidemann]] was elected as Prime Minister (Ministerpr\u00e4sident) of the newly formed coalition on 13 February.  Ebert was then constitutionally sworn in as Reich President ([[Reichspr\u00e4sident]]) on 21 August 1919.\n\nOn the one hand, the [[Weimar Constitution]] offered more possibilities for a [[direct democracy]] than the present [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], for example by setting up a mechanism for referenda. On the other hand, [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] granted the president the authority to rule against the majority in the Reichstag, with the help of the army if need be.  In 1932\u201333, Article 48 was instrumental in destroying German democracy.<ref>Mosler: ''Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs vom 11. August 1919''</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main|Weimar Republic}}\n\nFrom 1920 to 1923, nationalist forces continued fighting against the Weimar Republic and left-wing political opponents. In 1920, the German government was briefly overthrown in a coup organized by [[Wolfgang Kapp]] (the [[Kapp Putsch]]), and a nationalist government was briefly in power. Mass public demonstrations soon forced this regime out of power. In 1921 and 1922, [[Matthias Erzberger]] and [[Walter Rathenau]] were shot by members of the ultra-nationalist [[Organisation Consul]]. The newly formed [[Nazi Party]], under the leadership of [[Adolf Hitler]] and supported by former German army chief [[Erich Ludendorff]], engaged in political violence against the government and left-wing political forces as well. In 1923, in what is now known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], the Nazis took control of parts of [[Munich]], arrested the president of Bavaria, the chief of police, and others and forced them to sign an agreement in which they endorsed the Nazi takeover and its objective to overthrow the German government. The putsch came to an end when the German army and police were called in to put it down, resulting in an armed confrontation in which a number of Nazis and some police were killed.\n\nThe Weimar Republic was always under great pressure from both left-wing and right-wing extremists. The left-wing extremists accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers' movement by preventing a communist revolution and unleashing the Freikorps upon the workers. Right-wing extremists were opposed to any democratic system, preferring instead an authoritarian state similar to the Empire founded in 1871. To further undermine the Republic's credibility, right-wing extremists (especially certain members of the former officer corps) used the ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'' to blame an alleged conspiracy of Socialists and Jews for Germany's defeat in World War I, largely drawing fuel from the fact that eight out of the ten leaders of the communist revolution were Jewish. Both sides were determined to bring down the Weimar Republic. In the end, the right-wing extremists were successful, and the Weimar Republic came to an end with the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|ascent of Hitler]] and the National Socialist Party.\n\n== Impact on Weimar Republic ==\nThe Revolution of 1918/19 is one of the most important events in the modern history of Germany, yet it is poorly embedded in the historical memory of Germans. The failure of the Weimar Republic that this revolution brought into being and the Nazi era that followed it obstructed the view of these events for a long time. To this very day, the interpretation of these events has been determined more by legends than by facts.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBoth the radical right and the radical left{{snd}}under different circumstances{{snd}}nurtured the idea that a Communist uprising was aiming to establish a Soviet Republic following the Russian example. The democratic centre parties, especially the SPD, were also barely interested in assessing the events which turned Germany into a Republic fairly. At closer look, these events turned out to be a revolution supported by the Social Democrats and stopped by their party leadership. These processes helped to weaken the Weimar Republic from its very beginning.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAfter the imperial government and the Supreme Command shirked their responsibilities for the war and the defeat at an early stage, the majority parties of the Reichstag were left to cope with the resulting burdens. In his autobiography, Ludendorff's successor Groener states, \"It suited me just fine, when the army and the Supreme Command remained as guiltless as possible in these wretched truce negotiations, from which nothing good could be expected\".<ref name=\"Schulze, p. 149\"/>\n\nThus, the \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|Myth of the Stab in the Back]]\" was born, according to which the revolutionaries stabbed the army, \"undefeated on the field\", in the back and only then turned the almost secure victory into a defeat. It was mainly Ludendorff who contributed to the spread of this falsification of history to conceal his own role in the defeat. In nationalistic and national minded circles, the myth fell on fertile ground. They soon defamed the revolutionaries and even politicians like Ebert, who never wanted the revolution and had done everything to channel and contain it, as \"November Criminals\" (Novemberverbrecher). In 1923, Hitler and Ludendorff deliberately chose symbolic 9 November as the date of their attempted \"[[Beer Hall Putsch]]\".\n\nFrom its very beginning, the Weimar Republic was afflicted with the stigma of the military defeat. A large part of the bourgeoisie and the old elites from big industry, landowners, military, judiciary and administration never accepted the democratic republic and hoped to get rid of it at the first opportunity. On the left, the actions of the SPD Leadership during the revolution drove many of its former adherents to the Communists. The contained revolution gave birth to a \"democracy without democrats\".<ref>Sontheimer, ''Antidemokratisches Denken''</ref>\n\n== Contemporary statements ==\nDepending on their political standpoint of view, contemporaries had greatly differing opinions about the revolution.\n\n[[Ernst Troeltsch]], a Protestant theologian and philosopher, rather calmly remarked how the majority of Berlin citizens perceived 10 November:\n<blockquote>On Sunday morning after a frightful night the morning newspapers gave a clear picture: the Kaiser in Holland, the revolution victorious in most urban centres, the royals in the states abdicating. No man dead for Kaiser and Empire! The continuation of duties ensured and no run on the banks! (...) Trams and subways ran as usual which is a pledge that basic needs are cared for. On all faces it could be read: Wages will continue to be paid.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 85</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe liberal publicist [[Theodor Wolff]] wrote on the very day of 10 November in the newspaper ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', lending himself to far too optimistic illusions, which the SPD leadership also might have had:\n<blockquote>Like a sudden storm, the biggest of all revolutions has toppled the imperial regime including everything that belonged to it. It can be called the greatest of all revolutions because never has a more firmly built (...) fortress been taken in this manner at the first attempt. Only one week ago, there was still a military and civil administration so deeply rooted that it seemed to have secured its dominion beyond the change of times. (...) Only yesterday morning, at least in Berlin, all this still existed. Yesterday afternoon it was all gone.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 95</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe extreme right had a completely opposite perception. On 10 November, conservative journalist Paul Baecker wrote an article in ''Deutsche Tageszeitung'' which already contained essential elements of the ''[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]'':\n<blockquote>The work fought for by our fathers with their precious blood \u2013 dismissed by betrayal in the ranks of our own people! Germany, yesterday still undefeated, left to the mercy of our enemies by men carrying the German name, by felony out of our own ranks broken down in guilt and shame.<br>The German Socialists knew that peace was at hand anyway and that it was only about holding out against the enemy for a few days or weeks in order to wrest bearable conditions from them. In this situation they raised the white flag.<br>This is a sin that can never be forgiven and never will be forgiven. This is treason not only against the monarchy and the army but also against the German people themselves who will have to bear the consequences in centuries of decline and of misery.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 96</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn an article on the 10th anniversary of the revolution the publicist [[Kurt Tucholsky]] remarked that neither Wolff nor Baecker were right. Nevertheless, Tucholsky accused Ebert and Noske of betrayal, not of the monarchy but of the revolution. Although he wanted to regard it as only a coup d'\u00e9tat, he analysed the actual course of events more clearly than most of his contemporaries. In 1928 he wrote in \"November Coup\":\n<blockquote>The German Revolution of 1918 took place in a hall.<br>\nThe things taking place were not a revolution. There was no spiritual preparation, no leaders ready in the dark; no revolutionary goals. The mother of this revolution was the soldiers' longing to be home for Christmas. And weariness, disgust and weariness.<br>The possibilities that nevertheless were lying in the streets were betrayed by Ebert and his like. Fritz* Ebert, whom you cannot heighten to a personality by calling him Friedrich opposed the establishment of a republic only until he found there was a post of chairman to be had; comrade Scheidemann \u00e8 tutti quanti all were would-be senior civil servants. (* Fritz is the colloquial term for Friedrich like Willy \u2013 William)<br>\nThe following possibilities were left out: shattering federal states, division of landed property, revolutionary socialization of industry, reform of administrative and judiciary personnel. A republican constitution in which every sentence rescinds the next one, a revolution talking about well acquired rights of the old regime can be only laughed at.<br>\n''The German Revolution is still to take place.''<ref>Kurt Tucholsky: ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Collected Works), Vol. 6, p. 300</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Walter Rathenau]] was of a similar opinion. He called the revolution a \"disappointment\", a \"present by chance\", a \"product of desperation\", a \"revolution by mistake\". It did not deserve the name because it did \"not abolish the actual mistakes\" but \"degenerated into a degrading clash of interests\".\n\n<blockquote>Not a chain was broken by the swelling of spirit and will, but a lock merely rusted through. The chain fell off and the freed stood amazed, helpless, embarrassed and needed to arm against their will. The ones sensing their advantage were the quickest.<ref>S\u00f6semann, ''Demokratie im Widerstreit'', p.13</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian and publicist [[Sebastian Haffner]] in turn came out against Tucholsky and Rathenau. He lived through the revolution in Berlin as a child and wrote 50 years later in his book about one of the myths related to the events of November 1918 that had taken root especially in the bourgeoisie:\n\n<blockquote>It is often said that a true revolution in Germany in 1918 never took place. All that really happened was a breakdown. It was only the temporary weakness of the police and army in the moment of military defeat which let a mutiny of sailors appear as a revolution.\n<br>At first sight, one can see how wrong and blind this is comparing 1918 with 1945. In 1945 there really was a breakdown.<br>Certainly a mutiny of sailors started the revolution in 1918 but it was only a start. What made it extraordinary is that a mere sailors' mutiny triggered an earthquake which shook all of Germany; that the whole home army, the whole urban workforce and in Bavaria a part of the rural population rose up in revolt. This revolt was not just a mutiny anymore, it was a true revolution....<br>As in any revolution, the old order was replaced by the beginnings of a new one. It was not only destructive but also creative....<br>As a revolutionary achievement of masses the German November 1918 does not need to take second place to either the French July 1789 or the Russian March 1917.<ref>Haffner, ''Der Verrat'' p. 193 f.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Historical research ===\nDuring the Nazi regime, works on the Weimar Republic and the German Revolution published abroad and by exiles in the 1930s and 1940s could not be read in Germany. Around 1935, that affected the first published history of the Weimar Republic by [[Arthur Rosenberg]]. In his view the political situation at the beginning of the revolution was open: the moderate socialist and democratic-oriented work force indeed had a chance to become the actual social foundation of the republic and to drive back the conservative forces. It failed because of the wrong decisions of the SPD leadership and because of the revolutionary tactics employed by the extreme left wing of the work force.\n\nAfter 1945 West German historical research on the Weimar Republic concentrated most of all on its decline. In 1951, Theodor Eschenburg mostly ignored the revolutionary beginning of the republic. In 1955, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] also dealt with the German Revolution from the perspective of the failed republic. [[Erich Eyck]] shows how little the revolution after 1945 was regarded as part of German history. His two-volume ''History of the Weimar Republic'' gave barely 20 pages to these events. The same can be said for Karl Dietrich Erdmann's contribution to the 8th edition of the ''Gebhardt Handbook for German History'' (''Gebhardtsches Handbuch zur Deutschen Geschichte''), whose viewpoint dominated the interpretation of events related to the German Revolution after 1945. According to Erdmann, 1918/19 was about the choice between \"social revolution in line with forces demanding a proletarian dictatorship and parliamentary republic in line with the conservative elements like the German officer corps\".<ref>Kluge, ''Deutsche Revolution 1918/19'', p. 15</ref> As most Social Democrats were forced to join up with the old elites to prevent an imminent council dictatorship, the blame for the failure of the Weimar Republic was to be put on the extreme left, and the events of 1918/19 were successful defensive actions of democracy against Bolshevism.\n\nThis interpretation at the height of the [[Cold War]] was based on the assumption that the extreme left was comparably strong and a real threat to the democratic development. In this point, West German researchers ironically found themselves in line with Marxist historiography in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), which attributed considerable revolutionary potential most of all to the Spartacists.<ref>On East German historiography of the German Revolution see Mario Ke\u00dfler: Die Novemberrevolution in der Geschichtswissenschaft der DDR \u2013 Die Kontroversen des Jahres 1958 und ihre Folgen im internationalen Kontext, in: [[Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. III/2008.</ref>\n\nWhile in the postwar years the majority SPD (MSPD) was cleared of its Nazi odium as \"November Criminals\", GDR historians blamed the SPD for \"betrayal of the working class\" and the USPD leadership for their incompetence. Their interpretation was mainly based on the 1958 theories of the Central Committee of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] according to which the German Revolution was defined as a \"bourgeois-democratic revolution\", led in certain aspects by proletarian means and methods. The fact that a revolution by the working class in Germany never happened could be put down to the \"subjective factor\", especially the absence of a \"[[Marxist-Leninist]] offensive party\". Contrary to the official party line, [[Rudolf Lindau (politician)|Rudolf Lindau]] supported the theory that the German Revolution had a Socialist tendency.\n\nConsistently, the founding of the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) was declared to be the decisive turning point in German history, but in spite of ideological bias, historical research in the GDR expanded detailed knowledge of the German Revolution.<ref>Eberhard Kolb: ''Die Weimarer Republik''. Wien, 1984. p. 154f</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s, West German historians focused their research on the final stages of the Weimar Republic. In the 1960s, they shifted to its revolutionary beginnings, realising that the decisions and developments during the revolution were central to the failure of the first German Republic. The workers' and soldiers' councils especially moved into focus, and their previous appearance as a far-left movement had to be revised extensively. Authors like Ulrich Kluge, [[Eberhard Kolb]] and Reinhard R\u00fcrup argued that in the first weeks of the revolution the social base for a democratic redesign of society was much stronger than previously thought and that the potential of the extreme left was actually weaker than the MSPD's leadership, for example, assumed.\n\nAs \"Bolshevism\" posed no real threat, the scope of action for the Council of the People's Deputies (also supported by the more reform-oriented councils) to democratise the administration, military and society had been relatively large, but the MSPD's leadership did not take that step because it trusted in the loyalty of the old elites and mistrusted the spontaneous mass movements in the first weeks of the revolution. The result was the resignation and radicalisation of the council movement. The theories have been supported by the publications of the minutes of the Council of the People's Deputies. Increasingly, the history of the German Revolution appeared as the history of its gradual reversal.\n\nThis new interpretation of the German Revolution gained acceptance in research rather quickly even though older perceptions remained alive. Research concerning the composition of the Worker's and Soldier's Councils which today can be easily verified by sources is undisputed to a large extent, but the interpretation of the revolutionary events based on this research has been already criticised and partially modified since the end of the 1970s. Criticism was aimed at the partially idealised description of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils which especially was the case in the wake of the [[German Student Movement]] of the 1960s (1968). Peter von Oertzen went particularly far in this respect describing a social democracy based on councils as a positive alternative to the bourgeois republic. In comparison, [[Wolfgang J. Mommsen]] did not regard the councils as a homogeneous focused movement for democracy but as a heterogeneous group with a multitude of different motivations and goals. Jesse and K\u00f6hler even talked about the \"construct of a democratic council movement\". Certainly, the authors also excluded a \"relapse to the positions of the 1950s: \"The councils were neither communist oriented to a large extent nor can the policies of the majority SPD in every aspect be labelled fortuitous and worth praising.\"<ref>Kolb, op. cit. p. 160f</ref>\n\n[[Heinrich August Winkler]] tried to find a compromise, according to which the Social Democrats depended to a limited extent on cooperation with the old elites but went considerably too far: \"With more political willpower they could have changed more and preserved less.\"<ref>Kolb, op. cit. p. 161</ref>\n\nWith all the differences concerning details, historical researchers agree that in the German Revolution, the chances to put the republic on a firm footing were considerably better than the dangers coming from the extreme left. Instead, the alliance of the SPD with the old elites constituted a considerable structural problem for the Weimar Republic.<ref>Kolb, op.cit. pp. 143\u2013162; Kluge, ''Deutsche Revolution'' pp. 10\u201338</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Germany}}\n*[[Finnish Civil War]]\n*[[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)]]\n*[[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]\n*[[Luxemburgism]]\n*[[Anarchism in Germany]]\n*[[Silesian Uprisings]]\n*[[Revolutions of 1917\u201323]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nEnglish language literature:\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* Mark Jones:  ''Founding Weimar.
