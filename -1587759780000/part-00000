He later moved to his hometown promotion, the [[American Wrestling Association]] in Minnesota, and began teaming with [[Adrian Adonis]] as the \"East-West Connection\" in 1979.

Often after their televised matches Ventura would taunt and challenge fellow commentator [[Bruno Sammartino]], but nothing ever came of this.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nVentura participated in a six-man tag team match in December 1985 when he, [[Roddy Piper]], and [[Bob Orton]] defeated [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[Uncle Elmer]], and [[Gene Petit|Cousin Luke]] in a match which was broadcast on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event IV]]''. The tag match against the Hillbillies came about after Piper and Orton interrupted Elmer's wedding ceremony on the previous edition of the show; Ventura, who later claimed that he was under instruction from fellow commentator and WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] to \"bury them\", insulted Elmer and his wife during commentary of what was a real wedding ceremony at the [[Meadowlands Arena]], by proclaiming when they kissed: \"It looks like two [[carp]] in the middle of the [[Mississippi River]] going after the same piece of corn.\" According to Ventura, the wedding was real, for at that time the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] would not allow the WWF to stage a fake wedding in the state of [[New Jersey]], so Stan Frazier (Uncle Elmer) and his fiancee had agreed to have a real in-ring wedding.<ref name=OWOW/>\n\nAfter a failed comeback bid, Ventura hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's ''Superstars of Wrestling'' called \"The Body Shop\", in much the same heel style as \"Piper's Pit\", though the setting was a mock gym (when Ventura was unavailable, \"The Body Shop\" was often hosted by [[Don Muraco]]). He began to do [[color commentator#Sports entertainment|color commentary]] on television for ''[[List of former World Wrestling Entertainment programming#All-Star Wrestling (1974\u20131986)|All-Star Wrestling]]'', replacing [[Angelo Mosca]], and later ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', initially alongside Vince McMahon and the semi-retired Sammartino, and then just with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in early 1988. Ventura most notably co-hosted ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' with McMahon, the first six [[WrestleMania]]s (five of which were alongside [[Gorilla Monsoon]]), and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with Monsoon, with the lone exception for Ventura being the [[SummerSlam (1988)|first SummerSlam]], in which Ventura served as the guest referee during the main event.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nVentura's entertaining commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, i.e. a \"[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]\", as he was partial to the villains, which was something new and different at the time. McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, came up with the idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly favored the [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\nHowever, Ventura would still occasionally give credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of fan favorites such as [[Ricky Steamboat]] and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels [[Bobby Heenan]] and [[Jimmy Hart]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOne notable exception to this rule was the [[WrestleMania VI]] Ultimate Challenge title for title match between [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]], The [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]]. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at Wrestlemania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, \"This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty.\" Ventura's praise of Hogan's action was unusual for him, because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a Wrestlemania that he might \"come out of retirement and take this dude out\". Hogan and Ventura were at one point close friends.<ref name=\"VBot1\">Jesse Ventura, \"I Ain't Got Time To Bleed pg. 108</ref> However, Ventura abruptly ended the friendship in 1994 after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984.<ref name=\"VBot1\" /> Following a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a [[Sega]] product, while McMahon had a contract with rival company [[Nintendo]] at the time, the promoter released Ventura from the company in August 1990.<ref name=\"VBodt\">Jake Tapper, \"Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story,\" pg. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nVentura later served as a radio announcer for a few [[National Football League]] teams, among them the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\nIn February 1992 at [[SuperBrawl II]], Ventura joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] as a commentator. Ventura was ultimately released by WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]] for allegedly falling asleep during a ''WCW Worldwide'' TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, although it has been speculated that the move may have had more to do with Hogan's arrival shortly before.<ref name=OWOW/>\n\n===Litigation===\nIn 1987, while negotiating his contract as a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In November 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received [[royalties]], Ventura brought an action for fraud, misappropriation of publicity rights, and [[quantum meruit]] in [[Minnesota]] [[State court (United States)|state court]] against Titan Sports asking for the amount of $2 million in royalties based on a fair market value share.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrestlingforum.com/classic-wrestling/2001906-wrestling-observer-1994-a-2.html|title=Wrestling Observer 1994 - Page 2 - Wrestling Forum: WWE, Impact Wrestling, Indy Wrestling, Women of Wrestling Forums|website=www.wrestlingforum.com|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref> Titan moved the case to [[United States district court|federal court]], and Ventura won an $801,333 jury [[verdict]] on the last claim.

Alluding to the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], Ventura boldly announced that \"I think we oughta put a wrestler in the [[White House]] in 2008!\". On the June 11, 2007 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]],'' Ventura appeared to give comments about McMahon.<ref name=OWOW/> Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009 episode of ''Raw,'' during which he retained his [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] persona by siding with the number one contender [[Sheamus]] over WWE Champion [[John Cena]]. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE, while Ventura never did during his WWE career. After that, Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs (2009)|TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs]].

I didn't mean all religious people. I don't have any problem with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the [[Founding Fathers]] built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the fundamentalist fanatics are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn't accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That's what I find weak and destructive.<ref name=Principles/>}}\n\nHowever, in April 2011, Ventura said on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' that he is an [[atheist]] and believes that his beliefs could disqualify him for office in the future, arguing that, \"I don't believe you can be an atheist and admit it and get elected in our country.\"<ref name=\"The Howard Stern Show\">{{Cite episode |series=Howard Stern Show|title=[[The Howard Stern Show]] |network=[[Sirius XM Radio]] |airdate=April 5, 2011 |minutes=143 |quote=Actually Howard, I can't even run for office anymore.

He later moved to his hometown promotion, the [[American Wrestling Association]] in Minnesota, and began teaming with [[Adrian Adonis]] as the \"East-West Connection\" in 1979.

Often after their televised matches Ventura would taunt and challenge fellow commentator [[Bruno Sammartino]], but nothing ever came of this.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nVentura participated in a six-man tag team match in December 1985 when he, [[Roddy Piper]], and [[Bob Orton]] defeated [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[Uncle Elmer]], and [[Gene Petit|Cousin Luke]] in a match which was broadcast on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event IV]]''. The tag match against the Hillbillies came about after Piper and Orton interrupted Elmer's wedding ceremony on the previous edition of the show; Ventura, who later claimed that he was under instruction from fellow commentator and WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] to \"bury them\", insulted Elmer and his wife during commentary of what was a real wedding ceremony at the [[Meadowlands Arena]], by proclaiming when they kissed: \"It looks like two [[carp]] in the middle of the [[Mississippi River]] going after the same piece of corn.\" According to Ventura, the wedding was real, for at that time the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] would not allow the WWF to stage a fake wedding in the state of [[New Jersey]], so Stan Frazier (Uncle Elmer) and his fiancee had agreed to have a real in-ring wedding.<ref name=OWOW/>\n\nAfter a failed comeback bid, Ventura hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's ''Superstars of Wrestling'' called \"The Body Shop\", in much the same heel style as \"Piper's Pit\", though the setting was a mock gym (when Ventura was unavailable, \"The Body Shop\" was often hosted by [[Don Muraco]]). He began to do [[color commentator#Sports entertainment|color commentary]] on television for ''[[List of former World Wrestling Entertainment programming#All-Star Wrestling (1974\u20131986)|All-Star Wrestling]]'', replacing [[Angelo Mosca]], and later ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', initially alongside Vince McMahon and the semi-retired Sammartino, and then just with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in early 1988. Ventura most notably co-hosted ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' with McMahon, the first six [[WrestleMania]]s (five of which were alongside [[Gorilla Monsoon]]), and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with Monsoon, with the lone exception for Ventura being the [[SummerSlam (1988)|first SummerSlam]], in which Ventura served as the guest referee during the main event.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nVentura's entertaining commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, i.e. a \"[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]\", as he was partial to the villains, which was something new and different at the time. McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, came up with the idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly favored the [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorites]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\nHowever, Ventura would still occasionally give credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of fan favorites such as [[Ricky Steamboat]] and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels [[Bobby Heenan]] and [[Jimmy Hart]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOne notable exception to this rule was the [[WrestleMania VI]] Ultimate Challenge title for title match between [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]], The [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]]. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at Wrestlemania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, \"This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty.\" Ventura's praise of Hogan's action was unusual for him, because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a Wrestlemania that he might \"come out of retirement and take this dude out\". Hogan and Ventura were at one point close friends.<ref name=\"VBot1\">Jesse Ventura, \"I Ain't Got Time To Bleed pg. 108</ref> However, Ventura abruptly ended the friendship in 1994 after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984.<ref name=\"VBot1\" /> Following a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a [[Sega]] product, while McMahon had a contract with rival company [[Nintendo]] at the time, the promoter released Ventura from the company in August 1990.<ref name=\"VBodt\">Jake Tapper, \"Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story,\" pg. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nVentura later served as a radio announcer for a few [[National Football League]] teams, among them the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].<ref name=OWOW/>\n\nIn February 1992 at [[SuperBrawl II]], Ventura joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] as a commentator. Ventura was ultimately released by WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]] for allegedly falling asleep during a ''WCW Worldwide'' TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, although it has been speculated that the move may have had more to do with Hogan's arrival shortly before.<ref name=OWOW/>\n\n===Litigation===\nIn 1987, while negotiating his contract as a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In November 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received [[royalties]], Ventura brought an action for fraud, misappropriation of publicity rights, and [[quantum meruit]] in [[Minnesota]] [[State court (United States)|state court]] against Titan Sports asking for the amount of $2 million in royalties based on a fair market value share.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrestlingforum.com/classic-wrestling/2001906-wrestling-observer-1994-a-2.html|title=Wrestling Observer 1994 - Page 2 - Wrestling Forum: WWE, Impact Wrestling, Indy Wrestling, Women of Wrestling Forums|website=www.wrestlingforum.com|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref> Titan moved the case to [[United States district court|federal court]], and Ventura won an $801,333 jury [[verdict]] on the last claim.

On the June 11, 2007 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]],'' Ventura appeared to give comments about McMahon.<ref name=OWOW/> Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009 episode of ''Raw,'' during which he retained his [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] persona by siding with the number one contender [[Sheamus]] over WWE Champion [[John Cena]]. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE, while Ventura never did during his WWE career. After that, Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs (2009)|TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs]].

I didn't mean all religious people. I don't have any problem with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the [[Founding Fathers]] built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the fundamentalist fanatics are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn't accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That's what I find weak and destructive.<ref name=Principles/>}}\n\nHowever, in April 2011, Ventura said on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' that he is an [[atheist]] and believes that his beliefs could disqualify him for office in the future, arguing that, \"I don't believe you can be an atheist and admit it and get elected in our country.\"<ref name=\"The Howard Stern Show\">{{Cite episode |series=Howard Stern Show|title=[[The Howard Stern Show]] |network=[[Sirius XM Radio]] |airdate=April 5, 2011 |minutes=143 |quote=Actually Howard, I can't even run for office anymore.
