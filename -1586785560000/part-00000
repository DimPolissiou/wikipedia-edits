[[Refrigeration]] is an essential [[Food preservation|food storage technique]] in developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of [[bacteria]], so the refrigerator reduces the rate of [[Food spoilage|spoilage]].

''BBC''. 30 April 2008</ref> A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a '''freezer'''. The refrigerator replaced the [[icebox]], which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half.\n\nThe first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.\n\nFreezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most [https://womenperfectsolution.com/best-refrigerator-in-india-2020/ household refrigerators], refrigerator\u2013freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include [[Auto-defrost|automatic defrosting]], chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door.\n\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Technology development===\n{{See also|Refrigeration|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n\nBefore the invention of the refrigerator, [[Icehouse (building)|icehouses]] were used to provide cool storage for most of the year. Placed near freshwater lakes or packed with snow and ice during the winter, they were once very common. Natural means are still used to cool foods today. On mountainsides, runoff from melting snow is a convenient way to cool drinks, and during the winter one can keep milk fresh much longer just by keeping it outdoors. The word \"refrigeratory\" was used at least as early as the 17th century<ref>Venetum Britannicum, 1676, London, p. 176 in the 1678 edition.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n   | width     = 140\n   | direction = vertical\n   | image_style = border:0\n   | image1    = Gorrie Ice Machine.png\n   | alt1      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption1  = Schematic of Dr. John Gorrie's 1841 mechanical ice machine\n   | image2    = AppareilCarr\u00e9.jpg\n   | alt2      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption2  = [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]]'s ice-making device\n  }}\nThe history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor [[William Cullen]] designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump to create a partial [[vacuum]] over a container of [[diethyl ether]], which then [[boiling point|boiled]], absorbing [[heat of vaporization|heat]] from the surrounding air.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arora|first=Ramesh Chandra|title=Refrigeration and Air Conditioning|publisher=PHI Learning|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=81-203-3915-0|page=3|chapter=Mechanical vapour compression refrigeration}}</ref> The experiment even created a small amount of ice, but had no practical application at that time.\n\nIn 1805, American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] described a closed [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum. In 1820, the British scientist [[Michael Faraday]] liquefied [[ammonia]] and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate in Great Britain, [[Jacob Perkins]], built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system. It was a closed-cycle device that could operate continuously.<ref name=burstall>{{cite book |last = Burstall |first = Aubrey F. |year = 1965 |title = A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher = The MIT Press |isbn = 0-262-52001-X}}</ref> A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],<ref>{{US patent|8080}}</ref> who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.\n\nThe first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a Scottish Australian. His 1856 patent was for a vapor compression system using ether, alcohol or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapor-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation.\n\nThe first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as \"aqua ammonia\") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. [[Carl von Linde]], an engineering professor at the Technological University Munich in Germany, patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876. His new process made possible the use of gases such as [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[methyl chloride]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.\n\n{{Clear}}\n=== Commercial refrigerators ===\nCommercial refrigerator and freezer units, which go by many other names, were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. They used gas systems such as [[ammonia]] (R-717) or [[sulfur dioxide]] (R-764), which occasionally leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic [[refrigerant]]s such as [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|Freon-12]] (R-12) were introduced.  However, R-12 damaged the [[ozone layer]], causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.\n\nA common commercial refrigerator is the glass fronted beverage cooler. These type of appliances are typically designed for specific re-load conditions meaning that they generally have a larger cooling system. This ensures that they are able to cope with a large throughput of drinks and frequent door opening.  As a result, it is common for these types of commercial refrigerators to have energy consumption of >4 kWh/day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chest Freezer Reviews|url=http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912012151/http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|archivedate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic refrigerators===\nIn 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by [[Fred W.

Wales]] of Detroit, Michigan, introduced an idea for a practical electric refrigeration unit, which later became the basis for the [[Kelvinator]]. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by [[Alfred Mellowes]] in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by [[William C. Durant]] in 1918, who started the [[Frigidaire]] company to [[Mass production|mass-produce]] refrigerators. In 1918, Kelvinator company introduced the first refrigerator with any type of automatic control. The [[absorption refrigerator]] was invented by [[Baltzar von Platen (inventor)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]] from [[Sweden]] in 1922, while they were still students at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm. It became a worldwide success and was commercialized by [[Electrolux]]. Other pioneers included [[Charles Tellier]], [[David Boyle (inventor)|David Boyle]], and [[Raoul Pictet]]. [[Carl von Linde]] was the first to patent and make a practical and compact refrigerator.\n\nThese home units usually required the installation of the mechanical parts, motor and compressor, in the basement or an adjacent room while the cold box was located in the kitchen. There was a 1922 model that consisted of a wooden cold box, [[Watercooling|water-cooled]] compressor, an [[ice cube]] tray and a {{convert|9|cuft|adj=on}} compartment, and cost $714. (A 1922 [[Model-T]] Ford cost about $450.) By 1923, Kelvinator held 80 percent of the market for electric refrigerators. Also in 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. About this same time porcelain-covered metal cabinets began to appear. Ice cube trays were introduced more and more during the 1920s; up to this time freezing was not an auxiliary function of the modern refrigerator.\n\n[[File:Monitor refer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator, introduced in 1927, priced at $525, with the first all-steel cabinet, designed by Christian Steenstrup.

Over a million units were produced. As the refrigerating medium, these refrigerators used either [[sulfur dioxide]], which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or [[methyl formate]], which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and toxic if inhaled or ingested. Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all. These cooling systems cannot legally be recharged with the hazardous original refrigerants if they leak or break down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiqueappliances.com/monitor-tops/|title=Monitor Tops}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://refresearch.com/the-general-electric-monitor-top-refrigerator/|title=The General Electric Monitor Top Refrigerator|first=Neil|last=Lobocki|date=4 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.albanyinstitute.org/ge-monitor-top-refrigerator.html|title=GE Monitor-Top Refrigerator - Albany Institute of History and Art|website=www.albanyinstitute.org}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s and provided a safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants.  Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at the time for the unit was a ''deep freeze''. These devices, or ''appliances'', did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.history.com/exhibits/modern/fridge.html| url-status = dead | title = The History of Household Wonders: History of the Refrigerator | year = 2006 | work = [[History (U.S. TV network)|History.com]] | publisher = A&E Television Networks | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326092256/http://www.history.com/exhibits/modern/fridge.html | archive-date = 26 March 2008}}</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like automatic [[defrost]]ing and automatic ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though [[Ozone depletion|environmental issues]] led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the [[Post Foods|Postum Company]] (the forerunner of [[General Foods]]), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to [[Clarence Birdseye]]'s successful fresh freezing methods.\n\n== Styles of refrigerators ==\nIn the early 1950s most refrigerators were white, but from the mid-1950s through present day designers and manufacturers put color onto refrigerators. In the late-1950s/early-1960s, pastel colors like turquoise and pink became popular, and brushed chrome-plating (similar to stainless finish) was available on some models. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, [[earth tone]] colors were popular, including [[Gold (color)|Harvest Gold]], [[Green|Avocado Green]] and almond. In the 1980s, black became fashionable. In the late 1990s [[stainless steel]] came into vogue, and in 2009, one manufacturer introduced multi-color designs. Since 1961 the [[Color Marketing Group]] has attempted to coordinate the colors of appliances and other consumer goods.\n\nRefigerators can also be classified according to the number and arrangement of their doors:\n\n*One Door: the freezer and refrigerator compartment are behind the same door and in the same common compartment. The freezer is on the top part of the common compartment and may have an uninsulated and transparent plastic door covering it. The freezer compartment is formed by a sheet of metal or plastic that has been bent to form a floor and side walls, which is then fastened to the ceiling of the common compartment. The sheet has internal cavities and passageways, making it the evaporator of the refigerator.\nThere are also one door refrigerators that don't have a freezer compartment; these are available for both commercial and residential settings, and some can be switched between freezer and refrigerator mode.  \n\n*Conventional: the freezer compartment is above the refrigerator compartment, and are separated by a layer of insulation and have separate doors that can be opened independently from each other. A variation inverts this order, placing the freezer compartment below the refigerator compartment. In this variation, the freezer compartment may not have door shelves and may have several internal compartments, or a drawer may be used instead of a door for the freezer compartment. The freezer is always smaller than the refrigerator compartment.\n\n* Side by Side: once mainstream, this arrangement places the freezer and refigerator compartments side by side. Again, the freezer and refigerator are separated by insulation. The freezer is narrower than the refigerator and they may even use different lighting systems; freezer compartments tend to use incandescent lighting while refrigerator compartments may use fluorescent lighting instead, although both have been replaced with LED lighting in modern refrigerators. \n\n*French door: these have largely replaced side by side refrigerators in domestic settings. The refrigerator is above the freezer. The refigerator has a [[french door]] while the freezer is usually a drawer. Some models have 2 drawers, and some use french doors for both the freezer and refigerator. If it has 2 drawers, the upper drawer is often refigerated (it is not a freezer) and its temperature may be precisely controlled. \n\n*Multi door or six door: mainly made by Japanese companies like Hitachi, Panasonic and Mitsubishi Electric. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitachi-hk.com.hk/en/products/index_id_1180.html|title=Home Appliances - Refrigerator - Multi-Door|website=www.hitachi-hk.com.hk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.panasonic.com/my/consumer/home-appliances/refrigerator/multi-door.html|title=Multi Door Refrigerator &#124; Panasonic Malaysia|website=www.panasonic.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://panasonic.jp/reizo/|title=\u51b7\u8535\u5eab &#124; Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mitsubishielectric.com.sg/products/refrigerators/folio-series|title=Folio Series &#124; Mitsubishi Electric Asia|website=www.mitsubishielectric.com.sg}}</ref> These use a french door for the refrigerator compartment, which is at the top, and below are 4 drawers, organized in 3 levels.

On the second level is a freezer, and on the third level is a refrigerated vegetable compartment. The drawers may have 2 or 3 internal drawers or baskets that sit on top of each other and can be moved towards the back of the freezer while the drawer is open.

In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[R134a]] enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the ''condenser''; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as ''auto-refrigeration''. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment (\"box air\") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.\n\nModern domestic refrigerators are extremely reliable because motor and compressor are integrated within a welded container, \"sealed unit\", with greatly reduced likelihood of leakage or contamination.  By comparison, externally-coupled refrigeration compressors, such as those in automobile air conditioning, inevitably leak fluid and lubricant past the shaft seals.  This leads to a requirement for periodic recharging and, if ignored, possible compressor failure.\n\n===Absorption refrigerators===\nAn [[absorption refrigerator]] works differently from a compressor refrigerator, using a source of [[heat]], such as [[combustion]] of [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[solar thermal energy]] or an electric heating element. These heat sources are much quieter than the compressor motor in a typical refrigerator. A fan or pump might be the only mechanical moving parts; reliance on convection is considered impractical.\n\nOther uses of an absorption refrigerator (or \"chiller\") include large systems used in office buildings or complexes such as hospitals and universities. These large systems are used to chill a brine solution that is circulated through the building.\n\n===Peltier effect refrigerators===\nThe [[Peltier effect]] uses electricity to pump heat directly; refrigerators employing this system are sometimes used for camping, or in situations where noise is not acceptable. They can be totally silent (if a fan for air circulation is not fitted) but are less energy-efficient than other methods.\n\n===Dual compressor refrigerators===\nA few manufacturers offer dual compressor models.  These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted within a single cabinet.  Each has its own separate compressor, condenser and evaporator coils, insulation, thermostat, and door.  Typically, the compressors and condenser coils are mounted at the top of the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both.\n\n===Ultra-low temperature refrigerators===\n\"Ultra-cold\" or \"[[ULT freezer|ultra-low temperature (ULT)]]\" (typically \u221280{{nbsp}}C) freezers, as used for storing biological samples, also generally employ two stages of cooling, but in cascade. The lower temperature stage uses [[methane]], or a similar gas, as a refrigerant, with its condenser kept at around \u221240{{nbsp}}C by a second stage which uses a more conventional refrigerant. Well known brands include Forma and Revco (both now Thermo Scientific) and Thermoline. For much lower temperatures (around \u2212196{{nbsp}}C), laboratories usually purchase [[liquid nitrogen]], kept in a [[Dewar flask]], into which the samples are suspended. Some cryogenic ULT freezers can sustain temperatures down to -152\u00b0C using just a [[cascade refrigeration]] system. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phchd.com/global/biomedical/preservation/ultra-low-freezers|title=Ultra Low Temperature Freezers (Lab Freezer) &#124; PHCbi|first=P.

Most refrigerator-freezers\u2014except for manual defrost models or cheaper units\u2014use what appears to be two thermostats. Only the refrigerator compartment is properly temperature controlled. When the refrigerator gets too warm, the thermostat starts the cooling process and a fan circulates the air around the freezer. During this time, the refrigerator also gets colder. The freezer control knob only controls the amount of air that flows into the refrigerator via a damper system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060705170456/http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000661.htm Refrigerator \u2013 Adjusting Temperature Controls]. geappliances.com</ref> Changing the refrigerator temperature will inadvertently change the freezer temperature in the opposite direction. Changing the freezer temperature will have no effect on the refrigerator temperature. The freezer control may also be adjusted to compensate for any refrigerator adjustment.\n\nThis means the refrigerator may become too warm. However, because only enough air is diverted to the refrigerator compartment, the freezer usually re-acquires the set temperature quickly, unless the door is opened. When a door is opened, either in the refrigerator or the freezer, the fan in some units stops immediately to prevent excessive frost build up on the freezer's evaporator coil, because this coil is cooling two areas. When the freezer reaches temperature, the unit cycles off, no matter what the refrigerator temperature is. Modern computerized refrigerators do not use the damper system. The computer manages fan speed for both compartments, although air is still blown from the freezer.\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Fridgeinterior.jpg|thumb|200px|The inside of a home refrigerator containing a large variety of everyday food items.]]\n\nNewer refrigerators may include:\n*[[Auto-defrost|Automatic defrosting]]\n*A power failure warning that alerts the user by flashing a temperature display. It may display the maximum temperature reached during the power failure, and whether frozen food has defrosted or may contain harmful bacteria.\n*Chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door. Water and ice dispensing became available in the 1970s. In some refrigerators, the process of making ice is built-in so the user doesn't have to manually use ice trays. Some refrigerators have water chillers and water filtration systems.\n*Cabinet rollers that lets the refrigerator roll out for easier cleaning\n*Adjustable shelves and trays\n*A status indicator that notifies when it is time to change the [[Filter (water)|water filter]]\n*An in-door ice caddy, which relocates the ice-maker storage to the freezer door and saves approximately 60 litres (2&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) of usable freezer space. It is also removable, and helps to prevent ice-maker clogging.\n*A cooling zone in the refrigerator door shelves. Air from the freezer section is diverted to the refrigerator door, to cool milk or juice stored in the door shelf.\n*A drop down door built into the refrigerator main door, giving easy access to frequently used items such as milk, thus saving energy by not having to open the main door.\n*A Fast Freeze function to rapidly cool foods by running the compressor for a predetermined amount of time and thus temporarily lowering the freezer temperature below normal operating levels. It is recommended to use this feature several hours before adding more than 1&nbsp;kg of unfrozen food to the freezer. For freezers without this feature, lowering the temperature setting to the coldest will have the same effect.\n\n* Freezer Defrost: Early freezer units accumulated [[ice crystals]] around the freezing units. This was a result of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing (\"defrosting\") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for a short amount of time to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.\nThese older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, which is suitable for keeping food for a week.\n\n* Butter heater: In the early 1950s, the butter conditioner's patent was filed and published by the inventor Nave Alfred E. This feature was supposed to \"provide a new and improved food storage receptacle for storing butter or the like which may quickly and easily be removed from the refrigerator cabinet for the purpose of cleaning.\"<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 Butter Conditioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026070427/https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 |date=26 October 2016 }}. Google Patents.</ref><ref>{{US patent|2579848}}</ref> Because of the high interest to the invention, companies in UK, New Zealand, and Australia started to include the feature into the mass fridge production and soon it became a symbol of the local culture. However, not long after that it was removed from production as according to the companies this was the only way for them to meet new ecology regulations and they found it inefficient to have a heat generating device inside a fridge.\n\nLater advances included automatic ice units and self compartmentalized freezing units.\n\n== Types of domestic refrigerators ==\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4&nbsp;L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Some models for small [[household]]s fit under kitchen work surfaces, usually about 86&nbsp;cm high. Refrigerators may be combined with freezers, either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above, below, or side by side. A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes. Freezers may have drawers to store food in, or they may have no divisions (chest freezers).\n\nRefrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen.\n\nThree distinct classes of refrigerator are common:\n===Compressor refrigerators===\n*Compressor refrigerators are by far the most common type; they make a noticeable noise, but are most efficient and give greatest cooling effect. Portable compressor refrigerators for [[recreational vehicle]] (RV) and camping use are expensive but effective and reliable. Refrigeration units for commercial and industrial applications can be made in various sizes, shapes and styles to fit customer needs. Commercial and industrial refrigerators may have their compressors located away from the cabinet (similar to [[Air conditioning#Split systems|split system air conditioners]]) to reduce noise nuisance and reduce the load on air conditioning in hot weather.\n===Absorption refrigerator===\n*[[Absorption refrigerator]]s may be used in caravans and trailers, and dwellings lacking electricity, such as farms or rural cabins, where they have a long history. They may be powered by any heat source: gas (natural or propane) or kerosene being common. Models made for camping and RV use often have the option of running (inefficiently) on 12 volt battery power.\n\n===Solar refrigerator===\n**[[Solar refrigerator]]s and [[Thermal mass refrigerator]]s are designed to reduce electrical consumption. Solar refrigerators have the added advantage that they do not use refrigerants that are harmful to the environment or flammable. Typical solar designs are [[absorption refrigerator]]s that use ammonia as the working gas, and employ large mirrors to concentrate sufficient sunlight to reach the temperature required to free gaseous ammonia from the solvent.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210202228/http://blog.thegreenv.com/?p=191 The Green V.

News.cnet.com.</ref> Most thermal mass refrigerators are designed to use electricity intermittently. As these units are heavily insulated, cooling load is limited primarily to heat introduced by new items to be refrigerated, and ambient air transfer when the unit is open. Very little power is therefore required if opened infrequently.\n\n===Peltier refrigerators===\n*[[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier refrigerators]] are powered by electricity, usually 12 volt DC, but mains-powered wine coolers are available. Peltier refrigerators are inexpensive but inefficient and become progressively more inefficient with increased cooling effect; much of this inefficiency may be related to the temperature differential across the short distance between the \"hot\" and \"cold\" sides of the [[Peltier cell]]. Peltier refrigerators generally use heat sinks and fans to lower this differential; the only noise produced comes from the fan. Reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to the Peltier cells results in a heating rather than cooling effect.\n\nOther specialized cooling mechanisms may be used for cooling, but have not been applied to domestic or commercial refrigerators.\n\n===Magnetic refrigerator===\n*[[Magnetic refrigeration|Magnetic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that work on the magnetocaloric effect. The cooling effect is triggered by placing a metal alloy in a magnetic field.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html \"Towards the magnetic fridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207135221/http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html |date=7 December 2008 }}. ''Physorg''. 21 April 2006</ref>\n*[[Acoustic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that use resonant linear reciprocating motors/alternators to generate a sound that is converted to heat and cold using compressed helium gas. The heat is discarded and the cold is routed to the refrigerator.\n\n== Energy efficiency ==\n[[File:Energy label 2010.svg|thumb|A European energy label for a fridge.]]\n\nIn a house without air-conditioning (space heating and/or cooling) refrigerators consumed more energy than any other home device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Which UK \u2013 Saving Energy|url=http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|work=Which UK|accessdate=10 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110161250/http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|archivedate=10 November 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s a competition was held among the major manufacturers to encourage energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Feist, J.

Humboldt.edu</ref> But even ordinary units are quite efficient; some smaller units use less than 0.2 kWh per day (equivalent to 8 W continuously).\nLarger units, especially those with large freezers and icemakers, may use as much as 4&nbsp;kW\u00b7h per day (equivalent to 170 W continuously).\nThe European Union uses a letter-based mandatory [[European Union energy label|energy efficiency rating label]] instead of the Energy Star; thus EU refrigerators at the point of sale are labelled according to how energy-efficient they are.\n\nFor US refrigerators, the [[Consortium on Energy Efficiency]] (CEE) further differentiates between Energy Star qualified refrigerators. Tier 1 refrigerators are those that are 20% to 24.9% more efficient than the Federal minimum standards set by the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] (NAECA). Tier 2 are those that are 25% to 29.9% more efficient.

Although these designs generally use a much larger amount of energy compared to compressor refrigeration, other qualities such as silent operation or the ability to use gas can favor these refrigeration units in small enclosures, a mobile environment or in environments where unit failure would lead to devastating consequences.\n\nMany refrigerators made in the 1930s and 1940s were far more efficient than most that were made later. This is partly attributable to the addition of new features, such as auto-defrost, that reduced efficiency. Additionally, after World War 2, refrigerator style became more important than efficiency. This was especially true in the US in the 1970s, when side-by-side models (known as American fridgefreezers outside of the US) with ice dispensers and water chillers became popular. However, the reduction in efficiency also arose partly from reduction in the amount of insulation to cut costs.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:ExpensiveRefrigerators.JPG|thumb|260px|Display of modern American-style / side-by-side refrigerators, available for purchase in a store]]\nBecause of the introduction of new energy efficiency standards, refrigerators made today are much more efficient than those made in the 1930s; they consume the same amount of energy while being three times as large.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Successes of Energy Efficiency: The United States and California National Trust | url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225075006/http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | archivedate=25 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news  |title=Out With the Old, In With the New  |url=http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |author1=Calwell, Chris  |author2=Reeder, Travis  |lastauthoramp=yes  |year=2001  |work=Natural Resources Defense Council  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608090449/http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |archivedate=8 June 2011    }}</ref>\n\nThe efficiency of older refrigerators can be improved by defrosting (if the unit is manual defrost) and cleaning them regularly, replacing old and worn door seals with new ones, adjusting the thermostat to accommodate the actual contents (a refrigerator needn't be colder than {{convert|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to store drinks and non-perishable items) and also replacing insulation, where applicable. Some sites recommend cleaning condenser coils every month or so on units with coils on the rear, to add life to the coils and not suffer an unnoticeable deterioration in efficiency over an extended period, the unit should be able to ventilate or \"breathe\" with adequate spaces around the front, back, sides and above the unit. If the refrigerator uses a fan to keep the condenser cool, then this must be cleaned or seviced, at per individual manufactures recommendations.\n\nFrost-free refrigerators or freezers use electric fans to cool the appropriate compartment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bvxCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21|title=Low Temperature and Cryogenic Refrigeration|last=Kaka\u00e7|first=Sadik|last2=Avelino|first2=M.

The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer's evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a defrost cycle is controlled via a mechanical timer. This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIf the defrosting system melts all the ice before the timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) acts like a thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends a signal to the defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFrost-free refrigerators, including some early frost free refrigerator/freezers that used a cold plate in their refrigerator section instead of airflow from the freezer section, generally don't shut off their refrigerator fans during defrosting. This allows consumers to leave food in the main refrigerator compartment uncovered, and also helps keep vegetables moist. This method also helps reduce energy consumption, because the refrigerator is above freeze point and can pass the warmer-than-freezing air through the evaporator or cold plate to aid the defrosting cycle.\n\nWith the advent of digital [[inverter compressor]]s, the energy consumption is even further reduced than a single-speed induction motor compressor, and thus contributes far less in the way of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/how-the-digital-inverter-compressor-has-transformed-the-modern-refrigerator|title=How the Digital Inverter Compressor Has Transformed the Modern Refrigerator|website=news.samsung.com|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Regular Refrigerators vs Inverter Refrigerators ===\n\nThe energy consumption of a refrigerator is also dependent on the type of refrigeration being done. For instance, Inverter Refrigerators consume comparatively lesser energy than a typical non-inverter refrigerator. \n\nIn an inverter refrigerator, the compressor is used conditionally on requirement basis. For instance, an inverter refrigerator might use less energy during the winters than it does during the summers. This is because the compressor works for very less duration than it does during the summers.\n\n== Effect on lifestyle ==\nThe refrigerator allows the modern family to keep food fresh for longer than before. The most notable improvement is for meat and other highly perishable wares, which needed to be refined to gain anything resembling shelf life. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} (On the other hand, refrigerators and freezers can also be stocked with processed, quick-cook foods that are less healthy.) Refrigeration in transit makes it possible to enjoy food from distant places.\n\nDairy products, meats, fish, poultry and vegetables can be kept refrigerated in the same space within the kitchen (although raw meat should be kept separate from other food for reasons of [[hygiene]]).\n\nFreezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]]. Ice cream, a popular commodity of the 20th century, could previously only be obtained by traveling to where the product was made and eating it on the spot. Now it is a common food item. Ice on demand not only adds to the enjoyment of cold drinks, but is useful for first-aid, and for cold packs that can be kept frozen for picnics or in case of emergency.\n\n== Temperature zones and ratings ==\n===Residential units===\n\nThe capacity of a refrigerator is measured in either liters or cubic feet. Typically the volume of a combined refrigerator-freezer is split with 1/3rds to 1/4th of the volume allocated to the freezer although these values are highly variable.\n\nTemperature settings for refrigerator and freezer compartments are often given arbitrary numbers by manufacturers (for example, 1 through 9, warmest to coldest), but generally {{convert|3 |to|5|C|F}}<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> is ideal for the refrigerator compartment and {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} for the freezer. Some refrigerators must be within certain external temperature parameters to run properly. This can be an issue when placing units in an unfinished area, such as a garage. \n\nSome refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food:\n*{{Convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (freezer)\n*{{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (meat zone)\n*{{Convert|5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (cooling zone)\n*{{Convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[crisper drawer|crisper]])\n\n[[Europe]]an freezers, and refrigerators with a freezer compartment, have a four [[Star (classification)| star rating system]] to grade freezers. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n* [\u2217]     : min temperature = {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 week\n* [\u2217\u2217]    : min temperature = {{convert|-12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 month\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217]   : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is between 3 and 12 months \n::::depending on type (meat, vegetables, fish, etc.)\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217] : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for pre-frozen or frozen-from-fresh food is between 3 and 12 months\n\nAlthough both the three and four star ratings specify the same storage times and same minimum temperature of {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, only a four star freezer is intended for freezing fresh food, and may include a \"fast freeze\" function (runs the compressor continually, down to as low as {{convert|-26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}) to facilitate this. Three (or fewer) stars are used for frozen food compartments that are only suitable for storing frozen food; introducing fresh food into such a compartment is likely to result in unacceptable temperature rises.

Modern refrigerators usually use a refrigerant called HFC-134a ([[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane]]), which does not deplete the ozone layer, instead of Freon. A R-134a is now becoming very uncommon in Europe. Newer refrigerants are being used instead. The main refrigerant now used is R-600a, or [[isobutane]] which has a smaller effect on the atmosphere if released. There have been reports of refrigerators exploding if the refrigerant leaks isobutane in the presence of a spark.  If the coolant leaks into the fridge, at times when the door is not being opened (such as overnight) the concentration of coolant in the air within the fridge can build up to form an explosive mixture that can be ignited either by a spark from the thermostat or when the light comes on as the door is opened, resulting in documented cases of serious property damage and injury or even death from the resulting explosion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |title=Homeowner left with serious cuts and bruises after fridge-freezer exploded in his kitchen says he only survived because he was kneeling down |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206084025/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |archivedate=6 February 2016  }} [[Daily Mail]] February 2016</ref><ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805221722/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |archivedate=5 August 2017  }} [[Daily Mirror]] November 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225213551/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |archivedate=25 February 2017  }} [[Daily Mail]] September 2009</ref>\n\nDisposal of discarded refrigerators is regulated, often mandating the removal of doors for safety reasons.

The refrigerator was then refurbished, with new door seals, a thorough cleaning and the removal of items, such as the cover that is strapped to the back of many older units. The resulting refrigerators, now over 10% more efficient, were then distributed to low income families.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>\nFile:Commercial Refrigerator Advertisement 1905.jpg|thumb|left|McCray pre-electric home refrigerator ad from 1905; this company, founded in 1887, is still in business\nFile:Antique refrigerator - Hemingway House.jpg|thumb|A 1930s era General Electric \"Globe Top\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiqueappliances.com/monitor-tops/ | work = Antique Appliances |title=Monitor Tops|accessdate=2020-01-25}}</ref> refrigerator in the [[Ernest Hemingway House]]\nFile:MonitorTopFridgeHarvard.jpg|thumb|upright|General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator, still in use, June 2007\nFile:1963 Frigidaire Imperial refrigerator.jpg|thumb|Frigidaire Imperial \"Frost Proof\" model FPI-16BC-63, top refrigerator/bottom freezer with brushed chrome door finish made by [[Frigidaire|General Motors]] Canada in 1963\nFile:LG refrigerator interior.jpg|thumb|A side-by-side refrigerator-freezer with an [[icemaker]] (2011)\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Theater commercial, electric refrigerator, 1926.ogv|left|thumb|Commercial for electric refrigerators in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], 1926]]\n{{PanoViewer|Inside a refrigerator \u2013 360\u00b0 Photo.jpg|Inside a regular family refrigerator \u2013 360\u00b0 photo}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cold chain]]\n* [[Continuous freezers]]\n* [[Ice cream maker]]\n* [[Ice famine]]\n* [[Internet refrigerator]]\n* [[List of home appliances]]\n* [[Pot-in-pot refrigerator]]\n* [[Refrigerator death]]\n* [[Refrigerator magnet]]\n* [[Solar-powered refrigerator]]\n* [[Star (classification)|Star rating]]\n* [[Kimchi refrigerator]]\n* [[Wine cellar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Rees, Jonathan.

''BBC''. 30 April 2008</ref> A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a '''freezer'''. The refrigerator replaced the [[icebox]], which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half.\n\nThe first cooling systems for food involved ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.\n\nFreezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most [https://womenperfectsolution.com/best-refrigerator-in-india-2020/ household refrigerators], refrigerator\u2013freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include [[Auto-defrost|automatic defrosting]], chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door.\n\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Technology development===\n{{See also|Refrigeration|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n\nBefore the invention of the refrigerator, [[Icehouse (building)|icehouses]] were used to provide cool storage for most of the year. Placed near freshwater lakes or packed with snow and ice during the winter, they were once very common. Natural means are still used to cool foods today. On mountainsides, runoff from melting snow is a convenient way to cool drinks, and during the winter one can keep milk fresh much longer just by keeping it outdoors. The word \"refrigeratory\" was used at least as early as the 17th century<ref>Venetum Britannicum, 1676, London, p. 176 in the 1678 edition.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n   | width     = 140\n   | direction = vertical\n   | image_style = border:0\n   | image1    = Gorrie Ice Machine.png\n   | alt1      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption1  = Schematic of Dr. John Gorrie's 1841 mechanical ice machine\n   | image2    = AppareilCarr\u00e9.jpg\n   | alt2      = Mechanical drawing\n   | caption2  = [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]]'s ice-making device\n  }}\nThe history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor [[William Cullen]] designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755.

In 1820, the British scientist [[Michael Faraday]] liquefied [[ammonia]] and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate in Great Britain, [[Jacob Perkins]], built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system. It was a closed-cycle device that could operate continuously.<ref name=burstall>{{cite book |last = Burstall |first = Aubrey F. |year = 1965 |title = A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher = The MIT Press |isbn = 0-262-52001-X}}</ref> A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],<ref>{{US patent|8080}}</ref> who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.\n\nThe first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a Scottish Australian. His 1856 patent was for a vapor compression system using ether, alcohol or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapor-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation.\n\nThe first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as \"aqua ammonia\") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. [[Carl von Linde]], an engineering professor at the Technological University Munich in Germany, patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876. His new process made possible the use of gases such as [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[methyl chloride]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.\n\n{{Clear}}\n=== Commercial refrigerators ===\nCommercial refrigerator and freezer units, which go by many other names, were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. They used gas systems such as [[ammonia]] (R-717) or [[sulfur dioxide]] (R-764), which occasionally leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic [[refrigerant]]s such as [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|Freon-12]] (R-12) were introduced.  However, R-12 damaged the [[ozone layer]], causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.\n\nA common commercial refrigerator is the glass fronted beverage cooler. These type of appliances are typically designed for specific re-load conditions meaning that they generally have a larger cooling system. This ensures that they are able to cope with a large throughput of drinks and frequent door opening.  As a result, it is common for these types of commercial refrigerators to have energy consumption of >4 kWh/day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chest Freezer Reviews|url=http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912012151/http://groomandstyle.com/best-chest-freezer-review-top-5/|archivedate=12 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic refrigerators===\nIn 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by [[Fred W.

Wales]] of Detroit, Michigan, introduced an idea for a practical electric refrigeration unit, which later became the basis for the [[Kelvinator]]. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by [[Alfred Mellowes]] in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by [[William C. Durant]] in 1918, who started the [[Frigidaire]] company to [[Mass production|mass-produce]] refrigerators. In 1918, Kelvinator company introduced the first refrigerator with any type of automatic control. The [[absorption refrigerator]] was invented by [[Baltzar von Platen (inventor)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]] from [[Sweden]] in 1922, while they were still students at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm. It became a worldwide success and was commercialized by [[Electrolux]]. Other pioneers included [[Charles Tellier]], [[David Boyle (inventor)|David Boyle]], and [[Raoul Pictet]]. [[Carl von Linde]] was the first to patent and make a practical and compact refrigerator.\n\nThese home units usually required the installation of the mechanical parts, motor and compressor, in the basement or an adjacent room while the cold box was located in the kitchen. There was a 1922 model that consisted of a wooden cold box, [[Watercooling|water-cooled]] compressor, an [[ice cube]] tray and a {{convert|9|cuft|adj=on}} compartment, and cost $714. (A 1922 [[Model-T]] Ford cost about $450.) By 1923, Kelvinator held 80 percent of the market for electric refrigerators. Also in 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. About this same time porcelain-covered metal cabinets began to appear. Ice cube trays were introduced more and more during the 1920s; up to this time freezing was not an auxiliary function of the modern refrigerator.\n\n[[File:Monitor refer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|General Electric \"Monitor-Top\" refrigerator, introduced in 1927, priced at $525, with the first all-steel cabinet, designed by Christian Steenstrup.

Over a million units were produced. As the refrigerating medium, these refrigerators used either [[sulfur dioxide]], which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or [[methyl formate]], which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and toxic if inhaled or ingested. Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all. These cooling systems cannot legally be recharged with the hazardous original refrigerants if they leak or break down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiqueappliances.com/monitor-tops/|title=Monitor Tops}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://refresearch.com/the-general-electric-monitor-top-refrigerator/|title=The General Electric Monitor Top Refrigerator|first=Neil|last=Lobocki|date=4 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.albanyinstitute.org/ge-monitor-top-refrigerator.html|title=GE Monitor-Top Refrigerator - Albany Institute of History and Art|website=www.albanyinstitute.org}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of [[Freon]] in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s and provided a safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants.  Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at the time for the unit was a ''deep freeze''.

More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though [[Ozone depletion|environmental issues]] led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the [[Post Foods|Postum Company]] (the forerunner of [[General Foods]]), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to [[Clarence Birdseye]]'s successful fresh freezing methods.\n\n== Styles of refrigerators ==\nIn the early 1950s most refrigerators were white, but from the mid-1950s through present day designers and manufacturers put color onto refrigerators. In the late-1950s/early-1960s, pastel colors like turquoise and pink became popular, and brushed chrome-plating (similar to stainless finish) was available on some models. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, [[earth tone]] colors were popular, including [[Gold (color)|Harvest Gold]], [[Green|Avocado Green]] and almond. In the 1980s, black became fashionable. In the late 1990s [[stainless steel]] came into vogue, and in 2009, one manufacturer introduced multi-color designs. Since 1961 the [[Color Marketing Group]] has attempted to coordinate the colors of appliances and other consumer goods.\n\nRefigerators can also be classified according to the number and arrangement of their doors:\n\n*One Door: the freezer and refrigerator compartment are behind the same door and in the same common compartment. The freezer is on the top part of the common compartment and may have an uninsulated and transparent plastic door covering it. The freezer compartment is formed by a sheet of metal or plastic that has been bent to form a floor and side walls, which is then fastened to the ceiling of the common compartment. The sheet has internal cavities and passageways, making it the evaporator of the refigerator.\nThere are also one door refrigerators that don't have a freezer compartment; these are available for both commercial and residential settings, and some can be switched between freezer and refrigerator mode.  \n\n*Conventional: the freezer compartment is above the refrigerator compartment, and are separated by a layer of insulation and have separate doors that can be opened independently from each other. A variation inverts this order, placing the freezer compartment below the refigerator compartment. In this variation, the freezer compartment may not have door shelves and may have several internal compartments, or a drawer may be used instead of a door for the freezer compartment. The freezer is always smaller than the refrigerator compartment.\n\n* Side by Side: once mainstream, this arrangement places the freezer and refigerator compartments side by side. Again, the freezer and refigerator are separated by insulation. The freezer is narrower than the refigerator and they may even use different lighting systems; freezer compartments tend to use incandescent lighting while refrigerator compartments may use fluorescent lighting instead, although both have been replaced with LED lighting in modern refrigerators. \n\n*French door: these have largely replaced side by side refrigerators in domestic settings. The refrigerator is above the freezer. The refigerator has a [[french door]] while the freezer is usually a drawer. Some models have 2 drawers, and some use french doors for both the freezer and refigerator. If it has 2 drawers, the upper drawer is often refigerated (it is not a freezer) and its temperature may be precisely controlled. \n\n*Multi door or six door: mainly made by Japanese companies like Hitachi, Panasonic and Mitsubishi Electric. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitachi-hk.com.hk/en/products/index_id_1180.html|title=Home Appliances - Refrigerator - Multi-Door|website=www.hitachi-hk.com.hk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.panasonic.com/my/consumer/home-appliances/refrigerator/multi-door.html|title=Multi Door Refrigerator &#124; Panasonic Malaysia|website=www.panasonic.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://panasonic.jp/reizo/|title=\u51b7\u8535\u5eab &#124; Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mitsubishielectric.com.sg/products/refrigerators/folio-series|title=Folio Series &#124; Mitsubishi Electric Asia|website=www.mitsubishielectric.com.sg}}</ref> These use a french door for the refrigerator compartment, which is at the top, and below are 4 drawers, organized in 3 levels.

In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[R134a]] enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the ''condenser''; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as ''auto-refrigeration''. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment (\"box air\") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.\n\nModern domestic refrigerators are extremely reliable because motor and compressor are integrated within a welded container, \"sealed unit\", with greatly reduced likelihood of leakage or contamination.  By comparison, externally-coupled refrigeration compressors, such as those in automobile air conditioning, inevitably leak fluid and lubricant past the shaft seals.  This leads to a requirement for periodic recharging and, if ignored, possible compressor failure.\n\n===Absorption refrigerators===\nAn [[absorption refrigerator]] works differently from a compressor refrigerator, using a source of [[heat]], such as [[combustion]] of [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[solar thermal energy]] or an electric heating element. These heat sources are much quieter than the compressor motor in a typical refrigerator. A fan or pump might be the only mechanical moving parts; reliance on convection is considered impractical.\n\nOther uses of an absorption refrigerator (or \"chiller\") include large systems used in office buildings or complexes such as hospitals and universities. These large systems are used to chill a brine solution that is circulated through the building.\n\n===Peltier effect refrigerators===\nThe [[Peltier effect]] uses electricity to pump heat directly; refrigerators employing this system are sometimes used for camping, or in situations where noise is not acceptable. They can be totally silent (if a fan for air circulation is not fitted) but are less energy-efficient than other methods.\n\n===Dual compressor refrigerators===\nA few manufacturers offer dual compressor models.  These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted within a single cabinet.  Each has its own separate compressor, condenser and evaporator coils, insulation, thermostat, and door.  Typically, the compressors and condenser coils are mounted at the top of the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both.\n\n===Ultra-low temperature refrigerators===\n\"Ultra-cold\" or \"[[ULT freezer|ultra-low temperature (ULT)]]\" (typically \u221280{{nbsp}}C) freezers, as used for storing biological samples, also generally employ two stages of cooling, but in cascade. The lower temperature stage uses [[methane]], or a similar gas, as a refrigerant, with its condenser kept at around \u221240{{nbsp}}C by a second stage which uses a more conventional refrigerant. Well known brands include Forma and Revco (both now Thermo Scientific) and Thermoline. For much lower temperatures (around \u2212196{{nbsp}}C), laboratories usually purchase [[liquid nitrogen]], kept in a [[Dewar flask]], into which the samples are suspended. Some cryogenic ULT freezers can sustain temperatures down to -152\u00b0C using just a [[cascade refrigeration]] system. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phchd.com/global/biomedical/preservation/ultra-low-freezers|title=Ultra Low Temperature Freezers (Lab Freezer) &#124; PHCbi|first=P.

Most refrigerator-freezers\u2014except for manual defrost models or cheaper units\u2014use what appears to be two thermostats. Only the refrigerator compartment is properly temperature controlled. When the refrigerator gets too warm, the thermostat starts the cooling process and a fan circulates the air around the freezer. During this time, the refrigerator also gets colder. The freezer control knob only controls the amount of air that flows into the refrigerator via a damper system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060705170456/http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000661.htm Refrigerator \u2013 Adjusting Temperature Controls]. geappliances.com</ref> Changing the refrigerator temperature will inadvertently change the freezer temperature in the opposite direction. Changing the freezer temperature will have no effect on the refrigerator temperature. The freezer control may also be adjusted to compensate for any refrigerator adjustment.\n\nThis means the refrigerator may become too warm. However, because only enough air is diverted to the refrigerator compartment, the freezer usually re-acquires the set temperature quickly, unless the door is opened. When a door is opened, either in the refrigerator or the freezer, the fan in some units stops immediately to prevent excessive frost build up on the freezer's evaporator coil, because this coil is cooling two areas. When the freezer reaches temperature, the unit cycles off, no matter what the refrigerator temperature is. Modern computerized refrigerators do not use the damper system. The computer manages fan speed for both compartments, although air is still blown from the freezer.\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Fridgeinterior.jpg|thumb|200px|The inside of a home refrigerator containing a large variety of everyday food items.]]\n\nNewer refrigerators may include:\n*[[Auto-defrost|Automatic defrosting]]\n*A power failure warning that alerts the user by flashing a temperature display. It may display the maximum temperature reached during the power failure, and whether frozen food has defrosted or may contain harmful bacteria.\n*Chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door. Water and ice dispensing became available in the 1970s. In some refrigerators, the process of making ice is built-in so the user doesn't have to manually use ice trays. Some refrigerators have water chillers and water filtration systems.\n*Cabinet rollers that lets the refrigerator roll out for easier cleaning\n*Adjustable shelves and trays\n*A status indicator that notifies when it is time to change the [[Filter (water)|water filter]]\n*An in-door ice caddy, which relocates the ice-maker storage to the freezer door and saves approximately 60 litres (2&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) of usable freezer space. It is also removable, and helps to prevent ice-maker clogging.\n*A cooling zone in the refrigerator door shelves. Air from the freezer section is diverted to the refrigerator door, to cool milk or juice stored in the door shelf.\n*A drop down door built into the refrigerator main door, giving easy access to frequently used items such as milk, thus saving energy by not having to open the main door.\n*A Fast Freeze function to rapidly cool foods by running the compressor for a predetermined amount of time and thus temporarily lowering the freezer temperature below normal operating levels. It is recommended to use this feature several hours before adding more than 1&nbsp;kg of unfrozen food to the freezer. For freezers without this feature, lowering the temperature setting to the coldest will have the same effect.\n\n* Freezer Defrost: Early freezer units accumulated [[ice crystals]] around the freezing units. This was a result of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing (\"defrosting\") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for a short amount of time to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.\nThese older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, which is suitable for keeping food for a week.\n\n* Butter heater: In the early 1950s, the butter conditioner's patent was filed and published by the inventor Nave Alfred E. This feature was supposed to \"provide a new and improved food storage receptacle for storing butter or the like which may quickly and easily be removed from the refrigerator cabinet for the purpose of cleaning.\"<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 Butter Conditioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026070427/https://www.google.com/patents/US2579848 |date=26 October 2016 }}. Google Patents.</ref><ref>{{US patent|2579848}}</ref> Because of the high interest to the invention, companies in UK, New Zealand, and Australia started to include the feature into the mass fridge production and soon it became a symbol of the local culture. However, not long after that it was removed from production as according to the companies this was the only way for them to meet new ecology regulations and they found it inefficient to have a heat generating device inside a fridge.\n\nLater advances included automatic ice units and self compartmentalized freezing units.\n\n== Types of domestic refrigerators ==\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4&nbsp;L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1&nbsp;m wide with a capacity of 600&nbsp;L. Some models for small [[household]]s fit under kitchen work surfaces, usually about 86&nbsp;cm high. Refrigerators may be combined with freezers, either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above, below, or side by side. A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes. Freezers may have drawers to store food in, or they may have no divisions (chest freezers).\n\nRefrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen.\n\nThree distinct classes of refrigerator are common:\n===Compressor refrigerators===\n*Compressor refrigerators are by far the most common type; they make a noticeable noise, but are most efficient and give greatest cooling effect. Portable compressor refrigerators for [[recreational vehicle]] (RV) and camping use are expensive but effective and reliable. Refrigeration units for commercial and industrial applications can be made in various sizes, shapes and styles to fit customer needs. Commercial and industrial refrigerators may have their compressors located away from the cabinet (similar to [[Air conditioning#Split systems|split system air conditioners]]) to reduce noise nuisance and reduce the load on air conditioning in hot weather.\n===Absorption refrigerator===\n*[[Absorption refrigerator]]s may be used in caravans and trailers, and dwellings lacking electricity, such as farms or rural cabins, where they have a long history. They may be powered by any heat source: gas (natural or propane) or kerosene being common. Models made for camping and RV use often have the option of running (inefficiently) on 12 volt battery power.\n\n===Solar refrigerator===\n**[[Solar refrigerator]]s and [[Thermal mass refrigerator]]s are designed to reduce electrical consumption. Solar refrigerators have the added advantage that they do not use refrigerants that are harmful to the environment or flammable. Typical solar designs are [[absorption refrigerator]]s that use ammonia as the working gas, and employ large mirrors to concentrate sufficient sunlight to reach the temperature required to free gaseous ammonia from the solvent.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210202228/http://blog.thegreenv.com/?p=191 The Green V.

News.cnet.com.</ref> Most thermal mass refrigerators are designed to use electricity intermittently. As these units are heavily insulated, cooling load is limited primarily to heat introduced by new items to be refrigerated, and ambient air transfer when the unit is open. Very little power is therefore required if opened infrequently.\n\n===Peltier refrigerators===\n*[[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier refrigerators]] are powered by electricity, usually 12 volt DC, but mains-powered wine coolers are available. Peltier refrigerators are inexpensive but inefficient and become progressively more inefficient with increased cooling effect; much of this inefficiency may be related to the temperature differential across the short distance between the \"hot\" and \"cold\" sides of the [[Peltier cell]]. Peltier refrigerators generally use heat sinks and fans to lower this differential; the only noise produced comes from the fan. Reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to the Peltier cells results in a heating rather than cooling effect.\n\nOther specialized cooling mechanisms may be used for cooling, but have not been applied to domestic or commercial refrigerators.\n\n===Magnetic refrigerator===\n*[[Magnetic refrigeration|Magnetic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that work on the magnetocaloric effect. The cooling effect is triggered by placing a metal alloy in a magnetic field.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html \"Towards the magnetic fridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207135221/http://www.physorg.com/news64851465.html |date=7 December 2008 }}. ''Physorg''. 21 April 2006</ref>\n*[[Acoustic refrigerator]]s are refrigerators that use resonant linear reciprocating motors/alternators to generate a sound that is converted to heat and cold using compressed helium gas. The heat is discarded and the cold is routed to the refrigerator.\n\n== Energy efficiency ==\n[[File:Energy label 2010.svg|thumb|A European energy label for a fridge.]]\n\nIn a house without air-conditioning (space heating and/or cooling) refrigerators consumed more energy than any other home device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Which UK \u2013 Saving Energy|url=http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|work=Which UK|accessdate=10 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110161250/http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels|archivedate=10 November 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s a competition was held among the major manufacturers to encourage energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Feist, J.

Although these designs generally use a much larger amount of energy compared to compressor refrigeration, other qualities such as silent operation or the ability to use gas can favor these refrigeration units in small enclosures, a mobile environment or in environments where unit failure would lead to devastating consequences.\n\nMany refrigerators made in the 1930s and 1940s were far more efficient than most that were made later. This is partly attributable to the addition of new features, such as auto-defrost, that reduced efficiency. Additionally, after World War 2, refrigerator style became more important than efficiency. This was especially true in the US in the 1970s, when side-by-side models (known as American fridgefreezers outside of the US) with ice dispensers and water chillers became popular. However, the reduction in efficiency also arose partly from reduction in the amount of insulation to cut costs.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:ExpensiveRefrigerators.JPG|thumb|260px|Display of modern American-style / side-by-side refrigerators, available for purchase in a store]]\nBecause of the introduction of new energy efficiency standards, refrigerators made today are much more efficient than those made in the 1930s; they consume the same amount of energy while being three times as large.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Successes of Energy Efficiency: The United States and California National Trust | url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225075006/http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-999-2007-023/CEC-999-2007-023.PDF | archivedate=25 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news  |title=Out With the Old, In With the New  |url=http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |author1=Calwell, Chris  |author2=Reeder, Travis  |lastauthoramp=yes  |year=2001  |work=Natural Resources Defense Council  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608090449/http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/appliance/app1.pdf  |archivedate=8 June 2011    }}</ref>\n\nThe efficiency of older refrigerators can be improved by defrosting (if the unit is manual defrost) and cleaning them regularly, replacing old and worn door seals with new ones, adjusting the thermostat to accommodate the actual contents (a refrigerator needn't be colder than {{convert|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to store drinks and non-perishable items) and also replacing insulation, where applicable. Some sites recommend cleaning condenser coils every month or so on units with coils on the rear, to add life to the coils and not suffer an unnoticeable deterioration in efficiency over an extended period, the unit should be able to ventilate or \"breathe\" with adequate spaces around the front, back, sides and above the unit. If the refrigerator uses a fan to keep the condenser cool, then this must be cleaned or seviced, at per individual manufactures recommendations.\n\nFrost-free refrigerators or freezers use electric fans to cool the appropriate compartment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bvxCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21|title=Low Temperature and Cryogenic Refrigeration|last=Kaka\u00e7|first=Sadik|last2=Avelino|first2=M.

The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer's evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a defrost cycle is controlled via a mechanical timer. This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIf the defrosting system melts all the ice before the timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) acts like a thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends a signal to the defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFrost-free refrigerators, including some early frost free refrigerator/freezers that used a cold plate in their refrigerator section instead of airflow from the freezer section, generally don't shut off their refrigerator fans during defrosting. This allows consumers to leave food in the main refrigerator compartment uncovered, and also helps keep vegetables moist. This method also helps reduce energy consumption, because the refrigerator is above freeze point and can pass the warmer-than-freezing air through the evaporator or cold plate to aid the defrosting cycle.\n\nWith the advent of digital [[inverter compressor]]s, the energy consumption is even further reduced than a single-speed induction motor compressor, and thus contributes far less in the way of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/how-the-digital-inverter-compressor-has-transformed-the-modern-refrigerator|title=How the Digital Inverter Compressor Has Transformed the Modern Refrigerator|website=news.samsung.com|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Regular Refrigerators vs Inverter Refrigerators ===\n\nThe energy consumption of a refrigerator is also dependent on the type of refrigeration being done. For instance, Inverter Refrigerators consume comparatively lesser energy than a typical non-inverter refrigerator. \n\nIn an inverter refrigerator, the compressor is used conditionally on requirement basis. For instance, an inverter refrigerator might use less energy during the winters than it does during the summers. This is because the compressor works for very less duration than it does during the summers.\n\n== Effect on lifestyle ==\nThe refrigerator allows the modern family to keep food fresh for longer than before. The most notable improvement is for meat and other highly perishable wares, which needed to be refined to gain anything resembling shelf life. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} (On the other hand, refrigerators and freezers can also be stocked with processed, quick-cook foods that are less healthy.) Refrigeration in transit makes it possible to enjoy food from distant places.\n\nDairy products, meats, fish, poultry and vegetables can be kept refrigerated in the same space within the kitchen (although raw meat should be kept separate from other food for reasons of [[hygiene]]).\n\nFreezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and [[economies of scale|bulk purchases save money]]. Ice cream, a popular commodity of the 20th century, could previously only be obtained by traveling to where the product was made and eating it on the spot. Now it is a common food item. Ice on demand not only adds to the enjoyment of cold drinks, but is useful for first-aid, and for cold packs that can be kept frozen for picnics or in case of emergency.\n\n== Temperature zones and ratings ==\n===Residential units===\n\nThe capacity of a refrigerator is measured in either liters or cubic feet. Typically the volume of a combined refrigerator-freezer is split with 1/3rds to 1/4th of the volume allocated to the freezer although these values are highly variable.\n\nTemperature settings for refrigerator and freezer compartments are often given arbitrary numbers by manufacturers (for example, 1 through 9, warmest to coldest), but generally {{convert|3 |to|5|C|F}}<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> is ideal for the refrigerator compartment and {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} for the freezer. Some refrigerators must be within certain external temperature parameters to run properly. This can be an issue when placing units in an unfinished area, such as a garage. \n\nSome refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food:\n*{{Convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (freezer)\n*{{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (meat zone)\n*{{Convert|5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (cooling zone)\n*{{Convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[crisper drawer|crisper]])\n\n[[Europe]]an freezers, and refrigerators with a freezer compartment, have a four [[Star (classification)| star rating system]] to grade freezers. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n* [\u2217]     : min temperature = {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 week\n* [\u2217\u2217]    : min temperature = {{convert|-12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is 1 month\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217]   : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for (pre-frozen) food is between 3 and 12 months \n::::depending on type (meat, vegetables, fish, etc.)\n* [\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217] : min temperature = {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. \n:::Maximum storage time for pre-frozen or frozen-from-fresh food is between 3 and 12 months\n\nAlthough both the three and four star ratings specify the same storage times and same minimum temperature of {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, only a four star freezer is intended for freezing fresh food, and may include a \"fast freeze\" function (runs the compressor continually, down to as low as {{convert|-26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}) to facilitate this. Three (or fewer) stars are used for frozen food compartments that are only suitable for storing frozen food; introducing fresh food into such a compartment is likely to result in unacceptable temperature rises. This difference in categorization is shown in the design of the 4-star logo, where the \"standard\" three stars are displayed in a box using \"positive\" colours, denoting the same normal operation as a 3-star freezer, and the fourth star showing the additional fresh food/fast freeze function is prefixed to the box in \"negative\" colours or with other distinct formatting. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nMost European refrigerators include a moist cold refrigerator section (which does require (automatic) defrosting at irregular intervals) and a (rarely frost free) freezer section.\n\n=== Commercial refrigeration temperatures ===\n(from warmest to coolest)<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=https://northeastcooling.com/category/commercial-refrigeration-maintenance-tips/\n |date=\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422134813/http://northeastcooling.com/category/commercial-refrigeration-maintenance-tips/page/5/\n |url-status = dead\n |archive-date=22 April 2017\n |access-date=25 January 2020\n |title=Commercial Refrigeration Maintenance Tips Archives - Page 5 of 5\n |website=Northeast Cooling\n }}\n</ref><!--\u25e6-->\n; Refrigerators : {{convert|35|to|38|F|C|0}}, and not greater than maximum refrigerator temperature at {{convert|41|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Reach-in : {{convert|-10|to|+5|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Walk-in : {{convert|-10|to|0|F|C|0}}\n; Freezer, Ice Cream : {{convert|-20|to|-10|F|C|0}}\n\n== Disposal ==\n[[File:Servel Electrolux Gas Refrigerator ad, 1941.jpg|thumb|1941 Ad for [[Servel]] [[Electrolux]] Gas Refrigerator ([[Absorption refrigerator|Absorption]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://refresearch.com/the-first-absorption-refrigerator/|title=The First Absorption Refrigerator|first=Neil|last=Lobocki|date=4 October 2017|accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref> designed by [[Norman Bel Geddes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiXuznGGhz8C&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=Norman+Bel+Geddes+%2295817%22&hl=en|title=\"95,817 DESIGN FOR A REFRIGERATOR CABINET Norman Bel Geddes, New York, and William I.

Modern refrigerators usually use a refrigerant called HFC-134a ([[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane]]), which does not deplete the ozone layer, instead of Freon. A R-134a is now becoming very uncommon in Europe. Newer refrigerants are being used instead. The main refrigerant now used is R-600a, or [[isobutane]] which has a smaller effect on the atmosphere if released. There have been reports of refrigerators exploding if the refrigerant leaks isobutane in the presence of a spark.  If the coolant leaks into the fridge, at times when the door is not being opened (such as overnight) the concentration of coolant in the air within the fridge can build up to form an explosive mixture that can be ignited either by a spark from the thermostat or when the light comes on as the door is opened, resulting in documented cases of serious property damage and injury or even death from the resulting explosion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |title=Homeowner left with serious cuts and bruises after fridge-freezer exploded in his kitchen says he only survived because he was kneeling down |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206084025/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432767/Homeowner-left-cuts-bruises-fridge-freezer-exploded-kitchen-says-survived-kneeling-down.html |archivedate=6 February 2016  }} [[Daily Mail]] February 2016</ref><ref> {{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805221722/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tragic-bride-killed-after-fridge-6817075 |archivedate=5 August 2017  }} [[Daily Mirror]] November 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225213551/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html |archivedate=25 February 2017  }} [[Daily Mail]] September 2009</ref>\n\nDisposal of discarded refrigerators is regulated, often mandating the removal of doors for safety reasons.

The [[internal energy]] of a system is always measured from a fixed reference state and is therefore always a [[state function]].  Some authors define the exergy of the system to be changed when the environment changes, in which case it is not a state function.

If the intensive properties of different finitely extended elements of a system differ, there is always the possibility to extract mechanical work from the system.<ref>{{cite book |last1=van Gool |first1=W. |last2=Bruggink |first2=J.J.C.

Exergy is also synonymous with: ''available energy'', ''exergic energy'', ''essergy'' (considered archaic), ''utilizable energy'', ''available useful work'', ''maximum (or minimum) work'', ''maximum (or minimum) work content'', ''[[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] work'', and ''ideal work''.\n\nThe exergy destruction of a cycle is the sum of the exergy destruction of the processes that compose that cycle. The exergy destruction of a cycle can also be determined without tracing the individual processes by considering the entire cycle as a single process and using one of the exergy destruction equations.\n\n==Mathematical description==\n\n===An application of the second law of thermodynamics===\n{{See also|Second law of thermodynamics}}\n\nExergy uses [[System (thermodynamics)|system boundaries]] in a way that is unfamiliar to many. We imagine the presence of a [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot engine]] between the system and its reference environment even though this engine does not exist in the real world.  Its only purpose is to measure the results of a \"what-if\" scenario to represent the most efficient work interaction possible between the system and its surroundings.\n\nIf a real-world reference environment is chosen that behaves like an unlimited reservoir that remains unaltered by the system, then Carnot's speculation about the consequences of a system heading towards equilibrium with time is addressed by two equivalent mathematical statements. Let ''B'', the exergy or available work, decrease with time, and ''S''<sub>total</sub>, the entropy of the system and its reference environment enclosed together in a larger [[isolated system]], increase with time:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\le 0 \\mbox{ is equivalent to } \\frac {\\mathrm{d}S_{total}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\ge 0 \\qquad \\mbox{(1)} </math>\n\nFor macroscopic systems (above the [[thermodynamic limit]]), these statements are both expressions of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] if the following expression is used for exergy:\n\n:<math> B=U +P_RV -T_RS-\\sum_i\\mu_{i,R}N_i \\qquad \\mbox{(2)} </math>\nwhere the [[Extensive quantity|extensive quantities]] for the system are: ''U'' = [[Internal energy]], ''V'' = [[Volume]], and ''N''<sub>i</sub> = [[Mole (unit)|Moles]] of component ''i''\n\nThe [[Intensive quantity|intensive quantities]] for the surroundings are: ''P''<sub>R</sub> = [[Pressure]], ''T''<sub>R</sub> = [[temperature]], ''\u03bc''<sub>i, R\n</sub> = [[Chemical potential]] of component ''i''\n\nIndividual terms also often have names attached to them: <math>P_RV</math> is called \"available PV work\", <math>T_RS</math> is called \"entropic loss\" or \"heat loss\" and the final term is called \"available chemical energy.\"\n\nOther [[thermodynamic potential]]s may be used to replace internal energy so long as proper care is taken in recognizing which natural variables correspond to which potential. For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001){{ref|alberty01}}. Equation (2) is useful for processes where system volume, entropy, and number of moles of various components change because internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.\n\nAn alternative definition of internal energy does not separate available chemical potential from ''U''. This expression is useful (when substituted into equation (1)) for processes where system volume and entropy change, but no chemical reaction occurs:\n\n:<math> B=U[\\mu_1, \\mu_2, ... \\mu_n] +P_RV -T_RS=U[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}] +P_RV -T_RS \\qquad \\mbox{(3)} </math>\n\nIn this case a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and volume will have a single numerical value for this thermodynamic potential. A [[phase (matter)|multi-state]] system may complicate or simplify the problem because the [[Gibbs phase rule]] predicts that intensive quantities will no longer be completely independent from each other.\n\n===A historical and cultural tangent===\nIn 1848, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]], asked (and immediately answered) the question\n\n:Is there any principle on which an absolute thermometric scale can be founded? It appears to me that Carnot\u2019s theory of the motive power of heat enables us to give an affirmative answer.{{ref|kelvin1848}}\n\nWith the benefit of the hindsight contained in equation (3), we are able to understand the historical impact of Kelvin's idea on physics.  Kelvin suggested that the best temperature scale would describe a constant ability for a unit of temperature in the surroundings to alter the available work from Carnot's engine. From equation (3):\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}T_R}=-S \\qquad \\mbox{(4)} </math>\n\n[[Rudolf Clausius]] recognized the presence of a [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constant in Kelvin's analysis and gave it the name [[entropy]] in 1865 from the Greek for \"transformation\" because it describes the quantity of energy lost during transformation from heat to work.  The available work from a Carnot engine is at its maximum when the surroundings are at a temperature of [[absolute zero]].\n\nPhysicists then, as now, often look at a property with the word \"available\" or \"utilizable\" in its name with a certain unease.  The idea of what is available raises the question of \"available to what?\" and raises a concern about whether such a property is [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]. Laws derived using such a property may not describe the universe but instead describe what people wish to see.\n\nThe field of [[statistical mechanics]] (beginning with the work of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in developing the [[Boltzmann equation]]) relieved many physicists of this concern.  From this discipline, we now know that macroscopic properties may all be determined from properties on a microscopic scale where entropy is more \"real\" than temperature itself (''see [[Thermodynamic temperature]]''). Microscopic kinetic fluctuations among particles cause entropic loss, and this energy is unavailable for work because these fluctuations occur randomly in all directions.  The anthropocentric act is taken, in the eyes of some physicists and engineers today, when someone draws a hypothetical boundary, in fact he says: \"This is my system. What occurs beyond it is surroundings.\" In this context, exergy is sometimes described as an anthropocentric property, both by those who use it and those who don't.  Entropy is viewed as a more fundamental property of matter.\n\nIn the field of [[ecology]], the interactions among systems (mostly [[ecosystem]]s) and their manipulation of exergy resources is of primary concern.  With this perspective, the answer of \"available to what?\" is simply: \"available to the system\", because ecosystems appear to exist in the real world.  With the viewpoint of [[systems ecology]], a property of matter like absolute entropy is seen as anthropocentric because it is defined relative to an unobtainable hypothetical reference system in isolation at absolute zero temperature. With this emphasis on systems rather than matter, exergy is viewed as a more fundamental property of a system, and it is entropy that may be viewed as a co-property of a system with an idealized reference system.\n\n===A potential for every thermodynamic situation===\nIn addition to <math>U\\ </math> and <math> U[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}]</math>, the other [[thermodynamic potential]]s are frequently used to determine exergy.  For a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and pressure, [[enthalpy]] ''H'' is used in the expression:\n\n:<math> B=H-T_RS \\qquad \\mbox{(5)} </math>\n\nFor a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and volume, [[Helmholtz free energy]] ''A'' is used in the expression:\n\n:<math> B=A+P_RV \\qquad \\mbox{(6)} </math>\n\nFor a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and pressure, [[Gibbs free energy]] ''G'' is used in the expression:\n\n:<math> B=G \\qquad \\mbox{(7)} </math>\n\nThe potentials ''A'' and ''G'' are utilized for a constant temperature process.  In these cases, all energy is [[Thermodynamic free energy|free to perform useful work]] because there is no entropic loss.  A chemical reaction that generates electricity with no associated change in temperature will also experience no entropic loss. (''See [[Fuel cell]].'')  This is true of every isothermal process. Examples are [[gravitational potential energy]], [[kinetic energy]] (on a macroscopic scale), [[solar energy]], [[electrical energy]], and many others. If [[friction]], [[absorption (optics)|absorption]], [[electrical resistance]] or a similar energy conversion takes place that releases heat, the impact of that heat on thermodynamic potentials must be considered, and it is this impact that decreases the available energy.\n\n===Chemical exergy===\nSimilar to thermomechanical exergy, chemical exergy depends on the temperature and pressure of a system as well as on the composition. The key difference in evaluating chemical exergy versus thermomechanical exergy is that thermomechanical exergy does not take into account the difference in a system and environment's chemical composition. If the temperature, pressure or composition of a system differs from the environment's state, then the overall system will have exergy.<ref name=\"moran\">\n{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Michael\n|title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics.|year=2010\n|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Canada, Limited|location=Hoboken, N.J.\n|isbn=978-0-470-49590-2|pages=816\u2013817|edition=7th}}\n</ref>\n\nThe definition of chemical exergy resembles the standard definition of thermomechanical exergy, but with a few differences. Chemical exergy is defined as the maximum work that can be obtained when the considered system is brought into reaction with reference substances present in the environment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Szargut|first=Jan|title=Towards an International Reference Environment of Chemical Exergy|url=http://www.exergoecology.com/papers/towards_int_re.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2012}}\n</ref> Defining the exergy reference environment is one of the most vital parts of analyzing chemical exergy. In general, the environment is defined as the composition of air at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1 atm of pressure. At these properties air consists of N<sub>2</sub>=75.67%, O<sub>2</sub>=20.35%, H<sub>2</sub>O(g)=3.12%, CO<sub>2</sub>=0.03% and other gases=0.83%.<ref name=\"moran\" /> These molar fractions will become of use when applying Equation 8 below.\n\nC<sub>a</sub>H<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub> is the substance that is entering a system that one wants to find the maximum theoretical work of. By using the following equations, one can calculate the chemical exergy of the substance in a given system. Below, Equation 8 uses the Gibbs function of the applicable element or compound to calculate the chemical exergy. Equation 9 is similar but uses standard molar chemical exergy, which scientists have determined based on several criteria, including the ambient temperature and pressure that a system is being analyzed and the concentration of the most common components.<ref>\n{{cite journal|last=Rivero|first=R.|author2=Garfias, M.\n|title=Standard chemical exergy of elements updated|journal=Energy|date=1 December 2006\n|volume=31|issue=15|pages=3310\u20133326\n|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2006.03.020}}</ref> These values can be found in thermodynamic books or in online tables.<ref>\n{{cite journal|last=Zanchini|first=Enzo|author2=Terlizzese, Tiziano\n|title=Molar exergy and flow exergy of pure chemical fuels|journal=Energy\n|date=1 September 2009|volume=34|issue=9|pages=1246\u20131259\n|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2009.05.007}}</ref>\n\n====Important equations====\n<math>\\bar{e}^{ch}=\\left[ \\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{F}}+\\left( a+\\frac{b}{4}-\\frac{c}{2} \n\\right)\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}-a\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}-\\, \\frac{b}{2}\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{H_{2}O}(g)} \n\\right]\\, \\left( T_{0,}p_{0} \\right)+\\bar{R}T_{0}\\, ln\\left[ \n\\frac{{{(y}_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}^{e})}^{a+\\frac{b}{4}-\\, \\frac{c}{2}}}{\\left( \ny_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}^{e} \\right)^{a}\\left( y_{\\mathrm{H_{2}O}}^{e} \\right)^{\\frac{b}{2}}} \n\\right] \\mbox{(8)}</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n<math>\\bar{g}_{x}=</math> Gibbs function of the specific substance in the system at\n<math>\\left( T_{0,}p_{0} \\right)</math>.

Using a standard table works well for most cases, even if the environment conditions vary slightly, the difference is most likely negligible.\n\n====Total exergy====\nAfter finding the chemical exergy in a given system, one can find the total exergy by adding it to the thermomechanical exergy. Depending on the situation, the amount of chemical exergy added can be very small. If the system being evaluated involves combustion, the amount of chemical exergy is very large and necessary to find the total exergy of the system.\n\n===Irreversibility===\nIrreversibility accounts for the amount of exergy destroyed in a closed system, or in other words, the wasted work potential. This is also called dissipated energy. For highly efficient systems, the value of I, is low, and vice versa. The equation to calculate the Irreversibility of a closed system, as it relates to the exergy of that system, is as follows:<ref name=\"ohio\">\n{{cite web|title=Exergy (Availability) \u2013 Part a (updated 3/24/12)|url=http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/thermo/Applied/Chapt.7_11/Chapter7a.html|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n:<math> I = T_0s_{gen} \\qquad \\mbox{(10)} </math>\n\nwhere: <math> s_{gen} </math> is the entropy generated by the system processes.\n\nIf <math>I > 0</math> then there are irreversibilities present in the system.\nIf <math>I = 0</math> then there are no irreversibilities present in the system.\n\nThe value of I, the irreversibility, can not be negative, as it is not a property. On the contrary, the availability is a different story, which is a property of the system.\n\nExergy analysis is based on the relation between the actual work and the maximal work, that could be obtained in the reversible process:\n\n:<math> w_{act} = w_{max} - I \\qquad \\mbox{(11)} </math>\n\nThe first term at the right part is related with the difference in exergy at inlet and outlet of the system:<ref name=\"ohio\" />\n\n:<math> w_{max} = \\Delta B = B_{in} - B_{out} \\qquad \\mbox{(12)} </math>\n\nFor an Isolated System:\n\nNo heat or work interactions with the surroundings occur, and therefore, there are no transfers of availability between the system and its surroundings. The change in exergy of an isolated system is equivalent, but opposite the value for irreversibility of that system.\n\n:<math> \\Delta B = -I \\qquad \\mbox{(13)} </math>\n\n==Applications==\nApplying equation (1) to a subsystem yields:\n\n:<math> \\mbox{If } \\frac {\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\begin{cases} >0, & \\frac {\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\mbox{ maximum power generated} \\\\ <0, & \\frac {\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\mbox{ minimum power required} \\end{cases} \\qquad \\mbox{(14)} </math>\n\nThis expression applies equally well for theoretical ideals in a wide variety of applications: [[electrolysis]] (decrease in ''G''), [[galvanic cell]]s and [[fuel cell]]s (increase in ''G''), [[explosives]] (increase in ''A''), [[HVAC|heating and refrigeration]] (exchange of ''H''), [[heat engine|motors]] (decrease in ''U'') and [[electrical generator|generators]] (increase in ''U'').\n\nUtilization of the exergy concept often requires careful consideration of the choice of reference environment because, as Carnot knew, unlimited reservoirs do not exist in the real world.  A system may be maintained at a constant temperature to simulate an unlimited reservoir in the lab or in a factory, but those systems cannot then be isolated from a larger surrounding environment. However, with a proper choice of system boundaries, a reasonable constant reservoir can be imagined. A process sometimes must be compared to \"the most realistic impossibility,\" and this invariably involves a certain amount of guesswork.\n\n===Engineering applications===\nApplication of exergy to [[unit operation]]s in [[chemical plant]]s was partially responsible for the huge growth of the [[chemical industry]] during the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  During this time it was usually called ''availability'' or ''available work''.\n\nAs a simple example of exergy, air at atmospheric conditions of temperature, pressure, ''and composition'' contains energy but no exergy when it is chosen as the thermodynamic reference state known as [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient]]. Individual processes on Earth such as combustion in a power plant often eventually result in products that are incorporated into the atmosphere, so defining this reference state for exergy is useful even though the atmosphere itself is not at equilibrium and is full of long and short term variations.\n\nIf standard ambient conditions are used for calculations during chemical plant operation when the actual weather is very cold or hot, then certain parts of a chemical plant might seem to have an exergy efficiency of greater than 100% and without taking into account the non-standard atmospheric temperature variation can give an impression of being a perpetual motion machine.  Using actual conditions will give actual values, but standard ambient conditions are useful for initial design calculations.\n\nOne goal of energy and exergy methods in engineering is to compute what comes into and out of several possible designs before a factory is built. Energy input and output will always balance according to the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] or the energy conservation principle. Exergy output will not balance the exergy input for real processes since a part of the exergy input is always destroyed according to the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] for real processes. After the input and output are completed, the engineer will often want to select the most efficient process. An [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] or ''first law efficiency'' will determine the most efficient process based on wasting as little energy as possible relative to energy inputs.  An [[exergy efficiency]] or ''second-law efficiency'' will determine the most efficient process based on wasting ''and destroying'' as little available work as possible from a given input of available work.\n\n===Applications in natural resource utilization===\nIn recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of [[industrial ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].  Defining where one field ends and the next begins is a matter of semantics, but applications of exergy can be placed into rigid categories.\n\nResearchers in ecological economics and [[environmental accounting]] perform exergy-cost analyses in order to evaluate the impact of human activity on the current [[natural environment]].  As with ambient air, this often requires the unrealistic substitution of properties from a natural environment in place of the [[Heat reservoir|reference state]] [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|environment]] of Carnot.  For example, ecologists and others have developed reference conditions for the [[ocean]] and for the [[Earth's crust]].  Exergy values for human activity using this information can be useful for comparing policy alternatives based on the efficiency of utilizing [[natural resources]] to perform work. Typical questions that may be answered are:\n\n:Does the human production of one unit of an [[economic good]] by method ''A'' utilize more of a resource's exergy than by method ''B''?\n\n:Does the human production of economic good ''A'' utilize more of a resource's exergy than the production of good ''B''?\n\n:Does the human production of economic good ''A'' utilize a resource's exergy more efficiently than the production of good ''B''?\n\nThere has been some progress in standardizing and applying these methods.\n\nMeasuring exergy requires the evaluation of a system\u2019s reference state environment.<ref name=\"exergoecology\">\n{{cite web\n |title=The Reference Environment\n |work=Exergoecology Portal\n |year=2008\n |publisher=CIRCE\n |url=http://www.exergoecology.com/exergo/\n}}</ref> With respect to the applications of exergy on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system requires the assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system to do work, it is becoming increasingly imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources,<ref name=\"gcep.stanford\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Edwards |first=C.\n |title=Development of Low-Exergy-Lost, High-Efficiency Chemical Engines\n |journal=GCEP Technology Report\n |year=2007\n |url=http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/ryhz9TjH9TbEp9qJ290tWQ/2.6.3_edwards_2008_hq.pdf\n |pages=1\u20132\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and how human interference alters this potential.\n\nReferencing the inherent qualities of a system in place of a reference state environment<ref name=\"exergoecology\" /> is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource.

The current methods for analyzing the [[exhaust gas|emissions]] from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the exergy of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to examine these with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the [[atmosphere]].<ref name=\"gcep.stanford\" /> In this way, it is easier to determine how human action is affecting the natural environment.\n\n===Applications in sustainability===\nIn [[systems ecology]], researchers sometimes consider the exergy of the current formation of natural resources from a small number of exergy inputs (usually [[solar radiation]], [[tidal force]]s, and [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal heat]]).  This application not only requires assumptions about reference states, but it also requires assumptions about the real environments of the past that might have been close to those reference states.  Can we decide which is the most \"realistic impossibility\" over such a long period of time when we are only speculating about the reality?\n\nFor instance, comparing oil exergy to coal exergy using a common reference state would require geothermal exergy inputs to describe the transition from biological material to fossil fuels during millions of years in the Earth's crust, and solar radiation exergy inputs to describe the material's history before then when it was part of the biosphere.  This would need to be carried out mathematically backwards through time, to a presumed era when the oil and coal could be assumed to be receiving the same exergy inputs from these sources.  A speculation about a past environment is different from assigning a reference state with respect to known environments today. Reasonable guesses about real ancient environments may be made, but they are untestable guesses, and so some regard this application as [[pseudoscience]] or pseudo-engineering.\n\nThe field describes this accumulated exergy in a natural resource over time as [[embodied energy]] with units of the \"embodied joule\" or \"emjoule\".\n\nThe important application of this research is to address [[sustainability]] issues in a quantitative fashion through a [[sustainability measurement]]:\n\n:Does the human production of an economic good deplete the exergy of Earth's [[natural resources]] more quickly than those resources are able to receive exergy?\n\n:If so, how does this compare to the depletion caused by producing the same good (or a different one) using a different set of natural resources?\n\n===Assigning one thermodynamically obtained value to an economic good===\nA technique proposed by systems ecologists is to consolidate the three exergy inputs described in the last section into the single exergy input of solar radiation, and to express the total input of exergy into an economic good as a ''solar embodied joule'' or ''sej''. (''See [[Emergy]]'') Exergy inputs from solar, tidal, and geothermal forces all at one time had their origins at the beginning of the solar system under conditions which could be chosen as an initial reference state, and other speculative reference states could in theory be traced back to that time. With this tool we would be able to answer:\n\n:What fraction of the total human depletion of the Earth's exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?\n\n:What fraction of the total human and non-human depletion of the Earth's exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?\n\nNo additional thermodynamic laws are required for this idea, and the principles of [[energetics]] may confuse many issues for those outside the field.  The combination of untestable hypotheses, unfamiliar jargon that contradicts accepted jargon, intense advocacy among its supporters, and some degree of isolation from other disciplines have contributed to this [[protoscience]] being regarded by many as a [[pseudoscience]].  However, its basic tenets are only a further utilization of the exergy concept.\n\n===Implications in the development of complex physical systems===\nA common hypothesis in systems ecology is that the design engineer's observation that a greater capital investment is needed to create a process with increased exergy efficiency is actually the economic result of a fundamental law of nature.  By this view, exergy is the analogue of economic currency in the natural world. The analogy to capital investment is the accumulation of exergy into a system over long periods of time resulting in [[embodied energy]].  The analogy of capital investment resulting in a factory with high exergy efficiency is an increase in natural organizational structures with high exergy efficiency.  (''See [[Maximum power theorem|Maximum power]]'').  Researchers in these fields describe biological [[evolution]] in terms of increases in organism complexity due to the requirement for increased exergy efficiency because of competition for limited sources of exergy.\n\nSome biologists have a similar hypothesis.  A biological system (or a chemical plant) with a number of intermediate compartments and intermediate reactions is more efficient because the process is divided up into many small substeps, and this is closer to the [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible ideal]] of an infinite number of [[infinitesimal]] substeps.  Of course, an excessively large number of intermediate compartments comes at a capital cost that may be too high.\n\nTesting this idea in living organisms or ecosystems is impossible for all practical purposes because of the large time scales and small exergy inputs involved for changes to take place. However, if this idea is correct, it would not be a new fundamental law of nature. It would simply be living systems and ecosystems maximizing their exergy efficiency by utilizing laws of thermodynamics developed in the 19th century.\n\n===Philosophical and cosmological implications===\nSome proponents of utilizing exergy concepts describe them as a [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] or [[ecocentric]] alternative for terms like quality and [[Value theory|value]]. The \"[[deep ecology]]\" movement views [[economic]] usage of these terms as an [[anthropocentric]] [[philosophy]] which should be discarded.  A possible universal thermodynamic concept of value or utility appeals to those with an interest in [[monism]].\n\nFor some, the end result of this line of thinking about tracking exergy into the deep past is a restatement of the [[cosmological argument]] that the universe was once at [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and an input of exergy from some [[First Cause]] created a universe full of available work.  Current science is unable to describe the first 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds of the universe (''See [[Timeline of the Big Bang]]'').  An external reference state is not able to be defined for such an event, and (regardless of its merits), such an argument may be better expressed in terms of [[entropy]].\n\n==Quality of energy types==\nThe ratio of exergy to energy in a substance can be considered a measure of [[energy quality]].  Forms of energy such as macroscopic kinetic energy, electrical energy, and chemical [[Gibbs free energy]] are 100% recoverable as work, and therefore have an exergy equal to their energy.  However, forms of energy such as radiation and thermal energy can not be converted completely to work, and have exergy content less than their energy content.  The exact proportion of exergy in a substance depends on the amount of entropy relative to the surrounding environment as determined by the [[Thermodynamics|Second Law of Thermodynamics]].\n\nExergy is useful when measuring the efficiency of an energy conversion process.  The exergetic, or 2nd&nbsp;Law, efficiency is a ratio of the exergy output divided by the exergy input.  This formulation takes into account the quality of the energy, often offering a more accurate and useful analysis than efficiency estimates only using the [[Thermodynamics|First Law of Thermodynamics]].\n\nWork can be extracted also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When the flow of energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment of the notion of energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, [[Energy]] is a measure of the ability to do work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the [[entropy|second principle of energy flow transformations]] says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.\n\n===Exergy of heat available at a temperature===\n<!--(some of this will be moved up to mathematics section)-->\nMaximal possible conversion of heat to work, or exergy content of heat, depends on the [[temperature]] at which heat is available and the temperature level at which the reject heat can be disposed, that is the temperature of the surrounding. The upper limit for conversion is known as [[Carnot efficiency]] and was discovered by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot]] in 1824. See also [[Carnot heat engine]].\n\nCarnot efficiency is\n\n:<math>\\eta = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H} \\qquad \\mbox{(15)}</math>\n\nwhere ''T''<sub>''H''</sub> is the higher temperature and ''T''<sub>''C''</sub> is the lower temperature, both as [[absolute temperature]]. From Equation 15 it is clear that in order to maximize efficiency one should maximize ''T''<sub>''H''</sub> and minimize ''T''<sub>''C''</sub>.\n\nExergy exchanged is then:\n\n:<math>\\ B = Q(1 - \\frac{T_o}{T_ {source}}) \\qquad \\mbox{(16)}</math>\n\nwhere ''T''<sub>''source''</sub> is the temperature of the heat source, and ''T''<sub>''o''</sub> is the temperature of the surrounding.\n[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|350px|Higher exergy content tends to mean higher energy prices. Here the costs of heating (vertical axis) are compared with the exergy content of different energy carriers (horizontal axis) in Finland. Energy carriers included are district heating (D), ground-source heat pump (G), exhaust air heat pump (A), bioenergy meaning firewood (B), heating oil (O) and direct electric heating (E). Red dots and trend line indicates energy prices for consumers, blue dots and trend line indicates total price for consumers including capital expenditure for the heating system.<ref name=\"Muller\"/>]]\n\n=== Connection with economic value ===\n\nExergy in a sense can be understood as a measure of value of energy. Since high-exergy energy carriers can be used in for more versatile purposes, due to their ability to do more work, they can be postulated to hold more economic value. This can be seen in prices of energy carriers, i.e. high-exergy energy carriers such as electricity tend to be more valuable than low-exergy ones such as various fuels or heat. This has led to substitution of more valuable high-exergy energy carriers with low-exergy energy carriers, when possible. An example is heating systems, where higher investment to heating systems allows using low-exergy energy sources. Thus high-exergy content is being substituted with capital investments.<ref name=\"Muller\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.09.034|title = Estimating exergy prices for energy carriers in heating systems: Country analyses of exergy substitution with capital expenditures|journal = Energy and Buildings|volume = 43|issue = 12|pages = 3609\u20133617|year = 2011|last1 = M\u00fcller|first1 = A.|last2 = Kranzl|first2 = L.|last3 = Tuominen|first3 = P.|last4 = Boelman|first4 = E.|last5 = Molinari|first5 = M.|last6 = Entrop|first6 = A.G.}}</ref>\n\n=== Exergy based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ===\nExergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir.<ref>Rosen, M.

This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported\nand the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. The applicability of the EMIPS methodology relates specifically to transport system and allows an effective coupling with [[life cycle assessment]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Carnot===\nIn 1824, [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] studied the improvements developed for [[steam engines]] by [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] and others. Carnot utilized a purely theoretical perspective for these engines and developed new ideas. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The question has often been raised whether the motive power of heat is unbounded, whether the possible improvements in steam engines have an assignable limit\u2014a limit by which the nature of things will not allow to be passed by any means whatever... In order to consider in the most general way the principle of the production of motion by heat, it must be considered independently of any mechanism or any particular agent. It is necessary to establish principles applicable not only to steam-engines but to all imaginable heat-engines... The production of motion in steam-engines is always accompanied by a circumstance on which we should fix our attention.  This circumstance is the re-establishing of equilibrium\u2026 Imagine two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies, to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs...{{ref|carnot1824}}</blockquote>\n\nCarnot next described what is now called the [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot engine]], and proved by a [[thought experiment]] that any heat engine performing better than this engine would be a [[perpetual motion]] machine. Even in the 1820s, there was a long history of science forbidding such devices.  According to Carnot, \"Such a creation is entirely contrary to ideas now accepted, to the [[Classical mechanics|laws of mechanics]] and of sound [[physics]]. It is inadmissible.\"{{ref label|carnot1824|4|a}}\n\nThis description of an upper bound to the work that may be done by an engine was the earliest modern formulation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  Because it involves no mathematics, it still often serves as the entry point for a modern understanding of both the second law and [[entropy]].  Carnot's focus on [[heat engine]]s, [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], and [[heat reservoir]]s is also the best entry point for understanding the closely related concept of exergy.\n\nCarnot believed in the incorrect [[caloric theory]] of heat that was popular during his time, but his thought experiment nevertheless described a fundamental limit of nature. As [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] replaced caloric theory through the early and mid-19th century (''see [[Timeline of thermodynamics]]''), several scientists added mathematical precision to the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]] and developed the concept of [[entropy]].  Carnot's focus on processes at the human scale (above the [[thermodynamic limit]]) led to the most universally applicable concepts in [[physics]].  Entropy and the second-law are applied today in fields ranging from [[quantum mechanics]] to [[physical cosmology]].\n\n===Gibbs===\nIn the 1870s, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] unified a large quantity of 19th century [[thermochemistry]] into one compact theory.  Gibbs's theory incorporated the new concept of a [[chemical potential]] to cause change when distant from a [[chemical equilibrium]] into the older work begun by Carnot in describing thermal and [[mechanical equilibrium]] and their potentials for change.  Gibbs's unifying theory resulted in the [[thermodynamic potential]] [[state function]]s describing differences from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\nIn 1873, Gibbs derived the mathematics of \"available energy of the body and medium\" into the form it has today.{{ref label|gibbs1873|3|a}} (See the equations [[Exergy#Important equations|above]]).  The physics describing exergy has changed little since that time.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|energy}}\n* [[Entropy production]]\n* [[Energy: world resources and consumption]]\n* [[Emergy]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n#{{note|perrot}} {{Cite book| author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}\n#{{note|lowex}} {{cite web| title=lowexnet | url=http://www.lowex.net}}\n#{{note|rant56}}{{note label|rant56|2|a}} {{Cite journal| author= Z.

Willard Gibbs]] in 1873.{{ref label|gibbs1873|4}}\n\nEnergy is neither created nor destroyed during a process. Energy changes from one form to another (''see [[First Law of Thermodynamics]]''). In contrast, exergy is always destroyed when a process is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]], for example loss of heat to the environment (''see [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]''). This destruction is proportional to the [[entropy]] increase of the system together with its surroundings (''see [[Entropy production]]''). The destroyed exergy has been called anergy.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Honerkamp |first=J.\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1uc5S5UR6_YC&pg=PA298&dq=%22The+maximum+fraction+of+an+energy+form+which+(in+a+reversible+process)+can+be+transformed+into+work+is+called+exergy.+The+remaining+part+is+called+anergy,+and+this+corresponds+to+the+waste+heat.%22#v=onepage\n |title=Statistical physics\n |publisher=Springer\n |year=2002\n |page=298\n |quote=The maximum fraction of an energy form which (in a reversible process) can be transformed into work is called exergy.

The exergy of a system in equilibrium with the environment is zero. Exergy is neither a [[List of thermodynamic properties|thermodynamic property]] of matter nor a [[thermodynamic potential]] of a system.  Exergy and energy both have units of [[joule]]s. The [[internal energy]] of a system is always measured from a fixed reference state and is therefore always a [[state function]].  Some authors define the exergy of the system to be changed when the environment changes, in which case it is not a state function.  Other writers prefer{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} a slightly alternate definition of the available energy or exergy of a system where the environment is firmly defined,  as an unchangeable absolute reference state, and in this alternate definition exergy becomes a property of the state of the system alone.\n\nHowever, from a theoretical point of view, exergy may be defined without reference to any environment. If the intensive properties of different finitely extended elements of a system differ, there is always the possibility to extract mechanical work from the system.<ref>{{cite book |last1=van Gool |first1=W. |last2=Bruggink |first2=J.J.C.

Exergy is also synonymous with: ''available energy'', ''exergic energy'', ''essergy'' (considered archaic), ''utilizable energy'', ''available useful work'', ''maximum (or minimum) work'', ''maximum (or minimum) work content'', ''[[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] work'', and ''ideal work''.\n\nThe exergy destruction of a cycle is the sum of the exergy destruction of the processes that compose that cycle. The exergy destruction of a cycle can also be determined without tracing the individual processes by considering the entire cycle as a single process and using one of the exergy destruction equations.\n\n==Mathematical description==\n\n===An application of the second law of thermodynamics===\n{{See also|Second law of thermodynamics}}\n\nExergy uses [[System (thermodynamics)|system boundaries]] in a way that is unfamiliar to many. We imagine the presence of a [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot engine]] between the system and its reference environment even though this engine does not exist in the real world.  Its only purpose is to measure the results of a \"what-if\" scenario to represent the most efficient work interaction possible between the system and its surroundings.\n\nIf a real-world reference environment is chosen that behaves like an unlimited reservoir that remains unaltered by the system, then Carnot's speculation about the consequences of a system heading towards equilibrium with time is addressed by two equivalent mathematical statements. Let ''B'', the exergy or available work, decrease with time, and ''S''<sub>total</sub>, the entropy of the system and its reference environment enclosed together in a larger [[isolated system]], increase with time:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\le 0 \\mbox{ is equivalent to } \\frac {\\mathrm{d}S_{total}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\ge 0 \\qquad \\mbox{(1)} </math>\n\nFor macroscopic systems (above the [[thermodynamic limit]]), these statements are both expressions of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] if the following expression is used for exergy:\n\n:<math> B=U +P_RV -T_RS-\\sum_i\\mu_{i,R}N_i \\qquad \\mbox{(2)} </math>\nwhere the [[Extensive quantity|extensive quantities]] for the system are: ''U'' = [[Internal energy]], ''V'' = [[Volume]], and ''N''<sub>i</sub> = [[Mole (unit)|Moles]] of component ''i''\n\nThe [[Intensive quantity|intensive quantities]] for the surroundings are: ''P''<sub>R</sub> = [[Pressure]], ''T''<sub>R</sub> = [[temperature]], ''\u03bc''<sub>i, R\n</sub> = [[Chemical potential]] of component ''i''\n\nIndividual terms also often have names attached to them: <math>P_RV</math> is called \"available PV work\", <math>T_RS</math> is called \"entropic loss\" or \"heat loss\" and the final term is called \"available chemical energy.\"\n\nOther [[thermodynamic potential]]s may be used to replace internal energy so long as proper care is taken in recognizing which natural variables correspond to which potential. For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001){{ref|alberty01}}. Equation (2) is useful for processes where system volume, entropy, and number of moles of various components change because internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.\n\nAn alternative definition of internal energy does not separate available chemical potential from ''U''. This expression is useful (when substituted into equation (1)) for processes where system volume and entropy change, but no chemical reaction occurs:\n\n:<math> B=U[\\mu_1, \\mu_2, ... \\mu_n] +P_RV -T_RS=U[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}] +P_RV -T_RS \\qquad \\mbox{(3)} </math>\n\nIn this case a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and volume will have a single numerical value for this thermodynamic potential. A [[phase (matter)|multi-state]] system may complicate or simplify the problem because the [[Gibbs phase rule]] predicts that intensive quantities will no longer be completely independent from each other.\n\n===A historical and cultural tangent===\nIn 1848, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]], asked (and immediately answered) the question\n\n:Is there any principle on which an absolute thermometric scale can be founded? It appears to me that Carnot\u2019s theory of the motive power of heat enables us to give an affirmative answer.{{ref|kelvin1848}}\n\nWith the benefit of the hindsight contained in equation (3), we are able to understand the historical impact of Kelvin's idea on physics.  Kelvin suggested that the best temperature scale would describe a constant ability for a unit of temperature in the surroundings to alter the available work from Carnot's engine. From equation (3):\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}T_R}=-S \\qquad \\mbox{(4)} </math>\n\n[[Rudolf Clausius]] recognized the presence of a [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constant in Kelvin's analysis and gave it the name [[entropy]] in 1865 from the Greek for \"transformation\" because it describes the quantity of energy lost during transformation from heat to work.  The available work from a Carnot engine is at its maximum when the surroundings are at a temperature of [[absolute zero]].\n\nPhysicists then, as now, often look at a property with the word \"available\" or \"utilizable\" in its name with a certain unease.  The idea of what is available raises the question of \"available to what?\" and raises a concern about whether such a property is [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]. Laws derived using such a property may not describe the universe but instead describe what people wish to see.\n\nThe field of [[statistical mechanics]] (beginning with the work of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in developing the [[Boltzmann equation]]) relieved many physicists of this concern.  From this discipline, we now know that macroscopic properties may all be determined from properties on a microscopic scale where entropy is more \"real\" than temperature itself (''see [[Thermodynamic temperature]]''). Microscopic kinetic fluctuations among particles cause entropic loss, and this energy is unavailable for work because these fluctuations occur randomly in all directions.  The anthropocentric act is taken, in the eyes of some physicists and engineers today, when someone draws a hypothetical boundary, in fact he says: \"This is my system. What occurs beyond it is surroundings.\" In this context, exergy is sometimes described as an anthropocentric property, both by those who use it and those who don't.  Entropy is viewed as a more fundamental property of matter.\n\nIn the field of [[ecology]], the interactions among systems (mostly [[ecosystem]]s) and their manipulation of exergy resources is of primary concern.  With this perspective, the answer of \"available to what?\" is simply: \"available to the system\", because ecosystems appear to exist in the real world.  With the viewpoint of [[systems ecology]], a property of matter like absolute entropy is seen as anthropocentric because it is defined relative to an unobtainable hypothetical reference system in isolation at absolute zero temperature. With this emphasis on systems rather than matter, exergy is viewed as a more fundamental property of a system, and it is entropy that may be viewed as a co-property of a system with an idealized reference system.\n\n===A potential for every thermodynamic situation===\nIn addition to <math>U\\ </math> and <math> U[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}]</math>, the other [[thermodynamic potential]]s are frequently used to determine exergy.  For a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and pressure, [[enthalpy]] ''H'' is used in the expression:\n\n:<math> B=H-T_RS \\qquad \\mbox{(5)} </math>\n\nFor a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and volume, [[Helmholtz free energy]] ''A'' is used in the expression:\n\n:<math> B=A+P_RV \\qquad \\mbox{(6)} </math>\n\nFor a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and pressure, [[Gibbs free energy]] ''G'' is used in the expression:\n\n:<math> B=G \\qquad \\mbox{(7)} </math>\n\nThe potentials ''A'' and ''G'' are utilized for a constant temperature process.  In these cases, all energy is [[Thermodynamic free energy|free to perform useful work]] because there is no entropic loss.  A chemical reaction that generates electricity with no associated change in temperature will also experience no entropic loss. (''See [[Fuel cell]].'')  This is true of every isothermal process. Examples are [[gravitational potential energy]], [[kinetic energy]] (on a macroscopic scale), [[solar energy]], [[electrical energy]], and many others. If [[friction]], [[absorption (optics)|absorption]], [[electrical resistance]] or a similar energy conversion takes place that releases heat, the impact of that heat on thermodynamic potentials must be considered, and it is this impact that decreases the available energy.\n\n===Chemical exergy===\nSimilar to thermomechanical exergy, chemical exergy depends on the temperature and pressure of a system as well as on the composition. The key difference in evaluating chemical exergy versus thermomechanical exergy is that thermomechanical exergy does not take into account the difference in a system and environment's chemical composition. If the temperature, pressure or composition of a system differs from the environment's state, then the overall system will have exergy.<ref name=\"moran\">\n{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Michael\n|title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics.|year=2010\n|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Canada, Limited|location=Hoboken, N.J.\n|isbn=978-0-470-49590-2|pages=816\u2013817|edition=7th}}\n</ref>\n\nThe definition of chemical exergy resembles the standard definition of thermomechanical exergy, but with a few differences. Chemical exergy is defined as the maximum work that can be obtained when the considered system is brought into reaction with reference substances present in the environment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Szargut|first=Jan|title=Towards an International Reference Environment of Chemical Exergy|url=http://www.exergoecology.com/papers/towards_int_re.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2012}}\n</ref> Defining the exergy reference environment is one of the most vital parts of analyzing chemical exergy. In general, the environment is defined as the composition of air at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1 atm of pressure. At these properties air consists of N<sub>2</sub>=75.67%, O<sub>2</sub>=20.35%, H<sub>2</sub>O(g)=3.12%, CO<sub>2</sub>=0.03% and other gases=0.83%.<ref name=\"moran\" /> These molar fractions will become of use when applying Equation 8 below.\n\nC<sub>a</sub>H<sub>b</sub>O<sub>c</sub> is the substance that is entering a system that one wants to find the maximum theoretical work of. By using the following equations, one can calculate the chemical exergy of the substance in a given system.

Equation 9 is similar but uses standard molar chemical exergy, which scientists have determined based on several criteria, including the ambient temperature and pressure that a system is being analyzed and the concentration of the most common components.<ref>\n{{cite journal|last=Rivero|first=R.|author2=Garfias, M.\n|title=Standard chemical exergy of elements updated|journal=Energy|date=1 December 2006\n|volume=31|issue=15|pages=3310\u20133326\n|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2006.03.020}}</ref> These values can be found in thermodynamic books or in online tables.<ref>\n{{cite journal|last=Zanchini|first=Enzo|author2=Terlizzese, Tiziano\n|title=Molar exergy and flow exergy of pure chemical fuels|journal=Energy\n|date=1 September 2009|volume=34|issue=9|pages=1246\u20131259\n|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2009.05.007}}</ref>\n\n====Important equations====\n<math>\\bar{e}^{ch}=\\left[ \\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{F}}+\\left( a+\\frac{b}{4}-\\frac{c}{2} \n\\right)\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}-a\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}-\\, \\frac{b}{2}\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{H_{2}O}(g)} \n\\right]\\, \\left( T_{0,}p_{0} \\right)+\\bar{R}T_{0}\\, ln\\left[ \n\\frac{{{(y}_{\\mathrm{O_{2}}}^{e})}^{a+\\frac{b}{4}-\\, \\frac{c}{2}}}{\\left( \ny_{\\mathrm{CO_{2}}}^{e} \\right)^{a}\\left( y_{\\mathrm{H_{2}O}}^{e} \\right)^{\\frac{b}{2}}} \n\\right] \\mbox{(8)}</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n<math>\\bar{g}_{x}=</math> Gibbs function of the specific substance in the system at\n<math>\\left( T_{0,}p_{0} \\right)</math>.

Using a standard table works well for most cases, even if the environment conditions vary slightly, the difference is most likely negligible.\n\n====Total exergy====\nAfter finding the chemical exergy in a given system, one can find the total exergy by adding it to the thermomechanical exergy. Depending on the situation, the amount of chemical exergy added can be very small. If the system being evaluated involves combustion, the amount of chemical exergy is very large and necessary to find the total exergy of the system.\n\n===Irreversibility===\nIrreversibility accounts for the amount of exergy destroyed in a closed system, or in other words, the wasted work potential. This is also called dissipated energy. For highly efficient systems, the value of I, is low, and vice versa. The equation to calculate the Irreversibility of a closed system, as it relates to the exergy of that system, is as follows:<ref name=\"ohio\">\n{{cite web|title=Exergy (Availability) \u2013 Part a (updated 3/24/12)|url=http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/thermo/Applied/Chapt.7_11/Chapter7a.html|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n:<math> I = T_0s_{gen} \\qquad \\mbox{(10)} </math>\n\nwhere: <math> s_{gen} </math> is the entropy generated by the system processes.\n\nIf <math>I > 0</math> then there are irreversibilities present in the system.\nIf <math>I = 0</math> then there are no irreversibilities present in the system.\n\nThe value of I, the irreversibility, can not be negative, as it is not a property. On the contrary, the availability is a different story, which is a property of the system.\n\nExergy analysis is based on the relation between the actual work and the maximal work, that could be obtained in the reversible process:\n\n:<math> w_{act} = w_{max} - I \\qquad \\mbox{(11)} </math>\n\nThe first term at the right part is related with the difference in exergy at inlet and outlet of the system:<ref name=\"ohio\" />\n\n:<math> w_{max} = \\Delta B = B_{in} - B_{out} \\qquad \\mbox{(12)} </math>\n\nFor an Isolated System:\n\nNo heat or work interactions with the surroundings occur, and therefore, there are no transfers of availability between the system and its surroundings. The change in exergy of an isolated system is equivalent, but opposite the value for irreversibility of that system.\n\n:<math> \\Delta B = -I \\qquad \\mbox{(13)} </math>\n\n==Applications==\nApplying equation (1) to a subsystem yields:\n\n:<math> \\mbox{If } \\frac {\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\begin{cases} >0, & \\frac {\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\mbox{ maximum power generated} \\\\ <0, & \\frac {\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\mbox{ minimum power required} \\end{cases} \\qquad \\mbox{(14)} </math>\n\nThis expression applies equally well for theoretical ideals in a wide variety of applications: [[electrolysis]] (decrease in ''G''), [[galvanic cell]]s and [[fuel cell]]s (increase in ''G''), [[explosives]] (increase in ''A''), [[HVAC|heating and refrigeration]] (exchange of ''H''), [[heat engine|motors]] (decrease in ''U'') and [[electrical generator|generators]] (increase in ''U'').\n\nUtilization of the exergy concept often requires careful consideration of the choice of reference environment because, as Carnot knew, unlimited reservoirs do not exist in the real world.  A system may be maintained at a constant temperature to simulate an unlimited reservoir in the lab or in a factory, but those systems cannot then be isolated from a larger surrounding environment. However, with a proper choice of system boundaries, a reasonable constant reservoir can be imagined. A process sometimes must be compared to \"the most realistic impossibility,\" and this invariably involves a certain amount of guesswork.\n\n===Engineering applications===\nApplication of exergy to [[unit operation]]s in [[chemical plant]]s was partially responsible for the huge growth of the [[chemical industry]] during the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  During this time it was usually called ''availability'' or ''available work''.\n\nAs a simple example of exergy, air at atmospheric conditions of temperature, pressure, ''and composition'' contains energy but no exergy when it is chosen as the thermodynamic reference state known as [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient]]. Individual processes on Earth such as combustion in a power plant often eventually result in products that are incorporated into the atmosphere, so defining this reference state for exergy is useful even though the atmosphere itself is not at equilibrium and is full of long and short term variations.\n\nIf standard ambient conditions are used for calculations during chemical plant operation when the actual weather is very cold or hot, then certain parts of a chemical plant might seem to have an exergy efficiency of greater than 100% and without taking into account the non-standard atmospheric temperature variation can give an impression of being a perpetual motion machine.  Using actual conditions will give actual values, but standard ambient conditions are useful for initial design calculations.\n\nOne goal of energy and exergy methods in engineering is to compute what comes into and out of several possible designs before a factory is built. Energy input and output will always balance according to the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] or the energy conservation principle. Exergy output will not balance the exergy input for real processes since a part of the exergy input is always destroyed according to the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] for real processes. After the input and output are completed, the engineer will often want to select the most efficient process. An [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] or ''first law efficiency'' will determine the most efficient process based on wasting as little energy as possible relative to energy inputs.  An [[exergy efficiency]] or ''second-law efficiency'' will determine the most efficient process based on wasting ''and destroying'' as little available work as possible from a given input of available work.\n\n===Applications in natural resource utilization===\nIn recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of [[industrial ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].  Defining where one field ends and the next begins is a matter of semantics, but applications of exergy can be placed into rigid categories.\n\nResearchers in ecological economics and [[environmental accounting]] perform exergy-cost analyses in order to evaluate the impact of human activity on the current [[natural environment]].  As with ambient air, this often requires the unrealistic substitution of properties from a natural environment in place of the [[Heat reservoir|reference state]] [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|environment]] of Carnot.  For example, ecologists and others have developed reference conditions for the [[ocean]] and for the [[Earth's crust]].  Exergy values for human activity using this information can be useful for comparing policy alternatives based on the efficiency of utilizing [[natural resources]] to perform work. Typical questions that may be answered are:\n\n:Does the human production of one unit of an [[economic good]] by method ''A'' utilize more of a resource's exergy than by method ''B''?\n\n:Does the human production of economic good ''A'' utilize more of a resource's exergy than the production of good ''B''?\n\n:Does the human production of economic good ''A'' utilize a resource's exergy more efficiently than the production of good ''B''?\n\nThere has been some progress in standardizing and applying these methods.\n\nMeasuring exergy requires the evaluation of a system\u2019s reference state environment.<ref name=\"exergoecology\">\n{{cite web\n |title=The Reference Environment\n |work=Exergoecology Portal\n |year=2008\n |publisher=CIRCE\n |url=http://www.exergoecology.com/exergo/\n}}</ref> With respect to the applications of exergy on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system requires the assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system to do work, it is becoming increasingly imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources,<ref name=\"gcep.stanford\">\n{{cite journal\n |last=Edwards |first=C.\n |title=Development of Low-Exergy-Lost, High-Efficiency Chemical Engines\n |journal=GCEP Technology Report\n |year=2007\n |url=http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/ryhz9TjH9TbEp9qJ290tWQ/2.6.3_edwards_2008_hq.pdf\n |pages=1\u20132\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and how human interference alters this potential.\n\nReferencing the inherent qualities of a system in place of a reference state environment<ref name=\"exergoecology\" /> is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a system, and the reference substances<ref name=\"books.google\">\n{{cite book\n |last=Goswami |first=D. Y.\n |display-authors=etal\n |title=The CRC Handbook of Mechanical Engineering\n |edition=2nd\n |publisher=CRC Press\n |year=2004\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahbJMOhxHNAC&pg=PT231&lpg=PT231&dq=exergy+reference+substances\n |isbn=978-0-8493-0866-6\n}}</ref> that are acceptable within the reference environment.<ref name=\"books.google\" /> This determination allows for the assumption of qualities in a natural state: deviation from these levels may indicate a change in the environment caused by outside sources. There are three kinds of reference substances that are acceptable, due to their proliferation on the planet: gases within the [[atmosphere]], solids within the Earth\u2019s crust, and [[molecules]] or [[ions]] in seawater.<ref name=\"exergoecology\" /> By understanding these basic models, it\u2019s possible to determine the exergy of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of [[solar radiation]] on plant life.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(01)00409-4\n |title=Exergy of solar radiation: Information approach\n |year=2001\n |last1=Svirezhev\n |first1=Y\n |journal=Ecological Modelling\n |volume=145\n |issue=2\u20133\n |pages=101\u2013110\n }}</ref> These basic categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when examining how exergy can be defined through natural resources.\n\nOther qualities within a reference state environment include temperature, pressure, and any number of combinations of substances within a defined area.<ref name=\"exergoecology\" /> Again, the exergy of a system is determined by the potential of that system to do work, so it is necessary to determine the baseline qualities of a system before it is possible to understand the potential of that system. The thermodynamic value of a resource can be found by multiplying the exergy of the resource by the cost of obtaining the resource and processing it.<ref name=\"exergoecology\" />\n\nToday, it is becoming increasingly popular to analyze the environmental impacts of natural resource utilization, especially for energy usage.<ref name=\"books.google_a\">\n{{cite book\n |last=Dincer |first=I.\n |last2=Rosen |first2=M.

The current methods for analyzing the [[exhaust gas|emissions]] from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the exergy of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to examine these with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the [[atmosphere]].<ref name=\"gcep.stanford\" /> In this way, it is easier to determine how human action is affecting the natural environment.\n\n===Applications in sustainability===\nIn [[systems ecology]], researchers sometimes consider the exergy of the current formation of natural resources from a small number of exergy inputs (usually [[solar radiation]], [[tidal force]]s, and [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal heat]]).  This application not only requires assumptions about reference states, but it also requires assumptions about the real environments of the past that might have been close to those reference states.  Can we decide which is the most \"realistic impossibility\" over such a long period of time when we are only speculating about the reality?\n\nFor instance, comparing oil exergy to coal exergy using a common reference state would require geothermal exergy inputs to describe the transition from biological material to fossil fuels during millions of years in the Earth's crust, and solar radiation exergy inputs to describe the material's history before then when it was part of the biosphere.  This would need to be carried out mathematically backwards through time, to a presumed era when the oil and coal could be assumed to be receiving the same exergy inputs from these sources.  A speculation about a past environment is different from assigning a reference state with respect to known environments today. Reasonable guesses about real ancient environments may be made, but they are untestable guesses, and so some regard this application as [[pseudoscience]] or pseudo-engineering.\n\nThe field describes this accumulated exergy in a natural resource over time as [[embodied energy]] with units of the \"embodied joule\" or \"emjoule\".\n\nThe important application of this research is to address [[sustainability]] issues in a quantitative fashion through a [[sustainability measurement]]:\n\n:Does the human production of an economic good deplete the exergy of Earth's [[natural resources]] more quickly than those resources are able to receive exergy?\n\n:If so, how does this compare to the depletion caused by producing the same good (or a different one) using a different set of natural resources?\n\n===Assigning one thermodynamically obtained value to an economic good===\nA technique proposed by systems ecologists is to consolidate the three exergy inputs described in the last section into the single exergy input of solar radiation, and to express the total input of exergy into an economic good as a ''solar embodied joule'' or ''sej''. (''See [[Emergy]]'') Exergy inputs from solar, tidal, and geothermal forces all at one time had their origins at the beginning of the solar system under conditions which could be chosen as an initial reference state, and other speculative reference states could in theory be traced back to that time. With this tool we would be able to answer:\n\n:What fraction of the total human depletion of the Earth's exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?\n\n:What fraction of the total human and non-human depletion of the Earth's exergy is caused by the production of a particular economic good?\n\nNo additional thermodynamic laws are required for this idea, and the principles of [[energetics]] may confuse many issues for those outside the field.  The combination of untestable hypotheses, unfamiliar jargon that contradicts accepted jargon, intense advocacy among its supporters, and some degree of isolation from other disciplines have contributed to this [[protoscience]] being regarded by many as a [[pseudoscience]].  However, its basic tenets are only a further utilization of the exergy concept.\n\n===Implications in the development of complex physical systems===\nA common hypothesis in systems ecology is that the design engineer's observation that a greater capital investment is needed to create a process with increased exergy efficiency is actually the economic result of a fundamental law of nature.  By this view, exergy is the analogue of economic currency in the natural world. The analogy to capital investment is the accumulation of exergy into a system over long periods of time resulting in [[embodied energy]].  The analogy of capital investment resulting in a factory with high exergy efficiency is an increase in natural organizational structures with high exergy efficiency.  (''See [[Maximum power theorem|Maximum power]]'').  Researchers in these fields describe biological [[evolution]] in terms of increases in organism complexity due to the requirement for increased exergy efficiency because of competition for limited sources of exergy.\n\nSome biologists have a similar hypothesis.  A biological system (or a chemical plant) with a number of intermediate compartments and intermediate reactions is more efficient because the process is divided up into many small substeps, and this is closer to the [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible ideal]] of an infinite number of [[infinitesimal]] substeps.  Of course, an excessively large number of intermediate compartments comes at a capital cost that may be too high.\n\nTesting this idea in living organisms or ecosystems is impossible for all practical purposes because of the large time scales and small exergy inputs involved for changes to take place. However, if this idea is correct, it would not be a new fundamental law of nature. It would simply be living systems and ecosystems maximizing their exergy efficiency by utilizing laws of thermodynamics developed in the 19th century.\n\n===Philosophical and cosmological implications===\nSome proponents of utilizing exergy concepts describe them as a [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] or [[ecocentric]] alternative for terms like quality and [[Value theory|value]]. The \"[[deep ecology]]\" movement views [[economic]] usage of these terms as an [[anthropocentric]] [[philosophy]] which should be discarded.  A possible universal thermodynamic concept of value or utility appeals to those with an interest in [[monism]].\n\nFor some, the end result of this line of thinking about tracking exergy into the deep past is a restatement of the [[cosmological argument]] that the universe was once at [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and an input of exergy from some [[First Cause]] created a universe full of available work.  Current science is unable to describe the first 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds of the universe (''See [[Timeline of the Big Bang]]'').  An external reference state is not able to be defined for such an event, and (regardless of its merits), such an argument may be better expressed in terms of [[entropy]].\n\n==Quality of energy types==\nThe ratio of exergy to energy in a substance can be considered a measure of [[energy quality]].  Forms of energy such as macroscopic kinetic energy, electrical energy, and chemical [[Gibbs free energy]] are 100% recoverable as work, and therefore have an exergy equal to their energy.  However, forms of energy such as radiation and thermal energy can not be converted completely to work, and have exergy content less than their energy content.  The exact proportion of exergy in a substance depends on the amount of entropy relative to the surrounding environment as determined by the [[Thermodynamics|Second Law of Thermodynamics]].\n\nExergy is useful when measuring the efficiency of an energy conversion process.  The exergetic, or 2nd&nbsp;Law, efficiency is a ratio of the exergy output divided by the exergy input.  This formulation takes into account the quality of the energy, often offering a more accurate and useful analysis than efficiency estimates only using the [[Thermodynamics|First Law of Thermodynamics]].\n\nWork can be extracted also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When the flow of energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment of the notion of energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, [[Energy]] is a measure of the ability to do work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the [[entropy|second principle of energy flow transformations]] says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.\n\n===Exergy of heat available at a temperature===\n<!--(some of this will be moved up to mathematics section)-->\nMaximal possible conversion of heat to work, or exergy content of heat, depends on the [[temperature]] at which heat is available and the temperature level at which the reject heat can be disposed, that is the temperature of the surrounding. The upper limit for conversion is known as [[Carnot efficiency]] and was discovered by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot]] in 1824. See also [[Carnot heat engine]].\n\nCarnot efficiency is\n\n:<math>\\eta = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H} \\qquad \\mbox{(15)}</math>\n\nwhere ''T''<sub>''H''</sub> is the higher temperature and ''T''<sub>''C''</sub> is the lower temperature, both as [[absolute temperature]]. From Equation 15 it is clear that in order to maximize efficiency one should maximize ''T''<sub>''H''</sub> and minimize ''T''<sub>''C''</sub>.\n\nExergy exchanged is then:\n\n:<math>\\ B = Q(1 - \\frac{T_o}{T_ {source}}) \\qquad \\mbox{(16)}</math>\n\nwhere ''T''<sub>''source''</sub> is the temperature of the heat source, and ''T''<sub>''o''</sub> is the temperature of the surrounding.\n[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|350px|Higher exergy content tends to mean higher energy prices. Here the costs of heating (vertical axis) are compared with the exergy content of different energy carriers (horizontal axis) in Finland. Energy carriers included are district heating (D), ground-source heat pump (G), exhaust air heat pump (A), bioenergy meaning firewood (B), heating oil (O) and direct electric heating (E). Red dots and trend line indicates energy prices for consumers, blue dots and trend line indicates total price for consumers including capital expenditure for the heating system.<ref name=\"Muller\"/>]]\n\n=== Connection with economic value ===\n\nExergy in a sense can be understood as a measure of value of energy. Since high-exergy energy carriers can be used in for more versatile purposes, due to their ability to do more work, they can be postulated to hold more economic value. This can be seen in prices of energy carriers, i.e. high-exergy energy carriers such as electricity tend to be more valuable than low-exergy ones such as various fuels or heat. This has led to substitution of more valuable high-exergy energy carriers with low-exergy energy carriers, when possible. An example is heating systems, where higher investment to heating systems allows using low-exergy energy sources. Thus high-exergy content is being substituted with capital investments.<ref name=\"Muller\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.09.034|title = Estimating exergy prices for energy carriers in heating systems: Country analyses of exergy substitution with capital expenditures|journal = Energy and Buildings|volume = 43|issue = 12|pages = 3609\u20133617|year = 2011|last1 = M\u00fcller|first1 = A.|last2 = Kranzl|first2 = L.|last3 = Tuominen|first3 = P.|last4 = Boelman|first4 = E.|last5 = Molinari|first5 = M.|last6 = Entrop|first6 = A.G.}}</ref>\n\n=== Exergy based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ===\nExergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir.<ref>Rosen, M.

This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported\nand the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. The applicability of the EMIPS methodology relates specifically to transport system and allows an effective coupling with [[life cycle assessment]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Carnot===\nIn 1824, [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] studied the improvements developed for [[steam engines]] by [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] and others. Carnot utilized a purely theoretical perspective for these engines and developed new ideas. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The question has often been raised whether the motive power of heat is unbounded, whether the possible improvements in steam engines have an assignable limit\u2014a limit by which the nature of things will not allow to be passed by any means whatever... In order to consider in the most general way the principle of the production of motion by heat, it must be considered independently of any mechanism or any particular agent. It is necessary to establish principles applicable not only to steam-engines but to all imaginable heat-engines... The production of motion in steam-engines is always accompanied by a circumstance on which we should fix our attention.  This circumstance is the re-establishing of equilibrium\u2026 Imagine two bodies A and B, kept each at a constant temperature, that of A being higher than that of B. These two bodies, to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs...{{ref|carnot1824}}</blockquote>\n\nCarnot next described what is now called the [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot engine]], and proved by a [[thought experiment]] that any heat engine performing better than this engine would be a [[perpetual motion]] machine. Even in the 1820s, there was a long history of science forbidding such devices.  According to Carnot, \"Such a creation is entirely contrary to ideas now accepted, to the [[Classical mechanics|laws of mechanics]] and of sound [[physics]]. It is inadmissible.\"{{ref label|carnot1824|4|a}}\n\nThis description of an upper bound to the work that may be done by an engine was the earliest modern formulation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  Because it involves no mathematics, it still often serves as the entry point for a modern understanding of both the second law and [[entropy]].  Carnot's focus on [[heat engine]]s, [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], and [[heat reservoir]]s is also the best entry point for understanding the closely related concept of exergy.\n\nCarnot believed in the incorrect [[caloric theory]] of heat that was popular during his time, but his thought experiment nevertheless described a fundamental limit of nature. As [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] replaced caloric theory through the early and mid-19th century (''see [[Timeline of thermodynamics]]''), several scientists added mathematical precision to the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]] and developed the concept of [[entropy]].  Carnot's focus on processes at the human scale (above the [[thermodynamic limit]]) led to the most universally applicable concepts in [[physics]].  Entropy and the second-law are applied today in fields ranging from [[quantum mechanics]] to [[physical cosmology]].\n\n===Gibbs===\nIn the 1870s, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] unified a large quantity of 19th century [[thermochemistry]] into one compact theory.  Gibbs's theory incorporated the new concept of a [[chemical potential]] to cause change when distant from a [[chemical equilibrium]] into the older work begun by Carnot in describing thermal and [[mechanical equilibrium]] and their potentials for change.  Gibbs's unifying theory resulted in the [[thermodynamic potential]] [[state function]]s describing differences from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\nIn 1873, Gibbs derived the mathematics of \"available energy of the body and medium\" into the form it has today.{{ref label|gibbs1873|3|a}} (See the equations [[Exergy#Important equations|above]]).  The physics describing exergy has changed little since that time.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|energy}}\n* [[Entropy production]]\n* [[Energy: world resources and consumption]]\n* [[Emergy]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n#{{note|perrot}} {{Cite book| author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}\n#{{note|lowex}} {{cite web| title=lowexnet | url=http://www.lowex.net}}\n#{{note|rant56}}{{note label|rant56|2|a}} {{Cite journal| author= Z.

For the history of the modern [[nation state]], see [[History of modern Greece]].}}\n{{History of Greece}}\n{{Culture of Greece}}\n\nThe '''history of Greece''' encompasses the history of the territory of the modern nation state of [[Greece]] as well as that of the [[Greeks|Greek people]] and the areas they inhabited and ruled historically. The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages and as a result the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes. Generally, the history of Greece is divided into the following periods:\n\n*''[[Neolithic Greece]]''; covering a period beginning with the establishment of agricultural societies in 7000 BC and ending in 3200/3100 BC, \n*''[[Helladic period|Helladic]]'' ([[Minoan chronology|Minoan]] or [[Bronze Age]]); chronology covering a period beginning with the transition to a metal-based economy in 3200/3100 BC to the rise and fall of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek palaces]] spanning roughly five centuries (1600\u20131100 BC), \n*''[[Ancient Greece]]''; covering a period from the fall of the Mycenaean civilization in 1100 BC to 146 BC spanning multiple sub-periods including the [[Greek Dark Ages]] (or Iron Age, Homeric Age),  [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] and the [[Hellenistic period]], \n*''[[Roman Greece]]''; covering a period from the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] in 146 BC to 324 AD, \n*''[[Byzantine Greece]]''; covering a period from the establishment of the capital city of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Constantinople]], in 324 AD until the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 AD,\n*''[[Frankokratia|Frankish/Latin Greece]]; (including the [[Stato da Mar|Venetian possessions]])'' covering a period from the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204) to 1797, year of disestablishment of the Venetian Republic,\n*''[[Ottoman Greece]]''; covering a period from 1453 up until the [[Greek Revolution of 1821]],\n*''[[Modern Greece]]''; covering a period from 1821 to present.\n\nAt its cultural and geographical peak, [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] spread from [[Egypt]] all the way to the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in [[Afghanistan]]. Since then, Greek minorities have remained in former Greek territories (e.g. [[Turkey]], [[Albania]], [[Italy]], [[Libya]], [[Levant]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and Greek [[emigrants]] have assimilated into differing societies across the globe (e.g. [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[Northern Europe]], [[South Africa]]). Nowadays most Greeks live in the modern states of Greece (independent since 1821) and [[Cyprus]].\n\n==Prehistoric Greece==\n{{main|Prehistoric Balkans|Prehistory of Anatolia|Prehistoric Cyprus}}\n{{see also|Dimini|Sesklo|Dispilio|Theopetra cave}}\n\n===Neolithic to Bronze Age (7000\u20131100 BC)===\n{{main|Neolithic Europe|Neolithic Greece|Pelasgians|Helladic period|Proto-Greek}}\n\n[[File:Proto Greek Area reconstruction.png|thumb|275px|[[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] linguistic area according to linguist [[Vladimir I.

[[Mycenaean Greece]] is the [[Late Helladic]] Bronze Age civilization of [[Ancient Greece]] and it is the historical setting of the [[Epic poetry|epic]]s of [[Homer]] and most of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Greek polytheism|religion]]. The Mycenaean period takes its name from the archaeological site [[Mycenae]] in the northeastern [[Argolid]], in the [[Peloponnesos]] of southern Greece. [[Athens]], [[Pylos]], [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], and [[Tiryns]] are also important Mycenaean sites.\n\nMycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior [[aristocracy]]. Around 1400 BC, the [[Mycenaeans]] extended their control to [[Crete]], center of the [[Minoan civilization]], and adopted a form of the Minoan script called [[Linear A]] to write their early form of [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Mycenaean-era script is called [[Linear B]], which was deciphered in 1952 by [[Michael Ventris]]. The Mycenaeans buried their nobles in [[beehive tombs]] (''tholoi''), large circular burial chambers with a high-vaulted roof and straight entry passage lined with stone. They often buried daggers or some other form of military equipment with the deceased. The nobility were often buried with gold masks, tiaras, armor and jeweled weapons. Mycenaeans were buried in a sitting position, and some of the nobility underwent [[mummy|mummification]].\n\nAround 1100\u20131050 BC, the Mycenaean civilization collapsed. Numerous cities were sacked and the region entered what historians see as a \"[[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]]\". During this period, Greece experienced a decline in [[population]] and [[literacy]]. The Greeks themselves have traditionally blamed this decline on an [[Dorian invasion|invasion]] by another wave of Greek people, the [[Dorians]], although there is scant archaeological evidence for this view.\n\n==Ancient Greece (1100\u2013146 BC)==\n{{main|Ancient Greece}}\n{{further|Classical Anatolia|Ancient history of Cyprus}}\n[[File:Dodona Theater - Gallery version.jpg|thumb|240px|The ancient theatre of [[Dodona]]]]\n[[File:Hephaistos Temple.JPG|thumb|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in Athens]]\n\n[[Ancient Greece]] refers to a period of Greek history that lasted from the Dark Ages to the end of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] (circa 600 AD). In common usage it refers to all Greek history before the [[Roman Empire]], but historians use the term more precisely. Some writers include the periods of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[History of Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilizations, while others argue that these civilizations were so different from later Greek cultures that they should be classed separately. Traditionally, the Ancient Greek period was taken to begin with the date of the first [[Olympic Games]] in 776 BC, but most historians now extend the term back to about 1000 BC.\n\nThe traditional date for the end of the Classical Greek period is the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC. The period that follows is classed as [[History of Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]]. Not everyone treats the Classical Greek and Hellenic periods as distinct; however, and some writers treat the Ancient Greek civilization as a continuum running until the advent of [[Christianity]] in the 3rd century AD.\n\nAncient Greece is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of [[Western world|Western civilization]]. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the [[Roman Empire]], which carried a version of it to many parts of [[Europe]]. Ancient Greek civilization has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, [[philosophy]], art and architecture of the modern world, particularly during the [[Renaissance]] in Western Europe and again during various [[Classicism|neo-classical]] revivals in 18th and 19th-century Europe and the [[Americas]].\n\n===Iron Age (1100\u2013800 BC)===\n{{main|Greek Dark Ages}}\n{{further|Protogeometric art}}\n\nThe ''Greek Dark Ages'' (ca. 1100 BC\u2013800 BC) refers to the period of Greek history from the presumed [[Dorian invasion]] and end of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] in the 11th century BC to the rise of the first [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s in the 9th century BC and the epics of [[Homer]] and earliest writings in [[Greek alphabet|alphabetic]] [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 8th century BC.\n\nThe collapse of the Mycenaean coincided with the fall of several other large empires in the near east, most notably the [[Hittites|Hittite]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]. The cause may be attributed to an invasion of the [[Sea People]] wielding iron weapons. When the Dorians came down into Greece they also were equipped with superior iron weapons, easily dispersing the already weakened Mycenaeans. The period that follows these events is collectively known as the Greek Dark Ages.\n\nKings ruled throughout this period until eventually they were replaced with an aristocracy, then still later, in some areas, an aristocracy within an aristocracy\u2014an elite of the elite. Warfare shifted from a focus on cavalry to a great emphasis on infantry. Due to its cheapness of production and local availability, iron replaced bronze as the metal of choice in the manufacturing of tools and weapons. Slowly equality grew among the different sects of people, leading to the dethronement of the various Kings and the rise of the family.\n\nAt the end of this period of stagnation, the Greek civilization was engulfed in a renaissance that spread the Greek world as far as the [[Black Sea]] and [[Spain]]. Writing was relearned from the [[Phoenicians]], eventually spreading north into [[Italy]] and the [[Gauls]].\n\n===Archaic Greece===\n{{main|Archaic Greece}}\n{{further|Orientalizing Period|Geometric Art}}\nIn the 8th century BC, Greece began to emerge from the Dark Ages which followed the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Literacy had been lost and [[Linear B|Mycenaean script]] forgotten, but the Greeks adopted the [[Phoenician alphabet]], modifying it to create the [[Greek alphabet]]. From about the 9th century BC, written records begin to appear.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2014|loc=3: The End of the Mycenaean World and Its Aftermath (The Loss and Recovery of Writing)}}.</ref> Greece was divided into many small self-governing communities, a pattern largely dictated by Greek geography, where every island, valley and plain is cut off from its neighbours by the sea or mountain ranges.<ref>{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|pp=10\u201311}}.</ref>\n\nThe Archaic period can be understood as the [[Orientalizing period]], when Greece was at the fringe, but not under the sway, of the budding [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. Greece adopted significant amounts of cultural elements from the Orient, in art as well as in religion and mythology. Archaeologically, Archaic Greece is marked by [[Geometric pottery]].\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{main|Classical Greece}} \n{{further|Classical Athens}}\n[[File:3393 - Athens - Sto\u00e0 of Attalus - Herodotus - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Herodotus]] in [[Stoa of Attalus]], one of the earliest nameable historians whose work survives.]]\n[[File:Le\u00f3nidas en las Term\u00f3pilas, por Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|''[[Leonidas]] at [[Thermopylae]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]].]]\n\nThe basic unit of politics in Ancient Greece was the [[polis]], sometimes translated as [[city-state]]. \"Politics\" literally means \"the things of the polis\" where each city-state was independent, at least in theory. Some city-states might be subordinate to others (a colony traditionally deferred to its mother city), some might have had governments wholly dependent upon others (the [[Thirty Tyrants]] in [[Athens]] was imposed by [[Sparta]] following the [[Peloponnesian War]]), but the titularly supreme power in each city was located within that city. This meant that when Greece went to war (e.g., against the [[Persian Empire]]), it took the form of an alliance going to war. It also gave ample opportunity for wars within Greece between different cities.\n\n====Persian Wars====\nTwo major wars shaped the Classical Greek world. The [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] (500\u2013448 BC) are recounted in [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]''. By the late 6th century BC, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] ruled over all Greek city states and had made territorial gains in the [[Balkans]] and Eastern Europe proper as well. The [[Ionia]]n Greek cities [[Ionian Revolt|revolted]] from the [[Persian Empire]], through a chain of events, and were supported by some of the mainland cities, eventually led by [[History of Athens|Athens]]. To punish mainland Greece for its support of the Ionian cities (which uprising by that time had already been quelled) [[Darius I]] launched the [[First Persian invasion of Greece]], which lasted from 492 BC till 490 BC. The Persian general [[Megabyzus]] re-subjugated [[Thrace]] and conquered [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] in the early stages of the war,<ref>{{harvnb|Olbrycht|2011|pp=343}}.</ref> but the war eventually ended with a Greek victory. Darius's successor, [[Xerxes I]], launched the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]]. Even though at a crucial point in the war the Persians briefly overran northern and central Greece,<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|2007|p=3}}.</ref> the Greek city-states once again managed to turn this war into a victory. The notable battles of the Greco-Persian Wars include [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].\n\nTo prosecute the war and then to defend Greece from further Persian attack, Athens founded the [[Delian League]] in 477 BC. Initially, each city in the League would contribute ships and soldiers to a common army, but in time Athens allowed (and then compelled) the smaller cities to contribute funds so that it could supply their quota of ships. Secession from the League could be punished. Following military reversals against the Persians, the treasury was moved from [[Delos]] to Athens, further strengthening the latter's control over the League. The Delian League was eventually referred to pejoratively as the Athenian Empire.\n\nIn 458 BC, while the Persian Wars were still ongoing, war broke out between the Delian League and the [[Peloponnesian League]], comprising [[Sparta]] and its allies. After some inconclusive fighting, the two sides signed a peace in 447 BC. That peace was stipulated to last thirty years: instead it held only until 431 BC, with the onset of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Our main sources concerning this war are [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' and [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hellenica]]''.\n\n====Peloponnesian War====\nThe war began over a dispute between [[Corcyra]] and [[Epidamnus]]. [[Corinth]] intervened on the Epidamnian side. Fearful lest Corinth capture the Corcyran navy (second only to the Athenian in size), Athens intervened. It prevented Corinth from landing on Corcyra at the [[Battle of Sybota]], laid siege to [[Battle of Potidaea|Potidaea]], and forbade all commerce with Corinth's closely situated ally, [[Megara]] (the [[Megarian decree]]).\n\nThere was disagreement among the Greeks as to which party violated the treaty between the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues, as Athens was technically defending a new ally. The Corinthians turned to Sparta for aid. Fearing the growing might of Athens, and witnessing Athens' willingness to use it against the Megarians (the embargo would have ruined them), Sparta declared the treaty to have been violated and the Peloponnesian War began in earnest.\n\nThe first stage of the war (known as the Archidamian War for the Spartan king, [[Archidamus II]]) lasted until 421 BC with the signing of the [[Peace of Nicias]]. The Athenian general [[Pericles]] recommended that his city fight a defensive war, avoiding battle against the superior land forces led by Sparta, and importing everything needful by maintaining its powerful navy. Athens would simply outlast Sparta, whose citizens feared to be out of their city for long lest the [[helots]] revolt.\n\nThis strategy required that Athens endure regular [[siege]]s, and in 430 BC it was visited with an awful [[Plague of Athens|plague that killed about a quarter of its people]], including Pericles. With Pericles gone, less conservative elements gained power in the city and Athens went on the offensive. It captured 300\u2013400 Spartan [[hoplite]]s at the [[Battle of Pylos]]. This represented a significant fraction of the Spartan fighting force which the latter decided it could not afford to lose. Meanwhile, Athens had suffered humiliating defeats at [[Battle of Delium|Delium]] and [[Battle of Amphipolis|Amphipolis]]. The Peace of Nicias concluded with Sparta recovering its hostages and Athens recovering the city of [[Amphipolis]].\n\n[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|350px|Map of the [[Delian League]] (\"Athenian Empire or Alliance\") in 431 BC, just prior to the [[Peloponnesian War]].]]\n\nThose who signed the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC swore to uphold it for fifty years.  The second stage of the Peloponnesian War began in 415 BC when Athens embarked on the [[Sicilian Expedition]] to support an ally ([[Segesta]]) attacked by [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and to conquer [[Sicily]]. Initially, Sparta was reluctant, but [[Alcibiades]], the Athenian general who had argued for the Sicilian Expedition, defected to the Spartan cause upon being accused of grossly impious acts and convinced them that they could not allow Athens to subjugate Syracuse. The campaign ended in disaster for the Athenians.\n\nAthens' Ionian possessions rebelled with the support of Sparta, as advised by Alcibiades.  In 411 BC, an oligarchical revolt in Athens held out the chance for peace, but the Athenian navy, which remained committed to the democracy, refused to accept the change and continued fighting in Athens' name. The navy recalled Alcibiades (who had been forced to abandon the Spartan cause after reputedly seducing the wife of [[Agis II]], a Spartan king) and made him its head. The oligarchy in Athens collapsed and Alcibiades reconquered what had been lost.\n\nIn 407 BC, Alcibiades was replaced following a minor naval defeat at the [[Battle of Notium]]. The Spartan general [[Lysander]], having fortified his city's naval power, won victory after victory. Following the [[Battle of Arginusae]], which Athens won but was prevented by bad weather from rescuing some of its sailors, Athens executed or exiled eight of its top naval commanders. Lysander followed with a crushing blow at the [[Battle of Aegospotami]] in 405 BC which almost destroyed the Athenian fleet. Athens surrendered one year later, ending the Peloponnesian War.\n\nThe war had left devastation in its wake. Discontent with the [[Spartan hegemony]] that followed (including the fact that it ceded [[Ionia]] and [[Cyprus]] to the [[Persian Empire]] at the conclusion of the [[Corinthian War]] (395\u2013387 BC); see [[Treaty of Antalcidas]]) induced the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] to attack. Their general, [[Epaminondas]], crushed Sparta at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BC, inaugurating a period of Theban dominance in Greece. In 346 BC, unable to prevail in its ten-year war with [[Phocis]], Thebes called upon [[Philip II of Macedon]] for aid. [[Macedon]] quickly forced the city states into being united by the [[League of Corinth]] which led to the conquering of the Persian Empire and the Hellenistic Age had begun.\n\n===Hellenistic Greece===\n{{main|Hellenistic Period|Hellenistic Greece}}\n[[File:DemetriosPolyorchetes.jpg|thumb|Coin showing [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]].]]\nThe Hellenistic period of Greek history begins with the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC and ends with the [[annexation]] of the Greek peninsula and islands by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in 146 BC. Although the establishment of Roman rule did not break the continuity of Hellenistic society and culture, which remained essentially unchanged until the advent of [[Christianity]], it did mark the end of Greek political independence.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the importance of \"Greece proper\" (that is, the territory of modern Greece) within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centres of Hellenistic culture were [[Alexandria]] and [[Antioch]], capitals of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid Syria]]. (See [[Hellenistic civilization]] for the history of Greek culture outside Greece in this period.)\n\nAthens and her allies revolted against [[Macedon]] upon hearing that Alexander had died, but were defeated within a year in the [[Lamian War]]. Meanwhile, a struggle for power broke out among Alexander's generals, which resulted in the break-up of his empire and the establishment of a number of new kingdoms (see the [[Wars of the Diadochi]]). [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] was left with [[Egypt]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] with the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and points east. Control of Greece, [[Thrace]], and [[Anatolia]] was contested, but by 298 BC the [[Antigonid dynasty]] had supplanted the [[Antipatrid dynasty|Antipatrid]].\n\n[[File:Stag hunt mosaic, Pella.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stag Hunt Mosaic]] at the [[Archaeological Museum of Pella]] (3rd BC)]]\nMacedonian control of the city-states was intermittent, with a number of revolts. [[Athens]], [[Rhodes]], [[Pergamum]] and other Greek states retained substantial independence, and joined the [[Aetolian League]] as a means of defending it and restoring democracy in their states, whereas they saw Macedon as a tyrannical kingdom because of the fact they had not adopted democracy. The [[Achaean League]], while nominally subject to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] was in effect independent, and controlled most of southern Greece. [[Sparta]] also remained independent, but generally refused to join any league.\n\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|300px|The major [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] realms included the [[Diadochi|Diadoch kingdoms]]:\n{{legend|#787CAD|Kingdom of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]}}\n{{legend|#50A249|Kingdom of [[Cassander]]}}\n{{legend|#C38833|Kingdom of [[Lysimachus]]}}\n{{legend|#C3B933|Kingdom of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]}}\n{{legend|#AF3662|[[Epirus]]}}\nAlso shown on the map:\n{{legend|#85AB54|[[Greek colonies]]}}\n{{legend|#A361BD|[[Carthage]] (non-Greek)}}\n{{legend|#70A9BE|[[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (non-Greek)}}\nThe orange areas were often in dispute after 281 BC. The [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] occupied some of this area. Not shown: [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].]]\nIn 267 BC, [[Ptolemy II]] persuaded the Greek cities to revolt against Macedon, in what became the [[Chremonidean War]], after the Athenian leader [[Chremonides]]. The cities were defeated and Athens lost her independence and her democratic institutions. This marked the end of Athens as a political actor, although it remained the largest, wealthiest and most cultivated city in Greece. In 225 BC, Macedon defeated the Egyptian fleet at [[Kos|Cos]] and brought the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, except Rhodes, under its rule as well.\n\n[[Sparta]] remained hostile to the Achaeans, and in 227 BC invaded [[Achaea]] and seized control of the League. The remaining Achaeans preferred distant Macedon to nearby Sparta, and allied with the former. In 222 BC, the Macedonian army defeated the Spartans and annexed their city\u2014the first time Sparta had ever been occupied by a different state.\n\n[[Philip V of Macedon]] was the last Greek ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the ever-increasing power of [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Under his auspices, the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought conflict between Macedon and the Greek leagues to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum.\n\nIn 215 BC, however, Philip formed an alliance with Rome's enemy [[Carthage]]. Rome promptly lured the Achaean cities away from their nominal loyalty to Philip, and formed alliances with Rhodes and Pergamum, now the strongest power in [[Asia Minor]]. The [[First Macedonian War]] broke out in 212 BC, and ended inconclusively in 205 BC, but Macedon was now marked as an enemy of Rome.\n\nIn 202 BC, Rome defeated Carthage, and was free to turn her attention eastwards. In 198 BC, the [[Second Macedonian War]] broke out because Rome saw Macedon as a potential ally of the [[Seleucid Empire]], the greatest power in the east. Philip's allies in Greece deserted him and in 197 BC he was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]] by the Roman proconsul [[Titus Quinctius Flaminius]].\n\nLuckily for the Greeks, Flaminius was a moderate man and an admirer of Greek culture. Philip had to surrender his fleet and become a Roman ally, but was otherwise spared. At the [[Isthmian Games]] in 196 BC, Flaminius declared all the Greek cities free, although Roman garrisons were placed at Corinth and [[Chalcis]]. But the freedom promised by Rome was an illusion. All the cities except Rhodes were enrolled in a new League which Rome ultimately controlled, and aristocratic constitutions were favoured and actively promoted.\n\n==Roman Greece (146 BC\u2013324 AD)==\n{{main|Roman Empire|Greco-Roman world|Roman Greece}}\n[[File:Tony robert-fleury, l'ultimo giorno di corinto, ante 1870.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Scene of the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]]: last day before the Roman legions looted and burned the city of [[Corinth]]. ''The last day on Corinth'', [[Tony Robert-Fleury]], 1870]]\n[[File:Patras Roman Odeon 9281478.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman Odeon of [[Patras]]]]\n\nMilitarily, Greece itself declined to the point that the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] conquered the land (168 BC onwards), though Greek culture would in turn conquer Roman life. Although the period of Roman rule in Greece is conventionally dated as starting from the sacking of [[Corinth]] by the Roman [[Lucius Mummius]] in 146 BC, Macedonia had already come under Roman control with the defeat of its king, [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], by the Roman [[Aemilius Paullus]] at [[Pydna]] in 168 BC.\n\nThe Romans divided the region into four smaller republics, and in 146 BC Macedonia officially became a province, with its capital at [[Thessalonica]]. The rest of the Greek [[city-states]] gradually and eventually paid homage to Rome ending their ''de jure'' autonomy as well. The Romans left local administration to the [[Greeks]] without making any attempt to abolish traditional political patterns. The [[agora]] in [[Athens]] continued to be the centre of civic and political life.\n\n[[Caracalla]]'s decree in 212 AD, the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'', extended citizenship outside [[Italy]] to all free adult men in the entire [[Roman Empire]], effectively raising provincial populations to equal status with the city of [[Rome]] itself. The importance of this decree is historical, not political. It set the basis for integration where the economic and judicial mechanisms of the state could be applied throughout the Mediterranean as was once done from Latium into all Italy. In practice of course, integration did not take place uniformly. Societies already integrated with Rome, such as Greece, were favored by this decree, in comparison with those far away, too poor or just too alien such as Britain, Palestine or Egypt.\n\nCaracalla's decree did not set in motion the processes that led to the transfer of power from Italy and the West to Greece and the East, but rather accelerated them, setting the foundations for the millennium-long rise of Greece, in the form of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], as a major power in [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]] in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n==Middle Ages==\n===Byzantine rule (324\u20131204 AD)===\n{{main|Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Greece|Barbarian invasions}}\n{{See also|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism|Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire}}\n{{Further|Byzantine Anatolia|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}\n[[Image:Greece meteora monasteries.JPG|thumb|Byzantine era monasteries in [[Meteora]]]]\n[[File:Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg|thumb|240px|Depiction of the [[Greek fire]] by [[John Skylitzes]]' [[Madrid Skylitzes|Chronicle]] (late 11th century).]]\n\nThe history of the East Roman or Byzantine Empire is described by [[Byzantinist]] August Heisenberg as the history of \"the Christianized Roman empire of the Greek nation\".<ref>{{harvnb|Winnifrith|Murray|1983|loc=p. 113: \"For August Heisenberg the Byzantine empire was 'the Christianised Roman empire of the Greek nation'.\"}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Heisenberg|Kromayer|von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|1923|loc=\"Staat und Gesellschaft des Byzantinischen Reiches\", p. 364}}: \"Byzanz ist das christlich gewordene R\u00f6merreich griechischer Nation.\"</ref> The division of the empire into East and West and the subsequent collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] were developments that constantly accentuated the position of the Greeks in the empire and eventually allowed them to become identified with it altogether. The leading role of [[Constantinople]] began when [[Constantine the Great]] turned [[Byzantium]] into the new capital of the Roman Empire, from then on to be known as [[Constantinople]], placing the city at the center of Hellenism, a beacon for the [[Greeks]] that lasted to the modern era.\n\nThe figures of Constantine the Great and [[Justinian I|Justinian]] dominated during 324\u2013610. Assimilating the Roman tradition, the emperors sought to offer the basis for later developments and for the formation of the Byzantine Empire. Efforts to secure the borders of the Empire and to restore the Roman territories marked the early centuries. At the same time, the definitive formation and establishment of the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] doctrine, but also a series of conflicts resulting from heresies that developed within the boundaries of the empire, marked the early period of Byzantine history.\n\nIn the first period of the middle Byzantine era (610\u2013867), the empire was attacked both by old enemies ([[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Lombards]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]]) as well as by new ones, appearing for the first time in history ([[Arabs]], [[Bulgars]]). The main characteristic of this period was that the enemy attacks were not localized to the border areas of the state but they were extended deep beyond, even threatening the capital itself.\n\nThe attacks of the Slavs lost their periodical and temporary character and became permanent settlements that transformed into new states, initially hostile to Constantinople until their [[christianization]]. Those states were referred by the Byzantines as ''[[Sclavinia]]s''.\n\nChanges were also observed in the internal structure of the empire which was dictated by both external and internal conditions. The predominance of the small free farmers, the expansion of the military estates and the development of the system of [[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]]s, brought to completion developments that had started in the previous period. Changes were noted also in the sector of administration: the administration and society had become immiscibly [[Greeks|Greek]], while the restoration of Orthodoxy after the [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] movement, allowed the successful resumption of missionary action among neighboring peoples and their placement within the sphere of Byzantine cultural influence. During this period the state was geographically reduced and economically damaged, since it lost wealth-producing regions; however, it obtained greater lingual, dogmatic and cultural homogeneity.\n\nFrom the late 8th century, the Empire began to recover from the devastating impact of successive invasions, and the reconquest of Greek peninsula began. Greeks from [[Sicily]] and [[Asia Minor]] were brought in as settlers. The [[Slavs]] were either driven out to Asia Minor or assimilated and the Sclavinias were eliminated. By the middle of the 9th century, Greece was Byzantine again, and the cities began to recover due to improved security and the restoration of effective central control.\n\n===Economic prosperity===\n[[File:Wallsthess.jpg|Part of the walls|thumb|Part of the Byzantine [[Walls of Thessaloniki]]]]\n\nWhen the Byzantine Empire was rescued from a period of crisis by the resolute leadership of the three [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]] emperors [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios]], [[John II Komnenos|John]] and [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel]] in the 12th century, Greece prospered. Recent research has revealed that this period was a time of significant growth in the rural economy, with rising population levels and extensive tracts of new agricultural land being brought into production. The widespread construction of new rural churches is a strong indication that prosperity was being generated even in remote areas.\n\nA steady increase in population led to a higher population density, and there is good evidence that the demographic increase was accompanied by the revival of towns. According to Alan Harvey's ''Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire 900\u20131200'', towns expanded significantly in the twelfth century. Archaeological evidence shows an increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a \u2018notable upsurge\u2019 in new towns. Archaeological evidence tells us that many of the medieval towns, including [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe growth of the towns attracted the [[Venice|Venetians]], and this interest in trade appears to have further increased economic prosperity in Greece. Certainly, the Venetians and others were active traders in the ports of the [[Holy Land]], and they made a living out of shipping goods between the [[Crusader states|Crusader]] Kingdoms of [[Outremer]] and the West while also trading extensively with Byzantium and [[Egypt]].\n\n===Artistic revival===\n[[File:20090803 hosiosloukas36.jpg|thumb|180px|Exterior view of [[Hosios Loukas]] monastery, artistic example of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]]]]\n\nA kind of \"Renaissance\" of the [[Byzantine art]], as described by scholars, began since the 10th century. Many of the most important Byzantine churches in and around Athens, for example, were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of urbanisation in Greece during this period. There was also a revival in the mosaic art with artists showing great interest in depicting natural landscapes with wild animals and scenes from the hunt. Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. With its love of luxury and passion for color, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the Christian world.\n\nBeautiful [[Byzantine silk|silks from the workshops of Constantinople]] also portrayed in dazzling color animals\u2014lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins\u2014confronting each other, or representing Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase. The eyes of many patrons were attracted and the economy of Greece grew. In the provinces, regional schools of Architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences. All this suggests that there was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work.\n\nYet the marvelous expansion of Byzantine art during this period, one of the most remarkable facts in the history of the empire, did not stop there. From the 10th to the 12th century, Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at Torcello clearly show their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the Palatine Chapel, the Martorana at Palermo, and the cathedral of Cefalu, together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, prove the influence of Byzantium on the Norman Court of Sicily in the 12th century.\n\nHispano-Moorish art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. Romanesque art owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of Kiev, Venetian doges, abbots of [[Monte Cassino]], merchants of Amalfi, and the Norman kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the 12th century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centers dedicated to its production.\n\n===The Fourth Crusade (1204)===\n{{main|Fourth Crusade|Frankokratia}}\n[[File:LatinEmpire2.png|thumb|350px|The division of the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the [[Fourth Crusade]].]]\n\nThe year 1204 marks the beginning of the Late Byzantine period when [[Constantinople]] and a number of Byzantine territories were conquered by the Latins during the [[Fourth Crusade]]. During this period, a number of Byzantine Greek successor states emerged such as the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], such as number of Frankish/Latin Catholic states ([[Principality of Achaea]], [[Duchy of Athens]], [[Duchy of the Archipelago]], [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] etc.) In Latin-occupied territories, elements of feudality entered medieval Greek life.\n\n===From partial Byzantine restoration to 1453===\nThe [[Latin Empire]], however, lasted only 57 years, when in 1261 Constantinople was reclaimed by the [[Byzantine Greeks]] and the Byzantine Empire was restored. However, in mainland Greece and islands various Latin possessions continued to exist. From 1261 onwards, Byzantium underwent a gradual weakening of its internal structures and the reduction of its territories from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasions culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] on May 29, 1453. The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople resulted in the official end of both the Eastern Roman empire and the Byzantine period of Greek history.\n\n==Venetian and Ottoman rule (15th century\u20131821 AD)==\n{{main|Stato da M\u00e0r|Ottoman Greece|Septinsular Republic|Modern Greek Enlightenment|Greek War of Independence}}\n[[File:Navarino.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Navarino]], on October 1827, marked the effective end of Ottoman rule in Greece.]]\n\nWhen the [[Ottomans]] arrived, two Greek migrations occurred. The first migration entailed the Greek [[intelligentsia]] migrating to Western Europe and influencing the advent of the Renaissance. The second migration entailed Greeks leaving the plains of the Greek peninsula and resettling in the mountains.<ref>{{harvnb|Vacalopoulos|1976|loc=p. 45: \"The Greeks never lost their desire to escape from the heavy hand of the Turks, bad government, the impressment of their children, the increasingly heavy taxation, and the sundry caprices of the conqueror. Indeed, anyone studying the last two centuries of Byzantine rule cannot help being struck by the propensity of the Greeks to flee misfortune. The routes they chiefly took were: first, to the predominantly Greek territories, which were either still free or Frankish-controlled (that is to say, the Venetian fortresses in the Despotate of Morea, as well as in the Aegean and Ionian Islands) or else to Italy and the West generally; second, to remote mountain districts in the interior where the conqueror's yoke was not yet felt.\"}}</ref> The [[millet system]] contributed to the ethnic cohesion of Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the Ottoman Empire based on religion.\n\nThe Greeks living in the plains during Ottoman rule were either Christians who dealt with the burdens of foreign rule or crypto-Christians (Greek Muslims who were secret practitioners of the Greek Orthodox faith). Some Greeks became [[crypto-Christians]] to avoid heavy taxes and at the same time express their identity by maintaining their ties to the Greek Orthodox Church. However, Greeks who converted to [[Islam]] and were not crypto-Christians were deemed \"Turks\" (Muslims) in the eyes of Orthodox Greeks, even if they didn't adopt the Turkish language. The Ottomans ruled most of Greece until the early 19th century.\n\nThe first semi-independent, self-governed after centuries, Greek state was established 21 years before the outbreak of the Greek revolution. The [[Septinsular Republic]], with [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] as capital, was established in 1800.\n\n==Modern Greek nation state (1821\u2013present)==\n{{see|History of modern Greece|Kingdom of Greece|Megali Idea}}\n[[File:Nafplion view from Palamidi castle.JPG|thumb|[[Nafplio]] became the first capital of independent Greece during the governance of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]]]\n\nIn the early months of 1821, the Greeks [[Greek War of Independence|declared their independence]], but did not achieve it until 1829. The Great Powers first shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the ''status quo'' of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but soon changed their stance. Scores of non-Greeks [[philhellenes]] volunteered to fight for the cause, including [[Lord Byron]].\n\nOn October 20, 1827, a combined British, French and Russian naval force destroyed the Ottoman and Egyptian armada. The Russian minister of foreign affairs, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], himself a Greek, returned home as President of the new [[First Hellenic Republic|Republic]]. The first capital of the independent [[Greece]] was temporarily [[Aigina]] (1828\u20131829) and later officially [[Nafplion]] (1828\u20131834). After his assassination, the European powers turned Greece into a monarchy; the first King, [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], came from [[Bavaria]] and the second, [[George I of Greece|George I]], from [[Denmark]]. In 1834, King Otto transferred the capital to Athens.\n\n[[File:Territorial Expansion of Greece from 1832\u20131947.gif|thumb|left|340px|The territorial evolution of [[Kingdom of Greece]] until 1947]]\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, Greece sought to enlarge its boundaries to include the ethnic Greek population of the Ottoman Empire. Greece played a peripheral role in the [[Crimean War]]. When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, Greek leaders saw an opportunity to expand North and South into Ottoman areas that had a Christian majority. However, Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. The French and British seized its major port and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Greek efforts to cause insurrections failed as they were easily crushed by Ottoman forces. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war. The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate. The [[Ionian Islands]] were given by Britain upon the arrival of the new King [[George I of Greece|George I]] in 1863 and [[Thessaly]] was ceded by the Ottomans in 1880.\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:King George of Hellenes.jpg|thumb|180px|[[George I of Greece|George I]] was King of the Hellenes from 1862 to 1913]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, modernization transformed the social structure of Greece. The population grew rapidly, putting heavy pressure on the system of small farms with low productivity. Overall, population density more than doubled from 41 persons per square mile in 1829 to 114 in 1912 (16 to 44 per km<sup>2</sup>). One response was emigration to the United States, with a quarter million people leaving between 1906 and 1914. Entrepreneurs found numerous business opportunities in the retail and restaurant sectors of American cities; some sent money back to their families, others returned with hundreds of dollars, enough to purchase a farm or a small business in the old village. The urban population tripled from 8% in 1853 to 24% in 1907. Athens grew from a village of 6000 people in 1834, when it became the capital, to 63,000 in 1879, 111,000 in 1896, and 167,000 in 1907.<ref>{{harvnb|Myrsiades|Myrsiades|1992|pp=32\u201333}}.</ref>\n\nIn Athens and other cities, men arriving from rural areas set up workshops and stores, creating a middle class. They joined with bankers, professional men, university students, and military officers, to demand reform and modernization of the political and economic system. Athens became the center of the merchant marine, which quadrupled from 250,000 tons in 1875 to more than 1,000,000 tons in 1915.

In August 1936, Prime Minister [[Ioannis Metaxas|Metaxas]], with the agreement of the king, suspended the parliament and established the quasi-fascist [[Metaxas regime]].\n\nDespite the country's numerically small and ill-equipped armed forces, Greece made a decisive contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts in [[World War II]]. At the start of the war, Greece sided with the Allies and refused to give in to Italian demands. Italy invaded Greece by way of Albania on 28 October 1940, but Greek troops repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle (see [[Greco-Italian War]]). This marked the first Allied victory in the war.\n\nPrimarily to secure his strategic southern flank, German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] reluctantly stepped in and launched the [[Battle of Greece]] in April 1941. Axis units from Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy successfully invaded Greece, through Yugoslavia, forcing out the Greek defenders. The Greek government eventually decided to stop the fighting and thus stopped sending ammunition and supplies to the northern front and the defenders were easily overrun. The Greek government then proceeded, as the Nazi forces came towards the capital of Athens, to leave for Crete and then Cairo, Egypt.\n\nOn 20 May 1941, the Germans attempted to [[Battle of Crete|seize Crete]] with a large attack by [[paratroop]]ers, with the aim of reducing the threat of a counter-offensive by Allied forces in [[Egypt]], but faced heavy resistance. The Greek campaign might have delayed German military plans against Soviet Union, and it is argued that had the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] started on 20 May 1941 instead of 22 June 1941, the Nazi assault against the Soviet Union might have succeeded. The heavy losses of German paratroopers led the Germans to launch no further large-scale air-invasions.\n\nDuring the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], thousands of Greeks died in direct combat, in concentration camps, or of starvation. The occupiers murdered the greater part of the [[Jews in Greece|Jewish community]] despite efforts by Christian Greeks to shelter the Jews. The economy of Greece was devastated.\n\nWhen the Soviet Army began its drive across [[Romania]] in August 1944, the German Army in Greece began withdrawing north and northwestward from Greece into [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] to avoid being cut off in Greece. Hence, the German occupation of Greece ended in October 1944. The Resistance group [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] seized control of Athens on 12 October 1944. British troops had already landed on 4 October in [[Patras]], and entered Athens on 14 October 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|2010|p=285}}.</ref>\n\nChristina Goulter summarizes the devastation done to Greece during the war:<ref>{{harvnb|Goulter|2014|pp=1023\u20131025}}.</ref>\n\n:\"Between 1941 in 1945, over 8% of the Greek population had died; some 2000 villages and small towns had been razed to the ground; starvation was widespread due to the destruction of crops and worsened in many parts of Greece after liberation when agricultural labourers migrated to urban centres to escape politically inspired violence in the countryside; trade either internally or externally had all but ceased; most of Greece\u2019s merchant marine lay at the bottom of the sea; and motorized transport had been confiscated by the axis occupiers.\"\n\n===Greek Civil War (1944\u20131949)===\n{{See|Dekemvriana|Greek civil war}}\n[[File:The British Army in Greece 1945 NA21427.jpg|thumb|200px|Clashes in Athens during the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' events]]\n\nThe [[Greek Civil War]] ({{lang-el|E\u03bc\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 |translit=Emf\u00edlios p\u00f3lemos}}) was the first major confrontation of the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shrader|1999|loc=p. 266: \"As the first major confrontation of the Cold War, the Greek civil war was a testing ground for the tactics and techniques of insurgent-counterinsurgent warfare, which would mark military affairs for the ensuing four decades.\"}}</ref> It was fought between 1944 and 1949 in [[Greece]] between the nationalist/non-Marxist forces of Greece (financially supported by [[Great Britain]] at first, and later by the [[United States]]<ref>{{harvnb|Marantzidis|Antoniou|2004|pp=223\u2013231}}.</ref>) and the [[Democratic Army of Greece]] (ELAS), which was the military branch of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE).\n\n[[File:Gde.svg|thumb|Organization and military bases of the Communist led \"[[Democratic Army of Greece|Democratic Army]]\", as well as entry routes to Greece.]]\n\nThe conflict resulted in a victory for the British \u2014 and later U.S.-supported government forces, which led to Greece receiving American funds through the [[Truman Doctrine]] and the [[Marshall Plan]], as well as becoming a member of [[NATO]], which helped to define the ideological balance of power in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] for the entire Cold War.\n\nThe first phase of the civil war occurred in 1943\u20131944. Marxist and non-Marxist resistance groups fought each other in a fratricidal conflict to establish the leadership of the Greek resistance movement. In the second phase (December 1944), the ascendant communists, in military control of most of Greece, confronted the returning Greek [[government in exile]], which had been formed under the auspices of the Western Allies in [[Cairo]] and originally included six KKE-affiliated ministers. In the third phase (called by some the \"Third Round\"), guerrilla forces controlled by the KKE fought against the internationally recognized Greek government which was formed after elections were boycotted by the KKE. Although the involvement of the KKE in the uprisings was universally known, the party remained legal until 1948, continuing to coordinate attacks from its [[Athens]] offices until [[proscription]].\n\nThe war, which lasted from 1946 to 1949, was characterised by guerilla warfare between the KKE forces and Greek governmental forces mainly in the mountain ranges of northern Greece. The war ended with the NATO bombing of Mount Grammos and the final defeat of the KKE forces. The civil war left Greece with a legacy of political polarization. As a result, Greece also entered into an alliance with the United States and joined NATO, while relationships with its communist northern neighbours, both pro-Soviet and neutral, became strained.\n\n=== Postwar development and integration in Western Bloc (1949\u20131967) ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Greece developed rapidly, initially with the help of the [[Marshall Plan]]'s grants and loans, also to decrease the communist influence. In 1952, by joining NATO, Greece clearly became part of the Western Bloc of the Cold War. But in Greek society, the deep divide between the leftist and rightist sections continued.\n\nGreece economy advanced further through growth in the [[tourism]] sector. New attention was given to [[women's rights]], and in 1952 [[women's suffrage|suffrage for women]] was guaranteed in the Constitution, full Constitutional equality following, and [[Lina Tsaldari]] becoming the first female minister that decade.\n\nThe [[Greek economic miracle]] is the period of sustained [[economic growth]], generally from 1950 to 1973.

The junta government's accession to power lead to an isolation to Greece from European affairs and froze Greece's entry to the European Union. In 1973, the r\u00e9gime abolished the [[Kings of Greece|Greek monarchy]] and in 1974, dictator [[Georgios Papadopoulos|Papadopoulos]] denied help to the United States. After a second coup that year, Colonel [[Dimitrios Ioannides|Ioannides]] was appointed as the new head-of-state.\n\nIoannides was responsible for the 1974 coup against President [[Makarios III|Makarios]] of [[Cyprus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bahcheli|Bartmann|Srebrnik|2004|p=167}}.</ref> The coup became the pretext for the first wave of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).

Greece rejoined [[NATO]] in 1980, joined the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1981 and adopted the [[euro]] as its currency in 2001. New infrastructure funds from the EU and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, services, light industry and the telecommunications industry have brought Greeks an unprecedented standard of living. Tensions continue to exist between Greece and [[Turkey]] over Cyprus and the [[Aegean dispute|delimitation of borders]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] but relations have considerably thawed following successive earthquakes, first in Turkey and then in Greece, and an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance by ordinary Greeks and Turks (see [[Greek-Turkish earthquake diplomacy|Earthquake Diplomacy]]).\n\n===Greece in the Eurozone===\n{{main|Greek government-debt crisis}}\nThe 2008 global economic recession impacted Greece, as well as the [[European debt crisis|rest of the countries in the eurozone]].

Since then, Greek minorities have remained in former Greek territories (e.g. [[Turkey]], [[Albania]], [[Italy]], [[Libya]], [[Levant]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and Greek [[emigrants]] have assimilated into differing societies across the globe (e.g. [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[Northern Europe]], [[South Africa]]).

[[Mycenaean Greece]] is the [[Late Helladic]] Bronze Age civilization of [[Ancient Greece]] and it is the historical setting of the [[Epic poetry|epic]]s of [[Homer]] and most of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Greek polytheism|religion]]. The Mycenaean period takes its name from the archaeological site [[Mycenae]] in the northeastern [[Argolid]], in the [[Peloponnesos]] of southern Greece. [[Athens]], [[Pylos]], [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], and [[Tiryns]] are also important Mycenaean sites.\n\nMycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior [[aristocracy]]. Around 1400 BC, the [[Mycenaeans]] extended their control to [[Crete]], center of the [[Minoan civilization]], and adopted a form of the Minoan script called [[Linear A]] to write their early form of [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Mycenaean-era script is called [[Linear B]], which was deciphered in 1952 by [[Michael Ventris]]. The Mycenaeans buried their nobles in [[beehive tombs]] (''tholoi''), large circular burial chambers with a high-vaulted roof and straight entry passage lined with stone. They often buried daggers or some other form of military equipment with the deceased. The nobility were often buried with gold masks, tiaras, armor and jeweled weapons. Mycenaeans were buried in a sitting position, and some of the nobility underwent [[mummy|mummification]].\n\nAround 1100\u20131050 BC, the Mycenaean civilization collapsed. Numerous cities were sacked and the region entered what historians see as a \"[[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]]\". During this period, Greece experienced a decline in [[population]] and [[literacy]]. The Greeks themselves have traditionally blamed this decline on an [[Dorian invasion|invasion]] by another wave of Greek people, the [[Dorians]], although there is scant archaeological evidence for this view.\n\n==Ancient Greece (1100\u2013146 BC)==\n{{main|Ancient Greece}}\n{{further|Classical Anatolia|Ancient history of Cyprus}}\n[[File:Dodona Theater - Gallery version.jpg|thumb|240px|The ancient theatre of [[Dodona]]]]\n[[File:Hephaistos Temple.JPG|thumb|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in Athens]]\n\n[[Ancient Greece]] refers to a period of Greek history that lasted from the Dark Ages to the end of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] (circa 600 AD). In common usage it refers to all Greek history before the [[Roman Empire]], but historians use the term more precisely. Some writers include the periods of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[History of Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilizations, while others argue that these civilizations were so different from later Greek cultures that they should be classed separately. Traditionally, the Ancient Greek period was taken to begin with the date of the first [[Olympic Games]] in 776 BC, but most historians now extend the term back to about 1000 BC.\n\nThe traditional date for the end of the Classical Greek period is the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC. The period that follows is classed as [[History of Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]]. Not everyone treats the Classical Greek and Hellenic periods as distinct; however, and some writers treat the Ancient Greek civilization as a continuum running until the advent of [[Christianity]] in the 3rd century AD.\n\nAncient Greece is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of [[Western world|Western civilization]]. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the [[Roman Empire]], which carried a version of it to many parts of [[Europe]]. Ancient Greek civilization has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, [[philosophy]], art and architecture of the modern world, particularly during the [[Renaissance]] in Western Europe and again during various [[Classicism|neo-classical]] revivals in 18th and 19th-century Europe and the [[Americas]].\n\n===Iron Age (1100\u2013800 BC)===\n{{main|Greek Dark Ages}}\n{{further|Protogeometric art}}\n\nThe ''Greek Dark Ages'' (ca. 1100 BC\u2013800 BC) refers to the period of Greek history from the presumed [[Dorian invasion]] and end of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] in the 11th century BC to the rise of the first [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s in the 9th century BC and the epics of [[Homer]] and earliest writings in [[Greek alphabet|alphabetic]] [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 8th century BC.\n\nThe collapse of the Mycenaean coincided with the fall of several other large empires in the near east, most notably the [[Hittites|Hittite]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]. The cause may be attributed to an invasion of the [[Sea People]] wielding iron weapons. When the Dorians came down into Greece they also were equipped with superior iron weapons, easily dispersing the already weakened Mycenaeans. The period that follows these events is collectively known as the Greek Dark Ages.\n\nKings ruled throughout this period until eventually they were replaced with an aristocracy, then still later, in some areas, an aristocracy within an aristocracy\u2014an elite of the elite. Warfare shifted from a focus on cavalry to a great emphasis on infantry. Due to its cheapness of production and local availability, iron replaced bronze as the metal of choice in the manufacturing of tools and weapons. Slowly equality grew among the different sects of people, leading to the dethronement of the various Kings and the rise of the family.\n\nAt the end of this period of stagnation, the Greek civilization was engulfed in a renaissance that spread the Greek world as far as the [[Black Sea]] and [[Spain]]. Writing was relearned from the [[Phoenicians]], eventually spreading north into [[Italy]] and the [[Gauls]].\n\n===Archaic Greece===\n{{main|Archaic Greece}}\n{{further|Orientalizing Period|Geometric Art}}\nIn the 8th century BC, Greece began to emerge from the Dark Ages which followed the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Literacy had been lost and [[Linear B|Mycenaean script]] forgotten, but the Greeks adopted the [[Phoenician alphabet]], modifying it to create the [[Greek alphabet]]. From about the 9th century BC, written records begin to appear.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2014|loc=3: The End of the Mycenaean World and Its Aftermath (The Loss and Recovery of Writing)}}.</ref> Greece was divided into many small self-governing communities, a pattern largely dictated by Greek geography, where every island, valley and plain is cut off from its neighbours by the sea or mountain ranges.<ref>{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|pp=10\u201311}}.</ref>\n\nThe Archaic period can be understood as the [[Orientalizing period]], when Greece was at the fringe, but not under the sway, of the budding [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. Greece adopted significant amounts of cultural elements from the Orient, in art as well as in religion and mythology. Archaeologically, Archaic Greece is marked by [[Geometric pottery]].\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{main|Classical Greece}} \n{{further|Classical Athens}}\n[[File:3393 - Athens - Sto\u00e0 of Attalus - Herodotus - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Herodotus]] in [[Stoa of Attalus]], one of the earliest nameable historians whose work survives.]]\n[[File:Le\u00f3nidas en las Term\u00f3pilas, por Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|''[[Leonidas]] at [[Thermopylae]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]].]]\n\nThe basic unit of politics in Ancient Greece was the [[polis]], sometimes translated as [[city-state]]. \"Politics\" literally means \"the things of the polis\" where each city-state was independent, at least in theory. Some city-states might be subordinate to others (a colony traditionally deferred to its mother city), some might have had governments wholly dependent upon others (the [[Thirty Tyrants]] in [[Athens]] was imposed by [[Sparta]] following the [[Peloponnesian War]]), but the titularly supreme power in each city was located within that city. This meant that when Greece went to war (e.g., against the [[Persian Empire]]), it took the form of an alliance going to war. It also gave ample opportunity for wars within Greece between different cities.\n\n====Persian Wars====\nTwo major wars shaped the Classical Greek world. The [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] (500\u2013448 BC) are recounted in [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]''. By the late 6th century BC, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] ruled over all Greek city states and had made territorial gains in the [[Balkans]] and Eastern Europe proper as well. The [[Ionia]]n Greek cities [[Ionian Revolt|revolted]] from the [[Persian Empire]], through a chain of events, and were supported by some of the mainland cities, eventually led by [[History of Athens|Athens]]. To punish mainland Greece for its support of the Ionian cities (which uprising by that time had already been quelled) [[Darius I]] launched the [[First Persian invasion of Greece]], which lasted from 492 BC till 490 BC. The Persian general [[Megabyzus]] re-subjugated [[Thrace]] and conquered [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] in the early stages of the war,<ref>{{harvnb|Olbrycht|2011|pp=343}}.</ref> but the war eventually ended with a Greek victory. Darius's successor, [[Xerxes I]], launched the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]]. Even though at a crucial point in the war the Persians briefly overran northern and central Greece,<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|2007|p=3}}.</ref> the Greek city-states once again managed to turn this war into a victory. The notable battles of the Greco-Persian Wars include [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].\n\nTo prosecute the war and then to defend Greece from further Persian attack, Athens founded the [[Delian League]] in 477 BC. Initially, each city in the League would contribute ships and soldiers to a common army, but in time Athens allowed (and then compelled) the smaller cities to contribute funds so that it could supply their quota of ships. Secession from the League could be punished. Following military reversals against the Persians, the treasury was moved from [[Delos]] to Athens, further strengthening the latter's control over the League. The Delian League was eventually referred to pejoratively as the Athenian Empire.\n\nIn 458 BC, while the Persian Wars were still ongoing, war broke out between the Delian League and the [[Peloponnesian League]], comprising [[Sparta]] and its allies. After some inconclusive fighting, the two sides signed a peace in 447 BC. That peace was stipulated to last thirty years: instead it held only until 431 BC, with the onset of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Our main sources concerning this war are [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' and [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hellenica]]''.\n\n====Peloponnesian War====\nThe war began over a dispute between [[Corcyra]] and [[Epidamnus]]. [[Corinth]] intervened on the Epidamnian side. Fearful lest Corinth capture the Corcyran navy (second only to the Athenian in size), Athens intervened. It prevented Corinth from landing on Corcyra at the [[Battle of Sybota]], laid siege to [[Battle of Potidaea|Potidaea]], and forbade all commerce with Corinth's closely situated ally, [[Megara]] (the [[Megarian decree]]).\n\nThere was disagreement among the Greeks as to which party violated the treaty between the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues, as Athens was technically defending a new ally. The Corinthians turned to Sparta for aid. Fearing the growing might of Athens, and witnessing Athens' willingness to use it against the Megarians (the embargo would have ruined them), Sparta declared the treaty to have been violated and the Peloponnesian War began in earnest.\n\nThe first stage of the war (known as the Archidamian War for the Spartan king, [[Archidamus II]]) lasted until 421 BC with the signing of the [[Peace of Nicias]]. The Athenian general [[Pericles]] recommended that his city fight a defensive war, avoiding battle against the superior land forces led by Sparta, and importing everything needful by maintaining its powerful navy. Athens would simply outlast Sparta, whose citizens feared to be out of their city for long lest the [[helots]] revolt.\n\nThis strategy required that Athens endure regular [[siege]]s, and in 430 BC it was visited with an awful [[Plague of Athens|plague that killed about a quarter of its people]], including Pericles. With Pericles gone, less conservative elements gained power in the city and Athens went on the offensive. It captured 300\u2013400 Spartan [[hoplite]]s at the [[Battle of Pylos]]. This represented a significant fraction of the Spartan fighting force which the latter decided it could not afford to lose. Meanwhile, Athens had suffered humiliating defeats at [[Battle of Delium|Delium]] and [[Battle of Amphipolis|Amphipolis]]. The Peace of Nicias concluded with Sparta recovering its hostages and Athens recovering the city of [[Amphipolis]].\n\n[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|350px|Map of the [[Delian League]] (\"Athenian Empire or Alliance\") in 431 BC, just prior to the [[Peloponnesian War]].]]\n\nThose who signed the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC swore to uphold it for fifty years.  The second stage of the Peloponnesian War began in 415 BC when Athens embarked on the [[Sicilian Expedition]] to support an ally ([[Segesta]]) attacked by [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and to conquer [[Sicily]]. Initially, Sparta was reluctant, but [[Alcibiades]], the Athenian general who had argued for the Sicilian Expedition, defected to the Spartan cause upon being accused of grossly impious acts and convinced them that they could not allow Athens to subjugate Syracuse. The campaign ended in disaster for the Athenians.\n\nAthens' Ionian possessions rebelled with the support of Sparta, as advised by Alcibiades.  In 411 BC, an oligarchical revolt in Athens held out the chance for peace, but the Athenian navy, which remained committed to the democracy, refused to accept the change and continued fighting in Athens' name. The navy recalled Alcibiades (who had been forced to abandon the Spartan cause after reputedly seducing the wife of [[Agis II]], a Spartan king) and made him its head. The oligarchy in Athens collapsed and Alcibiades reconquered what had been lost.\n\nIn 407 BC, Alcibiades was replaced following a minor naval defeat at the [[Battle of Notium]]. The Spartan general [[Lysander]], having fortified his city's naval power, won victory after victory. Following the [[Battle of Arginusae]], which Athens won but was prevented by bad weather from rescuing some of its sailors, Athens executed or exiled eight of its top naval commanders. Lysander followed with a crushing blow at the [[Battle of Aegospotami]] in 405 BC which almost destroyed the Athenian fleet. Athens surrendered one year later, ending the Peloponnesian War.\n\nThe war had left devastation in its wake. Discontent with the [[Spartan hegemony]] that followed (including the fact that it ceded [[Ionia]] and [[Cyprus]] to the [[Persian Empire]] at the conclusion of the [[Corinthian War]] (395\u2013387 BC); see [[Treaty of Antalcidas]]) induced the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] to attack. Their general, [[Epaminondas]], crushed Sparta at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BC, inaugurating a period of Theban dominance in Greece. In 346 BC, unable to prevail in its ten-year war with [[Phocis]], Thebes called upon [[Philip II of Macedon]] for aid. [[Macedon]] quickly forced the city states into being united by the [[League of Corinth]] which led to the conquering of the Persian Empire and the Hellenistic Age had begun.\n\n===Hellenistic Greece===\n{{main|Hellenistic Period|Hellenistic Greece}}\n[[File:DemetriosPolyorchetes.jpg|thumb|Coin showing [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]].]]\nThe Hellenistic period of Greek history begins with the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC and ends with the [[annexation]] of the Greek peninsula and islands by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in 146 BC. Although the establishment of Roman rule did not break the continuity of Hellenistic society and culture, which remained essentially unchanged until the advent of [[Christianity]], it did mark the end of Greek political independence.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the importance of \"Greece proper\" (that is, the territory of modern Greece) within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centres of Hellenistic culture were [[Alexandria]] and [[Antioch]], capitals of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid Syria]]. (See [[Hellenistic civilization]] for the history of Greek culture outside Greece in this period.)\n\nAthens and her allies revolted against [[Macedon]] upon hearing that Alexander had died, but were defeated within a year in the [[Lamian War]]. Meanwhile, a struggle for power broke out among Alexander's generals, which resulted in the break-up of his empire and the establishment of a number of new kingdoms (see the [[Wars of the Diadochi]]). [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] was left with [[Egypt]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] with the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and points east. Control of Greece, [[Thrace]], and [[Anatolia]] was contested, but by 298 BC the [[Antigonid dynasty]] had supplanted the [[Antipatrid dynasty|Antipatrid]].\n\n[[File:Stag hunt mosaic, Pella.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stag Hunt Mosaic]] at the [[Archaeological Museum of Pella]] (3rd BC)]]\nMacedonian control of the city-states was intermittent, with a number of revolts. [[Athens]], [[Rhodes]], [[Pergamum]] and other Greek states retained substantial independence, and joined the [[Aetolian League]] as a means of defending it and restoring democracy in their states, whereas they saw Macedon as a tyrannical kingdom because of the fact they had not adopted democracy. The [[Achaean League]], while nominally subject to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] was in effect independent, and controlled most of southern Greece. [[Sparta]] also remained independent, but generally refused to join any league.\n\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|300px|The major [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] realms included the [[Diadochi|Diadoch kingdoms]]:\n{{legend|#787CAD|Kingdom of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]}}\n{{legend|#50A249|Kingdom of [[Cassander]]}}\n{{legend|#C38833|Kingdom of [[Lysimachus]]}}\n{{legend|#C3B933|Kingdom of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]}}\n{{legend|#AF3662|[[Epirus]]}}\nAlso shown on the map:\n{{legend|#85AB54|[[Greek colonies]]}}\n{{legend|#A361BD|[[Carthage]] (non-Greek)}}\n{{legend|#70A9BE|[[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (non-Greek)}}\nThe orange areas were often in dispute after 281 BC. The [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] occupied some of this area. Not shown: [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].]]\nIn 267 BC, [[Ptolemy II]] persuaded the Greek cities to revolt against Macedon, in what became the [[Chremonidean War]], after the Athenian leader [[Chremonides]]. The cities were defeated and Athens lost her independence and her democratic institutions. This marked the end of Athens as a political actor, although it remained the largest, wealthiest and most cultivated city in Greece. In 225 BC, Macedon defeated the Egyptian fleet at [[Kos|Cos]] and brought the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, except Rhodes, under its rule as well.\n\n[[Sparta]] remained hostile to the Achaeans, and in 227 BC invaded [[Achaea]] and seized control of the League. The remaining Achaeans preferred distant Macedon to nearby Sparta, and allied with the former. In 222 BC, the Macedonian army defeated the Spartans and annexed their city\u2014the first time Sparta had ever been occupied by a different state.\n\n[[Philip V of Macedon]] was the last Greek ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the ever-increasing power of [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Under his auspices, the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought conflict between Macedon and the Greek leagues to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum.\n\nIn 215 BC, however, Philip formed an alliance with Rome's enemy [[Carthage]]. Rome promptly lured the Achaean cities away from their nominal loyalty to Philip, and formed alliances with Rhodes and Pergamum, now the strongest power in [[Asia Minor]]. The [[First Macedonian War]] broke out in 212 BC, and ended inconclusively in 205 BC, but Macedon was now marked as an enemy of Rome.\n\nIn 202 BC, Rome defeated Carthage, and was free to turn her attention eastwards. In 198 BC, the [[Second Macedonian War]] broke out because Rome saw Macedon as a potential ally of the [[Seleucid Empire]], the greatest power in the east. Philip's allies in Greece deserted him and in 197 BC he was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]] by the Roman proconsul [[Titus Quinctius Flaminius]].\n\nLuckily for the Greeks, Flaminius was a moderate man and an admirer of Greek culture. Philip had to surrender his fleet and become a Roman ally, but was otherwise spared. At the [[Isthmian Games]] in 196 BC, Flaminius declared all the Greek cities free, although Roman garrisons were placed at Corinth and [[Chalcis]]. But the freedom promised by Rome was an illusion. All the cities except Rhodes were enrolled in a new League which Rome ultimately controlled, and aristocratic constitutions were favoured and actively promoted.\n\n==Roman Greece (146 BC\u2013324 AD)==\n{{main|Roman Empire|Greco-Roman world|Roman Greece}}\n[[File:Tony robert-fleury, l'ultimo giorno di corinto, ante 1870.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Scene of the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]]: last day before the Roman legions looted and burned the city of [[Corinth]]. ''The last day on Corinth'', [[Tony Robert-Fleury]], 1870]]\n[[File:Patras Roman Odeon 9281478.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman Odeon of [[Patras]]]]\n\nMilitarily, Greece itself declined to the point that the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] conquered the land (168 BC onwards), though Greek culture would in turn conquer Roman life. Although the period of Roman rule in Greece is conventionally dated as starting from the sacking of [[Corinth]] by the Roman [[Lucius Mummius]] in 146 BC, Macedonia had already come under Roman control with the defeat of its king, [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], by the Roman [[Aemilius Paullus]] at [[Pydna]] in 168 BC.\n\nThe Romans divided the region into four smaller republics, and in 146 BC Macedonia officially became a province, with its capital at [[Thessalonica]]. The rest of the Greek [[city-states]] gradually and eventually paid homage to Rome ending their ''de jure'' autonomy as well. The Romans left local administration to the [[Greeks]] without making any attempt to abolish traditional political patterns. The [[agora]] in [[Athens]] continued to be the centre of civic and political life.\n\n[[Caracalla]]'s decree in 212 AD, the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'', extended citizenship outside [[Italy]] to all free adult men in the entire [[Roman Empire]], effectively raising provincial populations to equal status with the city of [[Rome]] itself. The importance of this decree is historical, not political. It set the basis for integration where the economic and judicial mechanisms of the state could be applied throughout the Mediterranean as was once done from Latium into all Italy. In practice of course, integration did not take place uniformly. Societies already integrated with Rome, such as Greece, were favored by this decree, in comparison with those far away, too poor or just too alien such as Britain, Palestine or Egypt.\n\nCaracalla's decree did not set in motion the processes that led to the transfer of power from Italy and the West to Greece and the East, but rather accelerated them, setting the foundations for the millennium-long rise of Greece, in the form of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], as a major power in [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]] in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n==Middle Ages==\n===Byzantine rule (324\u20131204 AD)===\n{{main|Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Greece|Barbarian invasions}}\n{{See also|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism|Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire}}\n{{Further|Byzantine Anatolia|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}\n[[Image:Greece meteora monasteries.JPG|thumb|Byzantine era monasteries in [[Meteora]]]]\n[[File:Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg|thumb|240px|Depiction of the [[Greek fire]] by [[John Skylitzes]]' [[Madrid Skylitzes|Chronicle]] (late 11th century).]]\n\nThe history of the East Roman or Byzantine Empire is described by [[Byzantinist]] August Heisenberg as the history of \"the Christianized Roman empire of the Greek nation\".<ref>{{harvnb|Winnifrith|Murray|1983|loc=p. 113: \"For August Heisenberg the Byzantine empire was 'the Christianised Roman empire of the Greek nation'.\"}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Heisenberg|Kromayer|von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|1923|loc=\"Staat und Gesellschaft des Byzantinischen Reiches\", p. 364}}: \"Byzanz ist das christlich gewordene R\u00f6merreich griechischer Nation.\"</ref> The division of the empire into East and West and the subsequent collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] were developments that constantly accentuated the position of the Greeks in the empire and eventually allowed them to become identified with it altogether. The leading role of [[Constantinople]] began when [[Constantine the Great]] turned [[Byzantium]] into the new capital of the Roman Empire, from then on to be known as [[Constantinople]], placing the city at the center of Hellenism, a beacon for the [[Greeks]] that lasted to the modern era.\n\nThe figures of Constantine the Great and [[Justinian I|Justinian]] dominated during 324\u2013610. Assimilating the Roman tradition, the emperors sought to offer the basis for later developments and for the formation of the Byzantine Empire. Efforts to secure the borders of the Empire and to restore the Roman territories marked the early centuries. At the same time, the definitive formation and establishment of the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] doctrine, but also a series of conflicts resulting from heresies that developed within the boundaries of the empire, marked the early period of Byzantine history.\n\nIn the first period of the middle Byzantine era (610\u2013867), the empire was attacked both by old enemies ([[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Lombards]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]]) as well as by new ones, appearing for the first time in history ([[Arabs]], [[Bulgars]]). The main characteristic of this period was that the enemy attacks were not localized to the border areas of the state but they were extended deep beyond, even threatening the capital itself.\n\nThe attacks of the Slavs lost their periodical and temporary character and became permanent settlements that transformed into new states, initially hostile to Constantinople until their [[christianization]]. Those states were referred by the Byzantines as ''[[Sclavinia]]s''.\n\nChanges were also observed in the internal structure of the empire which was dictated by both external and internal conditions. The predominance of the small free farmers, the expansion of the military estates and the development of the system of [[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]]s, brought to completion developments that had started in the previous period. Changes were noted also in the sector of administration: the administration and society had become immiscibly [[Greeks|Greek]], while the restoration of Orthodoxy after the [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] movement, allowed the successful resumption of missionary action among neighboring peoples and their placement within the sphere of Byzantine cultural influence. During this period the state was geographically reduced and economically damaged, since it lost wealth-producing regions; however, it obtained greater lingual, dogmatic and cultural homogeneity.\n\nFrom the late 8th century, the Empire began to recover from the devastating impact of successive invasions, and the reconquest of Greek peninsula began. Greeks from [[Sicily]] and [[Asia Minor]] were brought in as settlers. The [[Slavs]] were either driven out to Asia Minor or assimilated and the Sclavinias were eliminated. By the middle of the 9th century, Greece was Byzantine again, and the cities began to recover due to improved security and the restoration of effective central control.\n\n===Economic prosperity===\n[[File:Wallsthess.jpg|Part of the walls|thumb|Part of the Byzantine [[Walls of Thessaloniki]]]]\n\nWhen the Byzantine Empire was rescued from a period of crisis by the resolute leadership of the three [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]] emperors [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios]], [[John II Komnenos|John]] and [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel]] in the 12th century, Greece prospered. Recent research has revealed that this period was a time of significant growth in the rural economy, with rising population levels and extensive tracts of new agricultural land being brought into production. The widespread construction of new rural churches is a strong indication that prosperity was being generated even in remote areas.\n\nA steady increase in population led to a higher population density, and there is good evidence that the demographic increase was accompanied by the revival of towns. According to Alan Harvey's ''Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire 900\u20131200'', towns expanded significantly in the twelfth century. Archaeological evidence shows an increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a \u2018notable upsurge\u2019 in new towns. Archaeological evidence tells us that many of the medieval towns, including [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe growth of the towns attracted the [[Venice|Venetians]], and this interest in trade appears to have further increased economic prosperity in Greece. Certainly, the Venetians and others were active traders in the ports of the [[Holy Land]], and they made a living out of shipping goods between the [[Crusader states|Crusader]] Kingdoms of [[Outremer]] and the West while also trading extensively with Byzantium and [[Egypt]].\n\n===Artistic revival===\n[[File:20090803 hosiosloukas36.jpg|thumb|180px|Exterior view of [[Hosios Loukas]] monastery, artistic example of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]]]]\n\nA kind of \"Renaissance\" of the [[Byzantine art]], as described by scholars, began since the 10th century. Many of the most important Byzantine churches in and around Athens, for example, were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of urbanisation in Greece during this period. There was also a revival in the mosaic art with artists showing great interest in depicting natural landscapes with wild animals and scenes from the hunt. Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. With its love of luxury and passion for color, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the Christian world.\n\nBeautiful [[Byzantine silk|silks from the workshops of Constantinople]] also portrayed in dazzling color animals\u2014lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins\u2014confronting each other, or representing Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase. The eyes of many patrons were attracted and the economy of Greece grew. In the provinces, regional schools of Architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences. All this suggests that there was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work.\n\nYet the marvelous expansion of Byzantine art during this period, one of the most remarkable facts in the history of the empire, did not stop there. From the 10th to the 12th century, Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at Torcello clearly show their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the Palatine Chapel, the Martorana at Palermo, and the cathedral of Cefalu, together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, prove the influence of Byzantium on the Norman Court of Sicily in the 12th century.\n\nHispano-Moorish art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. Romanesque art owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of Kiev, Venetian doges, abbots of [[Monte Cassino]], merchants of Amalfi, and the Norman kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the 12th century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centers dedicated to its production.\n\n===The Fourth Crusade (1204)===\n{{main|Fourth Crusade|Frankokratia}}\n[[File:LatinEmpire2.png|thumb|350px|The division of the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the [[Fourth Crusade]].]]\n\nThe year 1204 marks the beginning of the Late Byzantine period when [[Constantinople]] and a number of Byzantine territories were conquered by the Latins during the [[Fourth Crusade]]. During this period, a number of Byzantine Greek successor states emerged such as the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], such as number of Frankish/Latin Catholic states ([[Principality of Achaea]], [[Duchy of Athens]], [[Duchy of the Archipelago]], [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] etc.) In Latin-occupied territories, elements of feudality entered medieval Greek life.\n\n===From partial Byzantine restoration to 1453===\nThe [[Latin Empire]], however, lasted only 57 years, when in 1261 Constantinople was reclaimed by the [[Byzantine Greeks]] and the Byzantine Empire was restored. However, in mainland Greece and islands various Latin possessions continued to exist. From 1261 onwards, Byzantium underwent a gradual weakening of its internal structures and the reduction of its territories from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasions culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] on May 29, 1453. The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople resulted in the official end of both the Eastern Roman empire and the Byzantine period of Greek history.\n\n==Venetian and Ottoman rule (15th century\u20131821 AD)==\n{{main|Stato da M\u00e0r|Ottoman Greece|Septinsular Republic|Modern Greek Enlightenment|Greek War of Independence}}\n[[File:Navarino.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Navarino]], on October 1827, marked the effective end of Ottoman rule in Greece.]]\n\nWhen the [[Ottomans]] arrived, two Greek migrations occurred. The first migration entailed the Greek [[intelligentsia]] migrating to Western Europe and influencing the advent of the Renaissance. The second migration entailed Greeks leaving the plains of the Greek peninsula and resettling in the mountains.<ref>{{harvnb|Vacalopoulos|1976|loc=p. 45: \"The Greeks never lost their desire to escape from the heavy hand of the Turks, bad government, the impressment of their children, the increasingly heavy taxation, and the sundry caprices of the conqueror. Indeed, anyone studying the last two centuries of Byzantine rule cannot help being struck by the propensity of the Greeks to flee misfortune. The routes they chiefly took were: first, to the predominantly Greek territories, which were either still free or Frankish-controlled (that is to say, the Venetian fortresses in the Despotate of Morea, as well as in the Aegean and Ionian Islands) or else to Italy and the West generally; second, to remote mountain districts in the interior where the conqueror's yoke was not yet felt.\"}}</ref> The [[millet system]] contributed to the ethnic cohesion of Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the Ottoman Empire based on religion.\n\nThe Greeks living in the plains during Ottoman rule were either Christians who dealt with the burdens of foreign rule or crypto-Christians (Greek Muslims who were secret practitioners of the Greek Orthodox faith). Some Greeks became [[crypto-Christians]] to avoid heavy taxes and at the same time express their identity by maintaining their ties to the Greek Orthodox Church. However, Greeks who converted to [[Islam]] and were not crypto-Christians were deemed \"Turks\" (Muslims) in the eyes of Orthodox Greeks, even if they didn't adopt the Turkish language. The Ottomans ruled most of Greece until the early 19th century.\n\nThe first semi-independent, self-governed after centuries, Greek state was established 21 years before the outbreak of the Greek revolution. The [[Septinsular Republic]], with [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] as capital, was established in 1800.\n\n==Modern Greek nation state (1821\u2013present)==\n{{see|History of modern Greece|Kingdom of Greece|Megali Idea}}\n[[File:Nafplion view from Palamidi castle.JPG|thumb|[[Nafplio]] became the first capital of independent Greece during the governance of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]]]\n\nIn the early months of 1821, the Greeks [[Greek War of Independence|declared their independence]], but did not achieve it until 1829. The Great Powers first shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the ''status quo'' of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but soon changed their stance. Scores of non-Greeks [[philhellenes]] volunteered to fight for the cause, including [[Lord Byron]].\n\nOn October 20, 1827, a combined British, French and Russian naval force destroyed the Ottoman and Egyptian armada. The Russian minister of foreign affairs, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], himself a Greek, returned home as President of the new [[First Hellenic Republic|Republic]]. The first capital of the independent [[Greece]] was temporarily [[Aigina]] (1828\u20131829) and later officially [[Nafplion]] (1828\u20131834). After his assassination, the European powers turned Greece into a monarchy; the first King, [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], came from [[Bavaria]] and the second, [[George I of Greece|George I]], from [[Denmark]]. In 1834, King Otto transferred the capital to Athens.\n\n[[File:Territorial Expansion of Greece from 1832\u20131947.gif|thumb|left|340px|The territorial evolution of [[Kingdom of Greece]] until 1947]]\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, Greece sought to enlarge its boundaries to include the ethnic Greek population of the Ottoman Empire. Greece played a peripheral role in the [[Crimean War]]. When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, Greek leaders saw an opportunity to expand North and South into Ottoman areas that had a Christian majority. However, Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. The French and British seized its major port and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Greek efforts to cause insurrections failed as they were easily crushed by Ottoman forces. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war. The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate. The [[Ionian Islands]] were given by Britain upon the arrival of the new King [[George I of Greece|George I]] in 1863 and [[Thessaly]] was ceded by the Ottomans in 1880.\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:King George of Hellenes.jpg|thumb|180px|[[George I of Greece|George I]] was King of the Hellenes from 1862 to 1913]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, modernization transformed the social structure of Greece. The population grew rapidly, putting heavy pressure on the system of small farms with low productivity. Overall, population density more than doubled from 41 persons per square mile in 1829 to 114 in 1912 (16 to 44 per km<sup>2</sup>). One response was emigration to the United States, with a quarter million people leaving between 1906 and 1914. Entrepreneurs found numerous business opportunities in the retail and restaurant sectors of American cities; some sent money back to their families, others returned with hundreds of dollars, enough to purchase a farm or a small business in the old village. The urban population tripled from 8% in 1853 to 24% in 1907. Athens grew from a village of 6000 people in 1834, when it became the capital, to 63,000 in 1879, 111,000 in 1896, and 167,000 in 1907.<ref>{{harvnb|Myrsiades|Myrsiades|1992|pp=32\u201333}}.</ref>\n\nIn Athens and other cities, men arriving from rural areas set up workshops and stores, creating a middle class. They joined with bankers, professional men, university students, and military officers, to demand reform and modernization of the political and economic system. Athens became the center of the merchant marine, which quadrupled from 250,000 tons in 1875 to more than 1,000,000 tons in 1915. As the cities modernized, businessmen adopted the latest styles of Western European architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Bir\u0113s|Kardamits\u0113-Adam\u0113|2004|p=173}}.</ref>\n\n===Balkan Wars===\n{{Main|Goudi coup|Greece in the Balkan Wars}}\n[[File:Vasileios Hatzis - Landing of Greek troops at Kavala.jpg|thumb|The landing of Greek troops in [[Kavala]] during the Balkan Wars]]\n\nThe participation of Greece in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913 is one of the most important episodes in modern Greek history, as it allowed the Greek state to almost double its size and achieve most of its present territorial size.\n\nAs a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912\u20131913, most of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], southern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Crete]] and the northern [[Aegean islands]] were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Greece]].\n\n===World War I and Greco-Turkish War===\n{{Main|Greece in World War I|Macedonian Front|Provisional Government of National Defence|National Schism|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The I Battalion of the [[Army of National Defence]] marches on its way to the front, 1916.

In August 1936, Prime Minister [[Ioannis Metaxas|Metaxas]], with the agreement of the king, suspended the parliament and established the quasi-fascist [[Metaxas regime]].\n\nDespite the country's numerically small and ill-equipped armed forces, Greece made a decisive contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts in [[World War II]]. At the start of the war, Greece sided with the Allies and refused to give in to Italian demands. Italy invaded Greece by way of Albania on 28 October 1940, but Greek troops repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle (see [[Greco-Italian War]]). This marked the first Allied victory in the war.\n\nPrimarily to secure his strategic southern flank, German dictator Adolf Hitler reluctantly stepped in and launched the [[Battle of Greece]] in April 1941. Axis units from Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy successfully invaded Greece, through Yugoslavia, forcing out the Greek defenders. The Greek government eventually decided to stop the fighting and thus stopped sending ammunition and supplies to the northern front and the defenders were easily overrun. The Greek government then proceeded, as the Nazi forces came towards the capital of Athens, to leave for Crete and then Cairo, Egypt.\n\nOn 20 May 1941, the Germans attempted to [[Battle of Crete|seize Crete]] with a large attack by [[paratroop]]ers, with the aim of reducing the threat of a counter-offensive by Allied forces in [[Egypt]], but faced heavy resistance. The Greek campaign might have delayed German military plans against Soviet Union, and it is argued that had the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] started on 20 May 1941 instead of 22 June 1941, the Nazi assault against the Soviet Union might have succeeded. The heavy losses of German paratroopers led the Germans to launch no further large-scale air-invasions.\n\nDuring the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], thousands of Greeks died in direct combat, in concentration camps, or of starvation. The occupiers murdered the greater part of the [[Jews in Greece|Jewish community]] despite efforts by Christian Greeks to shelter the Jews. The economy of Greece was devastated.\n\nWhen the Soviet Army began its drive across [[Romania]] in August 1944, the German Army in Greece began withdrawing north and northwestward from Greece into [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] to avoid being cut off in Greece. Hence, the German occupation of Greece ended in October 1944. The Resistance group [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] seized control of Athens on 12 October 1944. British troops had already landed on 4 October in [[Patras]], and entered Athens on 14 October 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|2010|p=285}}.</ref>\n\nChristina Goulter summarizes the devastation done to Greece during the war:<ref>{{harvnb|Goulter|2014|pp=1023\u20131025}}.</ref>\n\n:\"Between 1941 in 1945, over 8% of the Greek population had died; some 2000 villages and small towns had been razed to the ground; starvation was widespread due to the destruction of crops and worsened in many parts of Greece after liberation when agricultural labourers migrated to urban centres to escape politically inspired violence in the countryside; trade either internally or externally had all but ceased; most of Greece\u2019s merchant marine lay at the bottom of the sea; and motorized transport had been confiscated by the axis occupiers.\"\n\n===Greek Civil War (1944\u20131949)===\n{{See|Dekemvriana|Greek civil war}}\n[[File:The British Army in Greece 1945 NA21427.jpg|thumb|200px|Clashes in Athens during the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' events]]\n\nThe [[Greek Civil War]] ({{lang-el|E\u03bc\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 |translit=Emf\u00edlios p\u00f3lemos}}) was the first major confrontation of the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shrader|1999|loc=p. 266: \"As the first major confrontation of the Cold War, the Greek civil war was a testing ground for the tactics and techniques of insurgent-counterinsurgent warfare, which would mark military affairs for the ensuing four decades.\"}}</ref> It was fought between 1944 and 1949 in [[Greece]] between the nationalist/non-Marxist forces of Greece (financially supported by [[Great Britain]] at first, and later by the [[United States]]<ref>{{harvnb|Marantzidis|Antoniou|2004|pp=223\u2013231}}.</ref>) and the [[Democratic Army of Greece]] (ELAS), which was the military branch of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE).\n\n[[File:Gde.svg|thumb|Organization and military bases of the Communist led \"[[Democratic Army of Greece|Democratic Army]]\", as well as entry routes to Greece.]]\n\nThe conflict resulted in a victory for the British \u2014 and later U.S.-supported government forces, which led to Greece receiving American funds through the [[Truman Doctrine]] and the [[Marshall Plan]], as well as becoming a member of [[NATO]], which helped to define the ideological balance of power in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] for the entire Cold War.\n\nThe first phase of the civil war occurred in 1943\u20131944. Marxist and non-Marxist resistance groups fought each other in a fratricidal conflict to establish the leadership of the Greek resistance movement. In the second phase (December 1944), the ascendant communists, in military control of most of Greece, confronted the returning Greek [[government in exile]], which had been formed under the auspices of the Western Allies in [[Cairo]] and originally included six KKE-affiliated ministers. In the third phase (called by some the \"Third Round\"), guerrilla forces controlled by the KKE fought against the internationally recognized Greek government which was formed after elections were boycotted by the KKE. Although the involvement of the KKE in the uprisings was universally known, the party remained legal until 1948, continuing to coordinate attacks from its [[Athens]] offices until [[proscription]].\n\nThe war, which lasted from 1946 to 1949, was characterised by guerilla warfare between the KKE forces and Greek governmental forces mainly in the mountain ranges of northern Greece. The war ended with the NATO bombing of Mount Grammos and the final defeat of the KKE forces. The civil war left Greece with a legacy of political polarization. As a result, Greece also entered into an alliance with the United States and joined NATO, while relationships with its communist northern neighbours, both pro-Soviet and neutral, became strained.\n\n=== Postwar development and integration in Western Bloc (1949\u20131967) ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Greece developed rapidly, initially with the help of the [[Marshall Plan]]'s grants and loans, also to decrease the communist influence. In 1952, by joining NATO, Greece clearly became part of the Western Bloc of the Cold War. But in Greek society, the deep divide between the leftist and rightist sections continued.\n\nGreece economy advanced further through growth in the [[tourism]] sector. New attention was given to [[women's rights]], and in 1952 [[women's suffrage|suffrage for women]] was guaranteed in the Constitution, full Constitutional equality following, and [[Lina Tsaldari]] becoming the first female minister that decade.\n\nThe [[Greek economic miracle]] is the period of sustained [[economic growth]], generally from 1950 to 1973.

In 1973, the r\u00e9gime abolished the [[Kings of Greece|Greek monarchy]] and in 1974, dictator [[Georgios Papadopoulos|Papadopoulos]] denied help to the United States.

Greece rejoined [[NATO]] in 1980, joined the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1981 and adopted the [[euro]] as its currency in 2001. New infrastructure funds from the EU and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, services, light industry and the telecommunications industry have brought Greeks an unprecedented standard of living.

These austerity measures were extremely unpopular with the Greek public, precipitating demonstrations and civil unrest.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Crete]]\n* [[History of Cyprus]]\n* [[History of the Cyclades]]\n* [[History of Thessaly]]\n* [[History of Athens]]\n* [[History of Macedonia]]\n* [[History of Thrace]]\n* [[History of the Greek language]]\n* [[Timeline of Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Timeline of modern Greek history]]\n\n'''Lists:'''\n* [[List of ancient Greeks]]\n* [[List of ancient Greek cities]]\n* [[List of Kings of Greece]]\n* [[List of Presidents of Greece]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece]]\n\n'''General''':\n* [[History of the Balkans]]\n* [[History of Anatolia|History of Asia Minor]]\n* [[Intermediate Region]]\n* [[History of Europe]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|20em}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Bahcheli|first1=Tozun|last2=Bartmann|first2=Barry|last3=Srebrnik|first3=Henry|title=De Facto States: The Quest For Sovereignty|year=2004|location=London|publisher=Routledge (Taylor & Francis)|isbn=978-0-20-348576-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIbah-giC0EC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Bir\u0113s|first1=Manos G.|last2=Kardamits\u0113-Adam\u0113|first2=Mar\u014d|title=Neoclassical Architecture in Greece|year=2004|location=Los Angeles, CA|publisher=Getty Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2eY2DSay5KkC|ref=harv|isbn=9780892367757}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Caskey|first=John L.|title=The Early Helladic Period in the Argolid|journal=Hesperia|volume=29|number=3|date=July\u2013September 1960|pages=285\u2013303|doi=10.2307/147199|ref=harv|jstor=147199}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Caskey|first=John L.|title=Lerna in the Early Bronze Age|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=72|issue=4|year=1968|pages=313\u2013316|doi=10.2307/503823|ref=harv|jstor=503823}}\n*{{cite book|last=Castleden|first=Rodney|title=Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete|year=1993|origyear=1990|location=London and New York|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-13-488064-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8eIAgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The Prehistory of the Greek Language|year=1963|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhs7AAAAIAAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston S.|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War (Volume 6)|year=2010|origyear=1953|location=New York|publisher=RosettaBooks, LLC|isbn=978-0-79-531147-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=A Concise History of Greece (Second Edition)|year=2002|origyear=1992|location=Cambridge and New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-52-100479-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5pyUIY4THYC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Coccossis|first1=Harry|last2=Psycharis|first2=Yannis|title=Regional Analysis and Policy: The Greek Experience|year=2008|location=Heidelberg|publisher=Physica-Verlag (A Springer Company)|isbn=978-3-79-082086-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9TG0Q0xKJYC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=John E.|title=An Archaeological Scenario for the \"Coming of the Greeks\" ca. 3200 B.C.|journal=The Journal of Indo-European Studies|volume=28|number=1\u20132|date=2000|pages=101\u2013153|url=https://www.academia.edu/4908240|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dickinson|first=Oliver|title=The Origins of Mycenaean Civilization|year=1977|location=G\u00f6tenberg|publisher=Paul Astr\u00f6ms F\u00f6rlag|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Dickinson|first=Oliver|title=Invasion, Migration and the Shaft Graves|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|volume=43|issue=1|date=December 1999|pages=97\u2013107|doi=10.1111/j.2041-5370.1999.tb00480.x|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Featherstone|first=Kevin|editor-last=Pridham|editor-first=Geoffrey|chapter=8.

A member of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), he was a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Romanian Chamber of Deputies]] for [[Maramure\u0219 County]] from 1996 to 2000. In the [[Radu Vasile]] and [[Mugur Is\u0103rescu]] cabinets, he served as [[Ministry of Public Finance (Romania)|Finance Minister]] from 1998 to 2000, while in the [[C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu]] cabinet, he was [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Minister of Agriculture]] during 2007.\n\n==Biography==\n\nBorn in [[B\u0103se\u015fti]], Maramure\u0219 County, he graduated from the Economic Studies Faculty of the [[University of Ia\u015fi]] in 1971.

From 1978 to 1980, he was an inspector at a firm in his native county, followed by a position as chief accountant at a railway parts manufacturer there, from 1980 to 1990. Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], he was economic director and then director of a [[Baia Mare]] firm. From 1995 to 1996, he headed a bank in that city. He has eleven published articles about finance and accounting in an economic magazine.<ref name=\"cvdeputat\">{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=68&cam=2&leg=1996&pag=0&idl=1 Profile] at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site; accessed August 31, 2010</ref>\n\nJoining the PNL in 1991, he was vice president of its Maramure\u0219 County chapter from 1992 to 1993 and president from 1993 to 1996.

He is best known as one of the first musicians to develop and popularise the fusion genre and for helping to develop the [[guitar synthesizer]] in collaboration with [[Roland Corporation]] and [[Korg]]. His album ''Ryo Kawasaki and the Golden Dragon Live'' was one of the first all digital recordings and he created the [[Kawasaki Synthesizer]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. During the 1960s, he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 1970s, he moved to New York City, where he settled and worked with [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Joanne Brackeen]] amongst others. In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music software for computers. He also produced several techno dance singles, formed his own record company called Satellites Records, and later returned to jazz-fusion in 1991.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life (1947\u20131968)===\nRyo Kawasaki was born on February 25, 1947, in [[K\u014denji]], Tokyo, while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father, Torao Kawasaki, was a Japanese [[diplomat]] who had worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese consulates and embassies, including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchuria]], now [[Shenyang]] in China), [[Shanghai]], and [[Beijing]] while active as an English teacher and translator for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother, Hiroko, was also multilingual, and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchuria]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years old when Ryo was born as an only child.\n\nKawasaki's mother encouraged him to take piano and ballet lessons, and he took voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and violin lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and electronics (he built his own radios, TVs and audio systems including amplifiers and speakers as well as telescopes). When Ryo was 10, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album ''Midnight Blue'' by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study jazz.\n\nIn high school, he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electronic organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed (acceleration) of gravity must be much greater than speed of light. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[Gazell|BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and editing.\n\n===Early career in Japan (1969\u20131973)===\nHe recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the No.&nbsp;3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz poll, Kawasaki spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Kawasaki's house).\n\nHe also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese jazz musicians such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66|\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66|\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66]]) and many others.\n\n===Developments in New York City (1973\u20132002)===\n\n====1973\u20131979 (as guitarist)====\n[[File:Ryo-gil.jpg|thumb|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Gil Evans]] at Sweet Basil in New York City, 1982]]\n[[File:David Williams, Elvin Jones and Ryo Kawasaki.jpg|right|thumb|David Williams, [[Elvin Jones]] and Kawasaki in Rochester, N.Y. 1976]]\nIn 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Kawasaki was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's \"loft scene\", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Kawasaki walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Kawasaki to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions, ''[[The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix]]''. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on [[RCA Records|RCA]], ''[[There Comes a Time (album)|There Comes a Time]]'', with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] on drums. Kawasaki rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public.\n\nKawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Kawasaki made his debut U.S. album, ''Juice'', in 1976 for RCA and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects.\n\nHe explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS Records|MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano \u2013 guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums\u2014AFT and Trinkets and Things\u2014for Timeless Records in the Netherlands. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums\u2014Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live\u2014the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings include [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams (jazz drummer)|Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]], and [[Alex Blake]]. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany.\n\n====1979\u20131990 (as inventor and programmer)====\nKawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in early 1980s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder called A8 along with 2 track mastering machine A2 and asked Kawasaki to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year.\n\nWhen the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16 hours a day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]\u2014''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musiquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''\u2014distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, ''Images'', in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990, for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] dance  singles\u2014\"Electric World\", \"One Kiss\", \"No Expectations\", \"Say Baby I Love You\", \"Don't Tell Me\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Life is The Rhythm\", \"Pleasure Garden\", and \"Acid Heat\"\u2014that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, ''The Music Now'' and ''Idex Music Jam''. In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced \"Crystallization\" in 1986.\n\n====1991\u20132000 (return to jazz guitarist)====\nKawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and record producer. Kawasaki's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album ''[[Here, There and Everywhere]]'' (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by Brazilian singer and guitarist [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo has continued to release a steady string of albums\u2014the acoustic ''My Reverie'' (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented ''Love Within The Universe'' (which received considerable airplay across the country), \"Remixes Remixes Vol. 1\" (also featuring Benson), \"Sweet Life\" and CD releases of \"Mirror of my Mind\" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam).\n\nHis 1999 release ''Cosmic Rhythm'' features British singer lyricist [[Clare Foster]] along with Kawasaki's rhythm section Victor Jones on drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on flugelhorn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ro himself.\n\nDuring 1995\u20131999, three [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]], and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], recorded Kawasaki's original composition \"[[Bamboo Child]]\" on their latest albums more than twenty years after its original recording.\n\n===Developments in Estonia and beyond (2000\u20132020)===\nIn 2001, Kawasaki released live a studio trio album \"Reval\", recorded in [[Tallinn]], Estonia with Estonian musicians [[Toivo Unt]] on bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on drums, and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]].\n\nHis other projects include being a composer, music director as well as a guitarist for the jazz ballet \"Still Point\" for the Estonian National Opera House during 2000-2002. This ballet is choreographed by [[Russell Adamson]], a native Jamaican who resides in [[Helsinki]].\n\nKawasaki released his third [[acoustic guitar]] solo album 'E' in 2002.\n\nFrom the year 2000 on, Kawasaki further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori Jazz|Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and [[Saransk]] Jazz Ark Festival. He also appeared numerous times at [[N\u00f5mme]] Jazz Festival in Estonia while assisting the production of this jazz festival.\n\nKawasaki's projects during 2005\u20132008 included guitar trio project with American drummer [[Brian Melvin]] and Estonian bassist [[Toivo Unt]] under the \"Art of Trio\" name, performing in a variety of venues in Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic states, and performing with Estonian vocalist Jaanika Ventsel, while also touring and recording in Japan for the duo project with bassist Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]), their duo CD \"[[Agana]]\" was released in February 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Kawasaki formed jazz ensemble with Estonian pianist/keyboardist [[T\u00f5nu Naissoo]].<ref>[http://www.tonunaissoo.com]</ref> Also, his second duo CD with Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]) and first CD with \"Art of Trio\" were completed and released during 2009, while his composition \"Raisins\" was included on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' radio station Fusion FM in 2008.\n\nFrom 2009 - 2011, Kawasaki further expanded his performing activities in Lebanon with Syrian bassist, Omar Harb and Lebanese drummer, Fouad Afra. The album \"Live in Beirut\" which Kawasaki recorded with Lebanese organist, Arthur Satyan and drummer, Fouad Afra was released in 2011.\n\nOverlapping the same time period, beginning in 2007, Kawasaki gradually developed his 4th acoustic guitar solo album \"Spain\" in Tallinn, Estonia, which was finally released in 2012.\nIn 2014, Ryo discovered a younger generation of Estonian musicians who inspired him to further develop a fusion, jazz-rock sound using his own compositions. Ryo's attention on these directions had somewhat faded away after their recording and release in the early 1980s with his group \"Golden Dragon\". As of spring 2016, Kawasaki has formed a new quartet called, \"Level 8\" exclusively with Estonian musicians: keyboardist, Raun Juurikas; electric bassist, Kaarel Liiv; and drummer, Eno Kollom. \"Level 8\" has now finished recording a new self-titled album focusing on Ryo's compositions both from the past and present utilizing a funk/fusion/jazz-rock sound. The album \"Level 8\" was released in March 2017.\n\nIn April 2016, UK independent label Nunorthernsoul released a vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works 1979 to 1983 by Ryo Kawasaki.\" A follow-up vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works Part 2 - 1976 to 1980 by Ryo Kawasaki\" is scheduled to be released in April 2017.\n\nHe died in Tallinn, Estonia in April 2020 at the age of 73.<ref>[https://kultuur.err.ee/1076803/suri-ryo-kawasaki Suri Ryo Kawasaki]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===As leader===\n* ''Easy Listening Jazz Guitar'' ([[Polydor Records|Polydor]], 1970)\n* ''Gut's the Guitar'' (Toshiba, 1972)\n* ''[[Prism (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Prism]]'' ([[East Wind Records|East Wind]], 1975)\n* ''[[Eight Mile Road (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Eight Mile Road]]'' (East Wind, 1976)\n* ''Juice'' ([[RCA Records|RCA]], 1976)\n* ''[[Ring Toss (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Ring Toss]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Nature's Revenge]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Mirror of My Mind]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Little Tree (Ryo Kawasaki album) | Little Tree]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Live (Ryo Kawasaki album) | Live]]'' (1980)\n* ''Sapporo'' (1980)\n* ''Ryo'' (1982)\n* ''Lucky Lady'' (1983)\n* ''Images'' (1987)\n* ''Here, There and Everywhere'' (1992)\n* ''My Reverie'' (1993)\n* ''Love Within the Universe'' (1994)\n* ''Remixes Vol.1.''

He is best known as one of the first musicians to develop and popularise the fusion genre and for helping to develop the [[guitar synthesizer]] in collaboration with [[Roland Corporation]] and [[Korg]]. His album ''Ryo Kawasaki and the Golden Dragon Live'' was one of the first all digital recordings and he created the [[Kawasaki Synthesizer]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. During the 1960s, he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 1970s, he moved to New York City, where he settled and worked with [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Joanne Brackeen]] amongst others. In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music software for computers. He also produced several techno dance singles, formed his own record company called Satellites Records, and later returned to jazz-fusion in 1991.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life (1947\u20131968)===\nRyo Kawasaki was born on February 25, 1947, in [[K\u014denji]], Tokyo, while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father, Torao Kawasaki, was a Japanese [[diplomat]] who had worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese consulates and embassies, including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchuria]], now [[Shenyang]] in China), [[Shanghai]], and [[Beijing]] while active as an English teacher and translator for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother, Hiroko, was also multilingual, and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchuria]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years old when Ryo was born as an only child.\n\nKawasaki's mother encouraged him to take piano and ballet lessons, and he took voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and violin lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and electronics (he built his own radios, TVs and audio systems including amplifiers and speakers as well as telescopes). When Ryo was 10, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album ''Midnight Blue'' by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study jazz.\n\nIn high school, he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electronic organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed (acceleration) of gravity must be much greater than speed of light. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[Gazell|BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and editing.\n\n===Early career in Japan (1969\u20131973)===\nHe recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the No.&nbsp;3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz poll, Kawasaki spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Kawasaki's house).\n\nHe also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese jazz musicians such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66|\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66|\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66]]) and many others.\n\n===Developments in New York City (1973\u20132002)===\n\n====1973\u20131979 (as guitarist)====\n[[File:Ryo-gil.jpg|thumb|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Gil Evans]] at Sweet Basil in New York City, 1982]]\n[[File:David Williams, Elvin Jones and Ryo Kawasaki.jpg|right|thumb|David Williams, [[Elvin Jones]] and Kawasaki in Rochester, N.Y. 1976]]\nIn 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Kawasaki was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's \"loft scene\", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Kawasaki walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Kawasaki to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions, ''[[The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix]]''. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on [[RCA Records|RCA]], ''[[There Comes a Time (album)|There Comes a Time]]'', with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] on drums. Kawasaki rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public.\n\nKawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Kawasaki made his debut U.S. album, ''Juice'', in 1976 for RCA and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects.\n\nHe explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS Records|MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano \u2013 guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums\u2014AFT and Trinkets and Things\u2014for Timeless Records in the Netherlands. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums\u2014Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live\u2014the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings include [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams (jazz drummer)|Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]], and [[Alex Blake]]. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany.\n\n====1979\u20131990 (as inventor and programmer)====\nKawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in early 1980s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder called A8 along with 2 track mastering machine A2 and asked Kawasaki to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year.\n\nWhen the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16 hours a day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]\u2014''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musiquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''\u2014distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, ''Images'', in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990, for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] dance  singles\u2014\"Electric World\", \"One Kiss\", \"No Expectations\", \"Say Baby I Love You\", \"Don't Tell Me\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Life is The Rhythm\", \"Pleasure Garden\", and \"Acid Heat\"\u2014that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, ''The Music Now'' and ''Idex Music Jam''. In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced \"Crystallization\" in 1986.\n\n====1991\u20132000 (return to jazz guitarist)====\nKawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and record producer. Kawasaki's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album ''[[Here, There and Everywhere]]'' (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by Brazilian singer and guitarist [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo has continued to release a steady string of albums\u2014the acoustic ''My Reverie'' (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented ''Love Within The Universe'' (which received considerable airplay across the country), \"Remixes Remixes Vol. 1\" (also featuring Benson), \"Sweet Life\" and CD releases of \"Mirror of my Mind\" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam).\n\nHis 1999 release ''Cosmic Rhythm'' features British singer lyricist [[Clare Foster]] along with Kawasaki's rhythm section Victor Jones on drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on flugelhorn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ro himself.\n\nDuring 1995\u20131999, three [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]], and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], recorded Kawasaki's original composition \"[[Bamboo Child]]\" on their latest albums more than twenty years after its original recording.\n\n===Developments in Estonia and beyond (2000\u20132020)===\nIn 2001, Kawasaki released live a studio trio album \"Reval\", recorded in [[Tallinn]], Estonia with Estonian musicians [[Toivo Unt]] on bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on drums, and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]].\n\nHis other projects include being a composer, music director as well as a guitarist for the jazz ballet \"Still Point\" for the Estonian National Opera House during 2000-2002. This ballet is choreographed by [[Russell Adamson]], a native Jamaican who resides in [[Helsinki]].\n\nKawasaki released his third [[acoustic guitar]] solo album 'E' in 2002.\n\nFrom the year 2000 on, Kawasaki further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori Jazz|Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and [[Saransk]] Jazz Ark Festival. He also appeared numerous times at [[N\u00f5mme]] Jazz Festival in Estonia while assisting the production of this jazz festival.\n\nKawasaki's projects during 2005\u20132008 included guitar trio project with American drummer [[Brian Melvin]] and Estonian bassist [[Toivo Unt]] under the \"Art of Trio\" name, performing in a variety of venues in Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic states, and performing with Estonian vocalist Jaanika Ventsel, while also touring and recording in Japan for the duo project with bassist Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]), their duo CD \"[[Agana]]\" was released in February 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Kawasaki formed jazz ensemble with Estonian pianist/keyboardist [[T\u00f5nu Naissoo]].<ref>[http://www.tonunaissoo.com]</ref> Also, his second duo CD with Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]) and first CD with \"Art of Trio\" were completed and released during 2009, while his composition \"Raisins\" was included on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' radio station Fusion FM in 2008.\n\nFrom 2009 - 2011, Kawasaki further expanded his performing activities in Lebanon with Syrian bassist, Omar Harb and Lebanese drummer, Fouad Afra. The album \"Live in Beirut\" which Kawasaki recorded with Lebanese organist, Arthur Satyan and drummer, Fouad Afra was released in 2011.\n\nOverlapping the same time period, beginning in 2007, Kawasaki gradually developed his 4th acoustic guitar solo album \"Spain\" in Tallinn, Estonia, which was finally released in 2012.\nIn 2014, Ryo discovered a younger generation of Estonian musicians who inspired him to further develop a fusion, jazz-rock sound using his own compositions. Ryo's attention on these directions had somewhat faded away after their recording and release in the early 1980s with his group \"Golden Dragon\".
