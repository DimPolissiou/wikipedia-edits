It was one of a small number of committed, independent theatre companies, including the [[Everyman Cinema, Hampstead|Hampstead Everyman]], the [[Gate Theatre Studio]] and the [[Q Theatre]], which took risks by producing a diverse range of new and experimental plays, or plays that were thought to be commercially non-viable on the West End. The theatrical producer [[Norman Marshall, theatrical director|Norman Marshall]] referred to these as 'The Other Theatre' in his 1947 book of the same name.\n\n[[File:Arts Theatre London 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Arts Theatre in 2011]]\n\nThe theatre opened with a revue by [[Herbert Farjeon]] entitled ''Picnic'', produced by Harold Scott and with music by [[Beverley Nichols]]. Its first important production was ''[[Young Woodley (play)|Young Woodley]]'' by [[John Van Druten]], staged in 1928, which later transferred to the [[Savoy Theatre]] when the Lord Chamberlain's ban was lifted. In 1938, a four-week revival of the [[Sewell Stokes|Stokes brothers']] [[Oscar Wilde (play)|Oscar Wilde]], starring Francis L. Sullivan and produced by [[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]], opened on 25 October. This coincided with a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of the play. In 1942, [[Alec Clunes]] and John Hanau took over the running of the theatre and for ten years produced a wide range of plays, winning a reputation as a 'pocket national theatre'. In 1946, Clunes teamed with author [[Peter Elstob]] to raise \u00a320,000, which eventually put the theatre on a sound financial footing.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1403076/Peter-Elstob.html | title=Peter Elstob| date=2002-07-30}}</ref>\n\n[[Ronnie Barker]] made his West End d\u00e9but at the production of ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' at the Arts Theatre in 1955 which was directed by Sir [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]], with whom Barker had worked at the [[Oxford Playhouse]]. Barker remained a West End actor for some years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included two performances each night as he played a gypsy in ''Listen to the Wind'' at the Arts Theatre in 1955.

Meanwhile, adult performances continued in the evening, including [[Tom Stoppard]]'s satirical double-bill ''[[Dirty Linen and New-Found-Land]]'' which, opening in June 1976, ran for four years at the Arts.\n\nThe theatre's lease was taken over by a consortium of UK and US producers in 2000 for a five-year period, and it was relaunched as a West End theatre with the anniversary production of [[Julian Mitchell]]'s play ''[[Another Country (play)|Another Country]]'', directed by [[Stephen Henry]]. Notable productions during this time included ''[[Closer to Heaven (musical)|Closer to Heaven]]'', the [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]/[[Pet Shop Boys]] musical, and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.\n\nIn 2011, the theatre was taken over by [[JJ Goodman]] and led by Artistic Director Mig Kimpton under the business management of Louis Hartshorn.
