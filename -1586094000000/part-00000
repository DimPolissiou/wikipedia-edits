Accumulation of these cancer cells causes a microscopic focus of abnormal cells that are, at least initially, locally confined within the specific tissue in which the progenitor cell resided. This condition is called squamous cell [[carcinoma in situ|carcinoma ''in situ'']], and it is diagnosed when the tumor has not yet penetrated the [[basement membrane]] or other delimiting structure to invade adjacent tissues. Once the lesion has grown and progressed to the point where it has breached, penetrated, and infiltrated adjacent structures, it is referred to as \"[[Invasive (medical)|invasive]]\" squamous cell carcinoma. Once a carcinoma becomes invasive, it is able to spread to other organs and cause a [[metastasis]], or \"secondary tumor\", to form.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Causes==\n\nHuman papilloma virus\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nThe differential for OSSN includes [[pterygium]], [[pingueculum]], [[papilloma]], [[solar keratosis]], [[lipoma]], [[lymphoma]], [[chronic blepharoconjunctivitis]], [[inflammation]], [[melanoma]], ocular [[pannus]], [[pyogenic granuloma]], [[kaposi sarcoma]], [[keratocanthoma]], mucoepidermoid carcinoma, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma.<ref name=\"0020-8167\">{{ISSN|0020-8167}}</ref> While [[confocal microscopy]] can be used for diagnosis, biopsy is considered the standard, especially before treatment with a cytotoxic medication.<ref name=\"0020-8167\"/>\n\n==Management==\nMost conjunctival squamous cell carcinomas are removed with surgery.  A few selected cases are treated with [[topical]] medication.  Surgical excision with a [[free margin]] of healthy tissue is a frequent treatment modality.

Accumulation of these cancer cells causes a microscopic focus of abnormal cells that are, at least initially, locally confined within the specific tissue in which the progenitor cell resided. This condition is called squamous cell [[carcinoma in situ|carcinoma ''in situ'']], and it is diagnosed when the tumor has not yet penetrated the [[basement membrane]] or other delimiting structure to invade adjacent tissues. Once the lesion has grown and progressed to the point where it has breached, penetrated, and infiltrated adjacent structures, it is referred to as \"[[Invasive (medical)|invasive]]\" squamous cell carcinoma. Once a carcinoma becomes invasive, it is able to spread to other organs and cause a [[metastasis]], or \"secondary tumor\", to form.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Causes==\n\nHuman papilloma virus\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nThe differential for OSSN includes [[pterygium]], [[pingueculum]], [[papilloma]], [[solar keratosis]], [[lipoma]], [[lymphoma]], [[chronic blepharoconjunctivitis]], [[inflammation]], [[melanoma]], ocular [[pannus]], [[pyogenic granuloma]], [[kaposi sarcoma]], [[keratocanthoma]], mucoepidermoid carcinoma, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma.<ref name=\"0020-8167\">{{ISSN|0020-8167}}</ref> While [[confocal microscopy]] can be used for diagnosis, biopsy is considered the standard, especially before treatment with a cytotoxic medication.<ref name=\"0020-8167\"/>\n\n==Management==\nMost conjunctival squamous cell carcinomas are removed with surgery.

Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, ease of detaching sheets, and compatibility with pets.

One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.<ref>The enthusiast, Bill Jarrett, and the inventor, Curtis Batts, are described in [[#Solutions|Solutions]].</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Motivations for study}}Context and relevance==\nIn the article \"Bathroom Politics: Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up\",{{sfn|Burns|2003}} [[Eastern Institute of Technology]] [[sociology]] professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination. On the first day of Burns' introductory course in sociology, he asks his students, \"Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang?\"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=111}} In the following fifty minutes, the students examine why they picked their answers, exploring the [[social construction]] of \"rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before\".{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=113}}\n\nBurns' activity has been adopted by a [[social psychology]] course at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where it is used to illustrate the principles of [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]]'s 1966 classic ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.{{sfn|Collett|2008}}\n\n[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under \"tastes, preferences, and interests\" as opposed to either [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] or \"attitudes, traits, norms, and needs\". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests are an important part of [[identity (social science)|identity]]; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's \"sense of uniqueness\". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls \"the 'get a life' folks among us\" who elevate interests into moral issues.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pp=173\u2013175}}\n\n[[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a [[chest of drawers]] to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that [[neuroimaging]] experiments\u2014which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from [[mental rotation]] and [[facial expression]]s to grocery shopping and [[tickling]]\u2014must strive to avoid such [[cultural bias]] and [[stereotype]]s.{{sfn|Gernsbacher|2007}}\n\nIn his book ''[[Conversational Capital]]'', Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of [[ritual]]ized behavior\u2014one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to [[word-of-mouth]] momentum. Cesvet's other examples include shaking a box of [[Tic Tac]]s and dissecting [[Oreo]] cookies.{{sfn|Cesvet|Babinski|Alper|2008|p=68}}\n\nBroadcaster [[Jim Bohannon]] has said that such issues are good for [[talk radio]]: \"It is an interactive medium, a certain kind of clash, it doesn't have to be a violent clash, but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list. It has to be something that's of general interest.\"{{sfn|Voice of America|2004}}\n\nThere are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] [[axle]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[wall]]: the toilet paper may hang ''over'' or ''under'' the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. In surveys of [[United States|American]] consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60-70% of respondents prefer ''over''.  This is said to exhibit [[Endianness#Etymology|Endianness]], which applies not only to [[eggs]], but to [[toilet paper]].

Despite the challenges posed by the hostile [[Antarctic climate]], \"It is in the more mundane trials of everyday life that personality clashes are revealed.\"{{sfn|Daily Express|1999|p=39}}\n\n==Solutions==\n\nSome of the proposed solutions to this problem involve more or better technology, while others concentrate on human behavior.\n\n===Mechanical===\nThe Tilt-A-Roll is a swiveling toilet paper dispenser invented by Curtis Batts in 1996, a [[Dallas]]-native [[industrial engineer]].{{sfn|Floyd|1999}} His patents on the invention, summarize its design as \"An adjustable angle coupling secures the yoke to the mounting assembly and permits rotation of the yoke about an axis directed orthogonally through the spindle such that the paper roll can be oriented to unroll paper either from over or from under the roll as desired.\"<ref>{{patent|US|5588615}} and {{patent|US|5690302}}</ref> An inventor named Rocky Hutson demonstrated a similar device he called the T.P. Swivel to the producers of the television program ''[[PitchMen]]'' in late 2009. {{sfn|Zayas|2009}}\n\nAnother solution is to install two toilet paper dispensers. A reader of the ''[[Annie's Mailbox]]'' column recommends using a holder large enough to fit two rolls, noting that the roll mounted ''over'' is more popular. Another reader sidesteps the issue by foregoing the holder, instead piling five or six rolls in a big wicker basket.{{sfn|Mitchell|Sugar|2005b}} Even using separate bathrooms can help.<ref>{{harvnb|Arkins|1994}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.</ref> Other solutions include vertical holders.\n\n===Behavioral===\nToilet paper orientation has been used rhetorically as the ultimate issue that government has no business dictating, in letters to the editor protesting the regulation of [[noise pollution]]{{sfn|Ratzlaff|2009}} and stricter requirements to get a divorce.{{sfn|Wuthrich|2006}} In 2006, protesting [[New Hampshire]]'s [[List of smoking bans in the United States#New Hampshire|ban on smoking]] in restaurants and bars, representative Ralph Boehm ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]\u2013[[Litchfield, New Hampshire|Litchfield]]) asked \"Will we soon be told which direction the toilet paper must hang from the roll?\"{{sfn|Saunders|2006}}\n\nDavid O'Connor's 2005 book ''Henderson's House Rules: The Official Guide to Replacing the Toilet Paper and Other Domestic Topics of Great Dispute'' aims to solve disagreements with a minimum of debate or compromise by offering authoritative, reasonable rules.{{sfn|O'Connor|2005|pp=2\u20133}} The \"House Rule\" for toilet paper is ''over and out'', and a full page is dedicated to a diagram of this orientation. But O'Connor writes that \"if a female household member has a strong preference for the toilet paper to hang over and in, against the wall, that preference prevails. It is admittedly an odd preference, but women use toilet paper far more often than men\u2014hence the rule.\"<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|2005|pp=63\u201364}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2006}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n===References===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation |author=Answer Fella |date=January 2007 |title=Famous Birthdays, Girlfriend Advice & a Brief History of Toilet Paper |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |page=52 |url=http://www.esquire.com/style/answer-fella/ESQ0107toiletpaper |accessdate=11 July 2010}}\n* {{Citation |last=Arkins |first=Diane C. |title=Consider Fallout of New Bath |date=7 October 1994|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=22N |id={{Factiva|chi0000020011028dqa700wzz}}}}\n* {{Citation |title=W.

Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, ease of detaching sheets, and compatibility with pets. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.<ref>For pros and cons, including RVs and cats, see [[#Arguments|Arguments]]; for celebrities and experts, including Ann Landers, see [[#Noted preferences|Noted preferences]]; for theories, see [[#Themes|Themes]].</ref> \n\nSolutions where the views of household members differ include using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms and ignoring the issue. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.<ref>The enthusiast, Bill Jarrett, and the inventor, Curtis Batts, are described in [[#Solutions|Solutions]].</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Motivations for study}}Context and relevance==\nIn the article \"Bathroom Politics: Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up\",{{sfn|Burns|2003}} [[Eastern Institute of Technology]] [[sociology]] professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination. On the first day of Burns' introductory course in sociology, he asks his students, \"Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang?\"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=111}} In the following fifty minutes, the students examine why they picked their answers, exploring the [[social construction]] of \"rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before\".{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=113}}\n\nBurns' activity has been adopted by a [[social psychology]] course at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where it is used to illustrate the principles of [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]]'s 1966 classic ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.{{sfn|Collett|2008}}\n\n[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under \"tastes, preferences, and interests\" as opposed to either [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] or \"attitudes, traits, norms, and needs\". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests are an important part of [[identity (social science)|identity]]; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's \"sense of uniqueness\". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls \"the 'get a life' folks among us\" who elevate interests into moral issues.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pp=173\u2013175}}\n\n[[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a [[chest of drawers]] to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that [[neuroimaging]] experiments\u2014which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from [[mental rotation]] and [[facial expression]]s to grocery shopping and [[tickling]]\u2014must strive to avoid such [[cultural bias]] and [[stereotype]]s.{{sfn|Gernsbacher|2007}}\n\nIn his book ''[[Conversational Capital]]'', Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of [[ritual]]ized behavior\u2014one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to [[word-of-mouth]] momentum. Cesvet's other examples include shaking a box of [[Tic Tac]]s and dissecting [[Oreo]] cookies.{{sfn|Cesvet|Babinski|Alper|2008|p=68}}\n\nBroadcaster [[Jim Bohannon]] has said that such issues are good for [[talk radio]]: \"It is an interactive medium, a certain kind of clash, it doesn't have to be a violent clash, but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list.
