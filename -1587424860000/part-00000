Words that are synonyms are said to be '''synonymous''', and the state of being a synonym is called '''synonymy'''.  For example, the words ''begin'', ''start'', ''commence'', and ''initiate'' are all synonyms of one another. Words are typically synonymous in one particular [[word sense|sense]]: for example, ''long'' and ''extended'' in the [[context (language use)|context]] ''long time'' or ''extended time'' are synonymous, but ''long'' cannot be used in the phrase ''extended family''.

Reed first gained prominence as a [[war correspondent]] during the [[World War I|first World War]], and later became best known for his coverage of the [[October Revolution]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd, Russia]], which he wrote about in his book [[Ten Days That Shook the World|''Ten Days That Shook the World''.]]\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Silas Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandparents' mansion in what is now the [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]]. His grandmother's household had Chinese servants.<ref>Granville Hicks with John Stuart, ''John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary.'' New York: Macmillan, 1936. p. 1.</ref> Reed wrote of paying a nickel to a \"Goose Hollowite\" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up. In 2001 a memorial bench dedicated to Reed was installed in [[Washington Park, Portland, Oregon|Washington Park]], which overlooks the site of Reed's birthplace (the mansion no longer exists).<ref name=prince>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YABWNNHirLIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage|title=Portland's Goose Hollow|last=Prince|first=Tracy J.|isbn=978-0-7385-7472-1|page=122|year=2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina}}</ref>\n\nHis mother, Margaret (Green) Reed, was the daughter of Portland industrialist [[Henry Dodge Green]],<ref name=\"cartoon\">[http://www.amiaconference.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/John-Reeds-Portland-Map.pdf \"Jon Reed's Portland \u2013 Map\"], Oregon Cartoon Institute</ref> who had made a fortune founding and operating three businesses: the first gas & light company, the first pig iron smelter on the West Coast, and the Portland water works (he was its second owner).<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 2.</ref> SW Green Avenue was named in his honor.<ref name=\"cartoon\"/>\n\nJohn's father, Charles Jerome Reed, was born in the East and came to Portland as the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer.

He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club, served on the editorial boards of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon|Lampoon]]'' and ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]'', and was president of the [[Harvard Glee Club]]. In 1910 he held a position in the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]], and also wrote music and lyrics for their show ''Diana's Debut''. Reed failed to make the football and [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] teams, but excelled in swimming and water polo.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 16.</ref> He was also made \"Ivy orator and poet\" in his senior year.\n\nReed attended meetings of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society|Socialist Club]], over which his friend [[Walter Lippmann]] presided, but never joined. The group introduced legislation into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration to establish a course on [[socialism]].<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' page 33.</ref> Reed later recalled:\n\n<blockquote>All this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like [[H.G. Wells]] and [[Graham Wallas]], wrenching us away from the [[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Wildian]] [[Amateur|dilettantism]] which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.<ref>Quoted in Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 33.</ref></blockquote>\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910. That summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring.<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 51.</ref> Reed worked as a common laborer on a cattle boat to pay his fare to Europe. His travels were encouraged by his favorite professor, [[Charles Townsend Copeland]] (\"Copey\"), who told him he must \"see life\" if he wanted to successfully write about it.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Macmilian|first1=Granville Hicks|title=Promethean Playboy|journal=Time|date=1936|volume=27|issue=16}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Journalist===\nReed had determined to become a journalist, and set out to make his mark in New York, a center of the industry. Reed made use of a valuable contact from Harvard, [[Lincoln Steffens]], who was establishing a reputation as a muckraker. He appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on ''[[The American Magazine]]'', where he read manuscripts, corrected proofs, and later helped with the composition. Reed supplemented his salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called ''Landscape Architecture.''<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Reed journalist.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|A native of [[Oregon]], John Reed made New York City the base of his operations.]]\n\nReed made his home in [[Greenwich Village]], a burgeoning hub of poets, writers, activists, and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a [[Freelancer|freelance journalist]] that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips, circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]].'' Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]],'' ''[[The Forum (defunct magazine)|The Forum]],'' and ''[[The Century Magazine]].'' One of his poems was set to music by composer [[Arthur Foote]]. The editors at ''The American'' came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 66.</ref>\n\nReed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and [[Ida Tarbell]]. He moved beyond them to a more radical political position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of ''[[The Masses]]'', edited by [[Max Eastman]]. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this socialist publication.\n\nThe first of Reed's many arrests came in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of [[Paterson Silk Strike of 1913|strikers in the New Jersey silk mills]]. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term he served further radicalized Reed. He allied with the general socialist union<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iww.org/history/library/iww/responsetoRILU/4|title=(4) I.W.W Not a Syndicalist Organization {{!}} Industrial Workers of the World|website=www.iww.org|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].<ref name=\"Homberger, John Reed, p. 49\">Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 49.</ref> His account of his experiences was published in June as an article, \"War in Paterson.\" During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader [[Bill Haywood]], Reed put on \"The Pageant of the Paterson Strike\" in [[Madison Square Garden]] as a benefit for the strikers.<ref name=\"Homberger, John Reed, p. 49\"/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1913, Reed was sent to Mexico by the ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' to report the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 55.</ref> He shared the perils of [[Pancho Villa]]'s army for four months and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose \"Primer Jefe\" political chief was [[Venustiano Carranza]]) when it defeated Federal forces at [[Torre\u00f3n]], opening the way for its advance on Mexico City.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 69.</ref> Reed adored Villa, but Carranza left him cold.\n\nReed's reporting on the [[Villistas]] in a series of outstanding magazine articles gained him a national reputation as a [[war correspondent]]. Reed deeply sympathized with the [[peons]] and vehemently opposed [[United States occupation of Veracruz|American intervention]]. Reed's reports were collected and published as the book ''Insurgent Mexico'' (1914).\n\nOn April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in [[Colorado]], scene of the recent [[Ludlow massacre]], a result of owners' suppression of labor organizing. There he spent a little more than a week, during which he investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July). He came to believe much more deeply in class conflict.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nReed spent summer 1914 in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] with [[Mabel Dodge]] and her son, putting together ''Insurgent Mexico'' and interviewing [[United States President|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at [[White House]] insistence, was not a success.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 79.</ref>\n\n===War correspondent===\nOn August 14, 1914, shortly after [[German Empire|Germany]] declared war on France, Reed set sail for neutral Italy, on assignment for the ''Metropolitan''. He met his lover Mabel Dodge in [[Naples]], and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed believed the war was the result of imperialist commercial rivalries and felt little sympathy for any of the parties.\n\nIn an unsigned piece titled \"The Traders' War,\" published in the September 1914 issue of ''The Masses,'' Reed wrote:\n\n{{quote|The real War, of which this sudden outburst of death and destruction is only an incident, began long ago. It has been raging for tens of years, but its battles have been so little advertised that they have been hardly noted. It is a clash of Traders...\n\nWhat has democracy to do in alliance with [[Nicholas II|Nicholas]], the Tsar? Is it Liberalism which is marching from the [[St. Petersburg, Russia|Petersburg]] of [[Father Gapon]], from the [[Odessa]] of the [[pogrom]]s?...\n\nNo. There is a falling out among commercial rivals....\n\nWe, who are Socialists, must hope\u2014we may even expect\u2014that out of this horror of bloodshed and dire destruction will come far-reaching social changes\u2014and a long step forward towards our goal of Peace among Men.\n\nBut we must not be duped by this editorial buncombe about Liberalism going forth to Holy War against Tyranny.\n\nThis is not Our War.<ref>John Reed, \"The Trader's War,\" ''The Masses,'' v. 5, no. 12, whole no. 40 (Sept. 1914), pp. 16\u201317. The article was attributed to \"a well-known American author and war correspondent who is compelled by arrangements with another publication to withhold his name.\"</ref>}}\n\nIn France, Reed was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of reaching the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed's relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 87.</ref> The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed [[Karl Liebknecht]], one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the [[Second International]], and by its replacement with [[militarism]] and [[nationalism]].<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 89.</ref>\n[[File:Reed-john-1917.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Reed {{Circa|1917}}]]\n\nHe returned to New York in December and wrote more about the war. In 1915 he traveled to Central Europe, accompanied by [[Boardman Robinson]], a Canadian artist and frequent ''Masses'' contributor. Traveling from [[Thessaloniki]], they saw scenes of profound devastation in [[Serbia]] (including a bombed-out [[Belgrade]]), also going through [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. They passed through the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] in [[Bessarabia]]. In [[Che\u0142m]] they were arrested and incarcerated for several weeks. At risk of being shot for espionage, they were saved by the American ambassador.\n\nTraveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the American ambassador in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) finally secured permission for them to leave, but not until after all their papers were seized in [[Kiev]]. In [[Bucharest]], the duo spent time piecing together more of their journey. At one point Reed traveled to [[Constantinople]] in hopes of seeing action at [[Gallipoli]]. From these experiences he wrote the book, ''[[The War in Eastern Europe]],'' published in April 1916.\n\nAfter returning to New York, Reed visited his mother in Portland. There he met and fell in love with [[Louise Bryant]], who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both also had affairs with others, in accordance with their bohemian circle and ideas about sexual liberation. Early in 1916 Reed met the young playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Beginning that May, the three rented a cottage in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], a summer destination on [[Cape Cod]] for many artists and writers from Greenwich Village. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 114.</ref>\n\nThat summer Reed covered the Presidential nominating conventions. He endorsed [[Woodrow Wilson]], believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 112\u201316.</ref> In November 1916 he married Bryant in [[Peekskill, New York]]. The same year, he underwent an operation at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] to remove a kidney. <!-- why? --> He was hospitalized until mid-December.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 118.</ref> The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a [[conscientious objector]], as had been his intention. During 1916 he privately published ''Tamburlaine and Other Verses'', in an edition of 500 copies.\n\nAs the country raced towards war, Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the ''Metropolitan'' was over. He pawned his late father's watch and sold his [[Cape Cod]] cottage to the [[birth control]] activist and sex educator [[Margaret Sanger]].<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 120.</ref>\n\nWhen Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the [[People's Council (US)|People's Council]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]: \"This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.\"<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 122.</ref> In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles against the war for ''[[The Masses]]'', which the [[United States Post Office Department]] refused to mail, and for ''Seven Arts.'' Due to antiwar articles by Reed and [[Randolph Bourne]], the arts magazine lost its financial backing and ceased publication.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 128\u201329.</ref> Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor, and his career lay in ruins.\n\n===Witness to the Russian Revolution===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u2116 5885. 1987. 100 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e \u0434\u043d\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0438\u0434\u0430.jpg|thumb|Worker of the American labor movement, internationalist writer, John Reed. Stamp of USSR, 1987.]]\n\nOn August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the [[US Department of State|State Department]] with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in [[Stockholm]].<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests and German and Bolshevik Propaganda: Report and Hearings of the Subcommittee on the Judiciary, United States Senate...,'' vol 3. p. 563. Hereafter: ''Overman Committee Report, v. 3.''</ref> The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of [[Finland]], the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed [[Kornilov affair|military coup]] of [[monarchist]] General [[Lavr Kornilov]]. This was an attempt to topple the [[Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles. Several of the subject nations of the old empire, such as Finland and [[Ukraine]], had gained autonomy and were seeking separate military accommodations with Germany.\n\nReed and Bryant were in Petrograd for the [[October Revolution]], in which the [[Bolsheviks]], headed by [[Vladimir Lenin]], toppled the Kerensky government; the Bolsheviks believed this was the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.\n\nFood shortages made the situation dire in the capital, and social disorder reigned. Reed later recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down\u2014milk and everything of that sort.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 575.</ref></blockquote>\n\nA mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government considered this a kind of coup, and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press. It issued warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and prepared to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets. At 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the [[Winter Palace]], the seat of Kerensky's government.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 569.</ref> Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 570.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u0420\u0438\u0434-\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|The cover of this 1919 British pamphlet emphasizes Reed's short-lived status as Soviet consul.]]\n\nReed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new [[revolutionary socialist]] government. He went to work for the new [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs]], translating decrees and news of the new government into English. \"I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,\" Reed later recalled.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 565.</ref>\n\nReed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met [[Leon Trotsky]] and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted, and he took a job with American [[Raymond Robins]] of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross]]. Robins wanted to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied. But in the dummy issue he prepared, he included a warning beneath the masthead: \"This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.\"<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 159\u201360</ref>\n\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved. Two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 161\">Homberger, p. 161</ref> Reed attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, saying he hoped it would \"call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses.\" American journalist [[Edgar Sisson]] told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 161\"/>\n\nIn January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York. As the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, Reed's credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he would have faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). Most Americans in Petrograd considered Reed's appointment a massive blunder. Businessman [[Alexander Gumberg]] met with Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for setting up a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk]]. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew Reed's nomination. Learning of Gumberg's intervention, Reed always denigrated him afterward.<ref>Homberger, pp. 161\u201363</ref>\n\nReed and Bryant wrote and published books about their Russian experiences. Bryant's ''Six Red Months in Russia'' appeared first, but Reed's ''10 Days That Shook the World'' (1919) garnered more notice.\n\nBryant returned to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28.<ref name=\"Stuart, p. 303\">Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 303.</ref> On his way back, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to [[Finland]]. In [[Turku]] harbor, when Reed was boarding a [[ship]] on his way to [[Stockholm]], Finnish [[police]] arrested him; he was held at [[Kakola]] prison in [[Turku]] until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to [[Oslo|Kristiania]], [[Norway]] via [[Stockholm]].\n\nBecause he remained under indictment in the ''Masses'' case, federal authorities immediately met Reed when his ship reached New York, holding him on board for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's papers, the material from which he intended to write his book, were seized. He was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, [[Morris Hillquit]], promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day.<ref name=\"Stuart, p. 303\"/> His papers were not returned to him until November.\n\n===Radical political activist===\n[[File:Voice of labor 1 Oct 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Cover of Reed's ''Voice of Labor,'' October 1919]]\n\nBack in America, Reed and Bryant defended the Bolsheviks and opposed the American intervention. Incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany, the public gave Reed a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in ''The Masses'', particularly one headlined \"Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy\", had been instrumental in the government gaining an indictment for [[sedition]] against the magazine (antiwar agitation was considered sedition and treason).\n\nThe first ''Masses'' trial ended in a hung jury the day before Reed reached New York. The defendants, including him, were to be retried. He immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29.<ref>Homberger, p. 167</ref> The second ''Masses'' trial also ended in a hung jury.\n\nIn [[Philadelphia]], Reed stood outside a closed hall <!-- Whose hall\" -->on May 31, and harangued a crowd of 1,000 about the case and the war until police dragged him away. He was arrested for inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. Reed became more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive.<ref>Homberger, p. 172</ref> On September 14, he was arrested for the third time since returning from Russia, charged with violating the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]] and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia was held in the United States (in [[The Bronx]]). Reed had passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well.<ref>Homberger, p. 174</ref> He tried to prevent [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention]] in Russia, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the [[Ukraine]] and Japanese designs on [[Siberia]], but this argument came to naught.<ref>Homberger, p. 171</ref>\n\nOn February 21\u201322, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the US, but emerged resilient. Reed followed her. According to Homberger, his testimony was \"savagely distorted\" by the press.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 180\">Homberger, p. 180</ref> Later that day Reed went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 180\"/> Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of ''[[The New York Communist]],'' the weekly newspaper issued by the [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party|Left Wing Section]] of Greater New York.\n\nAffiliated with the Left Wing of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] (Reed's group, which he helped create) and, the next day, the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of America]]. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, ''The Voice of Labor'', and was denounced as \"Jack the Liar\" in the Communist Party organ, ''The Communist''. Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. He believed this was a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy \"based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.\"<ref>Homberger, pp. 191\u201393</ref>\n\n===Comintern functionary===\nIndicted for [[sedition]] and hoping to secure [[Comintern]] backing for the CLP, Reed fled America with a forged passport in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate; he worked his way to [[Bergen]] as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to [[Oslo|Kristiania]], crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to [[Moscow]] by train. In the cold winter of 1919\u201320, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages. He filled notebooks with his writing and had an affair with a Russian woman.<ref>Homberger, p. 210</ref>\n\nReed's feelings about the revolution became ambivalent. Activist [[Emma Goldman]] had recently arrived aboard the [[USAT Buford|''Buford'']], among hundreds of aliens deported by the United States under the Sedition Act. She was especially concerned about the [[Cheka]]. Reed told her that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate, but suggested that she see [[Angelica Balabanoff]], a critic of the current situation. He wanted Goldman to hear the other side.<ref>Homberger, pp. 202\u201303</ref>\n\n[[File:Reed-tendays-1922.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|German edition of ''10 Days That Shook The World'', published by the [[Communist International|Comintern]] in Hamburg in 1922]]\n\nThough facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, Reed tried to return to the United States in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America.<ref>Homberger, pp. 203\u201304</ref> Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to [[Petrograd]].<ref>Homberger, p. 204</ref> In March, he crossed into [[Helsinki]], where he had radical friends, including [[Hella Wuolijoki]], the future politician and [[Finnish People's Democratic League|SDKL]] [[Parliament of Finland|member of parliament]]. With their help, he was hidden in the hold of a freighter.\n\nOn 13 March, customs officials in Finland found Reed in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was seaman \"Jim Gormley\". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. Because of his silence, he could not be tried for [[treason]]. He was charged and convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).\n\nThe [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finns for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate.<ref>Homberger, pp. 205\u201306</ref> Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained. His physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[insomnia]], wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a [[hunger strike]].<ref>Homberger, p. 206</ref> He was finally released in early June, and sailed for [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to [[Petrograd]], recuperating from malnutrition and [[scurvy]] caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively. His spirits were high.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 207\">Homberger, p. 207</ref>\n\nAt the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow. After he discussed with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]] and arrived in [[Gothenburg]] on August 10.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 207\"/> At the same time, Reed attended the second [[Comintern]] congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.<ref>Homberger, pp. 207\u201308</ref>\n\nDuring this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians. The latter believed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, and that the Communist party needed to work within the existing institutions\u2014a policy Reed felt would be disastrous.<ref>Homberger, p. 208</ref> He was contemptuous of the [[bullying]] tactics displayed during the congress by [[Karl Radek]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], who ordered Reed to attend the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] to be held at [[Baku]] on August 15.\n\nThe journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through a countryside that was devastated by civil war and [[typhus]]. Reed was reluctant to go. He asked for permission to travel later, as he wanted to meet Bryant in Petrograd after she arrived from [[Murmansk]]. Zinoviev insisted that Reed take the official train: \"the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.\"<ref name=\"homberger212-213\"/> Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance.<ref name=\"homberger212-213\">Homberger, pp. 212\u201313</ref> Years after having abandoned Communism himself, his friend [[Benjamin Gitlow]] asserted that Reed became bitterly disillusioned with the Communist movement because of his treatment by Zinoviev.<ref>Homberger, p. 214</ref>\n\nDuring his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took Bryant to meet Lenin, Trotsky, [[Lev Kamenev]], and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:JOhnReedFuneral1920Moscow-l.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Reed's body [[lying in state]] in Moscow]]\n\nReed was determined to return to the United States but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have [[influenza]], he was hospitalized five days later and diagnosed with [[scrub typhus|spotted typhus]]. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied [[blockade]]. Reed's mind started to wander; eventually he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920.<ref>Homberger, p. 215</ref> After a hero's funeral, Reed's body was buried at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]. He remains one of only three Americans who were honored by being buried there.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe interpretation of Reed in popular culture has been varied. Some{{who|date=November 2014}} have dismissed him as a \"romantic revolutionary\" and a \"playboy\", a vapid dilettante pretending to profess revolutionary sensibilities. For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amidst solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon.<ref>By the 1930s, the height of the communist movement in the United States, literary [[John Reed Club]]s, affiliated with the Communist Party, existed in his honor in many large cities of the United States.</ref> Others, such as his old friend and comrade [[Benjamin Gitlow]], claimed that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism toward the end of his life. They sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] cause.\n\n===Representation in other media===\n* Soviet director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s influential 1927 [[silent film]] ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' was based on Reed's book.\n* [[John Dos Passos]] included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work ''1919,'' the second part of his [[U.S.A. trilogy]].\n* The 1958 Soviet film ''In October Days'' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:\u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f|\u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f]]}}), directed by [[Sergei Vasilyev]], featured Reed and Bryant.\n* Actor and director [[Warren Beatty]] made the film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981), based on Reed's life. Beatty starred as Reed, [[Diane Keaton]] as Louise Bryant and [[Jack Nicholson]] as Eugene O'Neill. The movie won three [[Academy Award]]s and was nominated for nine others.\n\nTwo films are based on Reed's accounts of the Mexican Revolution, one with two parts released a year apart. Mexican director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] made ''[[Reed: Insurgent Mexico]]'' (1973). A Mexican\u2013Soviet-Italian co-production released ''[[Red Bells]]'' (1982) and ''[[Red Bells II]]'' (1983), both directed by [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], with [[Franco Nero]] as Reed.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Diana's Debut.''

His grandmother's household had Chinese servants.<ref>Granville Hicks with John Stuart, ''John Reed: The Making of a Revolutionary.'' New York: Macmillan, 1936. p. 1.</ref> Reed wrote of paying a nickel to a \"Goose Hollowite\" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up.

He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club, served on the editorial boards of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon|Lampoon]]'' and ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]'', and was president of the [[Harvard Glee Club]]. In 1910 he held a position in the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]], and also wrote music and lyrics for their show ''Diana's Debut''. Reed failed to make the football and [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] teams, but excelled in swimming and water polo.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 16.</ref> He was also made \"Ivy orator and poet\" in his senior year.\n\nReed attended meetings of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society|Socialist Club]], over which his friend [[Walter Lippmann]] presided, but never joined. The group introduced legislation into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration to establish a course on [[socialism]].<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' page 33.</ref> Reed later recalled:\n\n<blockquote>All this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like [[H.G. Wells]] and [[Graham Wallas]], wrenching us away from the [[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Wildian]] [[Amateur|dilettantism]] which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.<ref>Quoted in Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 33.</ref></blockquote>\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910.

Reed made use of a valuable contact from Harvard, [[Lincoln Steffens]], who was establishing a reputation as a muckraker. He appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on ''[[The American Magazine]]'', where he read manuscripts, corrected proofs, and later helped with the composition. Reed supplemented his salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called ''Landscape Architecture.''<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Reed journalist.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|A native of [[Oregon]], John Reed made New York City the base of his operations.]]\n\nReed made his home in [[Greenwich Village]], a burgeoning hub of poets, writers, activists, and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a [[Freelancer|freelance journalist]] that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips, circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]].'' Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]],'' ''[[The Forum (defunct magazine)|The Forum]],'' and ''[[The Century Magazine]].'' One of his poems was set to music by composer [[Arthur Foote]]. The editors at ''The American'' came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.<ref>Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 66.</ref>\n\nReed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and [[Ida Tarbell]]. He moved beyond them to a more radical political position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of ''[[The Masses]]'', edited by [[Max Eastman]]. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this socialist publication.\n\nThe first of Reed's many arrests came in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of [[Paterson Silk Strike of 1913|strikers in the New Jersey silk mills]]. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term he served further radicalized Reed. He allied with the general socialist union<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iww.org/history/library/iww/responsetoRILU/4|title=(4) I.W.W Not a Syndicalist Organization {{!}} Industrial Workers of the World|website=www.iww.org|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].<ref name=\"Homberger, John Reed, p. 49\">Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 49.</ref> His account of his experiences was published in June as an article, \"War in Paterson.\" During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader [[Bill Haywood]], Reed put on \"The Pageant of the Paterson Strike\" in [[Madison Square Garden]] as a benefit for the strikers.<ref name=\"Homberger, John Reed, p. 49\"/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1913, Reed was sent to Mexico by the ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' to report the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 55.</ref> He shared the perils of [[Pancho Villa]]'s army for four months and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose \"Primer Jefe\" political chief was [[Venustiano Carranza]]) when it defeated Federal forces at [[Torre\u00f3n]], opening the way for its advance on Mexico City.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 69.</ref> Reed adored Villa, but Carranza left him cold.\n\nReed's reporting on the [[Villistas]] in a series of outstanding magazine articles gained him a national reputation as a [[war correspondent]]. Reed deeply sympathized with the [[peons]] and vehemently opposed [[United States occupation of Veracruz|American intervention]]. Reed's reports were collected and published as the book ''Insurgent Mexico'' (1914).\n\nOn April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in [[Colorado]], scene of the recent [[Ludlow massacre]], a result of owners' suppression of labor organizing. There he spent a little more than a week, during which he investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July). He came to believe much more deeply in class conflict.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nReed spent summer 1914 in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] with [[Mabel Dodge]] and her son, putting together ''Insurgent Mexico'' and interviewing [[United States President|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at [[White House]] insistence, was not a success.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 79.</ref>\n\n===War correspondent===\nOn August 14, 1914, shortly after [[German Empire|Germany]] declared war on France, Reed set sail for neutral Italy, on assignment for the ''Metropolitan''. He met his lover Mabel Dodge in [[Naples]], and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed believed the war was the result of imperialist commercial rivalries and felt little sympathy for any of the parties.\n\nIn an unsigned piece titled \"The Traders' War,\" published in the September 1914 issue of ''The Masses,'' Reed wrote:\n\n{{quote|The real War, of which this sudden outburst of death and destruction is only an incident, began long ago. It has been raging for tens of years, but its battles have been so little advertised that they have been hardly noted.

The article was attributed to \"a well-known American author and war correspondent who is compelled by arrangements with another publication to withhold his name.\"</ref>}}\n\nIn France, Reed was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of reaching the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed's relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 87.</ref> The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed [[Karl Liebknecht]], one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the [[Second International]], and by its replacement with [[militarism]] and [[nationalism]].<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 89.</ref>\n[[File:Reed-john-1917.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Reed {{Circa|1917}}]]\n\nHe returned to New York in December and wrote more about the war. In 1915 he traveled to Central Europe, accompanied by [[Boardman Robinson]], a Canadian artist and frequent ''Masses'' contributor. Traveling from [[Thessaloniki]], they saw scenes of profound devastation in [[Serbia]] (including a bombed-out [[Belgrade]]), also going through [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. They passed through the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] in [[Bessarabia]]. In [[Che\u0142m]] they were arrested and incarcerated for several weeks. At risk of being shot for espionage, they were saved by the American ambassador.\n\nTraveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the American ambassador in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) finally secured permission for them to leave, but not until after all their papers were seized in [[Kiev]]. In [[Bucharest]], the duo spent time piecing together more of their journey. At one point Reed traveled to [[Constantinople]] in hopes of seeing action at [[Gallipoli]]. From these experiences he wrote the book, ''[[The War in Eastern Europe]],'' published in April 1916.\n\nAfter returning to New York, Reed visited his mother in Portland. There he met and fell in love with [[Louise Bryant]], who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both also had affairs with others, in accordance with their bohemian circle and ideas about sexual liberation. Early in 1916 Reed met the young playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Beginning that May, the three rented a cottage in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], a summer destination on [[Cape Cod]] for many artists and writers from Greenwich Village. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 114.</ref>\n\nThat summer Reed covered the Presidential nominating conventions. He endorsed [[Woodrow Wilson]], believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 112\u201316.</ref> In November 1916 he married Bryant in [[Peekskill, New York]]. The same year, he underwent an operation at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] to remove a kidney. <!-- why? --> He was hospitalized until mid-December.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 118.</ref> The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a [[conscientious objector]], as had been his intention. During 1916 he privately published ''Tamburlaine and Other Verses'', in an edition of 500 copies.\n\nAs the country raced towards war, Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the ''Metropolitan'' was over. He pawned his late father's watch and sold his [[Cape Cod]] cottage to the [[birth control]] activist and sex educator [[Margaret Sanger]].<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 120.</ref>\n\nWhen Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the [[People's Council (US)|People's Council]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]: \"This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.\"<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' p. 122.</ref> In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles against the war for ''[[The Masses]]'', which the [[United States Post Office Department]] refused to mail, and for ''Seven Arts.'' Due to antiwar articles by Reed and [[Randolph Bourne]], the arts magazine lost its financial backing and ceased publication.<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 128\u201329.</ref> Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor, and his career lay in ruins.\n\n===Witness to the Russian Revolution===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u2116 5885. 1987. 100 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e \u0434\u043d\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0438\u0434\u0430.jpg|thumb|Worker of the American labor movement, internationalist writer, John Reed. Stamp of USSR, 1987.]]\n\nOn August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the [[US Department of State|State Department]] with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in [[Stockholm]].<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests and German and Bolshevik Propaganda: Report and Hearings of the Subcommittee on the Judiciary, United States Senate...,'' vol 3. p. 563. Hereafter: ''Overman Committee Report, v. 3.''</ref> The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of [[Finland]], the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed [[Kornilov affair|military coup]] of [[monarchist]] General [[Lavr Kornilov]]. This was an attempt to topple the [[Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles. Several of the subject nations of the old empire, such as Finland and [[Ukraine]], had gained autonomy and were seeking separate military accommodations with Germany.\n\nReed and Bryant were in Petrograd for the [[October Revolution]], in which the [[Bolsheviks]], headed by [[Vladimir Lenin]], toppled the Kerensky government; the Bolsheviks believed this was the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.\n\nFood shortages made the situation dire in the capital, and social disorder reigned. Reed later recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down\u2014milk and everything of that sort.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 575.</ref></blockquote>\n\nA mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government considered this a kind of coup, and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press. It issued warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and prepared to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets. At 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the [[Winter Palace]], the seat of Kerensky's government.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 569.</ref> Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 570.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u0420\u0438\u0434-\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|The cover of this 1919 British pamphlet emphasizes Reed's short-lived status as Soviet consul.]]\n\nReed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new [[revolutionary socialist]] government. He went to work for the new [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs]], translating decrees and news of the new government into English. \"I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,\" Reed later recalled.<ref>Testimony of John Reed, ''Overman Committee Report,'' v. 3, p. 565.</ref>\n\nReed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met [[Leon Trotsky]] and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted, and he took a job with American [[Raymond Robins]] of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross]]. Robins wanted to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied. But in the dummy issue he prepared, he included a warning beneath the masthead: \"This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.\"<ref>Homberger, ''John Reed,'' pp. 159\u201360</ref>\n\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved. Two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 161\">Homberger, p. 161</ref> Reed attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, saying he hoped it would \"call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses.\" American journalist [[Edgar Sisson]] told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 161\"/>\n\nIn January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York. As the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, Reed's credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he would have faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). Most Americans in Petrograd considered Reed's appointment a massive blunder. Businessman [[Alexander Gumberg]] met with Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for setting up a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk]]. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew Reed's nomination. Learning of Gumberg's intervention, Reed always denigrated him afterward.<ref>Homberger, pp. 161\u201363</ref>\n\nReed and Bryant wrote and published books about their Russian experiences. Bryant's ''Six Red Months in Russia'' appeared first, but Reed's ''10 Days That Shook the World'' (1919) garnered more notice.\n\nBryant returned to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28.<ref name=\"Stuart, p. 303\">Hicks with Stuart, ''John Reed,'' p. 303.</ref> On his way back, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to [[Finland]]. In [[Turku]] harbor, when Reed was boarding a [[ship]] on his way to [[Stockholm]], Finnish [[police]] arrested him; he was held at [[Kakola]] prison in [[Turku]] until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to [[Oslo|Kristiania]], [[Norway]] via [[Stockholm]].\n\nBecause he remained under indictment in the ''Masses'' case, federal authorities immediately met Reed when his ship reached New York, holding him on board for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's papers, the material from which he intended to write his book, were seized. He was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, [[Morris Hillquit]], promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day.<ref name=\"Stuart, p. 303\"/> His papers were not returned to him until November.\n\n===Radical political activist===\n[[File:Voice of labor 1 Oct 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Cover of Reed's ''Voice of Labor,'' October 1919]]\n\nBack in America, Reed and Bryant defended the Bolsheviks and opposed the American intervention. Incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany, the public gave Reed a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in ''The Masses'', particularly one headlined \"Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy\", had been instrumental in the government gaining an indictment for [[sedition]] against the magazine (antiwar agitation was considered sedition and treason).\n\nThe first ''Masses'' trial ended in a hung jury the day before Reed reached New York. The defendants, including him, were to be retried. He immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29.<ref>Homberger, p. 167</ref> The second ''Masses'' trial also ended in a hung jury.\n\nIn [[Philadelphia]], Reed stood outside a closed hall <!-- Whose hall\" -->on May 31, and harangued a crowd of 1,000 about the case and the war until police dragged him away. He was arrested for inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. Reed became more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive.<ref>Homberger, p. 172</ref> On September 14, he was arrested for the third time since returning from Russia, charged with violating the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]] and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia was held in the United States (in [[The Bronx]]). Reed had passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well.<ref>Homberger, p. 174</ref> He tried to prevent [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention]] in Russia, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the [[Ukraine]] and Japanese designs on [[Siberia]], but this argument came to naught.<ref>Homberger, p. 171</ref>\n\nOn February 21\u201322, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the US, but emerged resilient. Reed followed her. According to Homberger, his testimony was \"savagely distorted\" by the press.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 180\">Homberger, p. 180</ref> Later that day Reed went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 180\"/> Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of ''[[The New York Communist]],'' the weekly newspaper issued by the [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party|Left Wing Section]] of Greater New York.\n\nAffiliated with the Left Wing of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] (Reed's group, which he helped create) and, the next day, the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of America]]. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, ''The Voice of Labor'', and was denounced as \"Jack the Liar\" in the Communist Party organ, ''The Communist''. Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. He believed this was a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy \"based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.\"<ref>Homberger, pp. 191\u201393</ref>\n\n===Comintern functionary===\nIndicted for [[sedition]] and hoping to secure [[Comintern]] backing for the CLP, Reed fled America with a forged passport in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate; he worked his way to [[Bergen]] as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to [[Oslo|Kristiania]], crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to [[Moscow]] by train. In the cold winter of 1919\u201320, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages. He filled notebooks with his writing and had an affair with a Russian woman.<ref>Homberger, p. 210</ref>\n\nReed's feelings about the revolution became ambivalent. Activist [[Emma Goldman]] had recently arrived aboard the [[USAT Buford|''Buford'']], among hundreds of aliens deported by the United States under the Sedition Act. She was especially concerned about the [[Cheka]]. Reed told her that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate, but suggested that she see [[Angelica Balabanoff]], a critic of the current situation. He wanted Goldman to hear the other side.<ref>Homberger, pp. 202\u201303</ref>\n\n[[File:Reed-tendays-1922.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|German edition of ''10 Days That Shook The World'', published by the [[Communist International|Comintern]] in Hamburg in 1922]]\n\nThough facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, Reed tried to return to the United States in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America.<ref>Homberger, pp. 203\u201304</ref> Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to [[Petrograd]].<ref>Homberger, p. 204</ref> In March, he crossed into [[Helsinki]], where he had radical friends, including [[Hella Wuolijoki]], the future politician and [[Finnish People's Democratic League|SDKL]] [[Parliament of Finland|member of parliament]]. With their help, he was hidden in the hold of a freighter.\n\nOn 13 March, customs officials in Finland found Reed in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was seaman \"Jim Gormley\". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. Because of his silence, he could not be tried for [[treason]]. He was charged and convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).\n\nThe [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finns for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate.<ref>Homberger, pp. 205\u201306</ref> Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained. His physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[insomnia]], wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a [[hunger strike]].<ref>Homberger, p. 206</ref> He was finally released in early June, and sailed for [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to [[Petrograd]], recuperating from malnutrition and [[scurvy]] caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively. His spirits were high.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 207\">Homberger, p. 207</ref>\n\nAt the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow. After he discussed with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]] and arrived in [[Gothenburg]] on August 10.<ref name=\"Homberger, p. 207\"/> At the same time, Reed attended the second [[Comintern]] congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.<ref>Homberger, pp. 207\u201308</ref>\n\nDuring this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians. The latter believed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, and that the Communist party needed to work within the existing institutions\u2014a policy Reed felt would be disastrous.<ref>Homberger, p. 208</ref> He was contemptuous of the [[bullying]] tactics displayed during the congress by [[Karl Radek]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], who ordered Reed to attend the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] to be held at [[Baku]] on August 15.\n\nThe journey to Baku was a long one; five days by train through a countryside that was devastated by civil war and [[typhus]]. Reed was reluctant to go. He asked for permission to travel later, as he wanted to meet Bryant in Petrograd after she arrived from [[Murmansk]]. Zinoviev insisted that Reed take the official train: \"the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.\"<ref name=\"homberger212-213\"/> Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance.<ref name=\"homberger212-213\">Homberger, pp. 212\u201313</ref> Years after having abandoned Communism himself, his friend [[Benjamin Gitlow]] asserted that Reed became bitterly disillusioned with the Communist movement because of his treatment by Zinoviev.<ref>Homberger, p. 214</ref>\n\nDuring his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took Bryant to meet Lenin, Trotsky, [[Lev Kamenev]], and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:JOhnReedFuneral1920Moscow-l.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Reed's body [[lying in state]] in Moscow]]\n\nReed was determined to return to the United States but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have [[influenza]], he was hospitalized five days later and diagnosed with [[scrub typhus|spotted typhus]]. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied [[blockade]]. Reed's mind started to wander; eventually he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920.<ref>Homberger, p. 215</ref> After a hero's funeral, Reed's body was buried at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]. He remains one of only three Americans who were honored by being buried there.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe interpretation of Reed in popular culture has been varied. Some{{who|date=November 2014}} have dismissed him as a \"romantic revolutionary\" and a \"playboy\", a vapid dilettante pretending to profess revolutionary sensibilities. For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amidst solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon.<ref>By the 1930s, the height of the communist movement in the United States, literary [[John Reed Club]]s, affiliated with the Communist Party, existed in his honor in many large cities of the United States.</ref> Others, such as his old friend and comrade [[Benjamin Gitlow]], claimed that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism towards the end of his life. They sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] cause.\n\n===Representation in other media===\n* Soviet director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s influential 1927 [[silent film]] ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' was based on Reed's book.\n* [[John Dos Passos]] included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work ''1919,'' the second part of his [[U.S.A. trilogy]].\n* The 1958 Soviet film ''In October Days'' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:\u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f|\u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f]]}}), directed by [[Sergei Vasilyev]], featured Reed and Bryant.\n* Actor and director [[Warren Beatty]] made the film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981), based on Reed's life.

Only three teams from [[2010\u201311 Croatian Second Football League|Druga HNL]] acquired the top level license: [[NK Dugopolje|Dugopolje]], [[HNK Gorica|Gorica]] and [[NK Lu\u010dko|Lu\u010dko]], where the latter two are set to play outside of their home venues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hns-cff.hr/upl/news/Obavijest_za_medije_konacne_odluke_za_201_12.pdf|title=Okon\u010dan Sredi\u0161nji postupak licenciranja klubova za natjecateljsku 2011/12. godinu|date=4 May 2011|work=HNS-CFF.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=4 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320084531/http://www.hns-cff.hr/upl/news/Obavijest_za_medije_konacne_odluke_za_201_12.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Dugopolje didn't managed to finish the season within top five places which would secure them promotion. The remaining clubs were given a deadline until 6 June 2011 to confirm their participation in the 2011\u201312 season. All clubs of the previous Prva HNL season have done so, with Druga HNL teams Lu\u010dko and Gorica applying on the last day. This meant that the format with 16 teams was prolonged by one more season, meaning five clubs are going to be relegated at the end of this season. The status of 14th placed [[NK Lokomotiva|Lokomotiva]] was in question after the 3rd placed team from Druga HNL, [[NK Pomorac|Pomorac]], contested the decision of CFF and tried to obtain the license through arbitration.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://prva-hnl.hr/blog/2011/06/gorica-i-lucko-novi-prvoligasi-liga-16-ostaje-jos-jednu-godinu/|title=Gorica i Lu\u010dko novi prvoliga\u0161i, Liga 16 ostaje jo\u0161 jednu godinu|date=7 June 2011|work=Prva-HNL.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=7 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611073253/http://prva-hnl.hr/blog/2011/06/gorica-i-lucko-novi-prvoligasi-liga-16-ostaje-jos-jednu-godinu/|archive-date=11 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 9 June 2011, arbitrary committee rejected the appeal with two votes against one.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/419029/nogomet-1-hnl/odbijena-zalba-pomorca |title=Odbijena \u017ealba Pomorca |last=Strahija |first=Ivana |date=9 June 2011 |work=Sportnet.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref> [[NK Istra 1961|Istra 1961]] appealed on the decision to include [[HNK Gorica|Gorica]] in the Prva HNL on terms of their license conditions concerning stadium infrastructure.

Instead, the league will stay at 16 teams with only the last three teams being relegated and the first three teams from 2010\u201311 Druga HNL earning promotion (if they are granted with top level license). In case of 16 teams not acquiring top level license, format with 12 teams will be applied.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://prva-hnl.hr/blog/2010/12/liga-16-ostaje-i-slijedece-godine/|title=Liga 16 ostaje i slijede\u0107e godine|date=29 December 2010|work=Prva-HNL.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=2 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104005733/http://prva-hnl.hr/blog/2010/12/liga-16-ostaje-i-slijedece-godine/|archive-date=4 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 2011, CFF announced that the first stage of licensing procedure for 2011\u201312 season was completed.

Only three teams from [[2010\u201311 Croatian Second Football League|Druga HNL]] acquired the top level license: [[NK Dugopolje|Dugopolje]], [[HNK Gorica|Gorica]] and [[NK Lu\u010dko|Lu\u010dko]], where the latter two are set to play outside of their home venues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hns-cff.hr/upl/news/Obavijest_za_medije_konacne_odluke_za_201_12.pdf|title=Okon\u010dan Sredi\u0161nji postupak licenciranja klubova za natjecateljsku 2011/12. godinu|date=4 May 2011|work=HNS-CFF.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=4 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320084531/http://www.hns-cff.hr/upl/news/Obavijest_za_medije_konacne_odluke_za_201_12.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Dugopolje didn't managed to finish the season within top five places which would secure them promotion.

All clubs of the previous Prva HNL season have done so, with Druga HNL teams Lu\u010dko and Gorica applying on the last day. This meant that the format with 16 teams was prolonged by one more season, meaning five clubs are going to be relegated at the end of this season.

Fox sought the most expeditious and low cost option and thus chose the already existing airports of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Centro|El Centro]], [[Marine Corps Air Station Mojave|Mojave]] and [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]]. For the fourth station, he chose land that had previously been looked at by the [[United States navy|Navy]] for a blimp base.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\">Shettle 2001:73</ref> The Marine Corps gave the owner of the land, a farmer named James Irvine Sr., $100,000 for {{convert|4000|acre|km2|sigfig=1}} including {{convert|1600|acre|km2|sigfig=2}} designated for a blimp base.<ref name=\"O'Hara7\">O'Hara, ''MCAS El Toro'', p.7.</ref> Construction of MCAS El Toro began on August 3, 1942 on land previously owned by the [[Irvine Company]].<ref>Rottman 2002:414</ref> The company greatly resisted the station's construction at this site, which at the time contained the largest [[lima bean]] field in North America, which was the company's prime source of revenue.<ref name=\"Shettle\"/> The name El Toro came from the nearby small community which in 1940 only had a population of 130 people.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\"/>\n\nThe base headquarters was established on November 4, 1942 and the first landing occurred in late November when a Major Michael Carmichael, flying from [[Camp Kearny]], was forced to make an emergency landing among the construction equipment.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\"/> The runways and taxiways were completed by 1 December 1942 and all squadron hangars were complete by 15 January 1943. Barracks and officer's quarters were ready by 20 January. January 1943 also saw the first operational units arriving at MCAS El Toro. First aboard were [[Marine Base Defense Aircraft Group 41]] and [[VMF-113]]. They were followed later in the month by [[VMSB-142]], [[VMF-224]], [[VMSB-231]] and [[VMSB-232]], who were returning from fighting during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in order to re-organize, re-equip and train.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\"/> The station was formally commissioned on 17 March 1943, with Colonel Theodore B. Millard as the first commanding officer.  Soon after its opening, MCAS El Toro was handling the largest tactical [[aerodrome]] traffic on the Pacific Coast.<ref>De Chant 1947:60</ref>\n\nAlready the largest Marine air station on the West Coast, in 1944, funds were approved to double its size and operations. By the end of 1944, the base was home to 1,248 officers and 6,831 enlisted personnel.<ref>Sherrod 1952:441</ref>\n\nIn 1950, El Toro was selected as a permanent [[Master Jet Base|Master Jet Station]] for the [[Fleet Marine Force]]s, Pacific.\nTo support this new role, the aviation infrastructure at El Toro was expanded significantly. For most of the ensuing years, El Toro served as the primary base for Marine Corps west coast fighter squadrons. During the 1960s, many US Marines left for and returned from Vietnam at El Toro MCAS.<ref name=\"Freeman\">{{cite web\n  | last = Freeman\n  | first = Paul\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: California - Southeastern Orange County\n  | work = El Toro MCAS (NZJ), El Toro, CA\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_OrangeCo_SE.htm#eltoro\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =  }}</ref>  In 1958, [[Marine Corps Air Station Miami]] was closed which brought the [[3rd Marine Aircraft Wing]] to El Toro.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:75\">Shettle 2001:75</ref>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Richard M. Nixon]], MCAS El Toro was used for flights to and from his \"[[La Casa Pacifica|Western White House]]\" at [[San Clemente, California]].\n\nThe land originally surrounding the base was mostly used for agricultural purposes when it first opened, but it the late 1980s and early 1990s, residential development began in the area; most of it was directly in the path of the base's runways, which proved to be a major problem as the constant loud noise produced by jets and helicopters passing overhead was very irritating to those living in the area. Few desired to move there because of this, causing the new neighborhoods to struggle.\n\nIn 1993, MCAS El Toro was designated for closing by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission and all of its activities were to be transferred to [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar]]. The station officially closed on July 2, 1999.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:75\"/>\n\n==Base conversion controversy==\nThe closing of MCAS El Toro ignited a political firestorm over the eventual fate of the facility. With the existing infrastructure, some favored converting the base into an  [[international airport]]. Those favoring the new airport tended to come from northern [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] (desiring the convenience of a closer airport), and from areas in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] that are within the arrival and departure noise zones surrounding  [[John Wayne Airport]] (hoping to close that airport in favor of the new one at El Toro).\n\nThose against the airport proposal were largely residents of the cities in the immediate vicinity of El Toro, such as [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[Lake Forest, California|Lake Forest]], [[Laguna Niguel]], [[Laguna Woods]], [[Dana Point]], and [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]], where residents were alarmed at the idea of the aircraft noise. The cities opposed to the airport created a joint powers authority, the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority (ETRPA), to oppose the project. They were joined in the effort by grass-roots organizations that collected record numbers of signatures on petitions to place anti-airport initiatives on the ballot and raised funds for the election campaigns. The volunteer-run El Toro Info Site [http://www.eltoroairport.org] was the Internet voice of the movement and one of the first political blogs.\n\nThis faction lobbied strongly in favor of other uses for the property. The city of Irvine sought to annex the property for park and related uses.\n\n[[File:MCAS ElToro.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Air station insignia An earlier cartoon version was designed by Walt Disney Studios.]]\n\nThe battle between pro-airport and anti-airport groups dominated [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] politics for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nAirport proposals were defeated in two hotly contested [[ballot initiatives]], and further challenges took place in the courts. A series of demonstration commercial flights from the airport in June 1999 generated less noise than the former military flights, but resulted in much public outcry due to the use of different flight paths from the military, and incessant circling over nearby cities to line up for another approach. Eventually the airport opponents prevailed, and in March 2002, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] announced that it would sell the land to private interests to be developed into [[Orange County Great Park]]. This decision came right after the military stated that it wanted to return to the base.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122963740.html HighBeam]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental remediation==\n\nBefore the site could be developed for civilian use, the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (which oversees both the Navy and the Marine Corps) was required to perform [[environmental remediation]] to clean up [[Soil contamination|contaminated soil]] on the site. The contamination was caused by [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), primarily industrial solvents that had been used over the years for purposes such as degreasing, paint stripping, and the cleaning of aircraft.\n\nOver the years, the VOCs had seeped into the [[groundwater]], resulting in a plume of contaminated groundwater extending for three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the west of the station. In July 2005, the Department of the Navy's [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) Program Management Office (PMO) issued a public notice stating that the cleanup of the contaminated soil was complete.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.bracpmo.navy.mil/bracbases/california/eltoro/viewdocs.aspx?doc_cat=public_notices\n |title       = July 2005, Public Notice - Cleanup of Contaminated Soil Successful at IRP Site 24 VOC Source Area, No Further Action Proposed\n |publisher   = Department of Navy Base Realignment and Closure Program Management Office\n |accessdate  = 2006-07-13\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206210257/http://www.bracpmo.navy.mil/bracbases/california/eltoro/viewdocs.aspx?doc_cat=public_notices\n |archivedate = 2007-02-06\n}}</ref>\nThe cleanup of the groundwater is being handled by the Irvine Desalter Project,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.irwd.com/WaterQuality/IDP/index.php \n |title=Water Quality \n |publisher=Irvine Desalter Project \n |accessdate=2006-07-13 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626100906/http://irwd.com/WaterQuality/IDP/index.php \n |archivedate=2006-06-26 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> a project of two local water authorities that has financial backing from the Navy and the [[State of California]].\n\n==Sale of El Toro==\nThe Department of the Navy hired the General Services Administration and Los Angeles-based Colliers International to assist in the sale of MCAS El Toro.

An online auction was conducted and in February 2005, the final bid of $650 million was accepted for the four parcels of land comprising the former MCAS El Toro. The auction winner was Heritage Fields LLC,<ref>[http://www.heritagefields.com/ Heritage Fields website]</ref> a joint venture between developer [[Lennar Corporation]] and several other firms.

Fox sought the most expeditious and low cost option and thus chose the already existing airports of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Centro|El Centro]], [[Marine Corps Air Station Mojave|Mojave]] and [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]]. For the fourth station, he chose land that had previously been looked at by the [[United States navy|Navy]] for a blimp base.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\">Shettle 2001:73</ref> The Marine Corps gave the owner of the land, a farmer named James Irvine Sr., $100,000 for {{convert|4000|acre|km2|sigfig=1}} including {{convert|1600|acre|km2|sigfig=2}} designated for a blimp base.<ref name=\"O'Hara7\">O'Hara, ''MCAS El Toro'', p.7.</ref> Construction of MCAS El Toro began on August 3, 1942 on land previously owned by the [[Irvine Company]].<ref>Rottman 2002:414</ref> The company greatly resisted the station's construction at this site, which at the time contained the largest [[lima bean]] field in North America, which was the company's prime source of revenue.<ref name=\"Shettle\"/> The name El Toro came from the nearby small community which in 1940 only had a population of 130 people.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\"/>\n\nThe base headquarters was established on November 4, 1942 and the first landing occurred in late November when a Major Michael Carmichael, flying from [[Camp Kearny]], was forced to make an emergency landing among the construction equipment.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\"/> The runways and taxiways were completed by 1 December 1942 and all squadron hangars were complete by 15 January 1943. Barracks and officer's quarters were ready by 20 January. January 1943 also saw the first operational units arriving at MCAS El Toro. First aboard were [[Marine Base Defense Aircraft Group 41]] and [[VMF-113]]. They were followed later in the month by [[VMSB-142]], [[VMF-224]], [[VMSB-231]] and [[VMSB-232]], who were returning from fighting during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in order to re-organize, re-equip and train.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:73\"/> The station was formally commissioned on 17 March 1943, with Colonel Theodore B. Millard as the first commanding officer.  Soon after its opening, MCAS El Toro was handling the largest tactical [[aerodrome]] traffic on the Pacific Coast.<ref>De Chant 1947:60</ref>\n\nAlready the largest Marine air station on the West Coast, in 1944, funds were approved to double its size and operations. By the end of 1944, the base was home to 1,248 officers and 6,831 enlisted personnel.<ref>Sherrod 1952:441</ref>\n\nIn 1950, El Toro was selected as a permanent [[Master Jet Base|Master Jet Station]] for the [[Fleet Marine Force]]s, Pacific.\nTo support this new role, the aviation infrastructure at El Toro was expanded significantly. For most of the ensuing years, El Toro served as the primary base for Marine Corps west coast fighter squadrons. During the 1960s, many US Marines left for and returned from Vietnam at El Toro MCAS.<ref name=\"Freeman\">{{cite web\n  | last = Freeman\n  | first = Paul\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: California - Southeastern Orange County\n  | work = El Toro MCAS (NZJ), El Toro, CA\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_OrangeCo_SE.htm#eltoro\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =  }}</ref>  In 1958, [[Marine Corps Air Station Miami]] was closed which brought the [[3rd Marine Aircraft Wing]] to El Toro.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:75\">Shettle 2001:75</ref>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Richard M. Nixon]], MCAS El Toro was used for flights to and from his \"[[La Casa Pacifica|Western White House]]\" at [[San Clemente, California]].\n\nThe land originally surrounding the base was mostly used for agricultural purposes when it first opened, but it the late 1980s and early 1990s, residential development began in the area; most of it was directly in the path of the base's runways, which proved to be a major problem as the constant loud noise produced by jets and helicopters passing overhead was very irritating to those living in the area. Few desired to move there because of this, causing the new neighborhoods to struggle.\n\nIn 1993, MCAS El Toro was designated for closing by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission and all of its activities were to be transferred to [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar]]. The station officially closed on July 2, 1999.<ref name=\"Shettle 2001:75\"/>\n\n==Base conversion controversy==\nThe closing of MCAS El Toro ignited a political firestorm over the eventual fate of the facility. With the existing infrastructure, some favored converting the base into an  [[international airport]]. Those favoring the new airport tended to come from northern [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] (desiring the convenience of a closer airport), and from areas in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] that are within the arrival and departure noise zones surrounding  [[John Wayne Airport]] (hoping to close that airport in favor of the new one at El Toro).\n\nThose against the airport proposal were largely residents of the cities in the immediate vicinity of El Toro, such as [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[Lake Forest, California|Lake Forest]], [[Laguna Niguel]], [[Laguna Woods]], [[Dana Point]], and [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]], where residents were alarmed at the idea of the aircraft noise. The cities opposed to the airport created a joint powers authority, the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority (ETRPA), to oppose the project. They were joined in the effort by grass-roots organizations that collected record numbers of signatures on petitions to place anti-airport initiatives on the ballot and raised funds for the election campaigns. The volunteer-run El Toro Info Site [http://www.eltoroairport.org] was the Internet voice of the movement and one of the first political blogs.\n\nThis faction lobbied strongly in favor of other uses for the property. The city of Irvine sought to annex the property for park and related uses.\n\n[[File:MCAS ElToro.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Air station insignia An earlier cartoon version was designed by Walt Disney Studios.]]\n\nThe battle between pro-airport and anti-airport groups dominated [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] politics for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nAirport proposals were defeated in two hotly contested [[ballot initiatives]], and further challenges took place in the courts. A series of demonstration commercial flights from the airport in June 1999 generated less noise than the former military flights, but resulted in much public outcry due to the use of different flight paths from the military, and incessant circling over nearby cities to line up for another approach. Eventually the airport opponents prevailed, and in March 2002, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] announced that it would sell the land to private interests to be developed into [[Orange County Great Park]]. This decision came right after the military stated that it wanted to return to the base.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122963740.html HighBeam]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental remediation==\n\nBefore the site could be developed for civilian use, the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (which oversees both the Navy and the Marine Corps) was required to perform [[environmental remediation]] to clean up [[Soil contamination|contaminated soil]] on the site. The contamination was caused by [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), primarily industrial solvents that had been used over the years for purposes such as degreasing, paint stripping, and the cleaning of aircraft.\n\nOver the years, the VOCs had seeped into the [[groundwater]], resulting in a plume of contaminated groundwater extending for three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the west of the station.
