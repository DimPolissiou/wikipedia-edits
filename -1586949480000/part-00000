The spotlight featured throughout the video is, in fact, a CCT Silhouette follow spot, as opposed to a real Super Trouper. The city of [[Glasgow]] mentioned in the lyric was suggested by Howard Huntridge who worked with their then-UK publishers Bocu Music. The music video was directed by [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]]. Parts of the video were later reused in the clip for the song \"[[Happy New Year (ABBA single)|Happy New Year]]\" (which also features on the ''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'' album).\n\n==Reception==\n\"Super Trouper\" continued ABBA's run of chart success, particularly in Europe. It was to become ABBA's ninth (and final) No. 1 in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book | first= Jo | last= Rice | year= 1982 | title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits | edition= 1st | publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd  | location= Enfield, Middlesex | page= 209 | isbn= 0-85112-250-7}}</ref><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> This distinction placed ABBA fourth for the most UK chart-toppers in history (behind [[The Beatles]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Cliff Richard]]); a position the group would keep for almost 20 years until [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] scored her tenth UK No. 1 with \"[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]\" in August 2000.<ref>https://www.onlineweb.com/theones/auxiliary_pages/madonna.htm</ref> The track was also the fourth biggest selling single in the UK for 1980. \"Super Trouper\" also topped the charts in Belgium, [[West Germany]], Ireland and the Netherlands, and was a Top 10 hit in Austria, Finland, France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nOutside of Europe, \"Super Trouper\" was a more modest hit. In the United States for example, where ABBA never quite managed to achieve the same sort of popularity experienced elsewhere, the single only reached No. 45. However, combined with \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\" and \"[[On and On and On]]\", it topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in May 1981.

The city of [[Glasgow]] mentioned in the lyric was suggested by Howard Huntridge who worked with their then-UK publishers Bocu Music. The music video was directed by [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]]. Parts of the video were later reused in the clip for the song \"[[Happy New Year (ABBA single)|Happy New Year]]\" (which also features on the ''[[Super Trouper (album)|Super Trouper]]'' album).\n\n==Reception==\n\"Super Trouper\" continued ABBA's run of chart success, particularly in Europe. It was to become ABBA's ninth (and final) No. 1 in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book | first= Jo | last= Rice | year= 1982 | title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits | edition= 1st | publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd  | location= Enfield, Middlesex | page= 209 | isbn= 0-85112-250-7}}</ref><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> This distinction placed ABBA fourth for the most UK chart-toppers in history (behind [[The Beatles]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Cliff Richard]]); a position the group would keep for almost 20 years until [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] scored her tenth UK No. 1 with \"[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]\" in August 2000.<ref>https://www.onlineweb.com/theones/auxiliary_pages/madonna.htm</ref> The track was also the fourth biggest selling single in the UK for 1980. \"Super Trouper\" also topped the charts in Belgium, [[West Germany]], Ireland and the Netherlands, and was a Top 10 hit in Austria, Finland, France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nOutside of Europe, \"Super Trouper\" was a more modest hit. In the United States for example, where ABBA never quite managed to achieve the same sort of popularity experienced elsewhere, the single only reached No. 45. However, combined with \"[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]\" and \"[[On and On and On]]\", it topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in May 1981.

The team's colors are: home all blue, and away all white.\n\n==History==\nThe club has been known under the following names:\n* ''[[Spartak (disambiguation)|Spartak]]'', 1946\u201357\n* ''[[Trudovye Rezervy]]'', 1958\u201365 and 1967\u201372\n* ''Trud'', 1966\n* ''Avangard'', 1973\u2013\nSpartak made an appearance in the Soviet league in 1946. Since 1957 Kursk was continuously represented in the league by Trudovye Rezervy, Trud, and Avangard. The club played in Class B and in the Second League. The best achievement was the second position in the zone in 1962 and 1964.\n\nAvangard entered the [[Russian Second Division|Russian Second League]] in 1992 and was moved to the Third League in 1994, after the number of clubs in the Second League was significantly reduced. In 1995, they won promotion to the Second League, and in 2004 Avangard finished second in their Second Division zone, obtaining promotion to the [[Russian Second Division|First Division]]. Avangard played 3 seasons in First Division and relegated to Second Division in 2007 as 18th. Avangard returned to second level in 2009 as Center Group champion. But, Avangard finished in the last place and was relegated to third level in 2010. The club won its PFL zone and was promoted back to the second-tier [[Russian Football National League]] at the end of the 2016\u201317 season.\n\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, the team has reached the final of the [[2017\u201318 Russian Cup|Russian Cup]], defeating two Premier League clubs ([[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]] and [[FC Amkar Perm|Amkar]]) during the competition. They lost the final 1\u20132 to [[FC Tosno]] on a late goal by [[Reziuan Mirzov]].\n\nIn February 2019, Avangard competed in the [[FNL Cup]]. They got into finals, where they had to play against [[FC Rotor Volgograd]]. The match took place on February 20. After the full-time, the score  was 1:1, with [[Mikhail Zemskov]] scoring the opening goal for Avangard on 80' minute and a quick response by [[Anzor Sanaya]] on 86' minute of the match. The match has ultimately ended in a penalty shoot-out, where Avangard was able to grab a 3-4 victory.\n\n==League history==\n\n===Russia===\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic [[irony]] which provokes [[laughter]].<ref>Marteinson, 2006</ref>\n\n[[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. [[Parody]] subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.\n\nOther forms of comedy include [[screwball comedy]], which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and [[black comedy]], which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature.  Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], sexual humor, and [[ethnic joke|race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comic ways. A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File: Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theatre]]\nrepresented in the  [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 ''k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda'', which is a compound of [[komos|\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''k\u00f4mos'' (revel) and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae ''\u014did\u1e17'' (singing).<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/comedy ] \"The old derivation from ''kome'' \"village\" is not now regarded.\"</ref> The adjective \"comic\" (Greek \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''k\u014dmik\u00f3s),'' which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\".<ref name = \"Cornford1934pn\">Cornford (1934){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia'' and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.<ref name = OED>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] confined their use of the [[word]] \"comedy\" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. [[Aristotle]] defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where [[tragedy]] was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.<ref>[[Richard McKeon|McKeon, Richard]]. ''The Basic Works Of Aristotle'', the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings.  It is in this sense that [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, ''[[The Divine Comedy|La Commedia]]''.\n\nAs time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter.<ref name = OED/> During the Middle Ages, the term \"comedy\" became synonymous with [[satire]], and later with [[humour]] in general.\n\nAristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, and his pupils [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. They disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''[[hija]]'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy.\n\nAfter the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" gained a more general meaning in [[medieval literature]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/470561|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|jstor=470561|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term ''[[laughter]]'' to refer to the whole [[gamut]] of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the [[grotesque]], [[irony]], and [[satire]].<ref>Herman Braet, Guido Latr\u00e9, Werner Verbeke (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mqDEpy0YUsC&pg=PA1 ''Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art''] p.1 quotation: {{quotation|The deliberate use by Menard of the term 'le rire' rather than 'l'humour' reflects accurately the current evidency to incorporate all instances of the comic in the analysis, while the classification in genres and fields such as grotesque, humour and even irony or satire always poses problems.

For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor.  A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres:  [[farce]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[satire]].  On the contrary, [[Plato]] taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nAlso in ''Poetics'', Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of [[literature]]. The other three genres are [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry]], and [[lyric poetry]]. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a [[mimesis]], or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.\n\n====Early Renaissance forms of comedy====\n{{main|Divine Comedy|Dante}}\nThe ''Divine Comedy'' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|di\u02c8vi\u02d0na kom\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0dja|}}) is a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321.

[[Charlie Chaplin]], through silent film, became one of the best-known faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like [[Marcel Marceau]], and the physical comedy of artists like [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as [[Bozo the Clown]] in the United States and [[Oleg Popov]] in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities \u2014 with Britain producing the influential [[surreal humour]] of the [[Goon Show]] after the Second World War. The Goons' influence spread to the American radio and [[audio recording|recording]] troupe [[the Firesign Theatre]]. [[American cinema]] has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Three Stooges]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]], as well as [[Bob Hope]] during the mid-20th century, to performers like [[George Carlin]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Eddie Murphy]] at the end of the century. [[Hollywood]] attracted many international talents like the British comics [[Peter Sellers]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], Canadian comics [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Mike Myers]], and the [[Australian comedy|Australian comedian]]  [[Paul Hogan]], famous for ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the [[cinema of Hong Kong]], [[Bollywood]], and French [[farce]].\n\nAmerican television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', [[Monty Python]], ''[[Dad's Army]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.

Each ''rasa'' was associated with a specific ''bhavas'' portrayed on stage. In the case of humour, it was associated with mirth (''hasya'').\n\n== Studies on comic theory ==\nThe phenomena connected with [[laughter]] and that which provokes it have been carefully investigated by psychologists. They agree the predominant characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a \"sudden glory\". Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \"play instinct\" and its emotional expression.\n\n[[George Meredith]] said that \"One excellent test of the civilization of a country ...

The different forms of comedy often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the subgenres of comedy are [[farce]], [[comedy of manners]], [[burlesque]], and [[satire]].\n\nSome comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and [[satire]] often imitate the conventions of the genre they are parodying or satirizing. For example, in the United States, parodies of newspapers and television news include ''[[The Onion]]'', and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''; in Australia, shows such as ''[[Kath & Kim]],'' [[Utopia (Australian TV series)|''Utopia'']], and ''[[Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell|Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell]]'' perform the same role.\n\n[[Self-deprecation]] is a technique of comedy used by many

The origins of the term are found in [[Ancient Greece]]. In the [[Athenian democracy]], the [[public opinion]] of voters was influenced by the [[political satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theaters]].<ref>Henderson, J.

Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}</ref> The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. [[Northrop Frye]] depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old.\"<ref>([[Anatomy of Criticism]], 1957)</ref> A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic [[irony]] which provokes [[laughter]].<ref>Marteinson, 2006</ref>\n\n[[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. [[Parody]] subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.\n\nOther forms of comedy include [[screwball comedy]], which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and [[black comedy]], which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature.  Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], sexual humor, and [[ethnic joke|race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comic ways. A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File: Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theatre]]\nrepresented in the  [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 ''k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda'', which is a compound of [[komos|\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''k\u00f4mos'' (revel) and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae ''\u014did\u1e17'' (singing).<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/comedy ] \"The old derivation from ''kome'' \"village\" is not now regarded.\"</ref> The adjective \"comic\" (Greek \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''k\u014dmik\u00f3s),'' which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\".<ref name = \"Cornford1934pn\">Cornford (1934){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia'' and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.<ref name = OED>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] confined their use of the [[word]] \"comedy\" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. [[Aristotle]] defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where [[tragedy]] was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.<ref>[[Richard McKeon|McKeon, Richard]]. ''The Basic Works Of Aristotle'', the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings.  It is in this sense that [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, ''[[The Divine Comedy|La Commedia]]''.\n\nAs time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter.<ref name = OED/> During the Middle Ages, the term \"comedy\" became synonymous with [[satire]], and later with [[humour]] in general.\n\nAristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, and his pupils [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. They disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''[[hija]]'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy.\n\nAfter the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" gained a more general meaning in [[medieval literature]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/470561|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|jstor=470561|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term ''[[laughter]]'' to refer to the whole [[gamut]] of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the [[grotesque]], [[irony]], and [[satire]].<ref>Herman Braet, Guido Latr\u00e9, Werner Verbeke (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mqDEpy0YUsC&pg=PA1 ''Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art''] p.1 quotation: {{quotation|The deliberate use by Menard of the term 'le rire' rather than 'l'humour' reflects accurately the current evidency to incorporate all instances of the comic in the analysis, while the classification in genres and fields such as grotesque, humour and even irony or satire always poses problems.

For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor.  A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres:  [[farce]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[satire]].  On the contrary, [[Plato]] taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nAlso in ''Poetics'', Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of [[literature]]. The other three genres are [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry]], and [[lyric poetry]]. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a [[mimesis]], or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.\n\n====Early Renaissance forms of comedy====\n{{main|Divine Comedy|Dante}}\nThe ''Divine Comedy'' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|di\u02c8vi\u02d0na kom\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0dja|}}) is a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321.

Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, incongruity, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], irrational or absurd situations and expressions of [[nonsense]].<ref name=stockwell>{{cite book|last1=Stockwell|first1=Peter|title=The Language of Surrealism|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KZhNDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA177&dq=Surreal%20humour&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q=Surreal%20humour&f=false|isbn=978-1-137-39219-0|date=2016-11-01}}</ref> The humour arises from a subversion of audience's expectations, so that amusement is founded on [[predictability|unpredictability]], separate from a logical analysis of the situation. The humour derived gets its appeal from the ridiculousness and unlikeliness of the situation. The genre has roots in [[Surrealism]] in the arts.<ref name=stockwell/>\n\n[[File:Edward Lear and His Cat Foss 1885.jpg|thumb|''Edward Lear, Aged 73 and a Half and His Cat Foss, Aged 16'', an 1885 lithograph by [[Edward Lear]]]]\nSurreal humour is the effect of [[logic|illogic]] and [[absurdity]] being used for humorous effect. Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', which both use illogic and absurdity ([[hookah]]-smoking [[caterpillars]], [[croquet]] matches using live [[flamingos]] as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of [[Edward Lear]]'s children stories and poems contain [[literary nonsense|nonsense]] and are basically surreal in approach. For example, ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World'' (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following:\n{{quote|After a time they saw some land at a distance; and when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great Gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lear|first=Edward|title=Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany, and Alphabets|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13650/13650-h/13650-h.htm#children|date=2004-10-08}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, several [[avant-garde]] movements, including the [[Dadaism|dadaists]], [[Surrealism|surrealists]], and [[Futurism (art)|futurists]], began to argue for an art that was random, jarring and illogical.<ref>{{cite book|title=The History of Futurism: The Precursors, Protagonists, and Legacies|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2012|editor1-last=Buelens|editor1-first=Geert|editor2-last=Hendrix|editor2-first=Harald|editor3-last=Jansen|editor3-first=Monica|isbn=978-0-7391-7387-9}}</ref> The goals of these movements were in some sense serious, and they were committed to undermining the solemnity and self-satisfaction of the contemporary artistic [[wikt:establishment|establishment]].

This became one of the most famous and influential pieces of art in history, and one of the earliest examples of the [[found object]] movement.

[[Charlie Chaplin]], through silent film, became one of the best-known faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like [[Marcel Marceau]], and the physical comedy of artists like [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as [[Bozo the Clown]] in the United States and [[Oleg Popov]] in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities \u2014 with Britain producing the influential [[surreal humour]] of the [[Goon Show]] after the Second World War. The Goons' influence spread to the American radio and [[audio recording|recording]] troupe [[the Firesign Theatre]]. [[American cinema]] has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Three Stooges]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]], as well as [[Bob Hope]] during the mid-20th century, to performers like [[George Carlin]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Eddie Murphy]] at the end of the century. [[Hollywood]] attracted many international talents like the British comics [[Peter Sellers]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], Canadian comics [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Mike Myers]], and the [[Australian comedy|Australian comedian]]  [[Paul Hogan]], famous for ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the [[cinema of Hong Kong]], [[Bollywood]], and French [[farce]].\n\nAmerican television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', [[Monty Python]], ''[[Dad's Army]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Australian satirist [[Barry Humphries]], whose comic creations include the housewife and \"gigastar\" Dame [[Edna Everage]], for his delivery of Dadaist and [[Absurdism|absurdist]] humour to millions, was described by biographer Anne Pender in 2010 as not only \"the most significant theatrical figure of our time ...

Each ''rasa'' was associated with a specific ''bhavas'' portrayed on stage. In the case of humour, it was associated with mirth (''hasya'').\n\n== Studies on comic theory ==\nThe phenomena connected with [[laughter]] and that which provokes it have been carefully investigated by psychologists. They agree the predominant characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a \"sudden glory\". Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \"play instinct\" and its emotional expression.\n\n[[George Meredith]] said that \"One excellent test of the civilization of a country ... I take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy, and the test of true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter.\" Laughter is said to be the cure for being sick.

The different forms of comedy often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the subgenres of comedy are [[farce]], [[comedy of manners]], [[burlesque]], and [[satire]].\n\nSome comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and [[satire]] often imitate the conventions of the genre they are parodying or satirizing. For example, in the United States, parodies of newspapers and television news include ''[[The Onion]]'', and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''; in Australia, shows such as ''[[Kath & Kim]],'' [[Utopia (Australian TV series)|''Utopia'']], and ''[[Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell|Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell]]'' perform the same role.\n\n[[Self-deprecation]] is a technique of comedy used by many

[[Frederic Shoberl]]'s 1833 English translation was published as ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (which became the generally used title in English), which refers to [[Quasimodo]], Notre Dame's bellringer.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Victor Hugo-Hunchback.jpg|thumb|Illustration from<br />''Victor Hugo et son temps'' (1881)]]\nVictor Hugo began writing ''Notre-Dame de Paris'' in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. For instance, the medieval stained glass panels of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been replaced by white glass to let more light into the church.<ref>[[:fr:Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris]]</ref> This explains the large descriptive sections of the book, which far exceed the requirements of the story. A few years earlier, Hugo had already published a paper entitled ''Guerre aux D\u00e9molisseurs'' (''War to the Demolishers'') specifically aimed at saving Paris' medieval architecture.<ref>[[:fr:Notre-Dame de Paris (roman)#cite note-21]]</ref> The agreement with his original publisher, Gosselin, was that the book would be finished that same year, but Hugo was constantly delayed due to the demands of other projects. In the summer of 1830, Gosselin demanded that Hugo complete the book by February 1831. Beginning in September 1830, Hugo worked nonstop on the project thereafter.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in [[Paris]] in 1482 during the reign of [[Louis XI]]. The gypsy Esmeralda (born as Agnes) captures the hearts of many men, including those of [[Captain Phoebus]] and [[Pierre Gringoire]], but especially [[Quasimodo]] and his guardian [[Archdeacon]] [[Claude Frollo]]. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards, who save Esmeralda. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, is about to be hanged by beggars when Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him for four years.\n\nThe following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the [[pillory]] for two hours, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart.\n\nLater, Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo actually attempted to kill in jealousy after seeing him trying to seduce Esmeralda. She is sentenced to death by hanging. As she is being led to the [[gallows]], Quasimodo swings down by the bell rope of Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral, temporarily protecting her \u2013 under the [[Right of asylum|law of sanctuary]] \u2013 from arrest.\n\nFrollo later informs Gringoire that the [[Parlement of Paris|Court of Parlement]] has voted to remove Esmeralda's right to the sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be killed. Clopin, the leader of the gypsies, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the citizens of Paris to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda.\n\nWhen Quasimodo sees the gypsies, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Likewise, he thinks the king's men want to rescue her, and tries to help them find her. She is rescued by Frollo and Gringoire. But after yet another failed attempt to win her love, Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is being hanged. When Frollo laughs during Esmeralda's hanging, Quasimodo pushes him from the height of Notre Dame to his death. Quasimodo goes to the cemetery, hugs Esmeralda's body, and dies of [[starvation]] with her. \n\nIn the original, the bodies are found in the charnel house, a mass grave into which the bodies of the destitue and of criminals were indiscriminately thrown, implying that Quasimodo had sought Esmeralda among the decaying corpses and lay beside her, himself to die.\n\n==Characters==\n===Major===\n* [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]] (born Agnes) is a beautiful 16-year-old Gypsy street dancer who is naturally compassionate and kind. She is the novel's protagonist and the center of the human drama within the story. A popular focus of the citizens' attentions, she experiences their changeable attitudes, being first adored as an entertainer, then hated as a witch, before being lauded again by Quasimodo. She is loved by both Quasimodo and Claude Frollo, but, unfortunately she falls hopelessly in love with Captain Phoebus, a handsome soldier whom she believes will rightly protect her but who simply wants to seduce her. She is one of the few characters to show Quasimodo a moment of human kindness, as when she gives him water after the hunchback's flogging. She is eventually revealed to not actually be a gypsy, but to have been kidnapped by them and replaced by the deformed Quasimodo.\n* [[Claude Frollo]], the novel's main antagonist, is the Archdeacon of Notre Dame. His dour attitude and his alchemical experiments have alienated him from the Parisians, who believe him a sorcerer. His parents died from the plague when he was a young man, leaving his dissolute younger brother Jehan as his only family whom he unsuccessfully attempts to reform towards a better life. Frollo also helps care for Quasimodo. Frollo's numerous sins include lechery, failed alchemy and other listed vices. His mad attraction to Esmeralda sets off a chain of events, including her attempted abduction, leading to Quasimodo's sentence to be lashed in the square, and Frollo almost murdering Phoebus in a jealous rage, leading to Esmeralda's execution.\n* [[Quasimodo]] is a deformed 20-year-old [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], and the bell ringer of Notre Dame. He is half blind and deaf, this because of all the years ringing the bells of the church. Abandoned by his mother as a baby, he was adopted by Claude Frollo. Quasimodo's life within the confines of the cathedral and his only two outlets \u2014ringing the [[church bells|bells]] and his love and devotion for Frollo\u2014are described. He rarely ventures outside the Cathedral because the citizens of Paris despise and shun him for his appearance. The notable occasions when he does leave include taking part in the [[Feast of Fools|Festival of Fools]] (which is celebrated on January 6)\u2014during which he is elected the Pope of Fools due to his perfect hideousness\u2014and his subsequent attempt to kidnap Esmeralda, his rescue of Esmeralda from the gallows, his attempt to bring Phoebus to Esmeralda, and his final abandonment of the cathedral at the end of the novel. It is revealed in the story that the baby Quasimodo was left by the [[Romani people|Gypsies]] in place of Esmeralda, whom they abducted.\n* [[Pierre Gringoire]] is a struggling poet. He mistakenly finds his way into the \"[[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]\", the domain of the Truands. In order to preserve the secrecy, Gringoire must either be killed by hanging, or marry a Gypsy. Although Esmeralda does not love him, and in fact believes him to be a coward rather than a true man, she takes pity on his plight and marries him. But, because she is already in love with Phoebus, much to his disappointment, she will not let him touch her.\n* [[Captain Phoebus|Phoebus de Chateaupers]] is the Captain of the King's Archers, and a minor antagonist in the novel. After he saves Esmeralda from abduction, she becomes infatuated with him, and he is intrigued by her. Already betrothed to the beautiful but spiteful Fleur-de-Lys, he wants to lie with Esmeralda nonetheless but is prevented when Frollo stabs him. Phoebus survives, but Esmeralda is taken to be the attempted assassin by all, including Phoebus himself, who no longer wants her. He is condemned to a miserable married life with Fleur-de-Lys.\n\n===Minor===\n* [[Clopin Trouillefou]] is the King of Truands. He sentences Gringoire to be hanged, and presides over his \"wedding\" to Esmeralda. He rallies the Court of Miracles to rescue Esmeralda from Notre Dame after the idea is suggested by Gringoire. He is eventually killed during the attack by the King's soldiers.\n* [[Jehan Frollo]] \"du Moulin\" (alternately named Joannes Frollo \"de Molendino\") is Claude Frollo's 16-year-old dissolute younger brother. He is a troublemaker and a student at the university. He is dependent on his brother for money, which he then proceeds to squander on alcohol. After his brother stops giving him money, Jehan becomes rogue. When he joins Clopin and his beggars to raid the cathedral, he briefly enters the cathedral by ascending one of the towers with a borrowed ladder. Afterwards he sees Quasimodo and tries to shoot an arrow at the hunchback's eye, but Quasimodo throws him down to his death.\n* [[Fleur-de-lis|Fleur-de-Lys]] de Gondelaurier is a beautiful and wealthy noblewoman engaged to Phoebus. Phoebus's attentions to Esmeralda make her insecure and jealous, and she and her friends respond by treating Esmeralda with contempt and spite. Fleur-de-Lys later neglects to inform Phoebus that Esmeralda has not been executed, which serves to deprive the pair of any further contact\u2014though as Phoebus no longer lusts after Esmeralda by this time, this does not matter. The novel ends with their wedding.\n* Madame Alo\u00efse de Gondelaurier is Fleur-de-Lys' mother.\n* Sister Gudule, also known as Sachette and formerly named Paquette Guybertaut \"la Chantefleurie\", is an [[anchorite|anchoress]], who lives in seclusion in an exposed cell in central Paris. She is tormented by the loss of her daughter Agnes, whom she believes to have been cannibalised by Gypsies as a baby, and devotes her life to mourning her. Her long-lost daughter turns out to be Esmeralda, a fact she discovers only moments before Esmeralda is hanged.  Gudule is accidentally killed by one of the King's soldiers while attempting to prevent them from taking her daughter.\n* Djali is Esmeralda's pet goat. In addition to dancing with Esmeralda, Djali can do tricks for money, such as tell time, spell Phoebus' name, and do impressions of public figures. Later during Esmeralda's trial when Esmeralda is falsely accused of the stabbing of Phoebus, Djali is falsely accused of being the devil in disguise. In the end of the novel, Djali is saved by Gringoire (who has become fond of the goat during his marriage to Esmeralda) after Esmeralda is captured and hanged.\n* [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] is the King of France. He appears as an old and sick man, but his personality is very sly and Machiavellian, as well as self-centred. He appears briefly when he is brought the news of the rioting at Notre Dame. He orders his guard to kill the rioters, and also the \"witch\" Esmeralda, because of being misinformed about the reason of rioting.\n* [[Tristan l'Hermite]] is a friend of King Louis XI. He leads the band that goes to capture Esmeralda.\n* Henriet Cousin is the city executioner, who hangs Esmeralda.\n* Florian Barbedienne is the judge who presides over Quasimodo's case for kidnapping Esmeralda. He is also deaf, which makes it more difficult because when he asks Quasimodo for his name, age and profession, Quasimodo does not respond. He sentences the hunchback to be tortured in the public square: one hour of flogging for attempted kidnap, and another hour of public disgrace after he thought Quasimodo was mocking him.\n* Jacques Charmolue is Claude Frollo's friend in charge of torturing prisoners. He gets Esmeralda to falsely confess to killing Phoebus. He then has her imprisoned.\n* Jacques Coppenole is a man who appears in the beginning of the novel as one of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] guests at the Feast of Fools. He convinces the Parisians to select the Pope of Fools.\n* Pierrat Torterue is the torturer at the Ch\u00e2telet. He tortures Esmeralda after her interrogation to the point in where he hurts her so badly she falsely confesses, sealing her own fate. He was also the official who administered the savage flogging to which Quasimodo was sentenced by Barbedienne.\n* The unnamed [[magistrate]] is the one who presides over Esmeralda's case after she is falsely accused of stabbing Phoebus. He forces her to confess to the crime and sentences her to be hanged in the gallows.\n* Robin Poussepain is Jehan Frollo's companion who appears with him during the Feast of Fools and Quasimodo's flogging in the public square.\n* [[Olivier le Daim|Olivier le Mauvais]] (literally \"Olivier the Evil\") is King Louis XI's close advisor.\n* La Falourdel is the innkeeper of the hotel where Phoebus and Esmeralda meet.\n* Marc Cenaine is a magician Jacques Charmolue and Claude Frollo torture for practicing witchcraft while they try to pry alchemy secrets from him.\n* B\u00e9rang\u00e8re de Champchevrier is Fleur-de-Lys' friend.\n* Jacques Coictier is King Louis XI's physician.\n* Robert d'Estouteville is the chamberlain to King Louis XI. He is in a bad temper the day Quasimodo is pilloried, and he does not realize Quasimodo and the judge on duty are both deaf.\n* Colombe is Fleur-de-Lys' friend.\n\n==Major themes==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe novel's original French title, ''Notre-Dame de Paris'', indicates that the cathedral itself is the most significant aspect of the novel, both the main setting and the focus of the story's themes.<ref>Zaretsky, Rob. [http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2293.htm \"Victor Hugo and Architecture\"], ''Engines of our Ingenuity'', 2006 radio transcript, University of Houston. Accessed 2 June 2016.</ref> The building had fallen into disrepair at the time of writing, which was something Hugo felt strongly about. The book portrays the [[Romantic fiction|Romantic]] era as one of extremes in architecture, passion, and religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The theme of [[determinism]] (fate and destiny, as set up in the preface of the novel through the introduction of the word \"[[Ananke (mythology)|ANANKE]]\") is explored, as well as revolution and social strife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/section13.rhtml |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nArchitecture is a major concern of Hugo's in ''Notre-Dame de Paris'', not just as embodied in the cathedral itself, but as representing throughout Paris and the rest of Europe an artistic genre which, Hugo argued, was about to disappear with the arrival of the printing press. Claude Frollo's portentous phrase, '{{lang|fr|Ceci tuera cela}}' (\"This will kill that\", as he looks from a printed book to the cathedral building), sums up this thesis, which is expounded on in Book V, chapter 2. Hugo writes that '{{lang|fr|quiconque naissait po\u00e8te se faisait architecte}}' (\"whoever was born a poet became an architect\"), arguing that while the written word was heavily censored and difficult to reproduce, architecture was extremely prominent and enjoyed considerable freedom.\n{{Verse translation|lang=fr|Il existe \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, pour la pens\u00e9e \u00e9crite en pierre, un privil\u00e8ge tout-\u00e0-fait comparable \u00e0 notre libert\u00e9 actuelle de la presse. C'est la libert\u00e9 de l'architecture.\n|\nThere exists in this era, for thoughts written in stone, a privilege absolutely comparable to our current freedom of the press. It is the freedom of architecture.|attr1=Book V, Chapter 2}}\n\nWith the recent introduction of the printing press, it became possible to reproduce one's ideas much more easily on paper, and Hugo considered this period to represent the last flowering of architecture as a great artistic form. As with many of his books, Hugo was interested in a time which seemed to him to be on the cusp between two types of society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/victor_hugo/hunchback_notre_dame/24/ |title=Online-literature.com |publisher=Online-literature.com |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe major theme of the third book is that over time the cathedral has been repaired, but the repairs and additions have made the cathedral worse: \"And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows\" and \"...who substituted for the ancient Gothic altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with angels' heads and clouds\" are a few examples of this. This chapter also discusses how, after repairs to the cathedral after the French Revolution, there was not a significant style in what was added. It seems as if the new architecture is actually now uglier and worse than it was before the repairing.\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\nHugo introduced with this work the concept of the novel as Epic Theatre. A giant epic about the history of a whole people, incarnated in the figure of the great cathedral as witness and silent protagonist of that history, and the whole idea of time and life as an ongoing, organic panorama centered on dozens of characters caught in the middle of that history. It is the first novel to have beggars as protagonists.\n\nA significant aspect of ''Notre Dame de Paris'' is that it encompasses the whole of life, from the King of France to Paris sewer rats, in a manner later co-opted by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and many others, including [[Charles Dickens]]. The enormous popularity of the book in France spurred the nascent historical preservation movement in that country and strongly encouraged [[Gothic revival]] architecture. Ultimately it led to major renovations at Notre-Dame in the 19th century led by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. Much of the cathedral's present appearance is a result of this renovation.\n\n==Allusions and references==\n\n===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science===\nIn ''The Hunchback of Notre-Dame'', Victor Hugo makes frequent reference to the architecture of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. He also mentions the invention of the [[printing press]], when the bookmaker near the beginning of the work speaks of \"the German pest.\"\n\nIn 2010, British archivist Adrian Glew discovered references to a real-life hunchback who was a foreman of a government sculpting studio in Paris in the 1820s who worked on post-Revolution restorations to the Cathedral.<ref name=nikkhah>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/7945634/Real-life-Quasimodo-uncovered-in-Tate-archives.html \"Real-life Quasimodo uncovered in Tate archives\"], Roya Nikkhah, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 15 August 2010</ref>\n\n===Allusions in other works===\nThe name ''Quasimodo'' has become synonymous with \"a courageous heart beneath a grotesque exterior.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Webber\n | first = Elizabeth\n | author2 = Mike Feinsilber\n | title = Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions\n | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]]\n | year = 1999\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersd0000webb/page/592 592]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersd0000webb/page/592\n | id = \n | isbn = 0-87779-628-9\n }}</ref>\n\n==Drama adaptations==\nTo date, all of the film and TV adaptations have strayed somewhat from the original plot, some going as far as to give it a happy ending, including in the  [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|classic 1939 film]]  (although Quasimodo loses Esmeralda to Gringoire in this version). The [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956 film)|1956 French film]] is one of the few versions to end almost exactly like the novel, although it changes other sections of the story.

[[Frederic Shoberl]]'s 1833 English translation was published as ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (which became the generally used title in English), which refers to [[Quasimodo]], Notre Dame's bellringer.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Victor Hugo-Hunchback.jpg|thumb|Illustration from<br />''Victor Hugo et son temps'' (1881)]]\nVictor Hugo began writing ''Notre-Dame de Paris'' in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. For instance, the medieval stained glass panels of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been replaced by white glass to let more light into the church.<ref>[[:fr:Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris]]</ref> This explains the large descriptive sections of the book, which far exceed the requirements of the story. A few years earlier, Hugo had already published a paper entitled ''Guerre aux D\u00e9molisseurs'' (''War to the Demolishers'') specifically aimed at saving Paris' medieval architecture.<ref>[[:fr:Notre-Dame de Paris (roman)#cite note-21]]</ref> The agreement with his original publisher, Gosselin, was that the book would be finished that same year, but Hugo was constantly delayed due to the demands of other projects. In the summer of 1830, Gosselin demanded that Hugo complete the book by February 1831. Beginning in September 1830, Hugo worked nonstop on the project thereafter.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in [[Paris]] in 1482 during the reign of [[Louis XI]]. The gypsy Esmeralda (born as Agnes) captures the hearts of many men, including those of [[Captain Phoebus]] and [[Pierre Gringoire]], but especially [[Quasimodo]] and his guardian [[Archdeacon]] [[Claude Frollo]]. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards, who save Esmeralda. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, is about to be hanged by beggars when Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him for four years.\n\nThe following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the [[pillory]] for two hours, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart.\n\nLater, Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo actually attempted to kill in jealousy after seeing him trying to seduce Esmeralda. She is sentenced to death by hanging. As she is being led to the [[gallows]], Quasimodo swings down by the bell rope of Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral, temporarily protecting her \u2013 under the [[Right of asylum|law of sanctuary]] \u2013 from arrest.\n\nFrollo later informs Gringoire that the [[Parlement of Paris|Court of Parlement]] has voted to remove Esmeralda's right to the sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be killed. Clopin, the leader of the gypsies, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the citizens of Paris to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda.\n\nWhen Quasimodo sees the gypsies, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Likewise, he thinks the king's men want to rescue her, and tries to help them find her. She is rescued by Frollo and Gringoire. But after yet another failed attempt to win her love, Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is being hanged. When Frollo laughs during Esmeralda's hanging, Quasimodo pushes him from the height of Notre Dame to his death. Quasimodo goes to the cemetery, hugs Esmeralda's body, and dies of [[starvation]] with her. \n\nIn the original, the bodies are found in the charnel house, a mass grave into which the bodies of the destitue and of criminals were indiscriminately thrown, implying that Quasimodo had sought Esmeralda among the decaying corpses and lay beside her, himself to die.\n\n==Characters==\n===Major===\n* [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]] (born Agnes) is a beautiful 16-year-old Gypsy street dancer who is naturally compassionate and kind. She is the novel's protagonist and the center of the human drama within the story. A popular focus of the citizens' attentions, she experiences their changeable attitudes, being first adored as an entertainer, then hated as a witch, before being lauded again by Quasimodo. She is loved by both Quasimodo and Claude Frollo, but, unfortunately she falls hopelessly in love with Captain Phoebus, a handsome soldier whom she believes will rightly protect her but who simply wants to seduce her. She is one of the few characters to show Quasimodo a moment of human kindness, as when she gives him water after the hunchback's flogging. She is eventually revealed to not actually be a gypsy, but to have been kidnapped by them and replaced by the deformed Quasimodo.\n* [[Claude Frollo]], the novel's main antagonist, is the Archdeacon of Notre Dame. His dour attitude and his alchemical experiments have alienated him from the Parisians, who believe him a sorcerer. His parents died from the plague when he was a young man, leaving his dissolute younger brother Jehan as his only family whom he unsuccessfully attempts to reform towards a better life. Frollo also helps care for Quasimodo. Frollo's numerous sins include lechery, failed alchemy and other listed vices. His mad attraction to Esmeralda sets off a chain of events, including her attempted abduction, leading to Quasimodo's sentence to be lashed in the square, and Frollo almost murdering Phoebus in a jealous rage, leading to Esmeralda's execution.\n* [[Quasimodo]] is a deformed 20-year-old [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], and the bell ringer of Notre Dame. He is half blind and deaf, this because of all the years ringing the bells of the church. Abandoned by his mother as a baby, he was adopted by Claude Frollo. Quasimodo's life within the confines of the cathedral and his only two outlets \u2014ringing the [[church bells|bells]] and his love and devotion for Frollo\u2014are described. He rarely ventures outside the Cathedral because the citizens of Paris despise and shun him for his appearance. The notable occasions when he does leave include taking part in the [[Feast of Fools|Festival of Fools]] (which is celebrated on January 6)\u2014during which he is elected the Pope of Fools due to his perfect hideousness\u2014and his subsequent attempt to kidnap Esmeralda, his rescue of Esmeralda from the gallows, his attempt to bring Phoebus to Esmeralda, and his final abandonment of the cathedral at the end of the novel. It is revealed in the story that the baby Quasimodo was left by the [[Romani people|Gypsies]] in place of Esmeralda, whom they abducted.\n* [[Pierre Gringoire]] is a struggling poet. He mistakenly finds his way into the \"[[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]\", the domain of the Truands. In order to preserve the secrecy, Gringoire must either be killed by hanging, or marry a Gypsy. Although Esmeralda does not love him, and in fact believes him to be a coward rather than a true man, she takes pity on his plight and marries him. But, because she is already in love with Phoebus, much to his disappointment, she will not let him touch her.\n* [[Captain Phoebus|Phoebus de Chateaupers]] is the Captain of the King's Archers, and a minor antagonist in the novel. After he saves Esmeralda from abduction, she becomes infatuated with him, and he is intrigued by her. Already betrothed to the beautiful but spiteful Fleur-de-Lys, he wants to lie with Esmeralda nonetheless but is prevented when Frollo stabs him. Phoebus survives, but Esmeralda is taken to be the attempted assassin by all, including Phoebus himself, who no longer wants her. He is condemned to a miserable married life with Fleur-de-Lys.\n\n===Minor===\n* [[Clopin Trouillefou]] is the King of Truands. He sentences Gringoire to be hanged, and presides over his \"wedding\" to Esmeralda. He rallies the Court of Miracles to rescue Esmeralda from Notre Dame after the idea is suggested by Gringoire. He is eventually killed during the attack by the King's soldiers.\n* [[Jehan Frollo]] \"du Moulin\" (alternately named Joannes Frollo \"de Molendino\") is Claude Frollo's 16-year-old dissolute younger brother. He is a troublemaker and a student at the university. He is dependent on his brother for money, which he then proceeds to squander on alcohol. After his brother stops giving him money, Jehan becomes rogue. When he joins Clopin and his beggars to raid the cathedral, he briefly enters the cathedral by ascending one of the towers with a borrowed ladder. Afterwards he sees Quasimodo and tries to shoot an arrow at the hunchback's eye, but Quasimodo throws him down to his death.\n* [[Fleur-de-lis|Fleur-de-Lys]] de Gondelaurier is a beautiful and wealthy noblewoman engaged to Phoebus. Phoebus's attentions to Esmeralda make her insecure and jealous, and she and her friends respond by treating Esmeralda with contempt and spite. Fleur-de-Lys later neglects to inform Phoebus that Esmeralda has not been executed, which serves to deprive the pair of any further contact\u2014though as Phoebus no longer lusts after Esmeralda by this time, this does not matter. The novel ends with their wedding.\n* Madame Alo\u00efse de Gondelaurier is Fleur-de-Lys' mother.\n* Sister Gudule, also known as Sachette and formerly named Paquette Guybertaut \"la Chantefleurie\", is an [[anchorite|anchoress]], who lives in seclusion in an exposed cell in central Paris. She is tormented by the loss of her daughter Agnes, whom she believes to have been cannibalised by Gypsies as a baby, and devotes her life to mourning her. Her long-lost daughter turns out to be Esmeralda, a fact she discovers only moments before Esmeralda is hanged.  Gudule is accidentally killed by one of the King's soldiers while attempting to prevent them from taking her daughter.\n* Djali is Esmeralda's pet goat. In addition to dancing with Esmeralda, Djali can do tricks for money, such as tell time, spell Phoebus' name, and do impressions of public figures. Later during Esmeralda's trial when Esmeralda is falsely accused of the stabbing of Phoebus, Djali is falsely accused of being the devil in disguise. In the end of the novel, Djali is saved by Gringoire (who has become fond of the goat during his marriage to Esmeralda) after Esmeralda is captured and hanged.\n* [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] is the King of France. He appears as an old and sick man, but his personality is very sly and Machiavellian, as well as self-centred. He appears briefly when he is brought the news of the rioting at Notre Dame. He orders his guard to kill the rioters, and also the \"witch\" Esmeralda, because of being misinformed about the reason of rioting.\n* [[Tristan l'Hermite]] is a friend of King Louis XI. He leads the band that goes to capture Esmeralda.\n* Henriet Cousin is the city executioner, who hangs Esmeralda.\n* Florian Barbedienne is the judge who presides over Quasimodo's case for kidnapping Esmeralda. He is also deaf, which makes it more difficult because when he asks Quasimodo for his name, age and profession, Quasimodo does not respond. He sentences the hunchback to be tortured in the public square: one hour of flogging for attempted kidnap, and another hour of public disgrace after he thought Quasimodo was mocking him.\n* Jacques Charmolue is Claude Frollo's friend in charge of torturing prisoners. He gets Esmeralda to falsely confess to killing Phoebus. He then has her imprisoned.\n* Jacques Coppenole is a man who appears in the beginning of the novel as one of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] guests at the Feast of Fools. He convinces the Parisians to select the Pope of Fools.\n* Pierrat Torterue is the torturer at the Ch\u00e2telet. He tortures Esmeralda after her interrogation to the point in where he hurts her so badly she falsely confesses, sealing her own fate. He was also the official who administered the savage flogging to which Quasimodo was sentenced by Barbedienne.\n* The unnamed [[magistrate]] is the one who presides over Esmeralda's case after she is falsely accused of stabbing Phoebus. He forces her to confess to the crime and sentences her to be hanged in the gallows.\n* Robin Poussepain is Jehan Frollo's companion who appears with him during the Feast of Fools and Quasimodo's flogging in the public square.\n* [[Olivier le Daim|Olivier le Mauvais]] (literally \"Olivier the Evil\") is King Louis XI's close advisor.\n* La Falourdel is the innkeeper of the hotel where Phoebus and Esmeralda meet.\n* Marc Cenaine is a magician Jacques Charmolue and Claude Frollo torture for practicing witchcraft while they try to pry alchemy secrets from him.\n* B\u00e9rang\u00e8re de Champchevrier is Fleur-de-Lys' friend.\n* Jacques Coictier is King Louis XI's physician.\n* Robert d'Estouteville is the chamberlain to King Louis XI. He is in a bad temper the day Quasimodo is pilloried, and he does not realize Quasimodo and the judge on duty are both deaf.\n* Colombe is Fleur-de-Lys' friend.\n\n==Major themes==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe novel's original French title, ''Notre-Dame de Paris'', indicates that the cathedral itself is the most significant aspect of the novel, both the main setting and the focus of the story's themes.<ref>Zaretsky, Rob. [http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2293.htm \"Victor Hugo and Architecture\"], ''Engines of our Ingenuity'', 2006 radio transcript, University of Houston. Accessed 2 June 2016.</ref> The building had fallen into disrepair at the time of writing, which was something Hugo felt strongly about. The book portrays the [[Romantic fiction|Romantic]] era as one of extremes in architecture, passion, and religion.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The theme of [[determinism]] (fate and destiny, as set up in the preface of the novel through the introduction of the word \"[[Ananke (mythology)|ANANKE]]\") is explored, as well as revolution and social strife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/section13.rhtml |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nArchitecture is a major concern of Hugo's in ''Notre-Dame de Paris'', not just as embodied in the cathedral itself, but as representing throughout Paris and the rest of Europe an artistic genre which, Hugo argued, was about to disappear with the arrival of the printing press. Claude Frollo's portentous phrase, '{{lang|fr|Ceci tuera cela}}' (\"This will kill that\", as he looks from a printed book to the cathedral building), sums up this thesis, which is expounded on in Book V, chapter 2. Hugo writes that '{{lang|fr|quiconque naissait po\u00e8te se faisait architecte}}' (\"whoever was born a poet became an architect\"), arguing that while the written word was heavily censored and difficult to reproduce, architecture was extremely prominent and enjoyed considerable freedom.\n{{Verse translation|lang=fr|Il existe \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, pour la pens\u00e9e \u00e9crite en pierre, un privil\u00e8ge tout-\u00e0-fait comparable \u00e0 notre libert\u00e9 actuelle de la presse. C'est la libert\u00e9 de l'architecture.\n|\nThere exists in this era, for thoughts written in stone, a privilege absolutely comparable to our current freedom of the press. It is the freedom of architecture.|attr1=Book V, Chapter 2}}\n\nWith the recent introduction of the printing press, it became possible to reproduce one's ideas much more easily on paper, and Hugo considered this period to represent the last flowering of architecture as a great artistic form. As with many of his books, Hugo was interested in a time which seemed to him to be on the cusp between two types of society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/victor_hugo/hunchback_notre_dame/24/ |title=Online-literature.com |publisher=Online-literature.com |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe major theme of the third book is that over time the cathedral has been repaired, but the repairs and additions have made the cathedral worse: \"And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows\" and \"...who substituted for the ancient Gothic altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with angels' heads and clouds\" are a few examples of this. This chapter also discusses how, after repairs to the cathedral after the French Revolution, there was not a significant style in what was added. It seems as if the new architecture is actually now uglier and worse than it was before the repairing.\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\nHugo introduced with this work the concept of the novel as Epic Theatre. A giant epic about the history of a whole people, incarnated in the figure of the great cathedral as witness and silent protagonist of that history, and the whole idea of time and life as an ongoing, organic panorama centered on dozens of characters caught in the middle of that history. It is the first novel to have beggars as protagonists.\n\nA significant aspect of ''Notre Dame de Paris'' is that it encompasses the whole of life, from the King of France to Paris sewer rats, in a manner later co-opted by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and many others, including [[Charles Dickens]]. The enormous popularity of the book in France spurred the nascent historical preservation movement in that country and strongly encouraged [[Gothic revival]] architecture. Ultimately it led to major renovations at Notre-Dame in the 19th century led by [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. Much of the cathedral's present appearance is a result of this renovation.\n\n==Allusions and references==\n\n===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science===\nIn ''The Hunchback of Notre-Dame'', Victor Hugo makes frequent reference to the architecture of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. He also mentions the invention of the [[printing press]], when the bookmaker near the beginning of the work speaks of \"the German pest.\"\n\nIn 2010, British archivist Adrian Glew discovered references to a real-life hunchback who was a foreman of a government sculpting studio in Paris in the 1820s who worked on post-Revolution restorations to the Cathedral.<ref name=nikkhah>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/7945634/Real-life-Quasimodo-uncovered-in-Tate-archives.html \"Real-life Quasimodo uncovered in Tate archives\"], Roya Nikkhah, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 15 August 2010</ref>\n\n===Allusions in other works===\nThe name ''Quasimodo'' has become synonymous with \"a courageous heart beneath a grotesque exterior.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Webber\n | first = Elizabeth\n | author2 = Mike Feinsilber\n | title = Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions\n | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]]\n | year = 1999\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersd0000webb/page/592 592]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersd0000webb/page/592\n | id = \n | isbn = 0-87779-628-9\n }}</ref>\n\n==Drama adaptations==\nTo date, all of the film and TV adaptations have strayed somewhat from the original plot, some going as far as to give it a happy ending, including in the  [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|classic 1939 film]]  (although Quasimodo loses Esmeralda to Gringoire in this version). The [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956 film)|1956 French film]] is one of the few versions to end almost exactly like the novel, although it changes other sections of the story. Unlike most adaptations, the [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|1996 Disney version]] has an ending that is inspired by [[La Esmeralda (opera)|an opera]] created by Hugo himself.\n\n===Comics===\nArtists like Noel Gloesner,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gloesner_noel.htm|title=No\u00ebl Gloesner|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> Andrew Dickson,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dickson_andrew.htm|title=Andrew Dickson|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> Robin Recht,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/recht_robin.htm|title=Robin Recht|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> Tim Conrad,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/conrad_tim.htm|title=Tim Conrad|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> Gilbert Bloch,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bloch_gilbert.htm|title=Gilbert Bloch|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> [[George Evans (cartoonist)|George Evans]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/e/evans.htm|title=George Evans|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> [[Dick Briefer]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/briefer_dick.htm|title=Dick Briefer|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> have all created comic strip and book adaptations of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''.

The bank has over 115 million customers, 11,000+ branches and 13,000+ [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] post merger with [[United Bank of India]] and [[Oriental Bank of Commerce]], effective from 1 April, 2020.<ref name=\"Merger\"/><ref name=\"Branches\"/>\n\nPNB has a banking subsidiary in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (PNB International Bank, with seven branches in the UK), as well as branches in [[Hong Kong]], [[Kowloon]], [[Dubai]], and [[Kabul]]. It has representative offices in [[Almaty]] ([[Kazakhstan]]), [[Dubai]] ([[United Arab Emirates]]), [[Shanghai]] ([[China]]), [[Oslo]] ([[Norway]]), and [[Sydney]] ([[Australia]]).

Lastly, PNB owns 41,64 % of JSC (SB) PNB Bank in Kazakhstan, which has four branches.\n\n==History==\nPunjab National Bank is a [[Public sector undertakings in India|PSU]] working under Central Government of India regulated by [[Reserve Bank of India]] Act, 1934 and Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Punjab National Bank was registered on 19 May 1894 under the Indian Companies Act, with its office in [[Anarkali Bazaar]], [[Lahore]], in present-day [[Pakistan]]. The founding board was drawn from different parts of India professing different faiths and of varying back-ground with, the common objective of creating a truly national bank that would further the economic interest of the country.<ref name=Origin>{{cite web |url=https://www.pnbindia.in/En/ui/OriginofPNB.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213033022/http://www.pnbindia.in/En/ui/OriginofPNB.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2011 |title=Origin of PNB |publisher=Punjab National Bank |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref> PNB's founders included several leaders of the [[Swadeshi]] movement such as [[Dyal Singh Majithia]] and [[Lala Harkishen Lal]], Lala Lalchand, Kali Prosanna Roy, E. C. Jessawala, Prabhu Dayal, Bakshi Jaishi Ram, and Lala Dholan Dass.<ref>Singh Majithia (1994).</ref><ref>Tandon (1989).</ref> [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] was actively associated with the management of the Bank in its early years. The board first met on 23 May 1894.<ref name=Origin/> The bank opened for business on 12 April 1895 in [[Lahore]].\n\nPNB is the first Indian bank to have been started solely with Indian capital that survives to the present - the earlier[[Oudh Commercial Bank]] was established in 1881, but failed in 1958.\n\n[[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]], [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], [[Indira Gandhi]] and the [[Jalianwala Bagh]] Committee have held PNB accounts.<ref name=Origin/>\n\n===Timeline===\n[[File:PNB ATM at Moolchand Metro Station.jpg|right|thumb|PNB ATM at Moolchand Metro Station of Delhi Metro, Delhi]]\nIn 1900 PNB established its first branch outside Lahore in India. Branches in [[Karachi]] and [[Peshawar]] followed. The next major event occurred in 1940 when PNB absorbed Bhagwan (or Bhugwan) Dass Bank, which had its head office in [[Dehra .\n\nAt the [[Partition of India]] and the creation of Pakistan, PNB lost its premises in Lahore, but continued to operate in Pakistan. Partition forced PNB to close 92 offices in [[West Pakistan]], one-third of its total number of branches, and which held 40% of the total deposits. PNB still maintained a few caretaker branches. On 31 March 1947, even before Partition, PNB had decided to leave Lahore and transfer its registered office to India; it received permission from the Lahore High Court on 20 June 1947, at which time it established a new head office at Under Hill Road, Civil Lines in New Delhi. Lala Yodh Raj was the Chairman of the Bank.\n\nIn 1951, PNB acquired the 39 branches of Bharat Bank (est. 1942). Bharat Bank became Bharat Nidhi Ltd. In 1960, PNB again shifted its head office, this time from Calcutta to Delhi. In 1961, PNB acquired Universal Bank of India, which Ramakrishna Jain had established in 1938 in [[Dalmianagar]], [[Bihar]]. PNB also amalgamated Indo Commercial Bank (est. 1932 by [[S. N. N. Sankaralinga Iyer]]) in a rescue. In 1963, The [[Politics of Burma#Military socialist era|Burmese revolutionary government]] nationalized PNB's branch in Rangoon ([[Yangon]]). This became People's Bank No. 7.<ref>Turnell (2009), p.226.</ref> After the [[History of the Kashmir conflict|Indo-Pak war]], in September 1965 the government of Pakistan seized all the offices in Pakistan of Indian banks. PNB also had one or more branches in [[East Pakistan]] ([[Bangladesh]]).\n\nThe [[Government of India]] (GOI) nationalized PNB and 13 other major commercial banks, on 19 July 1969. In 1976 or 1978, PNB opened a branch in London. some ten years later, in 1986, the [[Reserve Bank of India]] required PNB to transfer its London branch to [[State Bank of India]] after the branch was involved in a fraud scandal. That same year, 1986, PNB acquired Hindustan Commercial Bank (est. 1943) in a rescue. The acquisition added Hindustan's 142 branches to PNB's network. In 1993, PNB acquired [[New Bank of India]], which the GOI had nationalized in 1980. In 1998 PNB set up a representative office in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2003 PNB took over [[Nedungadi Bank]], the oldest private sector bank in [[Kerala]]. At the time of the merger with PNB, Nedungadi Bank's shares had zero value, with the result that its shareholders received no payment for their shares. PNB also opened a representative office in London. In 2004, PNB established a branch in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, a representative office in Shanghai, and another in [[Dubai]].  PNB also established an alliance with [[Everest Bank Limited]] in Nepal that permits migrants to transfer funds easily between India and Everest Bank's 12 branches in Nepal. Currently, PNB owns 20% of Everest Bank. Two years later, PNB established PNBIL \u2013 Punjab National Bank (International) \u2013 in the UK, with two offices, one in London, and one in Southall. Since then it has opened more branches, this time in Leicester, Birmingham, Ilford, Wembley, and Wolverhampton. PNB also opened a branch in Hong Kong. In January 2009, PNB established a representative office in Oslo, Norway. PNB hopes to upgrade this to a branch in due course. In January 2010, PNB established a subsidiary in [[Bhutan]]. PNB owns 51% of Druk PNB Bank, which has branches in [[Thimpu]], [[Phuentsholing]], and [[Wangdue]]. Local investors own the remaining shares. Then on 1 May, PNB opened its branch in Dubai's financial center. PNB purchased a small minority stake in Kazakhstan-based JSC Danabank established on 20 October 1992 in Pavlodar. Within the year PNB increased its ownership till 84% of what has become JSC (SB) PNB, with its share currently decreased to 49%. The associate in Kazakhstan now called JSC Tengri Bank has branches in [[Almaty]], [[Nur-Sultan]], [[Karaganda]], [[Pavlodar]] and Shymkent. September 2011: PNB opened a representative office in [[Sydney]], Australia. December 2012: PNB signed an agreement with US based life Insurance company [[Metlife]] to acquire a 30% stake in MetLife's Indian affiliate MetLife India Limited.  The company would be renamed PNB MetLife India Limited and PNB would sell MetLife's products in its branches.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/punjab-national-bank-acquires-30--stake-in-metlife-company-to-be-rebranded/1054584 |title=Punjab National Bank acquires 30% stake in Metlife, company to be re-branded |publisher=The Indian Express|date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=PNBAR2012-13>{{cite web |url=http://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/AnnualReport/532461/5324610313.pdf |title=Annual Report 2012-13 |publisher=PNB |date= |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=10K>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company/Punjab_National_Bank/ryxysxi-1-1njea5.html|title=Financials Information for Punjab National Bank |publisher=[[Hoover's]]|accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=PNBAR2012-13/><ref name=10K/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/7/#header:assets_sortreverse:true|title=The World's Biggest Public Companies|work=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n===[[Punjab National Bank Fraud Case, 2018]]===\nPunjab National Bank disclosed in February 2018 that it detected fraudulent transactions of up to $1.77 billion at just one of its branches.<ref name=\"punjab2018\">{{cite news |title=$1.8 Billion in India Bank Fraud Raises Fears of Ripple Effects |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/business/india-bank-fraud.html |agency=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Punjab National Bank Fraud Case, 2019 ===\nIn July 2019, Punjab National Bank detected another fraud, worth {{INRConvert|3805.15|c|0}} by [[Bhushan Power & Steel]] Ltd (BPSL).\n\n==Mergers and acquisitions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30px;\"| Number\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Acquisition date\n! scope=\"col\" | Company\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Location\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Price\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"sortable\" | Ref(s).\n|-\n| 1\n| 1951\n| Bharat Bank Ltd.\n| New Delhi, India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 2\n| 1961\n| Universal Bank of India\n| [[Dalmianagar]], [[Bihar]], India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 3\n| 1962\n| Indo-Commercial Bank\n| India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 4\n| 1986\n| Hindustan Commercial Bank\n| India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 5\n| 1993\n| [[New Bank of India]]\n| New Delhi, India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 6\n| 2003\n| [[Nedungadi Bank]]\n| [[Kozhikode]], [[Kerala]], India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|7\n|2020\n|{{ubl|[[Oriental Bank of Commerce]]|[[United Bank of India]]}}\n|{{ubl|[[Gurugram]] (Head Office)|[[Kolkata]] (Head Office)}}\n|\u2014\n|<ref>{{cite news |title=As amalgamation with United Bank, OBC takes effect, PNB becomes India\u2019s second largest PSB after SBI |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-as-amalgamation-with-united-bank-obc-takes-effect-pnb-becomes-india-s-second-largest-psb-after-sbi-2819256 |accessdate=2 April 2020 |work=DNA India |date=1 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n|- scope=\"row\"\n|}\n\n===Amalgamation===\nOn 30 August 2019, [[Minister of Finance (India)|Finance Minister]] [[Nirmala Sitharaman]] announced that the [[Oriental Bank of Commerce]] and [[United Bank of India]] would be merged with Punjab National Bank.

Punjab National Bank was registered on 19 May 1894 under the Indian Companies Act, with its office in [[Anarkali Bazaar]], [[Lahore]], in present-day [[Pakistan]]. The founding board was drawn from different parts of India professing different faiths and of varying back-ground with, the common objective of creating a truly national bank that would further the economic interest of the country.<ref name=Origin>{{cite web |url=https://www.pnbindia.in/En/ui/OriginofPNB.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213033022/http://www.pnbindia.in/En/ui/OriginofPNB.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2011 |title=Origin of PNB |publisher=Punjab National Bank |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref> PNB's founders included several leaders of the [[Swadeshi]] movement such as [[Dyal Singh Majithia]] and [[Lala Harkishen Lal]], Lala Lalchand, Kali Prosanna Roy, E.

Jessawala, Prabhu Dayal, Bakshi Jaishi Ram, and Lala Dholan Dass.<ref>Singh Majithia (1994).</ref><ref>Tandon (1989).</ref> [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] was actively associated with the management of the Bank in its early years. The board first met on 23 May 1894.<ref name=Origin/> The bank opened for business on 12 April 1895 in [[Lahore]].\n\nPNB is the first Indian bank to have been started solely with Indian capital that survives to the present - the earlier[[Oudh Commercial Bank]] was established in 1881, but failed in 1958.\n\n[[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]], [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], [[Indira Gandhi]] and the [[Jalianwala Bagh]] Committee have held PNB accounts.<ref name=Origin/>\n\n===Timeline===\n[[File:PNB ATM at Moolchand Metro Station.jpg|right|thumb|PNB ATM at Moolchand Metro Station of Delhi Metro, Delhi]]\nIn 1900 PNB established its first branch outside Lahore in India. Branches in [[Karachi]] and [[Peshawar]] followed. The next major event occurred in 1940 when PNB absorbed Bhagwan (or Bhugwan) Dass Bank, which had its head office in [[Dehra .\n\nAt the [[Partition of India]] and the creation of Pakistan, PNB lost its premises in Lahore, but continued to operate in Pakistan. Partition forced PNB to close 92 offices in [[West Pakistan]], one-third of its total number of branches, and which held 40% of the total deposits. PNB still maintained a few caretaker branches. On 31 March 1947, even before Partition, PNB had decided to leave Lahore and transfer its registered office to India; it received permission from the Lahore High Court on 20 June 1947, at which time it established a new head office at Under Hill Road, Civil Lines in New Delhi. Lala Yodh Raj was the Chairman of the Bank.\n\nIn 1951, PNB acquired the 39 branches of Bharat Bank (est. 1942). Bharat Bank became Bharat Nidhi Ltd. In 1960, PNB again shifted its head office, this time from Calcutta to Delhi. In 1961, PNB acquired Universal Bank of India, which Ramakrishna Jain had established in 1938 in [[Dalmianagar]], [[Bihar]]. PNB also amalgamated Indo Commercial Bank (est. 1932 by [[S. N. N. Sankaralinga Iyer]]) in a rescue. In 1963, The [[Politics of Burma#Military socialist era|Burmese revolutionary government]] nationalized PNB's branch in Rangoon ([[Yangon]]). This became People's Bank No. 7.<ref>Turnell (2009), p.226.</ref> After the [[History of the Kashmir conflict|Indo-Pak war]], in September 1965 the government of Pakistan seized all the offices in Pakistan of Indian banks. PNB also had one or more branches in [[East Pakistan]] ([[Bangladesh]]).\n\nThe [[Government of India]] (GOI) nationalized PNB and 13 other major commercial banks, on 19 July 1969. In 1976 or 1978, PNB opened a branch in London. some ten years later, in 1986, the [[Reserve Bank of India]] required PNB to transfer its London branch to [[State Bank of India]] after the branch was involved in a fraud scandal. That same year, 1986, PNB acquired Hindustan Commercial Bank (est. 1943) in a rescue. The acquisition added Hindustan's 142 branches to PNB's network. In 1993, PNB acquired [[New Bank of India]], which the GOI had nationalized in 1980. In 1998 PNB set up a representative office in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2003 PNB took over [[Nedungadi Bank]], the oldest private sector bank in [[Kerala]]. At the time of the merger with PNB, Nedungadi Bank's shares had zero value, with the result that its shareholders received no payment for their shares. PNB also opened a representative office in London. In 2004, PNB established a branch in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, a representative office in Shanghai, and another in [[Dubai]].  PNB also established an alliance with [[Everest Bank Limited]] in Nepal that permits migrants to transfer funds easily between India and Everest Bank's 12 branches in Nepal. Currently, PNB owns 20% of Everest Bank. Two years later, PNB established PNBIL \u2013 Punjab National Bank (International) \u2013 in the UK, with two offices, one in London, and one in Southall. Since then it has opened more branches, this time in Leicester, Birmingham, Ilford, Wembley, and Wolverhampton. PNB also opened a branch in Hong Kong. In January 2009, PNB established a representative office in Oslo, Norway. PNB hopes to upgrade this to a branch in due course. In January 2010, PNB established a subsidiary in [[Bhutan]]. PNB owns 51% of Druk PNB Bank, which has branches in [[Thimpu]], [[Phuentsholing]], and [[Wangdue]]. Local investors own the remaining shares. Then on 1 May, PNB opened its branch in Dubai's financial center. PNB purchased a small minority stake in Kazakhstan-based JSC Danabank established on 20 October 1992 in Pavlodar. Within the year PNB increased its ownership till 84% of what has become JSC (SB) PNB, with its share currently decreased to 49%. The associate in Kazakhstan now called JSC Tengri Bank has branches in [[Almaty]], [[Nur-Sultan]], [[Karaganda]], [[Pavlodar]] and Shymkent. September 2011: PNB opened a representative office in [[Sydney]], Australia. December 2012: PNB signed an agreement with US based life Insurance company [[Metlife]] to acquire a 30% stake in MetLife's Indian affiliate MetLife India Limited.  The company would be renamed PNB MetLife India Limited and PNB would sell MetLife's products in its branches.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/punjab-national-bank-acquires-30--stake-in-metlife-company-to-be-rebranded/1054584 |title=Punjab National Bank acquires 30% stake in Metlife, company to be re-branded |publisher=The Indian Express|date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=PNBAR2012-13>{{cite web |url=http://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/AnnualReport/532461/5324610313.pdf |title=Annual Report 2012-13 |publisher=PNB |date= |accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=10K>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company/Punjab_National_Bank/ryxysxi-1-1njea5.html|title=Financials Information for Punjab National Bank |publisher=[[Hoover's]]|accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=PNBAR2012-13/><ref name=10K/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/7/#header:assets_sortreverse:true|title=The World's Biggest Public Companies|work=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n===[[Punjab National Bank Fraud Case, 2018]]===\nPunjab National Bank disclosed in February 2018 that it detected fraudulent transactions of up to $1.77 billion at just one of its branches.<ref name=\"punjab2018\">{{cite news |title=$1.8 Billion in India Bank Fraud Raises Fears of Ripple Effects |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/business/india-bank-fraud.html |agency=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Punjab National Bank Fraud Case, 2019 ===\nIn July 2019, Punjab National Bank detected another fraud, worth {{INRConvert|3805.15|c|0}} by [[Bhushan Power & Steel]] Ltd (BPSL).\n\n==Mergers and acquisitions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30px;\"| Number\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Acquisition date\n! scope=\"col\" | Company\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Location\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Price\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"sortable\" | Ref(s).\n|-\n| 1\n| 1951\n| Bharat Bank Ltd.\n| New Delhi, India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 2\n| 1961\n| Universal Bank of India\n| [[Dalmianagar]], [[Bihar]], India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 3\n| 1962\n| Indo-Commercial Bank\n| India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 4\n| 1986\n| Hindustan Commercial Bank\n| India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 5\n| 1993\n| [[New Bank of India]]\n| New Delhi, India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|- scope=\"row\"\n| 6\n| 2003\n| [[Nedungadi Bank]]\n| [[Kozhikode]], [[Kerala]], India\n|\u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|7\n|2020\n|{{ubl|[[Oriental Bank of Commerce]]|[[United Bank of India]]}}\n|{{ubl|[[Gurugram]] (Head Office)|[[Kolkata]] (Head Office)}}\n|\u2014\n|<ref>{{cite news |title=As amalgamation with United Bank, OBC takes effect, PNB becomes India\u2019s second largest PSB after SBI |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-as-amalgamation-with-united-bank-obc-takes-effect-pnb-becomes-india-s-second-largest-psb-after-sbi-2819256 |accessdate=2 April 2020 |work=DNA India |date=1 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n|- scope=\"row\"\n|}\n\n===Amalgamation===\nOn 30 August 2019, [[Minister of Finance (India)|Finance Minister]] [[Nirmala Sitharaman]] announced that the [[Oriental Bank of Commerce]] and [[United Bank of India]] would be merged with Punjab National Bank.
