The Plaza Accord was successful in reducing the U.S. [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]] with [[Western Europe]]an nations but largely failed to fulfill its primary objective of alleviating the trade deficit with Japan. This deficit was due to structural conditions that were insensitive to monetary policy, specifically trade conditions. The [[Final goods|manufactured goods]] of the United States became more competitive in the exports market but were still largely unable to succeed in the [[Japanese domestic market]] due to Japan's structural restrictions on [[import]]s. The [[Louvre Accord]] was signed in 1987 to halt the continuing decline of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe signing of the Plaza Accord was significant in that it reflected Japan's emergence as a real player in managing the [[international monetary systems|international monetary system]].

For those of a similar name, see [[Lawrence Kramer (disambiguation)]]''\n\n[[File:U.S. Territory Governors meet in Capitol. Washington, D.C., Aug. 13.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Governor Lawerence W. Cramer far right]]\n\n'''Lawrence William Cramer''' (December 26, 1897 \u2013 1978) was the second civilian [[Governor of the United States Virgin Islands]].\n\nCramer was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison]] and obtained a [[master's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He then spent two years in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]] and was wounded in battle. After the war, he returned as a professor of Government at Columbia University and wrote a book about the diplomatic background of the war.\n\nCramer was [[Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands|Lieutenant Governor]] under [[Paul Martin Pearson]] since 1931. Both he and Pearson were [[subpoena]]ed to appear in [[Washington, D.C.]] before the [[United States Senate|Senate]] regarding a scandal / political dispute that ultimately resulted in the forced resignation of Pearson and the appointment of Cramer as full governor on August 21, 1935. After his appointment, the Senate hearings continued and [[Robert Herrick (novelist)|Robert Herrick]] was made acting-Governor.\n\nBefore Cramer was even installed, he had been tainted by his predecessor's reputation. The Islands' Colonial Council voted on July 29, 1935, to petition [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to bring the Islands back under the control of the [[United States Navy]], as it had been prior to 1931.\n\nAfter his inauguration, however, Cramer made some positive moves which quelled fears. First, he was sworn in by a native judge and not a mainland one. He announced stepped-up [[rum]] exporting plans and petitioned the [[Department of the Interior]] for increased home rule for the territory. He also petitioned for [[universal suffrage]]. These moves were successful and the moves to oust Cramer ceased.\n\nHowever, his difficulties resurfaced in 1937 as the [[Legislature of the United States Virgin Islands]] met for the first time and refused to consider eight of the nine bills he asked them to vote on. Cramer continued to have difficulties with the Assembly over tax law and other matters.\n\nHe resigned as governor in December, 1941. Cramer later served as executive secretary of the [[Committee on Fair Employment Practice]] during World War II.<ref>Jer\u00e9 Franco. \"Beyond Reservation Boundaries: Native American Workers in World War II\" in ''Journal of the Southwest'' Vol. 36, no. 3 (Autumn 1994) p. 251</ref>\n\nCramer's Park, a popular beach on [[St. Croix]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] is named after him.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War I}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*ISLANDS GET NEW RULER.

Cramer far right]]\n\n'''Lawrence William Cramer''' (December 26, 1897 \u2013 1978) was the second civilian [[Governor of the United States Virgin Islands]].\n\nCramer was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison]] and obtained a [[master's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He then spent two years in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]] and was wounded in battle. After the war, he returned as a professor of Government at Columbia University and wrote a book about the diplomatic background of the war.\n\nCramer was [[Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands|Lieutenant Governor]] under [[Paul Martin Pearson]] since 1931. Both he and Pearson were [[subpoena]]ed to appear in [[Washington, D.C.]] before the [[United States Senate|Senate]] regarding a scandal / political dispute that ultimately resulted in the forced resignation of Pearson and the appointment of Cramer as full governor on August 21, 1935. After his appointment, the Senate hearings continued and [[Robert Herrick (novelist)|Robert Herrick]] was made acting-Governor.\n\nBefore Cramer was even installed, he had been tainted by his predecessor's reputation. The Islands' Colonial Council voted on July 29, 1935, to petition [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to bring the Islands back under the control of the [[United States Navy]], as it had been prior to 1931.\n\nAfter his inauguration, however, Cramer made some positive moves which quelled fears. First, he was sworn in by a native judge and not a mainland one. He announced stepped-up [[rum]] exporting plans and petitioned the [[Department of the Interior]] for increased home rule for the territory. He also petitioned for [[universal suffrage]]. These moves were successful and the moves to oust Cramer ceased.\n\nHowever, his difficulties resurfaced in 1937 as the [[Legislative Assembly of the United States Virgin Islands]] met for the first time and refused to consider eight of the nine bills he asked them to vote on. Cramer continued to have difficulties with the Assembly over tax law and other matters.\n\nHe resigned as governor in December, 1941. Cramer later served as executive secretary of the [[President's Committee on Fair Employment Practices]] during World War II.<ref>Jer\u00e9 Franco. \"Beyond Reservation Boundaries: Native American Workers in World War II\" in ''Journal of the Southwest'' Vol. 36, no. 3 (Autumn 1994) p. 251</ref>\n\nCramer's Park, a popular beach on [[St. Croix]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] is named after him.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War I}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*ISLANDS GET NEW RULER.
