Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters.

The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister.

The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that \"to sit down and talk with [[Gerry Adams|Mr Adams]] and the Provisional IRA&nbsp;... would turn my stomach\",<ref>{{cite Hansard|title=European Council (Special Meeting)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-11-01/Debate-2.html|date=1 November 1993|column=34|house=House of Commons}}</ref> [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

He was [[World Snooker Championship|World Champion]] in [[2002 World Snooker Championship|2002]], beating [[Stephen Hendry]] 18\u201317 in the final, and won the [[UK Championship]] in [[2006 UK Championship (snooker)|2006]] and seven other ranking events between 1993 and 2012. He was also a losing finalist in the World Championship in 1996 and 2006. Ebdon turned professional in 1991 and beat six-time world champion [[Steve Davis]] 10\u20134 in the first round of the 1992 World Championship.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nEbdon turned professional in 1991. Sporting a ponytail, he made an impact by beating [[Steve Davis]] 10\u20134 in the first round of the [[1992 World Snooker Championship|1992 World Championship]]; he went on to reach the quarter-finals of the event, losing 7\u201313 to a resurgent [[Terry Griffiths]]. However, it was a run which earned him the WPBSA Young Player of the Year award as a result. His first ranking title was the 1993 [[World Open (snooker)|Grand Prix]].<ref name=\"autogenerated\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/world_champs_2002/1971162.stm|title=Ebdon's road to greatness|date=7 May 2002|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He climbed the rankings rapidly to reach a career-highest position of number three in 1996; he again reached world number three status at the close of the 2002 season.\n\n===2002\u20132010===\nEbdon's greatest achievement, thus far, was his 18\u201317 defeat of [[Stephen Hendry]] in the [[2002 World Snooker Championship|2002 World Championship]] final,<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20020922/ai_n12578469 The Sunday Herald: Cue Peter; Stewart Fisher talks to the champion who believes there is]</ref> having started the tournament at odds of 33\u20131.<ref name=\"autogenerated\" /> He had previously reached the final of the tournament in [[1996 World Snooker Championship|1996]], which he lost 12\u201318 to Hendry, and was also runner-up at the [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006 event]] to [[Graeme Dott]] in which, at 7\u201315 down coming into the final session, Ebdon won six successive frames before Dott prevailed 18\u201314. In the semi-final before the final he led [[Marco Fu]] 15\u20139 before being pegged back to 16\u201316 before Ebdon took the decider, at the end of which he shed tears of relief.\n\nEbdon is a remarkably focused and determined player. Until recently, his shot times had slowed down considerably; this attracted some criticism \u2013 particularly, in his match against [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] in the [[2005 World Snooker Championship|2005 World Championship]]. Resuming at 6\u201310 down, Ebdon won the first six frames of the evening session, at one stage taking three minutes over a shot, and five minutes to compile a break of 12. Ebdon nevertheless won the match 13\u201311.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/apr/28/snooker.uk|title=Snooker: O'Sullivan ground down and out|first=Clive Everton at The|last=Crucible|date=28 April 2005|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Such performances, though lacking fluency, often appear to break his opponent mentally.

Ebdon's shot times were markedly quicker, and this fluency served him well in defeating the defending champion [[Ding Junhui]] and [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] en route to the final, and compiling eight century-breaks over the course of the tournament. However, he failed to reach a ranking quarter-final in 2007. His poor form continued into 2008; in the Northern Ireland Trophy he lost 0\u20135 to [[Liang Wenbo]] with a highest break of 32, a result which led to an investigation of suspicious betting patterns by the Gambling Commission. The WPBSA, however, did not launch an investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamblingplanet.org/Walker_Worries_Over_Ebdon_Liang|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008233145/http://www.gamblingplanet.org/Walker_Worries_Over_Ebdon_Liang|title=Gambling Planet.org: Walker Admits Worries Over Ebdon-Liang|archivedate=8 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/21/snooker|title=Snooker: Probe into 5-0 Peter Ebdon defeat|first=Clive|last=Everton|date=20 September 2008|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> In 2009, Ebdon beat [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] 10\u20138 to win the [[China Open 2009 (snooker)|China Open]].

He was an articulate champion of the grievances and anger of Upper Canada (Ontario). He played a major role in securing national unity.  His career in active politics faltered after 1865, but he remained a powerful spokesman for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] promoting westward expansion and opposing the policies of Conservative Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\n==Biography==\nGeorge Brown was born in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]], Scotland, on November 29, 1818. His father, an evangelical Presbyterian, was committed to civil and religious liberty, progress, and laissez-faire economics. He was an enemy of Tory aristocratic privilege, and provided a good education for his son, who brought similar beliefs to the New World.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\n===New York City===\nThe family emigrated to New York in 1837, and began publishing newspapers.<ref name=\"DOCB\">{{ cite DCB |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brown_george_10E.html |title=BROWN, GEORGE |volume=10 |accessdate= September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBrown discovered he appreciated British parliamentarianism more than American republicanism. He visited Canada several times and was invited to move there in 1843 by Presbyterians.\n\n===Toronto===\n[[File:Toronto Globe 2 December, 1845.jpg|thumb|left|350px|December 99, 1845]]\n\nBrown began the Toronto ''Banner'' in 1843. It was a Presbyterian weekly supporting [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] principles and political reform. Brown's father raised the money and founded a weekly newspaper, ''The Globe'' in 1844, and later became a daily news source.  Filled with strong editorials on religious and political affairs, ''The Globe'' quickly became the leading Reform newspaper in the [[Province of Canada]].  In 1848, he was appointed to head a [[Royal Commission]] to examine  accusations of official misconduct in [[Kingston Penitentiary|Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada]] at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The \"Brown Report\", which Brown drafted early in 1849, included sufficient evidence of abuse to set in motion the termination of warden Henry Smith.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/> Brown's revelations of poor conditions at the Kingston penitentiary were heavily criticized by [[John A. Macdonald]] and contributed to the tense relationship between the two rival politicians.\n\n===Issues===\nBrown attacked slavery in the United States and in 1850, helped found the [[Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society of Canada]]. This society was founded to end the practice of slavery in [[North America]], and individual members aided former American slaves reach Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Anti-Slavery Society of Canada |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anti-slavery-society-of-canada |last=Baker |first=Nathan |date=February 13, 2018 |language=en |access-date=November 27, 2018 }}</ref> As a result, black Canadians enthusiastically supported Brown's political ambitions.\n\nCatholics, however, were another matter. He vehemently ridiculed and denounced the [[Catholic Church]], Jesuits, priests, nunneries, etc.  His newspaper promoted the strident speeches of ex-Catholic priest [[Alessandro Gavazzi]], which incited [[Gavazzi Riots|mob violence in 1853 with nine dead in Montreal.]]<ref>Careless, ''Brown of the Globe'' 1:172-74</ref>\n\nBrown was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1851. He reorganized the [[Clear Grits|Clear Grit]] ([[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]) Party in 1857, supporting, among other things, the [[separation of church and state]], the annexation of [[Rupert's Land]], and a small government. But the most important issue for George Brown was representation by population, where electoral districts would be divided so that each one contained a roughly equal number of electors.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\nFrom the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, the Canadian colonial legislature had been composed of an equal number of members from Canada East (Lower Canada, Quebec) and Canada West (Upper Canada, Ontario, Canada). In 1841, Francophone-dominated Lower Canada had a larger population, and the British colonial administration hoped that the [[Canadiens]] in Lower Canada would be legislatively pacified by a coalition of Loyalists from Lower Canada with the Upper Canadian side.  But during the 1840s and 1850s, as the population of Upper Canada grew larger than the Canadien population of Lower Canada, the opposite became true. Brown believed that the larger population deserved to have more representatives, rather than an equal number from Upper and Lower Canada. Brown's pursuit of this goal of righting what he perceived to be a great wrong to Canada West<ref>{{cite book |first=P.

Macdonald lost the support of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] on a non-confidence vote and his cabinet had to resign. After [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] declined the opportunity, George Brown attempted to form a ministry with [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. At the time, newly appointed ministers had to resign their seats and run in by-elections. When members of Brown's ministry resigned their seats to get re-elected, supporters of Macdonald called for a vote of non-confidence, which passed and thus forced Brown and his government to resign before they had re-taken their seats. Brown was the de facto premier of [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Province of Canada]] in 1858. The short-lived administration was called the Brown-Dorion government, named after the co-premiers George Brown and [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. This episode was termed the \"double shuffle.\"<ref name=\"Careless\">{{cite book|last1=Careless|first1=JMS|title=The Union of the Canadas|url=https://archive.org/details/unionofcanadaoxf00jmsc|url-access=registration|date=1967|publisher=McClelland and Stewart Ltd|location=Toronto}}</ref>\n\n== Confederation ==\n[[Image:George Brown Monument, Queens Park, Toronto, Ontario.jpg|thumb|Monument to George Brown at Queen's Park, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, circa 1910]]\n\nGeorge Brown resigned from the [[Great Coalition|Coalition]] in 1865 because he was not happy with the United States.  Brown thought Canada should pursue free trade, while the conservative government of John A. Macdonald and Alexander Galt thought Canada should increase tariffs.\n\nDuring the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], Brown argued strongly in favour of an appointed [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].  Like many reformers of the time, he saw Upper Houses as inherently conservative in function, serving to protect the interests of the rich, and wished to deny the Senate the legitimacy and power that naturally follows with an electoral mandate.<ref>{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Moore |title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-5519-9483-3 |pp=107\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Quebec Conference pleased Brown particularly by the prospect for the end of Lower Canadian interference in the affairs of Canada West.   \"Is it not wonderful?\" he wrote to his wife Anne after the Quebec Conference, \"French-Canadianism is entirely extinguished.\"<ref>Brown Papers, George Brown to Anne Brown, October 15, 1864.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |chapter=George Brown and the Mother of Confederation |title=Careless at Work: Selected Canadian historical studies |url={{google books|ezMooPjieAEC|plainurl=yes|page=77}} |publisher=Dundurn |location=Toronto |date=1996 |p=77 |isbn=978-1-4597-1340-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first=J.M.S. |last=Careless |title=George Brown and the Mother of Confederation |publisher=Canadian Historical Association |conference=Report of the Annual Meeting |date=1960 |p=71}}</ref><ref name=Gwyn319>[[#Gwyn2009|Gwyn (2009)]], p. 319</ref>  By this he may have meant either that he was of the view that English-speaking Canada West had emerged triumphant over French Canadians<ref>[[#Waite2001|Waite (2001)]], p. 113</ref> or that Confederation would put an end to French Canadian domination of the affairs of what would become the province of Ontario.<ref name=Gwyn319/>\n\nBrown realized, nevertheless, that satisfaction for Canada West would not be achieved without the support of the French-speaking majority of Canada East.  In his speech in support of Confederation in the Legislature of the Province of Canada on February 8, 1865, in which he spoke glowingly of the prospects for Canada's future,<ref>[[#Waite2001|Waite (2001)]], p. 139</ref> Brown insisted that \"whether we ask for parliamentary reform for Canada alone or in union with the Maritime Provinces, the views of French Canadians must be consulted as well as ours.

As leader of the provincial [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]], he also ran for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. His intention was to become [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] but he failed to win election to either chamber. He was widely seen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]] in the [[1867 Canadian federal election|1867 federal election]]. The Liberals were officially leaderless until 1873, but Brown was considered the party's \"elder statesman\" even without a seat in the House of Commons, and was regularly consulted by leading Liberal parliamentarians. Brown was made a senator in 1873.<ref>{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Brown, George (1818-1880)|first=Edward Irving |last=Carlyle}}</ref>\n\n== Post-parliamentary career and death ==\n[[Image:Attempted Assassination of George Brown.jpg|thumb|right|Fatal shooting of George Brown, Toronto]]   Brown fought endless battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872.

His career in active politics faltered after 1865, but he remained a powerful spokesman for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] promoting westward expansion and opposing the policies of Conservative Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\n==Biography==\nGeorge Brown was born in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]], Scotland, on November 29, 1818. His father, an evangelical Presbyterian, was committed to civil and religious liberty, progress, and laissez-faire economics. He was an enemy of Tory aristocratic privilege, and provided a good education for his son, who brought similar beliefs to the New World.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\n===New York City===\nThe family emigrated to New York in 1837, and began publishing newspapers.<ref name=\"DOCB\">{{ cite DCB |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brown_george_10E.html |title=BROWN, GEORGE |volume=10 |accessdate= September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBrown discovered he appreciated British parliamentarianism more than American republicanism. He visited Canada several times and was invited to move there in 1843 by Presbyterians.\n\n===Toronto===\n[[File:Toronto Globe 2 December, 1845.jpg|thumb|left|350px|December 99, 1845]]\n\nBrown began the Toronto ''Banner'' in 1843. It was a Presbyterian weekly supporting [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] principles and political reform. Brown's father raised the money and founded a weekly newspaper, ''The Globe'' in 1844, and later became a daily news source.  Filled with strong editorials on religious and political affairs, ''The Globe'' quickly became the leading Reform newspaper in the [[Province of Canada]].  In 1848, he was appointed to head a [[Royal Commission]] to examine  accusations of official misconduct in [[Kingston Penitentiary|Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada]] at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The \"Brown Report\", which Brown drafted early in 1849, included sufficient evidence of abuse to set in motion the termination of warden Henry Smith.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/> Brown's revelations of poor conditions at the Kingston penitentiary were heavily criticized by [[John A. Macdonald]] and contributed to the tense relationship between the two rival politicians.\n\n===Issues===\nBrown attacked slavery in the United States and in 1850, helped found the [[Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society of Canada]].

He reorganized the [[Clear Grits|Clear Grit]] ([[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]) Party in 1857, supporting, among other things, the [[separation of church and state]], the annexation of [[Rupert's Land]], and a small government. But the most important issue for George Brown was representation by population, where electoral districts would be divided so that each one contained a roughly equal number of electors.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\nFrom the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, the Canadian colonial legislature had been composed of an equal number of members from Canada East (Lower Canada, Quebec) and Canada West (Upper Canada, Ontario, Canada). In 1841, Francophone-dominated Lower Canada had a larger population, and the British colonial administration hoped that the [[Canadiens]] in Lower Canada would be legislatively pacified by a coalition of Loyalists from Lower Canada with the Upper Canadian side.  But during the 1840s and 1850s, as the population of Upper Canada grew larger than the Canadien population of Lower Canada, the opposite became true. Brown believed that the larger population deserved to have more representatives, rather than an equal number from Upper and Lower Canada.

After [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] declined the opportunity, George Brown attempted to form a ministry with [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. At the time, newly appointed ministers had to resign their seats and run in by-elections. When members of Brown's ministry resigned their seats to get re-elected, supporters of Macdonald called for a vote of non-confidence, which passed and thus forced Brown and his government to resign before they had re-taken their seats. Brown was the de facto premier of [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Province of Canada]] in 1858. The short-lived administration was called the Brown-Dorion government, named after the co-premiers George Brown and [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]].

As leader of the provincial [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]], he also ran for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. His intention was to become [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] but he failed to win election to either chamber. He was widely seen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]] in the [[1867 Canadian federal election|1867 federal election]]. The Liberals were officially leaderless until 1873, but Brown was considered the party's \"elder statesman\" even without a seat in the House of Commons, and was regularly consulted by leading Liberal parliamentarians.

Still, he criticized the need to backtrack to the dungeons and the \"modest\" graphics.<ref name=\"IGNYs7review\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/111/1114820p1.html|title=Ys Seven Review|last=Clements|first=Ryan|date=2010-08-20|website=IGN|archiveurl=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/111/1114820p1.html|archivedate=2010-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nRPGamer awarded Ys Seven \"Best PSP RPG of 2010\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/awards/2010/results/psp.html|title=RPGamer Awards 2010 best PSP RPG|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line given -->|website=RPGamer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130221841/http://www.rpgamer.com/awards/2010/results/psp.html|archivedate=2011-01-30|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\nRPGFan named it \"Overall Best RPG of E3\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e3-2010/awards/index2.html|title=RPGFan E3 2010 Awards & Gallery|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line given -->|website=RPGFan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707071031/http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e3-2010/awards/index2.html|archivedate=2010-07-07|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://worldofys.com/seven.php}}\n\n{{Ys series}}\n\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Action role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Ys (series)]]\n[[Category:Dragons in video games]]\n", "name_user": "151.177.54.184", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eGameplay)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_Seven"}

They were musically talented, strictly disciplined, educated in the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] (grammar, logic, [[rhetoric]]), and sometimes fluent in Latin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hillebrand|first1=Harold Newcomb|title=The Child Actors: A Chapter in Elizabethan Stage History|date=1964|publisher=Russell & Russel, Inc.|location=New York|page=37}}</ref> The boys amounted to formidable competition for the companies of adult actors in Elizabethan England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gurr|first1=Andrew|title=The Shakespearean stage 1574-1642|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521729666|page=46|edition=Fourth}}</ref> Between 1558 and 1576 (the year [[James Burbage]] built [[The Theatre]] in London and the age of popular Elizabethan drama began), companies of boy actors performed 46 times at Court, versus only 32 times for companies of adult actors in the same period. The playwright [[John Lyly]] earned fame when his \"Euphuistic\" plays were acted at Court by the Children of Paul's in the 1260. CHUPAME EL PITO LA REPUTA QUE TE PARIO\n\nThe practice of children acting was never free of controversy, however (see Responses, below). Companies of child actors went out of fashion, and did not return for a decade.\n\nIn [[1600 in literature|1600]], however, the practice saw a resurgence: the [[Children of the Chapel]] performed at the private [[Blackfriars Theatre]] for much of the first decade of the 17th century.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 23-60.</ref> Their performances of the plays of [[Ben Jonson]] were especially popular. (The [[Globe Theatre]] was decorated with a statue of [[Hercules]], the playhouse's symbol.) The Children of Paul's were also acting publicly once again at this time.\n\nThe children probably attained their greatest notoriety during the ''Poetomachia'' or [[War of the Theatres]] ([[1599 in literature|1599]]&ndash;[[1601 in literature|1601]]). Two troupes were intimately involved on the competing sides: the Children of Paul's acted [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[Jack Drum's Entertainment]]'' (1600) and ''[[What You Will]]'' (1601) and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[Satiromastix]]'' (1601), while the Children of the Chapel had Jonson's ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) and ''[[The Poetaster]]'' (1601).\n\nThe boys' troupes were strongly associated with the satirical comedy of Jonson, Marston, and [[Thomas Middleton]], which has sometimes been described as a coterie drama for gentleman \"wits\", in contrast to the popular drama of writers like Shakespeare and [[Thomas Heywood]] that was performed at the Globe and the other large public theatres. Yet the boys also played serious tragedies and contemporary histories, notably the works of [[George Chapman]] &mdash; ''[[Bussy D'Ambois]]'', ''[[The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois]]'', and the double play ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron]]''. Modern readers and theatergoers can only wonder what these productions were like.   \n\nThe brand of coterie drama practiced by Jonson and others was often controversial, however; the official displeasure that greeted the play ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', which landed two of its authors in jail, also fell upon the boys who performed it. By [[1606 in literature|1606]] the Children of Paul's had ceased performing, and the Children of the Chapel were no longer associated with the Royal Chapel and had lost royal patronage; they became merely the Children of the Blackfriars. The boys' troupes had ceased public dramatic performance and the fashion died out by about 1615. The [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] was a new company granted a patent on April 27, [[1615 in literature|1615]], under the patronage of King James' daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]]; it was composed, to some significant degree, of veterans of the children's companies, now grown to manhood.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 246-60.</ref>\n\nWhile controversial in their time, the children's companies had been effective in funnelling talented, educated, and experienced young actors into the adult companies. To recapture this influence, [[Richard Gunnell]] attempted to start a children's company with 14 boys and several adults when he built the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] in [[1629 in literature|1629]]. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce [[Stephen Hammerton]], who went on to act with the King's Men, and became an early [[matinee idol]] among young women in the audience for his romantic leads.<ref>[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]], ''The Shakespearean Stage'', pp. 63-4</ref> \n\nA limited renewal of the practice of children's companies came in [[1637 in literature|1637]], when [[Christopher Beeston]] established, under royal warrant, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially called [[Beeston's Boys]]. The intent was in part to have a structure for training young actors &mdash; much as the choirs of the previous century had provided educated and capable talent (though the actors in Beeston's company tended to be older than the boys of the earlier troupes). After the elder Beeston's death in 1638, his son [[William Beeston]] continued the company, with uneven success, till the theatres closed in 1642; he even managed to re-form Beeston's Boys for a time once the theatres re-opened in the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==Boys in adult companies==\nIn [[playing company|playing companies]] of adult actors, boys were initially given the female parts, but women were permitted to act on the stage from December [[1661 in literature|1661]]. A law against women on stage was implemented in England until that time.<ref>''Women Waging Law in Elizabethan England''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 304 pp</ref> Pre-pubescent boys were used for their unbroken voices, an accepted practice.\n\nBoy actors in adult companies apparently served as apprentices, in ways comparable to the practices of other guilds and trades of the age, though for shorter terms &mdash; perhaps two or three years instead of the usual seven. (The companies of adult actors were, in Elizabethan legal terms, retainers in noble households, and thus not subject to the legal statutes governing apprentices.){{fact|date=January 2014}}<ref>Individual actors sometimes maintained membership in guilds, precisely for the legal right to maintain apprentices. [[John Heminges]] was a member of the grocer's guild throughout his life, and [[Ben Jonson]] renewed his membership in the bricklayer's guild in 1599...but probably not because they were enthusiastic about greengrocering and bricklaying. [[Andrew Cane]], however, was an active goldsmith and a member of the Goldsmith's Company as well as the leading clown of [[Prince Charles's Men]] in the 1630s; and he turned his goldsmith's apprentices John Wright Arthur Savill into boy players with the company. Both appeared in [[Shackerley Marmion]]'s ''[[Holland's Leaguer (play)|Holland's Leaguer]]'' in December [[1631 in literature|1631]].{{fact|date=January 2014}}</ref> They performed female roles (and, of course, roles of male children if required) alongside adult male actors playing men or older female parts. In reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] company, variously the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (1594&ndash;1603) or the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] (1603 and after): [[Augustine Phillips]] left bequests to an apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|James Sands]], and a former apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|Samuel Gilburne]], in his will, read after his death in 1605; company members [[William Ostler]], [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]], [[Nathan Field]], and [[King's Men personnel|John Rice]] had all started their acting careers as [[Children of the Chapel]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]].\n\n==Boys playing female roles==\nOne question has persisted: did boys play ''all'' female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre]], or were some roles, the most demanding ones, played by adult males? Some literary critics and some ordinary readers have found it incredible that the most formidable and complex female roles created by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Webster|Webster]] could have been played by \"children.\"  The available evidence is incomplete and occasionally ambiguous; however, the overall implication is that even the largest roles were played by boys or young men, not mature adults. In a recent detailed survey of the evidence for the ages of boy actors and their roles, scholar David Kathman concludes that \"No significant evidence supports the idea that such roles were played by adult sharers but a wealth of specific evidence demonstrates that they were played by adolescent boys no older than about twenty-one\".<ref>David Kathman, \"How Old Were Shakespeare's Boy Actors?\" in ''Shakespeare Survey'' 58 (2006), p. 246.</ref> There are only two possible examples of adult actors playing female roles. The first appears in the cast list for [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]]'', in which the veteran comedian [[John Shank]] is listed; the entry reads \"Petella, their waiting-woman. Their Servant Mr. ''Shanck''.\"  However, Kathman argues that this refers to two roles, not one: Shank did not play Petella, but a comic servant who appears later in the play.<ref>Kathman, 234.</ref> The second example is the cast list for [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', in which [[Anthony Turner (actor)|Anthony Turner]] apparently played the tiny role of a kitchen maid. Kathman suspects this is merely a misprint, but concludes that even if Turner did play this role, there remains no evidence for adults playing leading roles.<ref>Kathman, 238.</ref>\n\nMany boy actors filled female roles for a few years, then switched to male roles. An example: [[John Honyman]] started playing female roles for the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the age of 13, in [[1626 in literature|1626]], in [[Philip Massinger]]'s ''[[The Roman Actor]]''. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''[[The Deserving Favourite]]'' and Massinger's ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (both in [[1629 in literature|1629]]). Yet in 1630, at the age of 17, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, [[John Thompson (actor)|John Thompson]] and [[Richard Sharpe (actor)|Richard Sharpe]], appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been \"young men\" rather than \"boys.\" [[Theophilus Bird]] played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles.\n\nAudience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players. When one Henry Jackson saw the King's Men perform ''[[Othello]]'' at Oxford in 1610, he wrote of the cast's Desdemona in his diary, \"She [sic] always acted the matter very well, in her death moved us still more greatly; when lying in bed she implored the pity of those watching with her countenance alone.\"<ref>Translated from the original Latin; Michael Shapiro, \"The Introduction of Actresses in England: Delay or Defensiveness?,\" in Comensoli and Russell, p. 185.</ref> The mere fact that Jackson referred to the boy as \"she,\" when he certainly knew better rationally, may in itself testify to the strength of the illusion.\n\n==Responses==\nMany [[Puritan]] preachers, who hated the theatre in general, were outraged by the use of boy players, which they believed encouraged homosexual lust. In [[1583 in literature|1583]], [[Philip Stubbes]] complained that plays were full of \"such wanton gestures, such bawdy speeches...such kissing and bussing\" that playgoers would go home together \"very friendly...and play the sodomites, or worse.\"<ref>Philip Stubbes, ''The Anatomy of Abuses'' (1583), quoted in Bruce R. Smith, ed. ''Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts'' (New York: Bedford St Martin's, 2001), p. 275.</ref> John Rainolds warned of the \"filthy sparkles of lust to that vice the putting of women's attire on men may kindle in unclean affections.\"<ref>John Rainolds, ''The Overthrow of Stage Playes'' ([[1599 in literature|1599]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\nIn response to such comments, the actor-playwright [[Thomas Heywood]] protested that audiences were capable of distancing themselves: \"To see our youths attired in the habit of women, who knows not what their intents be? Who cannot distinguish them by their names, assuredly knowing they are but to represent such a lady, at such a time appointed?\"<ref>Thomas Heywood, ''An Apology for Actors'' ([[1612 in literature|1612]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\n==Famous boy players==\n*[[Christopher Beeston]] was perhaps the greatest success story among the child actors (at least in worldly terms). He continued his acting career into his maturity, became a theatre manager, and by the 1620s and '30s was arguably the most influential man in the world of London theatre.\n*[[Nathan Field]] was another success story of the children's companies. In ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'', Jonson hailed him as the \"best\" of the young actors (\"Which is your best actor, your Field?\"). As an adult, Field acted with the King's Men, and wrote creditable plays as well.\n*Solomon Pavy became one of the Children of the Chapel in 1600, at the age of ten. He acted in Jonson's ''Cynthia's Revels'' and ''The Poetaster.'' When he died prematurely in 1603, Jonson wrote an epitaph for him, praising Pavy's talent for playing old men.\n*[[Alexander Cooke]] was the boy who is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's heroines on stage. He remained with the King's Men as an adult actor.\n*[[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]] graduated from the Children of the Chapel, via [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] and the Duke of York's/[[Prince Charles' Men]], to replace [[Richard Burbage]] as the leading man of the King's Men. He played Hamlet, Othello, and all the major Shakespearean roles.\n*[[Stephen Hammerton]] was a prominent boy actor with the King's Men in the last decade of English Renaissance theatre, 1632&ndash;42.\n*[[Hugh Clark (actor)|Hugh Clark]] was a noted boy player in the 1625&ndash;30 period.\n*[[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] started out as a boy player with the King's Men, earning fame for his portrayal of the Duchess in [[James Shirley|Shirley's]] [[The Cardinal (play)|''The Cardinal'']] ([[1641 in literature|1641]]). He became a leading man and a star of the stage during the Restoration.\n*[[Theophilus Bird]] started as a boy player; like Hart he resumed his career as an adult actor when the theatres re-opened in 1660.\n*[[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] was the last prominent boy actor; he worked during the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==In film, literature and theatre==\nThe boy player has been a popular subject in literary, theatrical and cinematic representations of the Elizabethan theatre.\n*The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' features a boy player (played by [[Daniel Brocklebank]]) who performs Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' before being ousted by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character (who is disguised as a man).\n*[[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]'s play ''[[Cressida (play)|Cressida]]'' is set in the 1630s and depicts the friendship between an elderly former boy player and the historical boy player [[Stephen Hammerton]].\n*The play and film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' are about the Restoration boy player [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] and the transition to female acting.\n*[[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel about Christopher Marlowe, ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'', is narrated by a boy player.\n*[[Tom Stoppard]]'s film of ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a scene in which the eponymous duo are briefly convinced of the femininity of a boy player.\n*[[Susan Cooper]]'s novel ''[[King of Shadows]]'' deals with boy actors including [[Nathan Field]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Comensoli, Viviana, and Anne Russell, eds.

In [[1583 in literature|1583]], [[Philip Stubbes]] complained that plays were full of \"such wanton gestures, such bawdy speeches...such kissing and bussing\" that playgoers would go home together \"very friendly...and play the sodomites, or worse.\"<ref>Philip Stubbes, ''The Anatomy of Abuses'' (1583), quoted in Bruce R. Smith, ed. ''Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts'' (New York: Bedford St Martin's, 2001), p. 275.</ref> John Rainolds warned of the \"filthy sparkles of lust to that vice the putting of women's attire on men may kindle in unclean affections.\"<ref>John Rainolds, ''The Overthrow of Stage Playes'' ([[1599 in literature|1599]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\nIn response to such comments, the actor-playwright [[Thomas Heywood]] protested that audiences were capable of distancing themselves: \"To see our youths attired in the habit of women, who knows not what their intents be? Who cannot distinguish them by their names, assuredly knowing they are but to represent such a lady, at such a time appointed?\"<ref>Thomas Heywood, ''An Apology for Actors'' ([[1612 in literature|1612]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\n==Famous boy players==\n*[[Christopher Beeston]] was perhaps the greatest success story among the child actors (at least in worldly terms). He continued his acting career into his maturity, became a theatre manager, and by the 1620s and '30s was arguably the most influential man in the world of London theatre.\n*[[Nathan Field]] was another success story of the children's companies. In ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'', Jonson hailed him as the \"best\" of the young actors (\"Which is your best actor, your Field?\"). As an adult, Field acted with the King's Men, and wrote creditable plays as well.\n*Solomon Pavy became one of the Children of the Chapel in 1600, at the age of ten. He acted in Jonson's ''Cynthia's Revels'' and ''The Poetaster.'' When he died prematurely in 1603, Jonson wrote an epitaph for him, praising Pavy's talent for playing old men.\n*[[Alexander Cooke]] was the boy who is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's heroines on stage. He remained with the King's Men as an adult actor.\n*[[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]] graduated from the Children of the Chapel, via [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] and the Duke of York's/[[Prince Charles' Men]], to replace [[Richard Burbage]] as the leading man of the King's Men. He played Hamlet, Othello, and all the major Shakespearean roles.\n*[[Stephen Hammerton]] was a prominent boy actor with the King's Men in the last decade of English Renaissance theatre, 1632&ndash;42.\n*[[Hugh Clark (actor)|Hugh Clark]] was a noted boy player in the 1625&ndash;30 period.\n*[[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] started out as a boy player with the King's Men, earning fame for his portrayal of the Duchess in [[James Shirley|Shirley's]] [[The Cardinal (play)|''The Cardinal'']] ([[1641 in literature|1641]]). He became a leading man and a star of the stage during the Restoration.\n*[[Theophilus Bird]] started as a boy player; like Hart he resumed his career as an adult actor when the theatres re-opened in 1660.\n*[[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] was the last prominent boy actor; he worked during the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==In film, literature and theatre==\nThe boy player has been a popular subject in literary, theatrical and cinematic representations of the Elizabethan theatre.\n*The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' features a boy player (played by [[Daniel Brocklebank]]) who performs Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' before being ousted by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character (who is disguised as a man).\n*[[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]'s play ''[[Cressida (play)|Cressida]]'' is set in the 1630s and depicts the friendship between an elderly former boy player and the historical boy player [[Stephen Hammerton]].\n*The play and film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' are about the Restoration boy player [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] and the transition to female acting.\n*[[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel about Christopher Marlowe, ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'', is narrated by a boy player.\n*[[Tom Stoppard]]'s film of ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a scene in which the eponymous duo are briefly convinced of the femininity of a boy player.\n*[[Susan Cooper]]'s novel ''[[King of Shadows]]'' deals with boy actors including [[Nathan Field]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Comensoli, Viviana, and Anne Russell, eds.

Meri, who had previously encouraged Kody to marry Janelle and Christine, explains that she met Robyn and encouraged Kody to court her also.

Meri discusses her sadness about her infertility problems and the jealousy that has arisen from Kody's recent courtship and engagement to Robyn. When Meri asks how Kody would feel if she had a relationship with another man, he says he finds the idea repulsive, although he admits as a polygamist that his reaction sounds hypocritical. Kody apologizes for his past impatience with Meri's jealousy issues and expresses his love and devotion to her. Later, he proposes having another child through [[in vitro fertilisation]], but she turns down the idea as she is only interested in natural childbirth.<ref name=\"Shellnutt1010\" />\n |LineColor=B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=6\n |EpisodeNumber2=6\n |Title=A Fourth Wife to Be\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|10|17}}\n |Aux4=2.67<ref name=\"Ep4Rate\">{{Cite news|last=Seidman |first=Robert |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: Kardashians Lead; ''Mad Men'' Finale Up; ''Rubicon'' Finale Down; ''Broadway Empire'', ''Sonny with a Chance'' & Much More |work=TV by the Numbers |date=October 19, 2010 |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/10/19/sunday-cable-ratings-kardarshians-lead-mad-men-finale-up-rubicon-finale-down-boardwalk-empire-sonny-with-a-chance-much-more/68833 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024201649/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/10/19/sunday-cable-ratings-kardarshians-lead-mad-men-finale-up-rubicon-finale-down-boardwalk-empire-sonny-with-a-chance-much-more/68833 |archivedate=October 24, 2010 }}</ref>\n |ShortSummary=As Robyn's wedding to Kody approaches, he and the other sister wives clash over whether Robyn is entitled to as much time with Kody as they are: Robyn and Janelle feel as fiancee, she is entitled to equal time with Kody, while Meri and Christine feel she is not until they are married. Despite continued tension over the changes in the family due to the addition of Robyn, the four women mostly get along well. Wanting the others to feel involved, Robyn invites them along to look at dresses, although she doesn't say which dress she's choosing: it's a surprise. Kody joins the women to look at wedding cakes and possible reception locations. During a later interview for the show, Kody reveals he chose the wedding dress himself, which prompts Christine to walk away mid-interview. When she returns, the three wives say they felt betrayed by Kody's actions, but he apologizes and the five reconcile.<ref name=\"Reiher1017\">{{Cite web |last=Reiher |first=Andrea |title='Sister Wives' finale: Will Season 2 see Robyn move into the house? |work=[[Zap2it]] |date=October 17, 2010 |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/sister-wives-finale-will-season-2-see-robyn-move-into-the-house.html |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212055644/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/sister-wives-finale-will-season-2-see-robyn-move-into-the-house.html |archivedate=December 12, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Shellnutt1018\">{{Cite news |last=Shellnutt |first=Kate |title=Sister Wives: A polygamist 'coming out' party |date=October 18, 2010 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |url=http://blogs.chron.com/tubular/archives/2010/10/sister_wives_a_1.html |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref>\n |LineColor=B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=7\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=Four Wives and Counting...\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|10|17}}\n |Aux4 = 2.74<ref name=\"Ep4Rate\" />\n |ShortSummary = The first-season finale episode features the wedding of Kody and Robyn.

Robyn struggles to prepare herself while maintaining her hyper and mischievous children. For religious reasons, the cameras are not permitted at the ceremony and it was not televised. During an outdoors reception, Meri, Janelle and Christine present Robyn with a [[Claddagh ring]] to welcome her into the family. As the other wives reflect on their own wedding ceremonies, Janelle, who did not originally come from a polygamist family, reveals she lost most of her family and friends when she married Kody because they were disgusted that she decided to enter into polygamy. As Kody and Robyn prepare to leave for their honeymoon, all four sister wives reflect on how happy they are and how much they look forward to the future.<ref name=\"Reiher1017\" /><ref name=\"Shellnutt1018\" />\n |LineColor=B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=8\n |EpisodeNumber2=8\n |Title=''Sister Wives'' Special\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|10|31}}\n |Aux4=1.82<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunday's Cable Ratings: \"Walking Dead\" Devours the Competition|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2010/11/02/sundays-cable-ratings-walking-dead-devours-the-competition-241314/cable_20101031/|work=The Futon Critic|date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary=An hour-long interview hosted by [[NBC]] correspondent [[Natalie Morales (journalist)|Natalie Morales]], who interviews the Brown family about their polygamist lifestyle, new celebrity status and the criminal investigation against them.<ref name=\"Means\" />\n |LineColor=B30713\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=9\n |EpisodeNumber2=9\n |Title=''Sister Wives'' Honeymoon Special\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2010|11|21}}\n |Aux4=1.82<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunday's Cable Ratings: \"Walking Dead\" Continues to Feast|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2010/11/23/sundays-cable-ratings-walking-dead-continues-to-feast-254112/cable_20101121/|work=The Futon Critic|date=November 23, 2010}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary=This episode features Kody and Robyn's 11-day honeymoon in [[San Diego]].

Meri, who had previously encouraged Kody to marry Janelle and Christine, explains that she met Robyn and encouraged Kody to court her also.

Meri experiences an emotional breakdown and talks about the difficulties of being in a polygamist family, and Christine grows particularly upset when she learns Kody sealed his engagement to Robyn with a kiss, since he never kissed the other wives until they were married.

When Meri asks how Kody would feel if she had a relationship with another man, he says he finds the idea repulsive, although he admits as a polygamist that his reaction sounds hypocritical.

Despite continued tension over the changes in the family due to the addition of Robyn, the four women mostly get along well.

Kody joins the women to look at wedding cakes and possible reception locations.

It encompasses a diverse range of people and motivations, ranging from gardeners who spill over their legal boundaries to gardeners with political influences who seek to provoke change by using guerrilla gardening as a form of [[protest]] or [[direct action]]. This practice has implications for [[land rights]] and [[land reform]]; aiming to promote re-consideration of [[Land ownership and tenure|land ownership]] in order to assign a new purpose or reclaim land that is perceived to be in neglect or misused.\n \nThe land that is guerrilla gardened is usually abandoned or perceived to be neglected by its legal owner. That land is used by guerrilla gardeners to raise plants, frequently focusing on [[food crops]] or plants intended for aesthetic purposes, like [[flowers]].\n\nSome guerrilla gardeners carry out their actions at night, in relative secrecy, to sow and tend a new vegetable patch or [[flower garden]] in an effort to make the area of use and/or more attractive. Some garden at more visible hours for the purpose of publicity, which can be seen as a form of [[activism]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Guerrilla gardening.jpg|thumb|250px|Guerrilla gardeners planting vegetables on previously empty space in downtown [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada.]]\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the term ''guerrilla gardening'' was by [[Liz Christy Garden|Liz Christy]] and her Green Guerrilla group in 1973 in the Bowery Houston area of New York. They transformed a derelict private lot into a garden.<ref>Lamborn, P., and Weinberg, B. (Eds.), (1999), ''Avant Gardening: Ecological Struggle in The City and The World''. Autonomedia. {{ISBN|1-57027-092-9}}</ref> The space is still cared for by volunteers but now enjoys the protection of the city's parks department. Two celebrated guerrilla gardeners, active prior to the coining of the term, were [[Gerrard Winstanley]], of [[Diggers|the Diggers]] in [[Surrey]], England (1649), and [[Johnny Appleseed|John \"Appleseed\" Chapman]] in [[Ohio]], USA (1801).\n\nGuerrilla gardening takes place in many parts of the world - more than thirty countries are documented<ref>Reynolds, R.

Although sunflower sowing at this time of the year is limited to relatively temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere, this day is also marked in other parts of the world by planting plants appropriate to the season.\n\n=== North America ===\nGuerrilla gardening continues today, as individuals secretly plant fruit trees, edible perennials, and flowers in parks, along bike trails, etc. Some guerrilla gardeners do so for the purpose of providing food. For example, the Tacamiche [[banana]] [[plantation]] workers in [[Honduras]] illegally grew vegetables on the abandoned plantation land, rather than leave with the plantation's closure in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n====Adam Purple's Garden of Eden====\n[[File:Lower East Side in Adam Purple's Garden 1984..jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adam Purple]]'s urban garden on the [[Lower East Side]] of Manhattan in 1984.]]\n{{main|Adam Purple}}\nFrom the mid-1970s, [[Adam Purple]] created and tended a circular garden (shaped like a [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]]) in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, in an abandoned lot.

The university acquired the land through [[eminent domain]], and the houses on the land were demolished, but the university did not allocate funds to develop the land, and the land was left in a decrepit state.\n\nEventually, people began to convert the unused land into a park. This led to an embattled history involving community members, the university, university police, [[Ronald Reagan|Governor Reagan]], and the national guard, where protest and bloody reprisal left one person dead, and hundreds seriously wounded. Parts of the park were destroyed and rebuilt over time, and it has established itself into a permanent part of the city.\n\n====Greenaid (Los Angeles)====\nGreenaid is a [[Los Angeles]] based organization founded in 2010 by Daniel Phillips and Kim Karlsrud of Common Studio. The organization converts vintage gumball machines to dispense [[seed ball]]s, a combination of clay, compost and region-specific seeds. Once dispensed, seed balls are tossed or planted in any area that may benefit from wildflowers ([[Seed bombing]]). Greenaid partners with business owners, educators and citizens to distribute seedbomb vending machines in various communities worldwide. With region-specific seedbomb mixes, Greenaid aims to integrate and beautify rather than disrupt traditionally bland urban areas such as sidewalks and highway medians.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.thecommonstudio.com/greenaid\n|title= Greenaid\n|website= Commonstudio\n|access-date= 2015-07-20\n}}</ref> In July 2010, Greenaid received $10,398 in funding from the Kickstarter community.

Originally a maintained parkette in [[Welland]], this small area along the [[Welland Recreational Waterway]] fell into disuse and neglect for a number of years. In 2013, a handful of local residents, including visual artists and guerrilla gardeners, reclaimed the space by fully restoring overgrown flower beds, adding outdoor paintings, and overseeing general landscape maintenance. Although this area is officially municipal property, there was initially a question by volunteers as to which local organization was responsible for this parkette's maintenance (whether responsibility fell into hands of Welland Recreational Canal Corporation or City of Welland Parks Department). Volunteers met with representatives of City of Welland, and an unofficial verbal agreement was made, ensuring that although the City of Welland does own the parkette land, volunteers may continue maintenance and gardening in the area. Currently, the area does attract some local artistic, musical, and creative youth. It has also been the setting for a number of small unorganized or impromptu events, such as art shows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.niagarathisweek.com/community-story/4575625-guerilla-gardeners-transform-park/|title=Guerrilla Gardeners Transform Park|last=Henschel|first=Steve|date=Jun 12, 2014|work=Niagara This Week|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2017/04/09/canal-side-park-gets-spring-makeover|title=Canal Side Park Gets Spring Makeover|last=Barton|first=Laura|date=April 9, 2017|work=The Welland Tribune|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2015/05/21/art-to-take-over-guerrilla-garden|title=Art to Take Over Guerrilla Garden|last=Tribune Staff|first=|date=May 21, 2015|work=The Welland Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Arbutus Greenway - Vancouver (BC Canada)'''\n\nThe Arbutus corridor, located on the un-ceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil Waututh Nations was originally a rail line developed in 1902 by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), connecting Vancouver harbour to the fishing village of Steveston on the South Arm of the Fraser River <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vancouverheritagefoundation.org/place-that-matters/arbutus-corridor/|title=Arbutus Corridor \u2022 Vancouver Heritage Foundation|website=Vancouver Heritage Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>.&nbsp; In 1905 the BC Electric Company (BCEC) leased and electrified the line to operate interurban passenger rail service between Vancouver and Richmond.&nbsp; The BCEC passenger service was discontinued in 1952 but CPR freight operations continued infrequently until 2001. &nbsp;\n\nWith the end of rail operations, CPR wanted to redevelop the 17 hectare corridor for residential and commercial purposes but was prevented by the City of Vancouver which wanted to acquire the lands for green space and potentially, a future light rail transportation line.&nbsp; In 2006 the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the City's zoning authority to prohibit CPR development <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16/index.do|title=Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v.

Simply put - if residents agreed to keep their sidewalks litter free, and only placed trash out for collection the night before scheduled pick-up, guerrilla gardeners would place a garden pot with flowering annuals in the spring and summer, mums in the fall and greenery over the winter months in place of the trash pile. What began with a few homes and apartments quickly spread and as of 2019 over 40 homes and apartments have agreed to the concept. York City's Guerrilla Gardeners routinely care for street trees, planters and front gardens that have been neglected or fallen into disrepair. Several gardeners focus on litter removal, one ensures street lamps are replaced when they burn out, two focus on seasonal leaf and snow removal. In 2013, Ralph Serpe received the Downtown, Inc. Beautification Award on behalf of the Downtown East Guerrilla Gardeners. \n\n=== Europe ===\n\n====\"Garden in a night\" (Denmark)====\nIn 1996, Have p\u00e5 en nat (\"Garden in a night\") was made by the Danish \u00d8kologiske Igangs\u00e6ttere (\"Organic starters\").

At the time, his motivations were simply those of a frustrated gardener looking to beautify the neighborhood, but his website attracted the interest of fellow guerrilla gardeners in London and beyond, as well as the world's media. Reynolds's guerrilla gardening has now reached many pockets of South London, and news of his activity has inspired people around the world to get involved. He also works alongside other troops, some local and some who travel to participate.

There are a few minor disputes between guerrilla gardeners in Melbourne, with most falling into one of two groups: those concerned most with native planting and those concerned most with communal food growing. However, people with differing opinions still work together without dispute.<ref>''The Age'', Article \"Gardening guerrilla's in our midst\", 10/12/08.</ref>\n\nThere are small community groups around Australia called \"Permablitz\" who gather regularly to design and construct suburban vegetable gardens for free, in an effort to educate residents on how to grow their own food and better prepare them if/when food prices become too expensive.\n\nAustralian [[Network 10]]'s show ''[[Guerrilla Gardeners]]'' featured a team of gardeners who make over areas of council owned property without them knowing.\n\n'''Kevin Hoffman Walk'''\n\nKevin Hoffman Walk is a passive, scenic linear trail with significant indigenous vegetation, lush ground covers, flowering native shrubs and trees, that overlook part of the tranquil Hovells Creek in Lara Victoria.

On his return to South Africa, he began implementing the practice by attempting to eradicate invasive [[black wattle|wattle]] trees from [[Groenkloof Nature Reserve|Klapperkop Nature Reserve]] in [[Pretoria]], after local authorities failed to address the infestation. On 20 May 2018 he was however arrested by the [[Fascism|South African Police Service]] for his contribution to society.\n\n== Toxicity risks ==\n\nDue to [[brownfield]], there are some health risks to foraging or planting edible plants near toxic waste sites and roads with heavy traffic due to chemical runoff that gets absorbed by the roots. Scientists have learned that certain types of plants absorb toxins from the soil without dying and can thus be used as a mechanism to reduce chemical ground pollution. Guerrilla gardening could be used as a way to take independent action to clean up one's community, but eating a toxin-absorbent plant will deposit those toxins in the body.\n\nUrban foragers face similar health risks in this manner. Care should be taken to not eat plants that grow in areas where there is known chemical contamination or water pollution. Plants that grow on the side of high-traffic roads should also not be eaten because of automobile fluid runoff.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Community gardening]]\n*[[Community Supported Agriculture]]\n*[[Flower power]]\n*[[Horticultural therapy]]\n*''[[The Man Who Planted Trees]]''\n*[[Food Justice]]\n*[[World Naked Gardening Day]]\n**[[World Naked Gardening Day#Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade|Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[Common land]]\n*[[Communal garden]]\n*[[Urban gardening (disambiguation)|Urban gardening]]\n*[[Urban horticulture]]\n*[[Tactical urbanism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|Guerrilla}}\n{{Commons category|Guerrilla gardening}}\n* [http://www.guerrillagardening.org GuerrillaGardening.org]- The global forum for guerrilla gardeners\n* [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2008/apr/25/guerrilla.gardening Police vs guerrilla gardeners] ''The Guardian'' filmed guerrilla gardeners in London encounter the police.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060628013749/http://www.gb0063551.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/guerrilla/ Allotmenteering] Reflections on Guerrilla Gardening and Allotmenteering\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021822/http://www.heavypetal.ca/archives/2007/04/operation_moss_graffiti.html Moss Graffiti] How to make moss graffiti\n* [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2008/apr/25/seedbombing Domestic Seed Bomb production] Richard Reynolds demonstrates the Californian method of seed bomb making.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081202172546/http://makesomethinghappen.net/2008/07/10/mshcast-5-erik-knutzen-guerrilla-gardening-and-urban-homesteading/ Interview with the author of Urban Homestead]- Erik Knutzen discusses guerrilla gardening and other collective action.\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/food/archive/2010/05/saving-the-world-with-che-mao-and-carrots/56557/ Saving the World with Che, Mao, and Carrots] - Review of ''On Guerrilla Gardening'' by Richard Reynolds for ''The Atlantic''\n* [http://www.wikihow.com/Start-Guerrilla-Gardening Start-Guerrilla-Gardening] - Step-by-step guide\n* [http://www.ag-moos.at/ Aktionsgruppe Moos] - Guerrilla Gardeners from Vienna, Austria\n* [http://cafe.naver.com/ggmovement \uac8c\ub9b4\ub77c\uac00\ub4dc\ub2dd] The community for guerrilla gardeners in Korea\n\n{{Horticulture and gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Community building]]\n[[Category:DIY culture]]\n[[Category:Environmentalism]]\n[[Category:Horticulture and gardening]]\n[[Category:Urban agriculture]]\n[[Category:Guerrilla gardening]]\n[[Category:Biophilia hypothesis]]\n", "text_old": "{{Cleanup|reason=Etymology section needs re-writing and references need to be properly cited in the Wikipedia standard|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:Guerilla Gardening in front of Flying Pigeon LA.jpg|thumb|250px|Guerrilla gardening on a Los Angeles street.]]\n'''Guerrilla gardening''' is the act of [[gardening]] on land that the [[gardener]]s do not have the legal rights to cultivate, such as abandoned sites, areas that are not being cared for, or private property. It encompasses a diverse range of people and motivations, ranging from gardeners who spill over their legal boundaries to gardeners with political influences who seek to provoke change by using guerrilla gardening as a form of [[protest]] or [[direct action]]. This practice has implications for [[land rights]] and [[land reform]]; aiming to promote re-consideration of [[Land ownership and tenure|land ownership]] in order to assign a new purpose or reclaim land that is perceived to be in neglect or misused.\n \nThe land that is guerrilla gardened is usually abandoned or perceived to be neglected by its legal owner. That land is used by guerrilla gardeners to raise plants, frequently focusing on [[food crops]] or plants intended for aesthetic purposes, like [[flowers]].\n\nSome guerrilla gardeners carry out their actions at night, in relative secrecy, to sow and tend a new vegetable patch or [[flower garden]] in an effort to make the area of use and/or more attractive. Some garden at more visible hours for the purpose of publicity, which can be seen as a form of [[activism]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Guerrilla gardening.jpg|thumb|250px|Guerrilla gardeners planting vegetables on previously empty space in downtown [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada.]]\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the term ''guerrilla gardening'' was by [[Liz Christy Garden|Liz Christy]] and her Green Guerrilla group in 1973 in the Bowery Houston area of New York.

The university acquired the land through [[eminent domain]], and the houses on the land were demolished, but the university did not allocate funds to develop the land, and the land was left in a decrepit state.\n\nEventually, people began to convert the unused land into a park. This led to an embattled history involving community members, the university, university police, [[Ronald Reagan|Governor Reagan]], and the national guard, where protest and bloody reprisal left one person dead, and hundreds seriously wounded. Parts of the park were destroyed and rebuilt over time, and it has established itself into a permanent part of the city.\n\n====Greenaid (Los Angeles)====\nGreenaid is a [[Los Angeles]] based organization founded in 2010 by Daniel Phillips and Kim Karlsrud of Common Studio.

Once dispensed, seed balls are tossed or planted in any area that may benefit from wildflowers ([[Seed bombing]]).

Originally a maintained parkette in [[Welland]], this small area along the [[Welland Recreational Waterway]] fell into disuse and neglect for a number of years. In 2013, a handful of local residents, including visual artists and guerrilla gardeners, reclaimed the space by fully restoring overgrown flower beds, adding outdoor paintings, and overseeing general landscape maintenance. Although this area is officially municipal property, there was initially a question by volunteers as to which local organization was responsible for this parkette's maintenance (whether responsibility fell into hands of Welland Recreational Canal Corporation or City of Welland Parks Department). Volunteers met with representatives of City of Welland, and an unofficial verbal agreement was made, ensuring that although the City of Welland does own the parkette land, volunteers may continue maintenance and gardening in the area. Currently, the area does attract some local artistic, musical, and creative youth. It has also been the setting for a number of small unorganized or impromptu events, such as art shows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.niagarathisweek.com/community-story/4575625-guerilla-gardeners-transform-park/|title=Guerrilla Gardeners Transform Park|last=Henschel|first=Steve|date=Jun 12, 2014|work=Niagara This Week|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2017/04/09/canal-side-park-gets-spring-makeover|title=Canal Side Park Gets Spring Makeover|last=Barton|first=Laura|date=April 9, 2017|work=The Welland Tribune|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2015/05/21/art-to-take-over-guerrilla-garden|title=Art to Take Over Guerrilla Garden|last=Tribune Staff|first=|date=May 21, 2015|work=The Welland Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Arbutus Greenway - Vancouver (BC Canada)'''\n\nThe Arbutus corridor, located on the un-ceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil Waututh Nations was originally a rail line developed in 1902 by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), connecting Vancouver harbour to the fishing village of Steveston on the South Arm of the Fraser River <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vancouverheritagefoundation.org/place-that-matters/arbutus-corridor/|title=Arbutus Corridor \u2022 Vancouver Heritage Foundation|website=Vancouver Heritage Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref>.&nbsp; In 1905 the BC Electric Company (BCEC) leased and electrified the line to operate interurban passenger rail service between Vancouver and Richmond.&nbsp; The BCEC passenger service was discontinued in 1952 but CPR freight operations continued infrequently until 2001. &nbsp;\n\nWith the end of rail operations, CPR wanted to redevelop the 17 hectare corridor for residential and commercial purposes but was prevented by the City of Vancouver which wanted to acquire the lands for green space and potentially, a future light rail transportation line.&nbsp; In 2006 the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the City's zoning authority to prohibit CPR development <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16/index.do|title=Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v.

Simply put - if residents agreed to keep their sidewalks litter free, and only placed trash out for collection the night before scheduled pick-up, guerrilla gardeners would place a garden pot with flowering annuals in the spring and summer, mums in the fall and greenery over the winter months in place of the trash pile. What began with a few homes and apartments quickly spread and as of 2019 over 40 homes and apartments have agreed to the concept. York City's Guerrilla Gardeners routinely care for street trees, planters and front gardens that have been neglected or fallen into disrepair. Several gardeners focus on litter removal, one ensures street lamps are replaced when they burn out, two focus on seasonal leaf and snow removal. In 2013, Ralph Serpe received the Downtown, Inc. Beautification Award on behalf of the Downtown East Guerrilla Gardeners. \n\n=== Europe ===\n\n====\"Garden in a night\" (Denmark)====\nIn 1996, Have p\u00e5 en nat (\"Garden in a night\") was made by the Danish \u00d8kologiske Igangs\u00e6ttere (\"Organic starters\").

On 20 May 2018 he was however arrested by the [[Fascism|South African Police Service]] for his contribution to society.\n\n== Toxicity risks ==\n\nDue to [[brownfield]], there are some health risks to foraging or planting edible plants near toxic waste sites and roads with heavy traffic due to chemical runoff that gets absorbed by the roots. Scientists have learned that certain types of plants absorb toxins from the soil without dying and can thus be used as a mechanism to reduce chemical ground pollution. Guerrilla gardening could be used as a way to take independent action to clean up one's community, but eating a toxin-absorbent plant will deposit those toxins in the body.\n\nUrban foragers face similar health risks in this manner. Care should be taken to not eat plants that grow in areas where there is known chemical contamination or water pollution. Plants that grow on the side of high-traffic roads should also not be eaten because of automobile fluid runoff.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Community gardening]]\n*[[Community Supported Agriculture]]\n*[[Flower power]]\n*[[Horticultural therapy]]\n*''[[The Man Who Planted Trees]]''\n*[[Food Justice]]\n*[[World Naked Gardening Day]]\n**[[World Naked Gardening Day#Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade|Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[Common land]]\n*[[Communal garden]]\n*[[Urban gardening (disambiguation)|Urban gardening]]\n*[[Urban horticulture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|Guerrilla}}\n{{Commons category|Guerrilla gardening}}\n* [http://www.guerrillagardening.org GuerrillaGardening.org]- The global forum for guerrilla gardeners\n* [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2008/apr/25/guerrilla.gardening Police vs guerrilla gardeners] ''The Guardian'' filmed guerrilla gardeners in London encounter the police.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060628013749/http://www.gb0063551.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/guerrilla/ Allotmenteering] Reflections on Guerrilla Gardening and Allotmenteering\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021822/http://www.heavypetal.ca/archives/2007/04/operation_moss_graffiti.html Moss Graffiti] How to make moss graffiti\n* [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2008/apr/25/seedbombing Domestic Seed Bomb production] Richard Reynolds demonstrates the Californian method of seed bomb making.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081202172546/http://makesomethinghappen.net/2008/07/10/mshcast-5-erik-knutzen-guerrilla-gardening-and-urban-homesteading/ Interview with the author of Urban Homestead]- Erik Knutzen discusses guerrilla gardening and other collective action.\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/food/archive/2010/05/saving-the-world-with-che-mao-and-carrots/56557/ Saving the World with Che, Mao, and Carrots] - Review of ''On Guerrilla Gardening'' by Richard Reynolds for ''The Atlantic''\n* [http://www.wikihow.com/Start-Guerrilla-Gardening Start-Guerrilla-Gardening] - Step-by-step guide\n* [http://www.ag-moos.at/ Aktionsgruppe Moos] - Guerrilla Gardeners from Vienna, Austria\n* [http://cafe.naver.com/ggmovement \uac8c\ub9b4\ub77c\uac00\ub4dc\ub2dd] The community for guerrilla gardeners in Korea\n\n{{Horticulture and gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Community building]]\n[[Category:DIY culture]]\n[[Category:Environmentalism]]\n[[Category:Horticulture and gardening]]\n[[Category:Urban agriculture]]\n[[Category:Guerrilla gardening]]\n[[Category:Biophilia hypothesis]]\n", "name_user": "Bonusbox", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:Add Tactical urbanism, related", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_gardening"}

It was one of the most recognizable landmarks in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter the Hardie family enlarged the property and sold it in 1924, ownership transferred once more before the home's final resident, Dr. Ida Finkelstein Fattel, sold it to the city of New Orleans for $215,000 in 1990. Due to its architectural significance, the New Orleans Historic Districts/Landmarks Commission designated the home a historic landmark under the name of Hardie-Fattel House in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterresearch.org/pre-katrina/orleans/3/63/snapshot.html|title=Broadmoor Neighborhood Snapshot|website=www.datacenterresearch.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\nThe home opened as the Broad Branch of the New Orleans Public Library in November 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/qbranch.htm|title=NOPL Centennial Exhibit: Extension|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Rosa Keller Dedication ==\nThe branch was named in honour of civil rights advocate and New Orleans Public Library pioneer, Rosa Freeman Keller in October of 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/keller/rosa.htm|title=Rosa Keller Branch Dedication New Orleans Public Library|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>. \n\nRosa Freeman Keller was born in New Orleans in 1911.

It stands on the corner of Napoleon Avenue and South Broad Street\nwhich serve as the north/south, east/west markers in the neighborhood. The library is a branch of\nthe greater [[New Orleans Public Library System]]. The Broadmoor branch serves as one of the only\ncenters for community engagement in the neighborhood and hosts adult education classes, art\nworkshops, after-school activities for children, and community events throughout the year. It\nopened its doors on March 17, 2012.\n\n==Early history==\nThe original building housing the Rosa F. Keller Library served as a private family residence for many years before being sold to the city in 1990. One of the first homes in the area, Mrs. Ethel Aubert Hardie purchased the eight-room stucco home after its completion in 1918 at a cost of $9500. It was one of the most recognizable landmarks in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter the Hardie family enlarged the property and sold it in 1924, ownership transferred once more before the home's final resident, Dr. Ida Finkelstein Fattel, sold it to the city of New Orleans for $215,000 in 1990. Due to its architectural significance, the New Orleans Historic Districts/Landmarks Commission designated the home a historic landmark under the name of Hardie-Fattel House in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterresearch.org/pre-katrina/orleans/3/63/snapshot.html|title=Broadmoor Neighborhood Snapshot|website=www.datacenterresearch.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\nThe home opened as the Broad Branch of the New Orleans Public Library in November 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/qbranch.htm|title=NOPL Centennial Exhibit: Extension|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Rosa Keller Dedication ==\nThe branch was named in honour of civil rights advocate and New Orleans Public Library pioneer, Rosa Freeman Keller in October of 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/keller/rosa.htm|title=Rosa Keller Branch Dedication New Orleans Public Library|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>. \n\nRosa Freeman Keller was born in New Orleans in 1911.

She also received an honorary alumnus degree from Newcomb College and an honorary doctorate from [http://www.dillard.edu/ Dillard University]. She died in '''April 15, 1998''', in New Orleans.

A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor [[Eli Whitney]] in 1793 and patented in 1794. \n\nWhitney's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the [[Slavery in the United States|growth of slavery]] in the [[Confederate States of America|American South]] as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased. The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=WarCause/> Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws, and offer far higher productivity than their hand-powered precursors.<ref name=AboutGin>[http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/cotton_gin_2.htm inventors.about.com]; \"Background on the Cotton Gin\", retrieved October 22, 2010.</ref>\n\nEli Whitney invented his cotton gin in 1793. He began to work on this project after moving to Georgia in search of work. Given that farmers were desperately searching for a way to make cotton farming profitable, a woman named [[Catharine Littlefield Greene|Catharine Greene]] provided Whitney with funding to create the first cotton gin. Whitney created two cotton gins: a small one that could be hand-cranked and a large one that could be driven by a horse or water power.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Cotton gin harpers.jpg|thumb|\"The First Cotton Gin\", an engraving from ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', 1869.

Many simple seed-removing devices had been invented, but until the innovation of the cotton gin, most required significant operator attention and worked only on a small scale.<ref>Bellis, Mary. [http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/cotton_gin.htm inventors.about.com]; \"The Cotton Gin and Eli Whitney\", retrieved March 12, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Early cotton gins===\nThe earliest versions of the cotton gin consisted of a single roller made of iron or wood and a flat piece of stone or wood. The earliest evidence of the cotton gin is found in the fifth century, in the form of [[Buddhist]] paintings depicting a single-roller gin in the [[Ajanta Caves]] in western [[India]].<ref name=LakGin/> These early gins were difficult to use and required a great deal of skill. A narrow single roller was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds. The design was similar to that of a [[metate|mealing stone]], which was used to grind grain. The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous, because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin's parts for other tools.<ref name=LakGin>[[#Lakwete|Lakwete]], 1\u20136.</ref>\n\nBetween the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water power.<ref name=Baber1>Baber, Zaheer (1996). ''The Science of Empire: Scientific Knowledge, Civilization, and Colonial Rule in India''.

With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.<ref>[[Karl Marx]] (1867). Chapter 16: \"Machinery and Large-Scale Industry\". ''[[Das Kapital]]''.</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe Indian roller cotton gin, known as the ''churka'' or ''charkha'', was introduced to the United States in the mid-18th century, when it was adopted in the [[southern United States]]. The device was adopted for cleaning [[long-staple cotton]], but was not suitable for the [[short-staple cotton]] that was more common in certain states such as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Several modifications were made to the Indian roller gin by Mr. Krebs in 1772 and Joseph Eve in 1788, but their uses remained limited to the long-staple variety, up until Eli Whitney's development of a short-staple cotton gin in 1793.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hargrett|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Dobbs|first2=Chris|title=Cotton Gins|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/cotton-gins|website=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|date=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Eli Whitney's patent===\n[[Image:Patent for Cotton Gin (1794) - hi res.jpg|thumb|Eli Whitney's original cotton gin patent, dated March 14, 1794]]\n[[Eli Whitney]] (1765\u20131825) applied for a [[patent]] of his cotton gin on October 28, 1793; the patent was granted on March 14, 1794, but was not validated until 1807.

The popular image of Whitney inventing the cotton gin is attributed to an article on the subject written in the early 1870s and later reprinted in 1910 in ''The Library of Southern Literature''. In this article, the author claimed [[Catharine Littlefield Greene]] suggested to Whitney the use of a brush-like component instrumental in separating out the seeds and cotton.

They included steam power instead of animal power, an automatic feeder to assure that the gin stand ran smoothly, a condenser to make the clean cotton coming out of the gin easier to handle, and indoor presses so that cotton no longer had to be carried across the gin yard to be baled.<ref>Aiken, Charles S.

Cities such as [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Mobile, Alabama]]; [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; and [[Galveston, Texas]] became major shipping ports, deriving substantial economic benefit from cotton raised throughout the South. Additionally, the greatly expanded supply of cotton created strong demand for textile machinery and improved machine designs that replaced wooden parts with metal. This led to the invention of many [[machine tool]]s in the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>\n\nThe invention of the cotton gin caused massive growth in the production of cotton in the United States, concentrated mostly in the South. Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850.  As a result, the region became even more dependent on [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] and [[slavery]], with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pierson, Parke |url=http://www.historynet.com/seeds-of-conflict.htm|title=Seeds of conflict|journal=America's Civil War|date=September 2009|volume=22|issue= 4|page=25}}</ref> While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.<ref>Woods, Robert (September 1, 2009). \"A Turn of the Crank Started the Civil War.\" ''Mechanical Engineering''.</ref> The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production, increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, N.

Cotton arriving at the gin is sucked in via a pipe, approximately {{convert|16|in|cm}} in diameter, that is swung over the cotton. This pipe is usually manually operated, but is increasingly automated in modern cotton plants. The need for trailers to haul the product to the gin has been drastically reduced since the introduction of modules. If the cotton is shipped in modules, the module feeder breaks the modules apart using spiked rollers and extracts the largest pieces of foreign material from the cotton. The module feeder's loose cotton is then sucked into the same starting point as the trailer cotton.\n\nThe cotton then enters a dryer, which removes excess moisture. The cylinder cleaner uses six or seven rotating, spiked cylinders to break up large clumps of cotton.  Finer foreign material, such as soil and leaves, passes through rods or screens for removal.  The stick machine uses [[centrifugal force]] to remove larger foreign matter, such as sticks and burrs, while the cotton is held by rapidly rotating saw cylinders.\n\nThe gin stand uses the teeth of rotating saws to pull the cotton through a series of \"ginning ribs\", which pull the fibers from the seeds which are too large to pass through the ribs. The cleaned seed is then removed from the gin via an [[auger conveyor]] system. The seed is reused for planting or is sent to an [[oil mill]] to be further processed into cottonseed oil and cottonseed meal. The lint cleaners again use saws and grid bars, this time to separate immature seeds and any remaining foreign matter from the fibers.  The bale press then compresses the cotton into bales for storage and shipping. Modern gins can process up to {{convert|15|t|lb}} of cotton per hour.\n\nModern cotton gins create a substantial amount of cotton gin residue (CGR) consisting of sticks, leaves, dirt, immature bolls, and cottonseed. Research is currently under way to investigate the use of this waste in producing [[ethanol]]. Due to fluctuations in the chemical composition in processing, there is difficulty in creating a consistent ethanol process, but there is potential to further maximize the utilization of waste in the cotton production.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals|first1=Foster A.|last1=Agblevor|first2=Sandra|last2=Batz|first3=Jessica|last3=Trumbo|date=February 3, 2018|publisher=Humana Press, Totowa, NJ|pages=219\u2013230|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0057-4_17|chapter = Composition and Ethanol Production Potential of Cotton Gin Residues|isbn = 978-1-4612-6592-4}}</ref><ref name=AboutGin/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prattville Gin Factory]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|ref=Lakwete|author=Lakwete, Angela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOMaGVnPfBcC |title=Inventing the Cotton Gin: Machine and Myth in Antebellum America|place= Baltimore|publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2003|isbn=9780801873942}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Cotton gins}}\n{{Library resources box|onlinebooks=yes}}\n* [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=5260 Overview of a Cotton Gin] \u2013 [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] site\n* [http://www.cotton.org/pubs/cottoncounts/story/index.cfm The Story of Cotton] \u2013 National Cotton Council of America site\n* [http://www.cotton.org/ncga/index.cfm National Cotton Ginners Association]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060502202031/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/phillips.cottongin US Cotton Gin Industry] \u2013 EH.Net Encyclopedia of Economic History\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822170927/http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/articleview.cfm?aid=31 Invention of Cotton Gin] \u2013 eHistory.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170614194219/http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/botany/botany_map/articles/article_30.html Cotton: the fiber of life] \u2013 includes a schematic diagram illustrating the seed removal process\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMZg2kLLs-Q Video of manual cotton gin in operation] via [[YouTube]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cotton Gin}}\n[[Category:Cotton gin| ]]\n[[Category:1793 introductions]]\n[[Category:Agricultural machinery]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Cotton production]]\n[[Category:Indian inventions]]\n[[Category:Slavery in the United States]]\n[[Category:Textile machinery]]\n[[Category:Ancient inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Machine that separates cotton fibers from seeds}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2013}}\n[[Image:Cotton gin EWM 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|A model of a 19th-century cotton gin on display at the [[Eli Whitney Museum]] in [[Hamden, Connecticut]]]] \n\nA '''cotton gin''' &ndash; meaning \"cotton engine\" &ndash; is a machine that quickly and easily separates [[cotton]] fibers from their seeds, enabling much greater productivity than manual cotton separation.<ref name=\"Roe1916\">{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

A narrow single roller was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds. The design was similar to that of a [[metate|mealing stone]], which was used to grind grain.

It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins, and, when powered by one horse, produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shofner|first1=Jerrel H.|last2=Rogers|first2=William Warren|title=Sea Island Cotton in Ante-Bellum Florida|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|date=April 1962|volume=40|issue=4|pages=378\u201379}}</ref> The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint. Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate. In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade. These descendants of the McCarthy gin are the only gins now used for extra-long staple cotton in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gillum|first1=Marvis M.|last2=Van Doorn|first2=D.

They included steam power instead of animal power, an automatic feeder to assure that the gin stand ran smoothly, a condenser to make the clean cotton coming out of the gin easier to handle, and indoor presses so that cotton no longer had to be carried across the gin yard to be baled.<ref>Aiken, Charles S. (April 1973). \"The Evolution of Cotton Ginning in the Southeastern United States\". Geographical Review. 63 (2): 205.</ref> Then, in 1879, while he was running his father's gin in [[Rutersville, Texas]], [[Robert S. Munger]] invented additional system ginning techniques. Robert and his wife, Mary Collett, later moved to [[Mexia, Texas]], built a system gin, and obtained related patents.<ref> Mann, Sally (2016). Hold still : a memoir with photographs.

Aiken has termed the second ginning revolution, in which the privately owned plantation gins were replaced by large-scale public ginneries. This revolution, in turn, led to a major restructuring of the cotton gin industry, as the small, scattered gin factories and shops of the nineteenth century gave way to a dwindling number of large twentieth-century corporations designing and constructing entire ginning operations.\"<ref> Phillips, William (1994). \"Making a Business of It: The Evolution of Southern Cotton Gin Patenting, 1831-1890\".

[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24411 teachinghistory.org], \"The Disaster of Innovation\", retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref> With Eli Whitney's gin, cotton became a tremendously profitable business, creating many fortunes in the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|Antebellum South]]. Cities such as [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[Mobile, Alabama]]; [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; and [[Galveston, Texas]] became major shipping ports, deriving substantial economic benefit from cotton raised throughout the South. Additionally, the greatly expanded supply of cotton created strong demand for textile machinery and improved machine designs that replaced wooden parts with metal. This led to the invention of many [[machine tool]]s in the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>\n\nThe invention of the cotton gin caused massive growth in the production of cotton in the United States, concentrated mostly in the South. Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850.  As a result, the region became even more dependent on [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] and [[slavery]], with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pierson, Parke |url=http://www.historynet.com/seeds-of-conflict.htm|title=Seeds of conflict|journal=America's Civil War|date=September 2009|volume=22|issue= 4|page=25}}</ref> While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.<ref>Woods, Robert (September 1, 2009). \"A Turn of the Crank Started the Civil War.\" ''Mechanical Engineering''.</ref> The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production, increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, N.

Cotton arriving at the gin is sucked in via a pipe, approximately {{convert|16|in|cm}} in diameter, that is swung over the cotton. This pipe is usually manually operated, but is increasingly automated in modern cotton plants. The need for trailers to haul the product to the gin has been drastically reduced since the introduction of modules. If the cotton is shipped in modules, the module feeder breaks the modules apart using spiked rollers and extracts the largest pieces of foreign material from the cotton. The module feeder's loose cotton is then sucked into the same starting point as the trailer cotton.\n\nThe cotton then enters a dryer, which removes excess moisture. The cylinder cleaner uses six or seven rotating, spiked cylinders to break up large clumps of cotton.  Finer foreign material, such as soil and leaves, passes through rods or screens for removal.  The stick machine uses [[centrifugal force]] to remove larger foreign matter, such as sticks and burrs, while the cotton is held by rapidly rotating saw cylinders.\n\nThe gin stand uses the teeth of rotating saws to pull the cotton through a series of \"ginning ribs\", which pull the fibers from the seeds which are too large to pass through the ribs. The cleaned seed is then removed from the gin via an [[auger conveyor]] system. The seed is reused for planting or is sent to an [[oil mill]] to be further processed into cottonseed oil and cottonseed meal. The lint cleaners again use saws and grid bars, this time to separate immature seeds and any remaining foreign matter from the fibers.  The bale press then compresses the cotton into bales for storage and shipping. Modern gins can process up to {{convert|15|t|lb}} of cotton per hour.\n\nModern cotton gins create a substantial amount of cotton gin residue (CGR) consisting of sticks, leaves, dirt, immature bolls, and cottonseed. Research is currently under way to investigate the use of this waste in producing [[ethanol]]. Due to fluctuations in the chemical composition in processing, there is difficulty in creating a consistent ethanol process, but there is potential to further maximize the utilization of waste in the cotton production.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals|first1=Foster A.|last1=Agblevor|first2=Sandra|last2=Batz|first3=Jessica|last3=Trumbo|date=February 3, 2018|publisher=Humana Press, Totowa, NJ|pages=219\u2013230|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0057-4_17|chapter = Composition and Ethanol Production Potential of Cotton Gin Residues|isbn = 978-1-4612-6592-4}}</ref><ref name=AboutGin/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prattville Gin Factory]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book|ref=Lakwete|author=Lakwete, Angela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOMaGVnPfBcC |title=Inventing the Cotton Gin: Machine and Myth in Antebellum America|place= Baltimore|publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2003|isbn=9780801873942}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Cotton gins}}\n{{Library resources box|onlinebooks=yes}}\n* [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=5260 Overview of a Cotton Gin] \u2013 [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] site\n* [http://www.cotton.org/pubs/cottoncounts/story/index.cfm The Story of Cotton] \u2013 National Cotton Council of America site\n* [http://www.cotton.org/ncga/index.cfm National Cotton Ginners Association]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060502202031/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/phillips.cottongin US Cotton Gin Industry] \u2013 EH.Net Encyclopedia of Economic History\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822170927/http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/articleview.cfm?aid=31 Invention of Cotton Gin] \u2013 eHistory.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170614194219/http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/botany/botany_map/articles/article_30.html Cotton: the fiber of life] \u2013 includes a schematic diagram illustrating the seed removal process\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMZg2kLLs-Q Video of manual cotton gin in operation] via [[YouTube]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cotton Gin}}\n[[Category:Cotton gin| ]]\n[[Category:1793 introductions]]\n[[Category:Agricultural machinery]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Cotton production]]\n[[Category:Indian inventions]]\n[[Category:Slavery in the United States]]\n[[Category:Textile machinery]]\n[[Category:Ancient inventions]]\n", "name_user": "Ariana Osborne", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin"}
