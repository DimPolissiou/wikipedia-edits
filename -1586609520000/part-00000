It seeks to give the general public the power to  recall any member of the parliament and it wishes to decrease the total number of seats within the National Council from 150 to 100. Additionally, it wants to introduce a flat tax rate of 15% and stop the financing of campaigns for political parties from the state budget.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.naseslovensko.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Volebn%C3%BD-program-2016.pdf |title=Program |website=www.naseslovensko.net}}</ref>\n\nThe party sees the [[EU]] and [[NATO]] as \"undermining the sovereignty of the Slovak nation\", and wants to leave these organizations in order to \"give Slovakia complete [[sovereignty]] and not be part of [[United States war crimes|American war crimes]] and a toy in the hands of foreign superpowers\". \u013dSNS also advocates the investigation of foreign [[NGOs]] for possible corruption or unlawful activity, forcing opposition news outlets to be classified as \"foreign agents\", and to \"liberate Slovakia from the slavery of foreign bankers\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nAs for internal security, the party wants to establish a home guard with the intention of protecting the people in areas  where legitimate police forces are not adequate at stopping \"Gypsy extremists\" who \"steal, rape and murder\" the \"decent people\", while also advocating the arming of the populace for the protection of personal life and private property. The party also wants to make politicians responsible for any criminal or corrupt activity they partake in while being a public servant and to be punished accordingly. In addition, \u013dSNS also intends to make police forces undergo training in illegal settlements inhabited by the resident Romani populace and demolish any illegal structures, whether they are \"black settlements\" or \"palaces of the rich\". The party seeks to re-establish border control on each segment of the country's borders and give the parliament the ability to use the army to secure and patrol these borders if necessary.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nDue to the country's armed forces being small and ill-prepared as a result of conscription being abolished, \u013dSNS sees it as necessary to modernize, renew, and increase the size of the Slovak Armed Forces to be able to \"effectively protect the nation from any foreign threats when it leaves NATO\", to prevent the \"hordes of Muslim immigrants\" from coming to Slovakia, and to protect [[Christianity]] and [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] from \"Islamization\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party plans to give jobs to the long-term unemployed through public works programmes. These jobs would consist of the maintenance of roads, schools, national memorials, hospitals and construction of housing as part of their social policy. The retirement age would be lowered to 60 years and the government would increase financial benefits for mothers with children, with rentable housing being provided to \"law-abiding and decent families\" and benefits to \"non-working gypsy thieves\" and \"asocials\" being cancelled.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party also seeks to nationalize the health care system in order to provide universal comprehensive healthcare for the citizens of Slovakia, as written in the Constitution of Slovakia, and to create one national health insurance organization. Additionally, the party wants to return to a centralized emergency service and to make sure that every ambulance has a physician on board to administer appropriate medical care. Furthermore, the party wants to indoctrinate children with traditionalist and fundamentalist Christian values, to \"protect them from violent media\", and to ban the operation of gambling machines in the country, while supporting and subsidizing domestic culture and artists to prevent Slovakia from \"descending into a degenerate society made up by [[consumerism]], [[secularism]] and empty [[liberalism]]\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party also seeks to subsidize tertiary education through taxes and eliminate college tuition, effectively introducing free college in Slovakia. In regards to the banking sector, the party intends to nationalize all private banks in the country  and create one state-run central bank under the control of the government. The party also wants to nationalize all strategic industries of the country, such as powerplants, steel and automobile manufacturing, mining, agriculture, railways, or public transport. The party wants to assure energy and food self-sufficiency to make the country less dependent on imports, by rebuilding the agricultural industry and placing a strong emphasis on locally produced goods. In addition, the party seeks to get rid of bureaucracy and red tape in business to increase growth of domestic companies.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party rejects the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership|TTIP agreement]], advocates a departure from the [[European Monetary Union]], and seeks to re-establish the previous currency, the [[Slovak koruna]], in order to give the state and the central bank authority to decide on the country's monetary policy. Moreover, the party advocates for the protection of the environment from pollution and exploitation by implementing conservationist laws and regulation and supporting the research and development of [[renewable energy]].<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\n\u013dSNS has also made proposals in parliament for the banning of abortion conducted in the second and third trimester and contraception in Slovakia, and is staunchly opposed to LGBT rights, denouncing the LGBT community as freaks and perverts and pushing for an active crackdown on homosexual activists and media, and the party also supports a constitutional ban on LGBT partnerships.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party is vocally opposed to liberalism and [[Atlanticism]], and harbours strong anti-establishment sentiment, rejecting the standard left-right classification and positions itself as a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] movement. Other policies include opposition to gun control, rejection of same-sex marriages, banning abortions conducted after the third month of pregnancy, withholding of welfare funds for those who refuse to work, ending the financing of NGOs and protesting NATO convoys going through Slovakia. In 2019, the party resumed its notorious campaign to collect enough petition signatures to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\n== Views on Roma and migrants ==\nThe party sees and describes the unintegrated groups of [[Romani people]] as being a drain on the social security system due to large Roma families receiving a higher amount of benefits for children compared to ethnic Slovaks. This especially applies to illegal Roma settlements, where these \"gypsy extremists\", as the party calls them, often reside in. Occasionally, the party has said that it wants to crackdown on \"Gypsy terror\" and uses the [[Kr\u00e1sna H\u00f4rka Castle]] fire of 2012 as an example of \"gypsy criminality\", whilst using rhetoric that describes the \"gypsy extremists\" as \"social parasites\" and \"extremists that steal, rape and murder decent people\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nAccording to the party, immigrants from third world countries are \"invaders who are supported by [[globalists]] to destroy the old continent of Europe\".

It seeks to give the general public the power to  recall any member of the parliament and it wishes to decrease the total number of seats within the National Council from 150 to 100. Additionally, it wants to introduce a flat tax rate of 15% and stop the financing of campaigns for political parties from the state budget.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.naseslovensko.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Volebn%C3%BD-program-2016.pdf |title=Program |website=www.naseslovensko.net}}</ref>\n\nThe party sees the [[EU]] and [[NATO]] as \"undermining the sovereignty of the Slovak nation\", and wants to leave these organizations in order to \"give Slovakia complete [[sovereignty]] and not be part of [[United States war crimes|American war crimes]] and a toy in the hands of foreign superpowers\". \u013dSNS also advocates the investigation of foreign [[NGOs]] for possible corruption or unlawful activity, forcing opposition news outlets to be classified as \"foreign agents\", and to \"liberate Slovakia from the slavery of foreign bankers\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nAs for internal security, the party wants to establish a home guard with the intention of protecting the people in areas  where legitimate police forces are not adequate at stopping \"Gypsy extremists\" who \"steal, rape and murder\" the \"decent people\", while also advocating the arming of the populace for the protection of personal life and private property. The party also wants to make politicians responsible for any criminal or corrupt activity they partake in while being a public servant and to be punished accordingly. In addition, \u013dSNS also intends to make police forces undergo training in illegal settlements inhabited by the resident Romani populace and demolish any illegal structures, whether they are \"black settlements\" or \"palaces of the rich\". The party seeks to re-establish border control on each segment of the country's borders and give the parliament the ability to use the army to secure and patrol these borders if necessary.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nDue to the country's armed forces being small and ill-prepared as a result of conscription being abolished, \u013dSNS sees it as necessary to modernize, renew, and increase the size of the Slovak Armed Forces to be able to \"effectively protect the nation from any foreign threats when it leaves NATO\", to prevent the \"hordes of Muslim immigrants\" from coming to Slovakia, and to protect [[Christianity]] and [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] from \"Islamization\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party plans to give jobs to the long-term unemployed through public works programmes. These jobs would consist of the maintenance of roads, schools, national memorials, hospitals and construction of housing as part of their social policy. The retirement age would be lowered to 60 years and the government would increase financial benefits for mothers with children, with rentable housing being provided to \"law-abiding and decent families\" and benefits to \"non-working gypsy thieves\" and \"asocials\" being cancelled.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party also seeks to nationalize the health care system in order to provide universal comprehensive healthcare for the citizens of Slovakia, as written in the Constitution of Slovakia, and to create one national health insurance organization. Additionally, the party wants to return to a centralized emergency service and to make sure that every ambulance has a physician on board to administer appropriate medical care. Furthermore, the party wants to indoctrinate children with traditionalist and fundamentalist Christian values, to \"protect them from violent media\", and to ban the operation of gambling machines in the country, while supporting and subsidizing domestic culture and artists to prevent Slovakia from \"descending into a degenerate society made up by [[consumerism]], [[secularism]] and empty [[liberalism]]\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party also seeks to subsidize tertiary education through taxes and eliminate college tuition, effectively introducing free college in Slovakia. In regards to the banking sector, the party intends to nationalize all private banks in the country  and create one state-run central bank under the control of the government. The party also wants to nationalize all strategic industries of the country, such as powerplants, steel and automobile manufacturing, mining, agriculture, railways, or public transport. The party wants to assure energy and food self-sufficiency to make the country less dependent on imports, by rebuilding the agricultural industry and placing a strong emphasis on locally produced goods. In addition, the party seeks to get rid of bureaucracy and red tape in business to increase growth of domestic companies.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party rejects the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership|TTIP agreement]], advocates a departure from the [[European Monetary Union]], and seeks to re-establish the previous currency, the [[Slovak koruna]], in order to give the state and the central bank authority to decide on the country's monetary policy. Moreover, the party advocates for the protection of the environment from pollution and exploitation by implementing conservationist laws and regulation and supporting the research and development of [[renewable energy]].<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\n\u013dSNS has also made proposals in parliament for the banning of abortion conducted in the second and third trimester and contraception in Slovakia, and is staunchly opposed to LGBT rights, denouncing the LGBT community as freaks and perverts and pushing for an active crackdown on homosexual activists and media, and the party also supports a constitutional ban on LGBT partnerships.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nThe party is vocally opposed to liberalism and [[Atlanticism]], and harbours strong anti-establishment sentiment, rejecting the standard left-right classification and positions itself as a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] movement. Other policies include opposition to gun control, rejection of same-sex marriages, banning abortions conducted after the third month of pregnancy, withholding of welfare funds for those who refuse to work, ending the financing of NGOs and protesting NATO convoys going through Slovakia. In 2019, the party resumed its notorious campaign to collect enough petition signatures to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\n== Views on Roma and migrants ==\nThe party sees and describes the unintegrated groups of [[Romani people]] as being a drain on the social security system due to large Roma families receiving a higher amount of benefits for children compared to ethnic Slovaks. This especially applies to illegal Roma settlements, where these \"gypsy extremists\", as the party calls them, often reside in. Occasionally, the party has said that it wants to crackdown on \"Gypsy terror\" and uses the [[Kr\u00e1sna H\u00f4rka Castle]] fire of 2012 as an example of \"gypsy criminality\", whilst using rhetoric that describes the \"gypsy extremists\" as \"social parasites\" and \"extremists that steal, rape and murder decent people\".<ref name=\"naseslovensko.net\"/>\n\nAccording to the party, immigrants from third world countries are \"invaders who are supported by [[globalists]] to destroy the old continent of Europe\".

The locality of the tale was not given.<ref name=yanagita1952/>\n\nThe version given by [[Algernon Bertram Freeman Mitford|A. B. Mitford]] in 1871 \"'''The Elves and the Envious Neighbour'''\" features two men with a wen on the forehead, and the second visitor earns another wen on top of his own. And it was not because of poor dancing or companionship, just mistaken identity. Mitford\"s version also concludes with a moral against envy.<ref name=mitford1871/>\n\n=== Analogue ===\n\n[[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]] noticed that the Japanese \"Kobutori\" tale was analogous to the Irish \"[[The Legend of Knockgrafton]]\", reporting his finding in 1875, though this was not printed for the public at large until 1885.<ref name=goodwin/> The Irish had been published by [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] in 1824 or 1825, and Goodwin first noticed the similarity after reading Mitford's brief version of the Japanese tale, but subsequently obtained a fuller version of the story which he printed in his paper.<ref name=goodwin/> The resemblance of \"The Legend of Knockgrafton\" to  the Japanese folktale was also noted by [[Joseph Jacobs]] in 1894.<ref name=jacobs/>\n\n== Explantory notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=fraser><!--[[Lucy Fraser]] redirects to Frazer-->Fraser, Lucy. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=pLReDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT10 Foreword]\" in Ozaki, Yei Theodora (2018).

Here the man explicitly \"made his living gathering [[firewood]]\". The medieval concludes with a one-liner moral cautioning against envy.<ref name=shirane/>\n\n===Variants===\nA variant called {{nihongo|The tumor doubled|\u7624\u4e8c\u3064|Kobu futatsu}}, where the protagonist priest has a [[tumor]] over the eye, was collected by [[Kunio Yanagita]]. The locality of the tale was not given.<ref name=yanagita1952/>\n\nThe version given by [[Algernon Bertram Freeman Mitford|A. B. Mitford]] in 1871 \"'''The Elves and the Envious Neighbour'''\" features two men with a wen on the forehead, and the second visitor earns another wen on top of his own. And it was not because of poor dancing or companionship, just mistaken identity. Mitford\"s version also concludes with a moral against envy.<ref name=mitford1871/>\n\n=== Analogue ===\n\n[[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]] noticed that the Japanese \"Kobutori\" tale was analogous to the Irish \"[[The Legend of Knockgrafton]]\", reporting his finding in 1875, though this was not printed for the public at large until 1885.<ref name=goodwin/> The Irish had been published by [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] in 1824 or 1825, and Goodwin first noticed the similarity after reading Mitford's brief version of the Japanese tale, but subsequently obtained a fuller version of the story which he printed in his paper.<ref name=goodwin/> The resemblance of \"The Legend of Knockgrafton\" to  the Japanese folktale was also noted by [[Joseph Jacobs]] in 1894.<ref name=jacobs/>\n\n== Explantory notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=fraser><!--[[Lucy Fraser]] redirects to Frazer-->Fraser, Lucy. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=pLReDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT10 Foreword]\" in Ozaki, Yei Theodora (2018).
