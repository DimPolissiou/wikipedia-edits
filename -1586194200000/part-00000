Many people claimed to have been healed after he had passed magnets ([[lodestone]]s) over their bodies.\n\n=== Valentine Greatrakes ===\nAn Irishman by the name of [[Valentine Greatrakes]] (1628\u20131682) was known as \"the Great Irish Stroker\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Barbara Beigun|date=1982-06-01|title=Greatrakes the Stroker: The Interpretations of His Contemporaries|journal=Isis|volume=73|issue=2|pages=178\u201385|doi=10.1086/352968|issn=0021-1753}}</ref> for his ability to heal people by laying his hands on them and passing magnets over their bodies.\n\n=== Johann Joseph Gassner ===\n[[Johann Joseph Gassner]] (1727\u20131779), a Catholic priest of the time, believed that disease was caused by evil spirits and could be exorcised by incantations and prayer.\n\n=== Father Maximilian Hell ===\nAround 1771, a Viennese Jesuit named [[Maximilian Hell]] (1720\u20131792) was using magnets to heal by applying steel plates to the naked body.  One of Father Hell's students was a young medical doctor from Vienna named Franz Anton Mesmer.\n\n=== Franz Anton Mesmer ===\n[[Image:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Franz Anton Mesmer|Mesmer]]]]\nWestern scientists first became involved in hypnosis around 1770, when [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734\u20131815), a physician from Austria, started investigating an effect he called \"[[animal magnetism]]\" or \"[[mesmerism]]\" (the latter name still remaining popular today).\n\nThe use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magn\u00e9tisme animal''' can be misleading and needs to be seen in this context:\n* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to at the time as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.\n* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of animals, including humans.\n\nMesmer developed his own theory and was himself inspired by the writings of the English physician [[Richard Mead]], the father of our understanding of [[transmissible diseases]]. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient's vein and letting the patient bleed for a while, passing magnets over the wound appeared to be an active force making the bleeding stop.  Mesmer additionally discovered that using a stick instead also \"worked.\"\n\nAfter moving to Paris and becoming popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the medical community challenged him.  The French king put together a Board of Inquiry that included chemist [[Lavoisier]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control named [[Joseph Ignace Guillotin]]. Mesmer refused to cooperate with the investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d'Eslon. Franklin constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been \"magnetised\" by d'Eslon. This  is considered perhaps the first placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination.<ref>H.F. Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'', Basic Books, 1980.</ref>\n\nAlthough Mesmerism remained popular and \"magnetic therapies\" are still advertised as a form of \"alternative medicine\" even today, Mesmer himself retired to Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.\n\n=== Abb\u00e9 Faria ===\n[[Image:AbaDeFaria.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Abb\u00e9 Faria]]]]\nMany of the original mesmerists were signatories to the first declarations that proclaimed the French revolution in 1789. Far from surprising, this could perhaps be expected, in that mesmerism opened up the prospect that the social order was in some sense [[suggestion|suggested]] and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during the Revolution and the Empire.\n\nAn Indo-[[Portugal|Portuguese]] priest,  [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]], revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early 19th century, [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]] introduced [[oriental hypnosis]] to Paris. Faria came from [[India]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hypnosis at its Bicentennial|last=Perry|first=Campbell|date=1978|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-1461328612|editor-last=D.P.M|editor-first=Fred H.

Faria's approach was significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] and [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]] of the [[Nancy School]]. Faria's theoretical position, and the subsequent experiences of those in the Nancy School, made significant contributions to the later [[autosuggestion]] techniques of [[\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9]] and the [[autogenic training]] techniques of [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]].\n[[Image:De Puysegur.JPG|thumb|right|70px|[[Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur|De Puys\u00e9gur]]]]\n\n=== Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur ===\nA student of Mesmer, [[Marquis de Puys\u00e9gur]], first described and coined the term for \"[[somnambulism]].\"\n\nFollowers of Puys\u00e9gur called themselves \"Experimentalists\" and believed in the [[Paracelsus]]-[[Mesmer]] fluidism theory.\n\n=== R\u00e9camier and Reichenbach ===\n[[Image:Karl Reichenbach.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Karl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]]]]\nR\u00e9camier, in 1821, prior to the development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used something resembling [[hypnoanesthesia]] and operated on patients under mesmeric coma.\n\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, [[Carl Reichenbach]] began experiments to find any scientific validity to \"mesmeric\" energy, which he called [[Odic force]] after the Norse god Odin. Although his conclusions were quickly rejected in the scientific community, they did undermine Mesmer's claims of [[mind control]].

I<br />\nmay, therefore, be said to have adopted the '''''vibratory''''' theory, whilst the<br />\nmesmerists and electro-biologists contend for the '''''emission''''' theory.

Instead, Braid adopted a skeptical position, influenced by the philosophical school of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Scottish Common Sense Realism]], attempting to explain the Mesmeric phenomena on the basis of well-established laws of psychology and physiology. Hence, Braid is regarded by many as the first true \"hypnotist\" as opposed to the Mesmerists and other magnetists who preceded him.\n\nBraid ascribed the \"mesmeric trance\" to a [[physiological]] process resulting from prolonged attention to a bright moving object or similar object of fixation. He postulated that \"protracted ocular fixation\" fatigued certain parts of the brain and caused a trance&nbsp;\u2013 a \"nervous sleep\" or \"neuro-hypnosis.\"\n\nLater Braid simplified the name to \"hypnotism\" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u1f55\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ''hypnos'', \"[[sleep]]\"). Finally, realizing that \"hypnotism\" was ''not'' a kind of sleep, he sought to change the name to \"''monoideism''\" (\"single-thought-ism\"), based on a view centred on the notion of a single, dominant idea; but the term \"hypnotism\" and its later, misleading (circa 1885) Nancy-centred derivative \"hypnosis,\" have persisted.\n\nBraid is credited with writing the first ever book on hypnotism, ''Neurypnology'' (1843).  After Braid's death in 1860, interest in hypnotism temporarily waned, and gradually shifted from Britain to France, where research began to grow, reaching its peak around the 1880s with the work of [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] and [[Jean-Martin Charcot]].\n\n====Braid on Yoga====\n\nAccording to his writings, Braid began to hear reports concerning the practices of various meditation techniques immediately after the publication of his major book on hypnotism, ''Neurypnology'' (1843).  Braid first discusses hypnotism's historical precursors in a series of articles entitled ''Magic, Mesmerism, Hypnotism, etc., Historically & Physiologically Considered''.  He draws analogies between his own practice of hypnotism and various forms of Hindu [[yoga]] meditation and other ancient spiritual practices.  Braid's interest in meditation really developed when he was introduced to the [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb|''Dabist\u0101n-i Maz\u0101hib'']], the \u201cSchool of Religions\u201d, an ancient Persian text describing a wide variety of Oriental religious practices:\n{{quote|Last May [1843], a gentleman residing in Edinburgh, personally unknown to me, who had long resided in India, favoured me with a letter expressing his approbation of the views which I had published on the nature and causes of hypnotic and mesmeric phenomena.  In corroboration of my views, he referred to what he had previously witnessed in oriental regions, and recommended me to look into the \u201cDabistan,\u201d a book lately published, for additional proof to the same effect.  On much recommendation I immediately sent for a copy of the \u201cDabistan\u201d, in which I found many statements corroborative of the fact, that the eastern saints are all self-hypnotisers, adopting means essentially the same as those which I had recommended for similar purposes.<ref>Braid, J. [http://www.ukhypnosis.com/2009/03/11/james-braid-on-hypnotic-meditation/ \"Magic, Mesmerism, Hypnotism, etc., Historically and Physiologically considered\"], 1844\u20131845, vol.

As he later wrote,\n{{quote|Inasmuch as patients can throw themselves into the nervous sleep, and manifest all the usual phenomena of Mesmerism, through their own unaided efforts, as I have so repeatedly proved by causing them to maintain a steady fixed gaze at any point, concentrating their whole mental energies on the idea of the object looked at; or that the same may arise by the patient looking at the point of his own finger, or as the Magi of Persia and Yogi of India have practised for the last 2,400 years, for religious purposes, throwing themselves into their ecstatic trances by each maintaining a steady fixed gaze at the tip of his own nose; it is obvious that there is no need for an exoteric influence to produce the phenomena of Mesmerism. [\u2026] The great object in all these processes is to induce a habit of abstraction or concentration of attention, in which the subject is entirely absorbed with one idea, or train of ideas, whilst he is unconscious of, or indifferently conscious to, every other object, purpose, or action.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/edinburghmedica152unkngoog#page/n322/mode/1up The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal] p. 306.</ref>}}\n\n=== Holy See ===\nObjections had been raised by some theologians stating that, if not applied properly, hypnosis could deprive a person of their faculty of reason. [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] specifically rebutted this, stating that \"The loss of reason is not a sin in itself but only by reason of the act by which one is deprived of the use of reason. If the act that deprives one of his use of reason is licit in itself and is done for a just cause, there is no sin; if no just cause is present, it must be considered a venial sin.\"\n\nOn 28 July 1847, a decree from the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Sacred Congregation of the Holy office]] ([[Roman Curia]]) declared that \"Having removed all misconception, foretelling of the future, explicit or implicit invocation of the devil, the use of animal magnetism (Hypnosis) is indeed merely an act of making use of physical media that are otherwise licit and hence it is not morally forbidden, provided it does not tend toward an illicit end or toward anything depraved.\"\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nHypnosis was used by field doctors in the [[American Civil War]] and was one of the first extensive medical application of hypnosis.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hypnosis for Behavioral Health: A Guide to Expanding Your Professional Practice|page=21|first=David|last=B.

''La m\u00e9thode num\u00e9rique''(\"The numerical method\") led to a number of systematic experimental examinations of hypnosis in France, Germany, and [[Switzerland]]. The process of post-hypnotic suggestion was first described in this period. Extraordinary improvements in sensory acuity and memory were reported under hypnosis.\n\nFrom the 1880s the examination of hypnosis passed from surgical doctors to mental health professionals. Charcot had led the way and his study was continued by his pupil, [[Pierre Janet]]. Janet described the theory of ''[[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]'', the  splitting of mental aspects under hypnosis (or hysteria) so skills and memory could be made inaccessible or recovered. Janet provoked interest in the subconscious and laid the framework for reintegration therapy for dissociated personalities.\n\n[[File:Une le\u00e7on clinique \u00e0 la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re.jpg|thumb|400px|Charcot demonstrating [[hypnosis]] on a \"[[hysteria|hysterical]]\" ''[[Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]]'' patient, \"Blanche\" ([[Blanche Wittmann]]), who is supported by [[Joseph Babi\u0144ski]].<ref>See: [[A Clinical Lesson at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]].</ref>]]\n\n=== Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault ===\n[[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]] (1864\u20131904), the founder of the [[Nancy School]], first wrote of the necessity for cooperation between the hypnotizer and the participant, for ''[[rapport]]''.

Much of the work of early 20th century self-help teachers (such as such as [[Norman Vincent Peale]], [[Robert H. Schuller]], and [[W. Clement Stone]]) was derived from that of Cou\u00e9.\n\n=== Boris Sidis ===\n[[Image:Boris Sidis cropped 2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Boris Sidis]]]]\n[[Boris Sidis]] (1867\u20131923), a Ukraine-born American psychologist and psychiatrist who studied under [[William James]] at [[Harvard University]], formulated this law of [[suggestion]]:\n\n:Suggestibility varies as the amount of disaggregation, and inversely as the unification of consciousness. Disaggregation refers to the split between the normal waking consciousness and the subconscious.\n\n=== Johannes Schultz ===\nThe German psychiatrist [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz|Johannes Schultz]] adapted the theories of [[Abbe Faria]] and [[Emile Cou\u00e9]] and identifying certain parallels to techniques in [[yoga]] and [[meditation]]. He called his system of self-hypnosis [[Autogenic training]].\n\n=== Gustave Le Bon ===\n[[Gustave Le Bon]]'s study of [[crowd psychology]] compared the effects of a [[leadership|leader]] of a group to hypnosis. Le Bon made use of the [[suggestibility]] concept.\n\n=== Sigmund Freud ===\nHypnosis, which at the end of the 19th century had become a popular phenomenon, in particular due to Charcot's public hypnotism sessions, was crucial in the invention of [[psychoanalysis]] by [[Sigmund Freud]], a student of Charcot. Freud later witnessed a small number of the experiments of [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault|Li\u00e9beault]] and [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] in Nancy. Back in Vienna he developed [[abreaction therapy]] using hypnosis with [[Josef Breuer]]. When Sigmund Freud discounted its use in psychiatry, in the first half of the last century, stage hypnotists kept it alive more than physicians.\n\n===Platanov and Pavlov===\nRussian medicine has had extensive experience with obstetric hypnosis. Platanov, in the 1920s, became well known for his hypno-obstetric successes. Impressed by this approach, Stalin later set up a nationwide program headed by Velvoski, who originally combined hypnosis with [[Pavlovian|Pavlov]]'s techniques, but eventually used the latter almost exclusively. [[Fernand Lamaze]], having visited Russia, brought back to France \"childbirth without pain through the psychological method,\" which in turn showed more [[Reflexology|reflexologic]] than hypnotic inspiration.\n\n=== 20th century wars ===\nThe use of hypnosis in the treatment of neuroses flourished in World War I, World War II and the [[Korean War]].  Hypnosis techniques were merged with psychiatry and was especially useful in the treatment of what is known today as [[PTSD|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== William McDougall ===\n[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (1871\u20131944), an English psychologist, treated soldiers with \"shell shock\" and criticised certain aspects of Freudian theory such as the concept of [[abreaction]].\n\n=== Clark L. Hull ===\nThe modern study of hypnotism is usually considered to have begun in the 1920s with [[Clark Leonard Hull]] (1884\u20131952) at [[Yale University]]. An experimental psychologist, his work ''Hypnosis and Suggestibility'' (1933) was a rigorous study of the phenomenon, using statistical and experimental analysis. Hull's studies emphatically demonstrated once and for all that hypnosis had no connection with sleep (\"hypnosis is not sleep, \u2026 it has no special relationship to sleep, and the whole concept of sleep when applied to hypnosis obscures the situation\").\n\nThe main result of Hull's study was to rein in the extravagant claims of hypnotists, especially regarding extraordinary improvements in cognition or the senses under hypnosis. Hull's experiments showed the reality of some classical phenomena such as mentally induced pain reduction and apparent inhibition of memory recall. However, Clark's work made clear that these effects could be achieved without hypnosis being seen as a distinct state, but rather as a result of suggestion and motivation, which was a forerunner of the behavioural approach to hypnosis. Similarly, moderate increases in certain physical capacities and changes to the threshold of sensory stimulation could be induced psychologically; attenuation effects could be especially dramatic.\n\n=== Andrew Salter ===\nIn the 1940s, [[Andrew Salter]] (1914\u20131996) introduced to American therapy the [[Pavlovian]] method of contradicting, opposing, and attacking beliefs. In the conditioned reflex, he has found what he saw as the essence of hypnosis. He thus gave a rebirth to hypnotism by combining it with [[classical conditioning]]. [[Ivan Pavlov]] had himself induced an altered state in pigeons, that he referred to as \"Cortical Inhibition,\" which some later theorists believe was some form of hypnotic state.\n\n=== British Hypnotism Act ===\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[Hypnotism Act 1952]] was instituted to regulate stage hypnotists' public entertainments.\n\n=== British Medical Association, 1955 ===\nOn 23 April 1955, the British Medical Association (BMA) approved the use of hypnosis in the areas of psychoneuroses and hypnoanesthesia in pain management in childbirth and surgery.  At this time, the BMA also advised all physicians and medical students to receive fundamental training in hypnosis. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===1956, Pope's approval of hypnosis===\nThe Roman Catholic Church banned hypnotism until the mid-20th century when, in 1956, [[Pope Pius XII]] gave his approval of hypnosis. He stated that the use of hypnosis by health care professionals for diagnosis and treatment is permitted. In an address from the Vatican on hypnosis in childbirth, the Pope gave these guidelines:\n# Hypnotism is a serious matter, and not something to dabble in.\n# In its scientific use, the precautions dictated by both science and morality must be followed.\n# Under the aspect of anaesthesia, it is governed by the same principles as other forms of anaesthesia.\n\n=== American Medical Association, 1958 ===\nIn 1958, the American Medical Association approved a report on the medical uses of hypnosis. It encouraged research on hypnosis although pointing out that some aspects of hypnosis are unknown and controversial.  However, in June 1987, the AMA's policy-making body rescinded all AMA policies from 1881\u20131958 (other than two not relating to hypnosis). {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== American Psychological Association ===\nTwo years after AMA approval, the American Psychological Association endorsed hypnosis as a branch of psychology. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Ernest Hilgard and others===\nStudies continued after the Second World War.

Although Elman had no medical training, Gil Boyne (a major teacher of hypnosis) repeatedly stated that Dave Elman trained more physicians and dentists in the use of hypnotism than anyone else in the United States.\n\nDave Elman is also known for introducing rapid inductions to the field of hypnotism.  An induction method he introduced over fifty years ago is still one of the favored inductions used by many of today's practitioners.\n\nHe placed great stress on what he called \"'''the Esdaile state'''\" or the \"hypnotic coma,\" which, according to Elman, had not been deliberately induced since Scottish surgeon [[James Esdaile]] last attained it. This was an unfortunate and historically inaccurate choice of terminology on Elman's part. [[James Esdaile|Esdaile]] never used what we now call '''''hypnosis''''' even on a single occasion; he used something loosely resembling '''''[[mesmerism]]''''' (also known as '''''[[animal magnetism]]''''').\n\n===Ormond McGill===\n[[Ormond McGill]] (1913\u20132005), stage hypnotist and hypnotherapist, was the \"Dean of American Hypnotists\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and writer of the seminal \"Encyclopedia of Genuine Stage Hypnotism\" (1947).\n\n=== U.S. definition for hypnotherapist ===\nThe U.S. (Department of Labor) Directory of Occupational Titles (D.O.T. 079.157.010) supplies the following definition:\n:\"Hypnotherapist \u2013 Induces hypnotic state in client to increase motivation or alter behavior pattern through hypnosis. Consults with client to determine the nature of problem. Prepares client to enter hypnotic states by explaining how hypnosis works and what client will experience. Tests subject to determine degrees of physical and emotional suggestibility. Induces hypnotic state in client using individualized methods and techniques of hypnosis based on interpretation of test results and analysis of client's problem.

One of Father Hell's students was a young medical doctor from Vienna named Franz Anton Mesmer.\n\n=== Franz Anton Mesmer ===\n[[Image:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Franz Anton Mesmer|Mesmer]]]]\nWestern scientists first became involved in hypnosis around 1770, when [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734\u20131815), a physician from Austria, started investigating an effect he called \"[[animal magnetism]]\" or \"[[mesmerism]]\" (the latter name still remaining popular today).\n\nThe use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magn\u00e9tisme animal''' can be misleading and needs to be seen in this context:\n* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to at the time as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.\n* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of animals, including humans.\n\nMesmer developed his own theory and was himself inspired by the writings of the English physician [[Richard Mead]], the father of our understanding of [[transmissible diseases]]. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient's vein and letting the patient bleed for a while, passing magnets over the wound appeared to be an active force making the bleeding stop.  Mesmer additionally discovered that using a stick instead also \"worked.\"\n\nAfter moving to Paris and becoming popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the medical community challenged him.  The French king put together a Board of Inquiry that included chemist [[Lavoisier]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control named [[Joseph Ignace Guillotin]]. Mesmer refused to cooperate with the investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d'Eslon. Franklin constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been \"magnetised\" by d'Eslon. This  is considered perhaps the first placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination.<ref>H.F. Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'', Basic Books, 1980.</ref>\n\nAlthough Mesmerism remained popular and \"magnetic therapies\" are still advertised as a form of \"alternative medicine\" even today, Mesmer himself retired to Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.\n\n=== Abb\u00e9 Faria ===\n[[Image:AbaDeFaria.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Abb\u00e9 Faria]]]]\nMany of the original mesmerists were signatories to the first declarations that proclaimed the French revolution in 1789. Far from surprising, this could perhaps be expected, in that mesmerism opened up the prospect that the social order was in some sense [[suggestion|suggested]] and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during the Revolution and the Empire.\n\nAn Indo-[[Portugal|Portuguese]] priest,  [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]], revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early 19th century, [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]] introduced [[oriental hypnosis]] to Paris.

Faria's approach was significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] and [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]] of the [[Nancy School]].

Although his conclusions were quickly rejected in the scientific community, they did undermine Mesmer's claims of [[mind control]].

Instead, Braid adopted a skeptical position, influenced by the philosophical school of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Scottish Common Sense Realism]], attempting to explain the Mesmeric phenomena on the basis of well-established laws of psychology and physiology. Hence, Braid is regarded by many as the first true \"hypnotist\" as opposed to the Mesmerists and other magnetists who preceded him.\n\nBraid ascribed the \"mesmeric trance\" to a [[physiological]] process resulting from prolonged attention to a bright moving object or similar object of fixation. He postulated that \"protracted ocular fixation\" fatigued certain parts of the brain and caused a trance&nbsp;\u2013 a \"nervous sleep\" or \"neuro-hypnosis.\"\n\nLater Braid simplified the name to \"hypnotism\" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u1f55\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ''hypnos'', \"[[sleep]]\"). Finally, realizing that \"hypnotism\" was ''not'' a kind of sleep, he sought to change the name to \"''monoideism''\" (\"single-thought-ism\"), based on a view centred on the notion of a single, dominant idea; but the term \"hypnotism\" and its later, misleading (circa 1885) Nancy-centred derivative \"hypnosis,\" have persisted.\n\nBraid is credited with writing the first ever book on hypnotism, ''Neurypnology'' (1843).  After Braid's death in 1860, interest in hypnotism temporarily waned, and gradually shifted from Britain to France, where research began to grow, reaching its peak around the 1880s with the work of [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] and [[Jean-Martin Charcot]].\n\n====Braid on Yoga====\n\nAccording to his writings, Braid began to hear reports concerning the practices of various meditation techniques immediately after the publication of his major book on hypnotism, ''Neurypnology'' (1843).  Braid first discusses hypnotism's historical precursors in a series of articles entitled ''Magic, Mesmerism, Hypnotism, etc., Historically & Physiologically Considered''.  He draws analogies between his own practice of hypnotism and various forms of Hindu [[yoga]] meditation and other ancient spiritual practices.  Braid\u2019s interest in meditation really developed when he was introduced to the [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb|''Dabist\u0101n-i Maz\u0101hib'']], the \u201cSchool of Religions\u201d, an ancient Persian text describing a wide variety of Oriental religious practices:\n{{quote|Last May [1843], a gentleman residing in Edinburgh, personally unknown to me, who had long resided in India, favoured me with a letter expressing his approbation of the views which I had published on the nature and causes of hypnotic and mesmeric phenomena.  In corroboration of my views, he referred to what he had previously witnessed in oriental regions, and recommended me to look into the \u201cDabistan,\u201d a book lately published, for additional proof to the same effect.  On much recommendation I immediately sent for a copy of the \u201cDabistan\u201d, in which I found many statements corroborative of the fact, that the eastern saints are all self-hypnotisers, adopting means essentially the same as those which I had recommended for similar purposes.<ref>Braid, J.

As he later wrote,\n{{quote|Inasmuch as patients can throw themselves into the nervous sleep, and manifest all the usual phenomena of Mesmerism, through their own unaided efforts, as I have so repeatedly proved by causing them to maintain a steady fixed gaze at any point, concentrating their whole mental energies on the idea of the object looked at; or that the same may arise by the patient looking at the point of his own finger, or as the Magi of Persia and Yogi of India have practised for the last 2,400 years, for religious purposes, throwing themselves into their ecstatic trances by each maintaining a steady fixed gaze at the tip of his own nose; it is obvious that there is no need for an exoteric influence to produce the phenomena of Mesmerism. [\u2026] The great object in all these processes is to induce a habit of abstraction or concentration of attention, in which the subject is entirely absorbed with one idea, or train of ideas, whilst he is unconscious of, or indifferently conscious to, every other object, purpose, or action.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/edinburghmedica152unkngoog#page/n322/mode/1up The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal] p. 306.</ref>}}\n\n=== Holy See ===\nObjections had been raised by some theologians stating that, if not applied properly, hypnosis could deprive a person of their faculty of reason. [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] specifically rebutted this, stating that \"The loss of reason is not a sin in itself but only by reason of the act by which one is deprived of the use of reason. If the act that deprives one of his use of reason is licit in itself and is done for a just cause, there is no sin; if no just cause is present, it must be considered a venial sin.\"\n\nOn 28 July 1847, a decree from the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Sacred Congregation of the Holy office]] ([[Roman Curia]]) declared that \"Having removed all misconception, foretelling of the future, explicit or implicit invocation of the devil, the use of animal magnetism (Hypnosis) is indeed merely an act of making use of physical media that are otherwise licit and hence it is not morally forbidden, provided it does not tend toward an illicit end or toward anything depraved.\"\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nHypnosis was used by field doctors in the [[American Civil War]] and was one of the first extensive medical application of hypnosis.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hypnosis for Behavioral Health: A Guide to Expanding Your Professional Practice|page=21|first=David|last=B.

''La m\u00e9thode num\u00e9rique''(\"The numerical method\") led to a number of systematic experimental examinations of hypnosis in France, Germany, and [[Switzerland]]. The process of post-hypnotic suggestion was first described in this period. Extraordinary improvements in sensory acuity and memory were reported under hypnosis.\n\nFrom the 1880s the examination of hypnosis passed from surgical doctors to mental health professionals. Charcot had led the way and his study was continued by his pupil, [[Pierre Janet]]. Janet described the theory of ''[[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]'', the  splitting of mental aspects under hypnosis (or hysteria) so skills and memory could be made inaccessible or recovered. Janet provoked interest in the subconscious and laid the framework for reintegration therapy for dissociated personalities.\n\n[[File:Une le\u00e7on clinique \u00e0 la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re.jpg|thumb|400px|Charcot demonstrating [[hypnosis]] on a \"[[hysteria|hysterical]]\" ''[[Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]]'' patient, \"Blanche\" ([[Blanche Wittmann]]), who is supported by [[Joseph Babi\u0144ski]].<ref>See: [[A Clinical Lesson at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]].</ref>]]\n\n=== Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault ===\n[[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault]] (1864\u20131904), the founder of the [[Nancy School]], first wrote of the necessity for cooperation between the hypnotizer and the participant, for ''[[rapport]]''.

Much of the work of early 20th century self-help teachers (such as such as [[Norman Vincent Peale]], [[Robert H. Schuller]], and [[W. Clement Stone]]) was derived from that of Cou\u00e9.\n\n=== Boris Sidis ===\n[[Image:Boris Sidis cropped 2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Boris Sidis]]]]\n[[Boris Sidis]] (1867\u20131923), a Ukraine-born American psychologist and psychiatrist who studied under [[William James]] at [[Harvard University]], formulated this law of [[suggestion]]:\n\n:Suggestibility varies as the amount of disaggregation, and inversely as the unification of consciousness. Disaggregation refers to the split between the normal waking consciousness and the subconscious.\n\n=== Johannes Schultz ===\nThe German psychiatrist [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz|Johannes Schultz]] adapted the theories of [[Abbe Faria]] and [[Emile Cou\u00e9]] and identifying certain parallels to techniques in [[yoga]] and [[meditation]]. He called his system of self-hypnosis [[Autogenic training]].\n\n=== Gustave Le Bon ===\n[[Gustave Le Bon]]'s study of [[crowd psychology]] compared the effects of a [[leadership|leader]] of a group to hypnosis. Le Bon made use of the [[suggestibility]] concept.\n\n=== Sigmund Freud ===\nHypnosis, which at the end of the 19th century had become a popular phenomenon, in particular due to Charcot's public hypnotism sessions, was crucial in the invention of [[psychoanalysis]] by [[Sigmund Freud]], a student of Charcot. Freud later witnessed a small number of the experiments of [[Ambroise-Auguste Li\u00e9beault|Li\u00e9beault]] and [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] in Nancy. Back in Vienna he developed [[abreaction therapy]] using hypnosis with [[Josef Breuer]]. When Sigmund Freud discounted its use in psychiatry, in the first half of the last century, stage hypnotists kept it alive more than physicians.\n\n===Platanov and Pavlov===\nRussian medicine has had extensive experience with obstetric hypnosis. Platanov, in the 1920s, became well known for his hypno-obstetric successes. Impressed by this approach, Stalin later set up a nationwide program headed by Velvoski, who originally combined hypnosis with [[Pavlovian|Pavlov]]'s techniques, but eventually used the latter almost exclusively. [[Fernand Lamaze]], having visited Russia, brought back to France \"childbirth without pain through the psychological method,\" which in turn showed more [[Reflexology|reflexologic]] than hypnotic inspiration.\n\n=== 20th century wars ===\nThe use of hypnosis in the treatment of neuroses flourished in World War I, World War II and the [[Korean War]].  Hypnosis techniques were merged with psychiatry and was especially useful in the treatment of what is known today as [[PTSD|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== William McDougall ===\n[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (1871\u20131944), an English psychologist, treated soldiers with \"shell shock\" and criticised certain aspects of Freudian theory such as the concept of [[abreaction]].\n\n=== Clark L. Hull ===\nThe modern study of hypnotism is usually considered to have begun in the 1920s with [[Clark Leonard Hull]] (1884\u20131952) at [[Yale University]]. An experimental psychologist, his work ''Hypnosis and Suggestibility'' (1933) was a rigorous study of the phenomenon, using statistical and experimental analysis. Hull's studies emphatically demonstrated once and for all that hypnosis had no connection with sleep (\"hypnosis is not sleep, \u2026 it has no special relationship to sleep, and the whole concept of sleep when applied to hypnosis obscures the situation\").\n\nThe main result of Hull's study was to rein in the extravagant claims of hypnotists, especially regarding extraordinary improvements in cognition or the senses under hypnosis. Hull's experiments showed the reality of some classical phenomena such as mentally induced pain reduction and apparent inhibition of memory recall. However, Clark's work made clear that these effects could be achieved without hypnosis being seen as a distinct state, but rather as a result of suggestion and motivation, which was a forerunner of the behavioural approach to hypnosis. Similarly, moderate increases in certain physical capacities and changes to the threshold of sensory stimulation could be induced psychologically; attenuation effects could be especially dramatic.\n\n=== Andrew Salter ===\nIn the 1940s, [[Andrew Salter]] (1914\u20131996) introduced to American therapy the [[Pavlovian]] method of contradicting, opposing, and attacking beliefs. In the conditioned reflex, he has found what he saw as the essence of hypnosis. He thus gave a rebirth to hypnotism by combining it with [[classical conditioning]]. [[Ivan Pavlov]] had himself induced an altered state in pigeons, that he referred to as \"Cortical Inhibition,\" which some later theorists believe was some form of hypnotic state.\n\n=== British Hypnotism Act ===\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[Hypnotism Act 1952]] was instituted to regulate stage hypnotists' public entertainments.\n\n=== British Medical Association, 1955 ===\nOn 23 April 1955, the British Medical Association (BMA) approved the use of hypnosis in the areas of psychoneuroses and hypnoanesthesia in pain management in childbirth and surgery.  At this time, the BMA also advised all physicians and medical students to receive fundamental training in hypnosis. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===1956, Pope's approval of hypnosis===\nThe Roman Catholic Church banned hypnotism until the mid-20th century when, in 1956, [[Pope Pius XII]] gave his approval of hypnosis. He stated that the use of hypnosis by health care professionals for diagnosis and treatment is permitted. In an address from the Vatican on hypnosis in childbirth, the Pope gave these guidelines:\n# Hypnotism is a serious matter, and not something to dabble in.\n# In its scientific use, the precautions dictated by both science and morality must be followed.\n# Under the aspect of anaesthesia, it is governed by the same principles as other forms of anaesthesia.\n\n=== American Medical Association, 1958 ===\nIn 1958, the American Medical Association approved a report on the medical uses of hypnosis. It encouraged research on hypnosis although pointing out that some aspects of hypnosis are unknown and controversial.  However, in June 1987, the AMA's policy-making body rescinded all AMA policies from 1881\u20131958 (other than two not relating to hypnosis). {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== American Psychological Association ===\nTwo years after AMA approval, the American Psychological Association endorsed hypnosis as a branch of psychology. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Ernest Hilgard and others===\nStudies continued after the Second World War. Barber, Hilgard, Orne and Sarbin also produced substantial studies.\n\nIn 1961, [[Ernest Hilgard]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Muller Weitzenhoffer]] created the [[Stanford scales]], a standardized scale for susceptibility to hypnosis, and properly examined susceptibility across age-groups and sex.\n\nHilgard went on to study sensory deception (1965) and induced anesthesia and [[analgesia]] (1975).\n\n\n'''Harry Arons (1914-1997)'''\n\nHarry Arons was the biggest contributor in the 20th century to the acceptance of hypnosis by the medical & mental health community with his almost monthly training courses around the United States for over five decades.\n\nDuring his 52-year career he trained tens of thousands of doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists in the use of hypnosis to help their patients.\n\nHe also pioneered in utilizing hypnosis in criminal investigation, and worked successfully with well-known attorneys like F. Lee Bailey in the famous Coppolino murder trial.\n\nHis hypnosis techniques and procedures are still widely used by professionals to this day.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[Hypnosis]]\n|-\n|Applications[[History of hypnosis|[show]]]\n|-\n|Origins[[History of hypnosis|[hide]]]\n\n* [[Animal magnetism]]/mesmerism\n* History of hypnosis\n* [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]]\n* [[Franz Mesmer]]\n* [[Charles Poyen]]\n|-\n|Key figures[[History of hypnosis|[show]]]\n|-\n|Related topics[[History of hypnosis|[show]]]\n|-\n|\n* [[Template:Hypnosis|<abbr>v</abbr>]]\n* [[Template talk:Hypnosis|<abbr>t</abbr>]]\n* <abbr>[[Template:Hypnosis|e]]</abbr>\n|}\n\n=== Dave Elman ===\n[[Dave Elman]] (1900\u20131967) helped to promote the medical use of hypnosis from 1949 until his heart attack in 1962. Elman's definition of hypnosis is still used today by professional hypnotherapists. Although Elman had no medical training, Gil Boyne (a major teacher of hypnosis) repeatedly stated that Dave Elman trained more physicians and dentists in the use of hypnotism than anyone else in the United States.\n\nDave Elman is also known for introducing rapid inductions to the field of hypnotism.  An induction method he introduced over fifty years ago is still one of the favored inductions used by many of today's practitioners.\n\nHe placed great stress on what he called \"'''the Esdaile state'''\" or the \"hypnotic coma,\" which, according to Elman, had not been deliberately induced since Scottish surgeon [[James Esdaile]] last attained it. This was an unfortunate and historically inaccurate choice of terminology on Elman's part. [[James Esdaile|Esdaile]] never used what we now call '''''hypnosis''''' even on a single occasion; he used something loosely resembling '''''[[mesmerism]]''''' (also known as '''''[[animal magnetism]]''''').\n\n===Ormond McGill===\n[[Ormond McGill]] (1913\u20132005), stage hypnotist and hypnotherapist, was the \"Dean of American Hypnotists\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and writer of the seminal \"Encyclopedia of Genuine Stage Hypnotism\" (1947).\n\n=== U.S. definition for hypnotherapist ===\nThe U.S. (Department of Labor) Directory of Occupational Titles (D.O.T. 079.157.010) supplies the following definition:\n:\"Hypnotherapist \u2013 Induces hypnotic state in client to increase motivation or alter behavior pattern through hypnosis. Consults with client to determine the nature of problem. Prepares client to enter hypnotic states by explaining how hypnosis works and what client will experience. Tests subject to determine degrees of physical and emotional suggestibility. Induces hypnotic state in client using individualized methods and techniques of hypnosis based on interpretation of test results and analysis of client's problem. May train client in self-hypnosis conditioning. Some states hold the term \"Therapist\" to be licensed medical professionals. Therefore, using this term and not being a licensed professional would be practicing without a license.\n\n=== UK National Occupational Standards ===\n[[National Occupational Standards]] (NOS) for Hypnotherapy was published in 2002 by Skills for Health, the Government's Sector Skills Council for the UK health industry. The [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] started conferring optional certificates and diplomas in international level through National Awarding Bodies by assessing learning outcomes of training/accrediting-prior-experiential-learning.\n\n=== Indian restriction ===\nThe Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, in its letter no.R.14015/25/96-U&H(R) (Pt.) dated 25 November 2003, has categorically stated that hypnotherapy is a recommended mode of therapy in India, to be practiced only by appropriately trained personnel.\n\n==Contemporary researchers==\n\n=== Nicholas Spanos ===\n[[Nicholas Spanos]], who died in 1994, was Professor of Psychology and Director of the Laboratory for Experimental Hypnosis at [[Carleton University]] and a leading nonstate theorist and hypnotic skills training researcher.\n\n===Martin Orne===\n[[Martin Theodore Orne]] was a professor of psychiatry at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] who researched [[demand characteristics]] and hypnosis.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Hypnosis]]\n* [[Hypnosis in popular culture]]\n* [[Hypnotherapy]]\n* [[Hypnotic induction]]\n* [[Nancy School]]\n* [[The Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re School of Hypnosis]]\n* [[Self-hypnosis]]\n* [[The Zoist|The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology & Mesmerism, and Their Applications to Human Welfare]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Bailly, J.-S., \"Secret Report on Mesmerism or Animal Magnetism\", ''International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis'', Vol. 50, No. 4, (October 2002), pp.&nbsp;364\u201368. {{doi|10.1080/00207140208410110}}\n* [https://archive.org/stream/edinburghmedica152unkngoog#page/n302/mode/1up Braid, J., \"The Power of the Mind over the Body: An Experimental Inquiry into the nature and cause of the Phenomena attributed by Baron Reichenbach and others to a 'New Imponderable'\", ''The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal'', Vol. 66, No. 169, (1 October 1846), pp. 286\u2013311.]\n* Franklin, B., Majault, M.J., Le Roy, J.B., Sallin, C.L., Bailly, J.-S., d'Arcet, J., de Bory, G., Guillotin, J.-I. & Lavoisier, A., \"Report of The Commissioners charged by the King with the Examination of Animal Magnetism\", ''International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis'', Vol. 50, No. 4, (October 2002), pp.&nbsp;332\u201363. {{doi|10.1080/00207140208410109}}\n* [https://archive.org/details/b24872210_0002 Harte, R., ''Hypnotism and the Doctors, Volume I: Animal Magnetism: Mesmer/De Puysegur'', L.N.

Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. Because they have no fur they lose more body heat than coated cats; this makes them warm to the touch, and prone to finding warm places.\n\n==Breed standards==\nThese breed standards are defined by [[The International Cat Association]] (TICA):<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Wedge-shaped heads with prominent cheekbones\n* Large, lemon-shaped eyes\n* Very large ears with no hair on inside, but soft down on outside base\n* Well-muscled, powerful neck of medium length\n* Medium length torso, barrel-chested, and full, round abdomen, sometimes called a [[pot belly]]\n* Paw pads thicker than other cats, giving the appearance of walking on cushions\n* Whiplike, tapering tail from body to tip, (sometimes with fur all over tail or a puff of fur on the tip, like a lion)\n* Muscular body<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tica.org/members/publications/standards/sx.pdf |title=TICA Sphynx breed standards |website= TICA.org| publisher= [[The International Cat Association]] |accessdate= 2014-06-22}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:A Sphynx cat.jpg|thumb|A male purebred Sphynx in the \"mink\" pattern.

In the movement for [[Sex worker rights|sex workers' rights]], sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has \"self-regulatory boards\" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations.<ref name=\"holly\">Burkhalter, Holly. \"Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 122133-.

In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.<ref name=\"berger\"/> The link between demand for paid sex and incidences of human trafficking, as well as the \"demand for trafficking\" discourse more broadly, have never been proven empirically and have been seriously questioned by a number of scholars and organisations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaatw.org/resources/publications/913-moving-beyond-supply-and-demand-catchphrases-assessing-the-uses-and-limitations-of-demand-based-approaches-in-anti-trafficking|title=Moving Beyond 'Supply and Demand' Catchphrases: Assessing the uses and limitations of demand-based approaches in Anti-Trafficking|last=Ham|first=Julie|date=2011|website=|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Is Trafficking in Human Beings Demand Driven?

The traffickers expect to generate huge profit from the business yet face minimal punishment or legal consequence. Human trafficking is one of the most profitable illegal industries that is second to the drug trade. While drugs are consumables, human beings can be sold repeatedly from one employer to another. The costs are low, and the profits are extremely high. Similar to employers, consumers desire to pay the lowest price and receive the highest benefit. The demand for cheap goods stimulates employers to demand cheap labour from human traffickers. High demand drives the volume of supply. \nCorporations maximise profit at the expense of trafficked labours. The low cost of illegal immigrant labour and trafficked labour in such enterprises tends to depress wages for legal labourers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Fuels Human Trafficking? |url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692 |website=UNICEF USA}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the United Nations, human trafficking can be closely integrated into legal businesses, including the tourism industry, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, and leisure and entertainment businesses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=U.N.

Businesses are set up to launder money and not necessarily to make profits. Legitimate businesses may be possibly held in competition against enterprises that are financially backed by human traffickers with illegally acquired income. Fair competition may be undermined when human trafficking victims are exploited for cheap labour, driving down production costs, thereby indirectly causing a negative economic imbalance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grewal |first1=Silky |title=Human Trafficking: Threat To Economic Security Of A Nation |website=BusinessWorld}}</ref>\n\nBy definition, human trafficking is an organised crime, executed into action by several actors at the source, transit and destination points of trafficking. Huge profits with minimal risk incur from this offence, that is exclusively meant for the gains of its organisers and the exploiters. The revenue accrued from the Illegal industry of human trafficking does not contribute to a nation's GDP. On the contrary, it is a loss to the economy and national security of a nation, as it is a vicious cycle where this illegal activity can be accountable for funding other illegal activities. The exploitation continuously generates large sums of illegal income for criminal networks, with a corresponding threat on other legitimate businesses which have positive economic impacts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grewal |first1=Silky |title=Human Trafficking: Threat To Economic Security Of A Nation |website=BusinessWorld}}</ref>\n\nHuman trafficking is a national threat as it blocks national growth and development.

For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'.<ref name=\"Agustin, Laura 2008\"/> Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.<ref name=\"rsis.edu.sg\" /> British scholar Julia O'Connell Davidson has advanced the same argument.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern slavery : the margins of freedom|last=O'Connell Davidson, Julia, 1960-|isbn=978-1-137-29727-3|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=909538560}}</ref> Furthermore, anti-trafficking actors often conflate clandestine migratory movements or voluntary sex work with forms of exploitation covered in human trafficking definitions, ignoring the fact that a migratory movement is not a requirement for human trafficking victimization.\n\nThe critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by irregular migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = G\u00fcl\u00e7\u00fcr | first1 = Leyla | last2 = \u0130lkkaracan | first2 = P\u0131nar | title = The \"Natasha\" experience: Migrant sex workers from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in Turkey | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 411\u2013421 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00278-9 | date = July\u2013August 2002 | ref = harv |url=http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/NATASHA.PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe international [[Save the Children]] organization also stated: \"The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se\u2026trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other\u2026On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti-trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking \u2013 Save the Children Nepal |accessdate=2010-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nClaudia Aradau of Open University claims that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ \"politics of pity,\" which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering.

Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking{{snd}} identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government's new anti-trafficking measures \"not fit for purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Anti-trafficking measures 'not fit for purpose' and breach international law \u2013 new report |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18820 |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Victim identification and protection in the UK====\nIn the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status.<ref>Stepnitz, Abigail. \"A Lie More Disastrous than the Truth: Asylum and the Identification of Trafficked Women in the UK.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 104\u201319.

Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle \"criminal networks\", and to rescue victims from abuse.<ref name=\"ditmore\">Ditmore, Melissa, and Juhu Thukral. \"Accountability and the Use of Raids to Fight Trafficking.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 134\u201348. Anti Trafficking Review. Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, June 2012. Web. 11 March 2013.</ref>\n\nThe problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The [[Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005]] (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.<ref name=\"ditmore\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-30|title=How to Stage a Raid: Police, media and the master narrative of trafficking|url=http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/199/196|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=7|doi=10.14197/atr.20121773}}</ref> Another study found that the majority of women \"rescued\" in anti-trafficking raids, both voluntary and coerced sex workers, eventually returned to sex work but had amassed huge amounts of debt for legal fees and other costs while they were in detention after the raid and were, overall, in a worse situation than before the raid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sangram.org/resources/RAIDED-E-Book.pdf|title=Raided: How anti-trafficking strategies increase sex workers' vulnerability to exploitative practices|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|publisher=Sangram|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nLaw enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful.\nSocial workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.<ref name=\"ditmore\" />\n\nAs raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.<ref name=\"ahmed\">{{Cite journal|author=Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu|title=\"We Have the Right Not to Be 'rescued'\u2026\"*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|journal=Anti Trafficking Review|volume=1|date=June 2012|pages=149\u201319|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812011153/http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nScholars Aziza Ahmed and [[Meena Seshu]] suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model.<ref name=\"ahmed\"/>\n\n====\"End Demand\" programs====\nCritics argue that [[End Demand]] programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, \"[[John school]]s\" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers because of the higher risk nature of their work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=No proper citation given for this study.}} The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of john schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some john schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.<ref name=\"desiree\">Wortley, S., Fischer, B., & Webster, C.

The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on \"sexualized domination\", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Johanna|title=Selling Sexual Services: A Socialist Feminist Perspective|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article34256|website=Europe Solidaire Sans Fronti\u00e8res|publisher=Syst\u00e8me de Publication pour un Internet Partag\u00e9}}</ref><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite web|title=Feminist Manifesto in Support of Sex Workers' Rights|url=https://feministsforsexworkers.com/|website=Feminists for Sex Workers|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism]] harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism|Third-wave]] feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to [[Amartya Sen]]'s and [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims.  Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.<ref name=\"shelley\">CAVALIERI, SHELLEY. \"[http://ilj.law.indiana.edu/articles/86/86_4_cavalieri.pdf Between Victim And Agent: A Third-Wave Feminist Account Of Trafficking For Sex Work.]\" Indiana Law Journal86.4 (2011): 1409\u20131458. Legal Collection. Web. 6 March 2013.</ref>\n\nThe clash between the different feminist perspectives on trafficking and sex work was especially evident at the negotiations of the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children|Palermo Protocol]]. One feminist group, led by the [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]], saw trafficking as the result of globalisation and restrictive labour migration policies, with force, fraud and coercion as its defining features. The other feminist group, led by the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] saw trafficking more narrowly as the result of men's demand for paid sex. Both groups tried to influence the definition of trafficking and other provisions in the Protocol. Eventually, both were only partially successful;<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title=Purity, Victimhood and Agency: Fifteen years of the UN Trafficking Protocol|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/90/111|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.20121544}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex slaves and discourse masters : the construction of trafficking|last=Doezema, Jo.|date=2010|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-415-7|location=London|oclc=650365532}}</ref> however, scholars have noted that this rift between feminist organisations led to the extremely weak and voluntary victim protection provisions of the Protocol.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuang|first=Janie A.|date=2010|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=158|issue=6|pages=1655\u20131728|issn=0041-9907|jstor=25682362|title=Rescuing Trafficking from Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform and Anti-Trafficking Law and Policy}}</ref>\n\n===Social norms===\nAccording to modern Feminists, women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of [[social norms]] that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead people to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.<ref name=\"yvonne\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Yvonne | year = 2007 | title = Children for sale: Child trafficking in Southeast Asia | url = | journal = Child Abuse Review | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 401\u2013422 | doi=10.1002/car.1009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n  | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

In the movement for [[Sex worker rights|sex workers' rights]], sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has \"self-regulatory boards\" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations.<ref name=\"holly\">Burkhalter, Holly. \"Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 122133-.

In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.<ref name=\"berger\"/> The link between demand for paid sex and incidences of human trafficking, as well as the \"demand for trafficking\" discourse more broadly, have never been proven empirically and have been seriously questioned by a number of scholars and organisations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaatw.org/resources/publications/913-moving-beyond-supply-and-demand-catchphrases-assessing-the-uses-and-limitations-of-demand-based-approaches-in-anti-trafficking|title=Moving Beyond 'Supply and Demand' Catchphrases: Assessing the uses and limitations of demand-based approaches in Anti-Trafficking|last=Ham|first=Julie|date=2011|website=|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Is Trafficking in Human Beings Demand Driven?

The traffickers expect to generate huge profit from the business yet face minimal punishment or legal consequence. Human trafficking is one of the most profitable illegal industries that is second to the drug trade. While drugs are consumables, human beings can be sold repeatedly from one employer to another. The costs are low, and the profits are extremely high. Similar to employers, consumers desire to pay the lowest price and receive the highest benefit. The demand for cheap goods stimulates employers to demand cheap labour from human traffickers. High demand drives the volume of supply. \nCorporations maximise profit at the expense of trafficked labours. The low cost of illegal immigrant labour and trafficked labour in such enterprises tends to depress wages for legal labourers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Fuels Human Trafficking? |url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692 |website=UNICEF USA}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the United Nations, human trafficking can be closely integrated into legal businesses, including the tourism industry, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, and leisure and entertainment businesses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=U.N.

Businesses are set up to launder money and not necessarily to make profits.

On the contrary, it is a loss to the economy and national security of a nation, as it is a vicious cycle where this illegal activity can be accountable for funding other illegal activities.

For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'.<ref name=\"Agustin, Laura 2008\"/> Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.<ref name=\"rsis.edu.sg\" /> British scholar Julia O'Connell Davidson has advanced the same argument.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern slavery : the margins of freedom|last=O'Connell Davidson, Julia, 1960-|isbn=978-1-137-29727-3|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=909538560}}</ref> Furthermore, anti-trafficking actors often conflate clandestine migratory movements or voluntary sex work with forms of exploitation covered in human trafficking definitions, ignoring the fact that a migratory movement is not a requirement for human trafficking victimization.\n\nThe critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by irregular migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = G\u00fcl\u00e7\u00fcr | first1 = Leyla | last2 = \u0130lkkaracan | first2 = P\u0131nar | title = The \"Natasha\" experience: Migrant sex workers from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in Turkey | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 411\u2013421 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00278-9 | date = July\u2013August 2002 | ref = harv |url=http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/NATASHA.PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe international [[Save the Children]] organization also stated: \"The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se\u2026trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other\u2026On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti-trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking \u2013 Save the Children Nepal |accessdate=2010-01-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nClaudia Aradau of Open University claims that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ \"politics of pity,\" which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering.

Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking{{snd}} identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government's new anti-trafficking measures \"not fit for purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Anti-trafficking measures 'not fit for purpose' and breach international law \u2013 new report |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18820 |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Victim identification and protection in the UK====\nIn the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status.<ref>Stepnitz, Abigail. \"A Lie More Disastrous than the Truth: Asylum and the Identification of Trafficked Women in the UK.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 104\u201319.

Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle \"criminal networks\", and to rescue victims from abuse.<ref name=\"ditmore\">Ditmore, Melissa, and Juhu Thukral. \"Accountability and the Use of Raids to Fight Trafficking.\" Anti Trafficking Review 1 (2012): 134\u201348. Anti Trafficking Review. Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, June 2012. Web. 11 March 2013.</ref>\n\nThe problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The [[Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005]] (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.<ref name=\"ditmore\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-30|title=How to Stage a Raid: Police, media and the master narrative of trafficking|url=http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/199/196|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=7|doi=10.14197/atr.20121773}}</ref> Another study found that the majority of women \"rescued\" in anti-trafficking raids, both voluntary and coerced sex workers, eventually returned to sex work but had amassed huge amounts of debt for legal fees and other costs while they were in detention after the raid and were, overall, in a worse situation than before the raid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sangram.org/resources/RAIDED-E-Book.pdf|title=Raided: How anti-trafficking strategies increase sex workers' vulnerability to exploitative practices|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|publisher=Sangram|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nLaw enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful.\nSocial workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.<ref name=\"ditmore\" />\n\nAs raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.<ref name=\"ahmed\">{{Cite journal|author=Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu|title=\"We Have the Right Not to Be 'rescued'\u2026\"*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|journal=Anti Trafficking Review|volume=1|date=June 2012|pages=149\u201319|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812011153/http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nScholars Aziza Ahmed and [[Meena Seshu]] suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model.<ref name=\"ahmed\"/>\n\n====\"End Demand\" programs====\nCritics argue that [[End Demand]] programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, \"[[John school]]s\" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers because of the higher risk nature of their work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=No proper citation given for this study.}} The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of john schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some john schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.<ref name=\"desiree\">Wortley, S., Fischer, B., & Webster, C.

The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on \"sexualized domination\", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Johanna|title=Selling Sexual Services: A Socialist Feminist Perspective|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article34256|website=Europe Solidaire Sans Fronti\u00e8res|publisher=Syst\u00e8me de Publication pour un Internet Partag\u00e9}}</ref><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite web|title=Feminist Manifesto in Support of Sex Workers' Rights|url=https://feministsforsexworkers.com/|website=Feminists for Sex Workers|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism]] harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"shelley\" /><ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n[[Third-wave feminism|Third-wave]] feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to [[Amartya Sen]]'s and [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims.  Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.<ref name=\"shelley\">CAVALIERI, SHELLEY. \"[http://ilj.law.indiana.edu/articles/86/86_4_cavalieri.pdf Between Victim And Agent: A Third-Wave Feminist Account Of Trafficking For Sex Work.]\" Indiana Law Journal86.4 (2011): 1409\u20131458. Legal Collection. Web. 6 March 2013.</ref>\n\nThe clash between the different feminist perspectives on trafficking and sex work was especially evident at the negotiations of the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children|Palermo Protocol]]. One feminist group, led by the [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]], saw trafficking as the result of globalisation and restrictive labour migration policies, with force, fraud and coercion as its defining features. The other feminist group, led by the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] saw trafficking more narrowly as the result of men's demand for paid sex. Both groups tried to influence the definition of trafficking and other provisions in the Protocol. Eventually, both were only partially successful;<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title=Purity, Victimhood and Agency: Fifteen years of the UN Trafficking Protocol|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/90/111|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.20121544}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex slaves and discourse masters : the construction of trafficking|last=Doezema, Jo.|date=2010|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-415-7|location=London|oclc=650365532}}</ref> however, scholars have noted that this rift between feminist organisations led to the extremely weak and voluntary victim protection provisions of the Protocol.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuang|first=Janie A.|date=2010|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=158|issue=6|pages=1655\u20131728|issn=0041-9907|jstor=25682362|title=Rescuing Trafficking from Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform and Anti-Trafficking Law and Policy}}</ref>\n\n===Social norms===\nAccording to modern Feminists, women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of [[social norms]] that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead people to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.<ref name=\"yvonne\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Yvonne | year = 2007 | title = Children for sale: Child trafficking in Southeast Asia | url = | journal = Child Abuse Review | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 401\u2013422 | doi=10.1002/car.1009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n  | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
