Recorded in late 1993, it marked a divergence from the band's unpolished [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] aesthetics to more refined melodies and song structure. Frontwoman [[Courtney Love]] commented in 1993 that she wanted the record to be \"shocking to the people who think that we don't have a soft edge\", though still maintain a harsh sensibility.\n\nThe album was produced by [[Sean Slade]] and [[Paul Q. Kolderie]] and mixed by [[Scott Litt]] and [[J Mascis]]. The lyrics and packaging reflect Love's thematic preoccupations with beauty, and [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s of milk, motherhood, [[anti-elitism]], and violence against women, while Love derived the album title from a quote in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939).\n\nAt the time of its release, the album was met with critical acclaim, and it earned top-100 chart spots in seven countries before going multi-[[RIAA certification|platinum]] in December 1994. Despite this, it was also the subject of some public discussion regarding unsubstantiated rumors that Love's husband, [[Kurt Cobain]]\u2014who died by suicide one week before the album's release\u2014helped [[ghostwriter|ghostwrite]] the album. This claim has been disputed by the band members, producers, as well as music biographers, though the band confirmed that Cobain sang additional backing vocals on two tracks during a visit to the studio.\n\nIn critical circles, ''Live Through This'' is considered a contemporary classic,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undercover.fm/news/10171-courtney-love-to-flash-her-hole-at-sxsw |author=Cashmere, Paul |title=Courtney Love To Flash Her Hole At SXSW |date=February 7, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |work=Undercover News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403043132/http://www.undercover.fm/news/10171-courtney-love-to-flash-her-hole-at-sxsw |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}</ref> and was included in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of ''[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]'', as well as being featured on the list ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.

Recorded in late 1993, it marked a divergence from the band's unpolished [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] aesthetics to more refined melodies and song structure. Frontwoman [[Courtney Love]] commented in 1993 that she wanted the record to be \"shocking to the people who think that we don't have a soft edge\", though still maintain a harsh sensibility.\n\nThe album was produced by [[Sean Slade]] and [[Paul Q. Kolderie]] and mixed by [[Scott Litt]] and [[J Mascis]]. The lyrics and packaging reflect Love's thematic preoccupations with beauty, and [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s of milk, motherhood, [[anti-elitism]], and violence against women, while Love derived the album title from a quote in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939).\n\nAt the time of its release, the album was met with critical acclaim, and it earned top-100 chart spots in seven countries before going multi-[[RIAA certification|platinum]] in December 1994. Despite this, it was also the subject of some public discussion regarding unsubstantiated rumors that Love's husband, [[Kurt Cobain]]\u2014who died by suicide one week before the album's release\u2014helped [[ghostwriter|ghostwrite]] the album. This claim has been disputed by the band members, producers, as well as music biographers, though the band confirmed that Cobain sang additional backing vocals on two tracks during a visit to the studio.\n\nIn critical circles, ''Live Through This'' is considered a contemporary classic,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undercover.fm/news/10171-courtney-love-to-flash-her-hole-at-sxsw |author=Cashmere, Paul |title=Courtney Love To Flash Her Hole At SXSW |date=February 7, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |work=Undercover News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403043132/http://www.undercover.fm/news/10171-courtney-love-to-flash-her-hole-at-sxsw |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}</ref> and was included in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of ''[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]'', as well as being featured on the list ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.

{"title_page": "Architecture of London", "text_new": "[[File:Parliament at Sunset.JPG|thumb|right|338x338px|[[Palace of Westminster]] (1840\u201370) by [[Charles Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin]], one of London's most iconic works of architecture and a masterpiece of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] movement.]]\n[[File:London Greenwich.JPG|thumb|339x339px|[[Queen's House|Queens House]] (1633) [[Inigo Jones|Indigo Jones]] (centre) and [[Old Royal Naval College]] (1712) Christopher Wren, a masterpiece of the [[English Baroque|English Baroque Movement]]]]\n[[London]] is the largest and capital city of [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Founded as the ancient city of [[Londinium]] in the first century CE by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as capital of the Roman province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], London has been an inhabited settlement almost continuously since. After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in the 5th century, the layout of the Roman settlement became the approximate blueprint of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Medieval London|medieval city]]. This ancient core of London is known as the [[City of London]] with [[Westminster]], the ancient centre of political power in London, lying to the west. Relatively few structures survive from London's medieval past due to the city's near-total destruction in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]], but notable survivors include the [[Tower of London]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Westminster Hall]], [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], [[St James's Palace]], [[Lambeth Palace]] and a handful of scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivals. After the Great Fire, London was transformed as it was rebuilt and greatly modernised under the direction of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]], with the new Baroque [[St Paul's Cathedral]] as its centrepiece. After a period of dramatic expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries, London reached its zenith as the world's largest and populous city from 1831 to 1925, as well as being the capital of the [[British Empire]] at its greatest extent and power. In this period London sprawled vastly beyond its historical boundaries, absorbing many formerly rural settlements and creating vast suburbs. The city was also transformed by groundbreaking new infrastructure projects like the [[West India Docks]] which affirmed London's status as a major port, a system of canals which included the [[Regent's Canal]], [[London sewerage system|a modern sewage system]], some of the world's first intercity railway termini such as [[London Paddington station|Paddington Station]], and [[London Underground|the world's first underground railway system]]. These innovations set London apart as the pre-eminent city of the [[Industrial Age|industrial age]]. After suffering significant destruction during by [[The Blitz]] of [[World War II]] and a period of economic decline in the [[History of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|post-war]] period, London is once again a global capital of culture and commerce, with much new development adding to its eclectic cityscape.\n\nLondon contains a very wide variety of architectural styles from a variety of historical periods. London's great architectural eclecticism stems from its long history, constant redevelopment, destruction caused by [[The Blitz]] and historical government recognition of private property rights which often prevented large scale state planning. This sets London apart from other great European capitals like [[Paris]], [[Vienna]] and [[Rome]] which are more architecturally homogenous and were more rationally planned. London's eclectic architectural heritage ranges from Roman archaeological remains, the great medieval fortress the [[Tower of London]], the 13th-century gothic of [[Westminster Abbey]], the opulent [[English Baroque|baroque]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the elegant neoclassicism of [[Somerset House]], the urban set piece of [[Regent Street]], the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian High Gothic]] of [[St Pancras railway station]], the [[Art Deco|art deco]] [[Hoover Building]], the austere [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]] of the [[Barbican Estate]] and the [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] skyscraper [[30 St Mary Axe]].\n\nBeing the capital of the [[United Kingdom]], London contains many of the most important buildings of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British State]], [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|The Monarchy]] and [[Church of England|The Church of England]]. These include the [[Palace of Westminster]]; the centre of British democracy, [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham Palace;]] the official residence of the British Monarchy and [[Westminster Abbey]]; the site of all coronations of English and British monarchs since 1066. London also contains numerous [[monument]]s such as the ancient heart of London at [[London Stone]], the 17th-century [[The Monument|Monument]] to the Great Fire of London, [[Marble Arch]], [[Wellington Arch]], the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is an internationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], often regarded as the centre of London.\n[[File:Westminster Abbey London 8.jpg|thumb|339x339px|[[Westminster Abbey]], a predominantly 13th-14th century [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] abbey, one of London's most significant surviving buildings from the Middle Ages.]]\nThroughout most of London's history, the height of buildings has been restricted. These restrictions gradually eroded in the post-war period (except those protecting certain views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]) and high rise buildings have become ever more numerous since, particularly in the 21st century.

In the medieval period, the city lay predominantly within the boundaries of the city walls originally built by the Romans \u2013 the area now known as [[City of London|The City of London]] \u2013 with [[Westminster]] being a separate much smaller settlement to the west. Some aristocratic houses were constructed along the [[Strand, London|Strand]] which connected the two settlements. There was also some development on the south bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]] at [[Southwark]] with the famous [[London Bridge]] connecting the district to the rest of London as well as being the gateway to the South East of England. The earliest record of [[London Bridge|London bridge]] dates from the 10th century, a structure probably built of wood, but the most famous incarnation of this bridge was constructed between 1176 and 1209. This was a stone bridge 900&nbsp;ft wide and consisting of 19 arches, complete with its own street of shops, houses, a chapel and a drawbridge in the centre to allow large boat traffic pass through.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=124}}</ref> The River Thames was an important means of transportation within the city, as well as providing access to overseas trade by sea, with many wharfs and quays built along the north bank of the river.\n\n====== Norman and Gothic Architecture ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| total_width = 620\n| image1 = Tower_of_London_viewed_from_the_River_Thames.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The White Tower (1080) the romanesque central keep of the tower of London complex.\n| image2 = Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg\n| caption2 = An aerial view of The Tower of London complex, which reached its current form c.14th century\n| header = The Tower of London\n}}\nMany of medieval London's most significant structures were initially constructed by the [[Normans]], who recognised the importance of architecture as a means of demonstrating their power and of subordinating the native Saxon population after [[Norman conquest of England|their conquest of England]]. The [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] was a major turning point in the history of [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] as they brought with them a new European [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style \nand a greater architectural ambition than their [[Saxons|Saxon]] predecessors. Almost immediately after their conquest of England the Normans built several fortresses along the River Thames in the centre of the London to consolidate their power, the most notable of which being [[Baynard's Castle]] which was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]] and the [[Tower of London]] which still survives today.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108}}</ref> The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]], the central keep of the Tower of London complex, was completed in the 1080s and built in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. Also of note within The White Tower is the chapel of [[St John's Chapel, London|St John's]], one of the oldest and least altered Romanesque churches in all of England.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clapham|first=A.W|title=English Romanesque Architecture|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The only other surviving [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in central London is [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in Smithfield, the remains of a former much larger priory church.\n\nAnother significant London structure initially constructed by the Normans is [[Westminster Hall]]. Completed in 1097 in the reign of [[William II of England|William II]] as a royal residence, the hall become the foundation of the [[Palace of Westminster]], a complex which gradually expanded throughout the Middle Ages. The hall was largely rebuilt in the reign of Richard II and became the largest such hall in medieval Europe. It is notable for its exceptionally wide span [[hammerbeam roof]] added in the 14th century, widely considered to be a marvel of medieval engineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE81VeStEFg&t=311s|title=Dan Cruickshank explores the Palace of Westminster|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Miraculously [[Westminster Hall]] still survives today having escaped the fire of 1834 which destroyed the majority of the medieval Palace of Westminster; it was then incorporated into [[Charles Barry|Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin|Pugin]]'s [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] [[Palace of Westminster]] who admired its authentic gothic style. Other surviving examples of medieval halls in London can be found in the form of [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] (1440) which once served as London's city hall (it was greatly altered after [[Great Fire of London|the great fire]]) and the Old Hall of [[Lincoln's Inn]] (1492).\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| image1 = Towers of Westminster Abbey.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = (left) Twin Towers of the west front, c.18th century.\n| image2 = Westminster abbey.jpg\n| caption2 = (centre) North portal c.14th century.\n| image 3 = \n| image3 = London - Westminster abbey - chapter house 03.jpg\n| img_gap = 200\n| caption3 = (right) Chapter house c.14th century\n| caption_align = \n| header = Westminster Abbey\n}}\n\n[[Normans|The Normans]] also began the construction of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] on [[Ludgate Hill]], replacing a primitive [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] timber framed building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=136}}</ref> By the time of its completion in the 14th century the cathedral included elements of [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture]] alongside the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] nave constructed by the Normans. The cathedral was one of the largest and tallest churches in medieval Europe; at one point it was crowned by an exceptionally tall spire similar to that of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] which was about 158&nbsp;m (520&nbsp;ft) high, although this was destroyed after being hit by lightning in the 16th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> The cathedral was latterly completely destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666 and replaced by [[Christopher Wren]]'s [[St Paul's Cathedral|surviving baroque cathedral]] which retained the medieval cathedral's Latin cross layout.\n\nLondon's other most significant church [[Westminster Abbey]] was first constructed in the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]] in the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque style]] but was subsequently rebuilt in the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] style in the 13th century in the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]; this produced the building which largely survives today. The sophisticated [[gothic architecture]] of the abbey is reminiscent of French Cathedrals like that of [[Reims Cathedral|Reims]] rather than the [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] of the period, leading to much speculation as to whether the master mason was French.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Webb|first=Geoffrey|title=Architecture of Britain in the Middle Ages|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=109}}</ref>  The most significant later addition to the abbey was the [[Henry VII Chapel]] built in the late 15th to early 16th century, an exceptional example of late [[English Gothic architecture]] notable for its highly ornate [[fan vault]]ed ceiling. The twin-towered west front of the abbey was added in the 18th century to the designs of [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] in a faithful [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style intended to be in keeping with the rest of the medieval building. Other significant [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] churches surviving from the Middle Ages include [[Southwark Cathedral]], a former priory that was the first gothic church in London built between 1220 and 1420, as well as a handful of city churches that miraculously survived the great fire like [[St Andrew Undershaft]], [[St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate|St Helen's Bishopsgate]], [[St Olave's Church, Hart Street|St Olave's Hart Street]] and [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]].\n\n====== Tudor Architecture ======\n[[File:Great Gate, Hampton Court Palace.jpg|thumb|290x290px|[[Hampton Court Palace]] (1515\u20131540) residence of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] then [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]],]]A significant proportion of London's surviving architecture from the Middle Ages dates from the [[Tudor period]]. The Tudor period was a period of rapid expansion for London, both economically as a result of growing overseas trade and in terms of population which grew dramatically from roughly 50,000 in 1500 to 250,000 in 1600. As a result of this population boom the city sprawled considerably and by the end of the 16th century the majority of London's population lived outside the city walls for the first time.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Edward|title=A Guide to the Architecture of London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Henry VII and Henry VIII also commissioned a substantial number of royal works including the extension and construction of several palaces, these included the massive [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall Palace]] that stretched all the way from Westminster Hall to what is now [[Trafalgar Square]], the extravagant [[Nonsuch Palace]] in Greenwich and [[St James's Palace]] which survives today. By far the most substantial surviving Tudor palace in Greater London is [[Hampton Court Palace]], originally built for [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] and then later becoming a residence of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Greatly extended by Christopher Wren in the late 17th century, the palace still retains most of its original Tudor architecture with its original 16th-century great hall, chapel, astronomical clock and gatehouses; it is often regarded as the finest example of [[Tudor architecture|Tudor Architecture]] in England.<ref name=\":1\" /> Henry VIII also greatly influenced the current form of central London by establishing the hunting grounds of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[St James's Park]] giving London its exceptionally green city centre which survives to this day.

Examples of this can be seen in the form of the Tudor gatehouse of [[Lambeth Palace]] (1495) the London residence of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|The Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Lincoln's Inn]] (1521) and  [[St James's Palace]] (1536). [[Tudor architecture]] however is most closely associated with its distinctive vernacular houses which were typically timber framed and filled with [[wattle and daub]] giving the houses a black and white 'checkerboard' appearance. Most commercial and domestic buildings in London before [[Great Fire of London|the great fire]] resembled this from. Only a tiny handful of such buildings survive to this day including [[Staple Inn]]; an [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]] dating back to the [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] period, 41 [[Cloth Fair]]; central London's oldest house started in 1597 and [[Prince Henry's Room]]; a timber-framed [[jettying|jettied]] townhouse built in 1610. Although the vast majority of such structures were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] many timber-framed houses did, in fact, survive until as late as the late 19th and early 20th centuries but were demolished to make way for new development.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Daview|first=Phillip|title=Lost London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> A famous example of this is the demolition of [[Wych Street]] in the Edwardian period to make way for [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]], a new road built between the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and [[High Holborn]].<gallery>\nFile:White Tower, City of London.jpg|[[White Tower (Tower of London)|The White Tower]] (1080) the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] central keep of the [[Tower of London]].\nFile:Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg|[[Tower of London|The Tower of London]] fortress complex.

The pre-eminent architect in this architectural miletstone was [[Inigo Jones]], who was appointed Surveyor of the King's Works in 1615. Having travelled around Italy and owning a copy of ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' by [[Andrea Palladio]], Jones was one of the first English architects to be firmly influenced by [[classical architecture]], both of [[Classical architecture|classical antiquity]] and the [[Neoclassical architecture|revival of the style]] epitomised by the work of Italian architect [[Andrea Palladio]] his strongest influence. His first completed major work in inner London was [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]] (1622), an extension to the mostly medieval [[Palace of Whitehall]], with a Palladian portland stone facade and a fine painted ceiling by the famous Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. As the first truly classical building in London \u2013 a then primitive predominantly timber-framed medieval city \u2013 it is an extremely significant building in the history of London's Architecture, described by Eric de Mare as.\n\n\"an architectural innovation that must have startled Londoners with its sophisticated Palladian Masonry, for its main fa\u00e7ades containing rhythmical rows of tall windows, carved decorations and classical pilasters, all in mathematically, carefully proportioned precision, must have seemed to them like a stage set than a building.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wren's London|last=Eric|first=De Mare|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London.jpg|thumb|292x292px|[[St Paul's, Covent Garden]] (1633) Indigo Jones, London's first classical church and the centre piece of Jones's Covent Garden piazza.]]\n\nAnother royal commission [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] was completed in 1633 and again shows Jones's purist [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style that did not mirror the exuberant [[Baroque]] which was then fashionable in mainland Europe. But perhaps Jones' most significant architectural commission was the redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] in West London. In 1630 Jones was commissioned by the Earl of Bedford to redevelop the area in the west of the city with fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Between 1630 and 1633 Jones designed and constructed London's first modern square; a classical style piazza lined with colonnaded terraced houses and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] on the Western side; the first church in London built in a classical style notable for its monumental tuscan portico. The piazza became a blueprint for the fashionable squares built across the [[West End of London]] in the [[Georgian era]] and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] was an architectural blueprint for the baroque [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|city churches]] built by Wren after the [[Great Fire of London]]. The outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642 greatly interrupted building activity in England and after the parliamentarian victory Jones was heavily fined due to his close connections to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

Despite this plan's rejection, London was still greatly modernised in its reconstruction.|alt=]]\n\nThe [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666 destroyed almost 90% of the largely medieval city, including a total of 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 [[Livery Company|Company]] Halls, the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[Bridewell Palace]] and other City prisons, the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Letter Office]], and the three western city gates; [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], and [[Aldersgate]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Fire of London|last=Porter|first=Stephen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Although the Great Fire is considered to be a cataclysmic event in the history of London, the enormous destruction it caused also presented a historic opportunity to completely replan and modernise the somewhat primitive, predominantly medieval city in its subsequent reconstruction. Radical classical style reconstruction plans were quickly drawn up by architects such as Christopher Wren which proposed to completely discard the city's chaotic medieval street plan in favour of a rationalised grid system with wide boulevards, piazzas and a uniform classical style for all new buildings. However, due to a shortage of labour necessary to complete such grandiose plans, complications with redistributing and compensating property that had been lost in the fire, as well as the intense urgency of rebuilding the city as quickly as possible, it was thus decided to rebuild the city around the original medieval street plan.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the rejection of a classical style replanning of the city, London nonetheless witnessed a radical architectural transformation in its subsequent reconstruction. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the new city compared to its predecessor was its architectural uniformity. In 1667 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] specified that all new houses were to be built to a uniform height and plot size, as well all being built of brick rather than wood to reduce fire hazard. As a result, the chaotic streets of overhanging timber-framed houses of medieval and Stuart London were replaced with neat rows of uniformly proportioned brick terraces. A good surviving example of the kind of simple brick terraces built immediately after the fire can be found at [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in the [[Inner Temple]], becoming a blue print for the Georgian terraced house.\n\n====== St Paul's Cathedral and The City Churches ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 600\n| image1 = St_Paul's_Cathedral_Dome_from_One_New_Change_-_Square_Crop.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The \t365ft (111 m) high dome of St Paul's Cathedral completed in 1710.

Much like his masterplan for the reconstruction of the city, Wren's original design for the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was also rejected and a compromise design had to be reached as a result. Inspired by [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basillica]] in Rome, Wren originally wanted to build a domed baroque style cathedral built in a [[Greek Cross|Greek cross]] layout, but this design was rejected by the church as a result of the excessive [[papist]] connotations of this very Southern European design.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Dlu-zVHq0&t=2307s|title=Baroque: From St Peter's to St Paul's - Part Three (Art History Documentary)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an act of compromise, the design that was eventually built is a hybrid design which utilises baroque ornamentation and a great dome but built on the Latin cross layout of the [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|former gothic cathedral]]. Largely as a result of the awkward incorporation of a Latin cross layout in a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] design, the overall composition of the cathedral is considered to be inferior to most comparable baroque cathedrals of the same period, however, the 111-metre-high dome completed in 1710 is widely considered to be one of the greatest ever built, and has since become one of London's most enduring landmarks; it was also London's tallest building from 1710 until 1962.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main west facade with its double [[corinthian order]] and fine baroque towers is another successful feature of the exterior, with a great imposing scale when viewed up [[Ludgate Hill]]. \n[[File:St Mary-le-Bow (15667683845).jpg|thumb|The tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow]] (1683) Christopher Wren, one of the finest of the City Churches.]]\nThe [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 city churches]] (25 of which survive today) designed by Wren and his team are also of great architectural significance. Stylistically they are very eclectic and inventive designs, that were often built on very small and limiting sites. The towers of the churches are the most architecturally notable and inventive feature of the church exteriors. Perhaps the most notable examples are the unusual tiered spire of [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's Fleet Street]] the tallest of the city churches and the famous tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow|St-Mary-le-bow]], an inventive mixture of classicism and gothic. Stylistically most of the churches are not purely baroque in their style, the most notable exception being [[St Stephen Walbrook|St Stephen's Walbrook]] with its fine domed interior.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pevsner|first=Nikolaus|title=An Outline of European Architecture|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Many of the churches such as [[St Peter upon Cornhill|St Peter Upon Cornhill]] showcase a strong influence from Dutch classicism and [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], whereas others like [[St Mary Aldermary]] are purely [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] recreations of the former medieval churches, complete with a fan vaulted ceiling harking back to the [[English Gothic architecture|perpendicular gothic]] of the late Middle Ages. Despite the architectural merit of these individual buildings, perhaps the most significant achievement of Wren's reconstruction of St Paul's and the city churches was their overall interaction as an ensemble. Observing Canaletto's views of the [[City of London]] painted in 1750, one can see how [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] and the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] soar prominently above the rest of the city as a result of the tightly restricted height of all new domestic and commercial buildings in the city. The result is a highly picturesque skyline whose beauty astounded visitors to the newly reconstructed city.<ref name=\":2\" /> And so paradoxically, the great catastrophe that was the [[Great Fire of London]] can be considered in hindsight to have given a great new lease of life to London, as it gave a much-needed opportunity drastically improve and modernise the city. In the words of the architectural historian [[Simon Thurley|Dr Simon Thurley]]:\n\n\"This apparent catastrophe [...] was in reality one of the best things that ever happened to London. [...] The Great Fire of London enabled a new start - a new type of mass housing, handsome paved streets populated with modern churches and public buildings. There was a new [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], a new [[St Paul's Cathedral|Cathedral]], a rebuilt [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]]. London now was cleaner, more modern and more uniform that any other city in Europe [...] and it remained so until the mid 19th century.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|title=The Five Catastrophes That Made London - Professor Dr Simon Thurley|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZrzY0R_yz8|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====== Later Architectural Commissions: Royal Hospital Chelsea, Old Royal Naval College and The Commissioners Churches ======\n[[File:Christ Church exterior, Spitalfields, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|left|thumb|335x335px|[[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] (1729) showcasing the unusual style of [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]]]\n\nBut the reconstruction of London was not the only significant architectural commission of this period. [[Christopher Wren]], very much the preeminent architect of this period, was tasked with the design of two new military hospitals; the first being the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] for army veterans completed in 1692, and the latter of which being the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]] (latterly known as the [[Old Royal Naval College]]) completed in 1712. [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]] is one of Wren's more restrained works, with its red brick facades resembling long residential terraces. It nonetheless has a fine chapel and great hall with decorative interiors. In contrast [[Old Royal Naval College]] with its ornate Painted Hall, St Paul's Chapel and symmetrical east and west wings that frame [[Queen's House|Queens House]] by [[Inigo Jones]] is widely considered to be the crowning glory of the [[English Baroque]] movement. Now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], the site is described as \"the finest and most dramatically sited architectural ensemble and landscape ensemble in the British Isles.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/795/|title=Maritime Greenwich, UNESCO|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther fine examples of English Baroque in London can be found in the form of the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches|Commissioner's Churches]], 12 highly original churches that were built in response to a [[New Churches in London and Westminster Act 1710|1710 act of Parliament]] requesting the building of 50 new churches in London (the further 38 were not completed). The majority of these churches were designed by Wren's former assistant [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] who made significant contributions to the design of the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] and [[Old Royal Naval College]]. [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] is well known for his highly eccentric and idiosyncratic style that draws upon influences in Greek, Roman, Egyptian and even medieval architecture. Perhaps the most lauded and best known of these churches is [[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] (1729) which showcases [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor's]] trademark blend of baroque and gothic, as well his tendency to create buildings with an imposing sense of monumentality. Other Commissioner's Churches such as [[St Mary le Strand|St Mary-le-Strand]] by James Gibbs and [[St John's, Smith Square|St John's Smith Square]] by [[Thomas Archer]] are also superlative examples of late English [[Baroque architecture|Baroque Architecture]] showing a much stronger European influence than the designs of [[Christopher Wren|Wren]] or [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] whilst still maintaining a distinctly English sensibility.[[File:Old Royal Naval College 2017-08-06.jpg|thumb|1213x1213px|[[Old Royal Naval College|The Old Royal Naval College]] by [[Christopher Wren]] (1712) and [[Queen's House|Queens House]] (1635) by [[Inigo Jones]] viewed from the River Thames.]]<gallery>\nFile:PaternosterSquare-TempleBar.jpg|[[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] (1672) [[Christopher Wren]], originally on [[Fleet Street]] then moved to [[Paternoster Square]].

This great rise in prestige and wealth is reflected in London's significant growth in size and population in the 18th century. The city sprawled significantly, with substantial new development in areas in the west of the city such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Marylebone]], [[Mayfair]] and [[Kensington]], as well as in London's Satellite villages like [[Hampstead]], [[Islington]], [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] and [[Dulwich]]<ref name=\":1\" />[[St James's|.]] This development was centred around the construction of terraces and fashionable new squares like [[Grosvenor Square]], [[Portman Square]] and [[Bedford Square]], which became the new home of the burgeoning middle classes that emerged from Britain's new mercantile economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McxRTW1vCoE|title=London's Great Estates|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As well as this, with the construction of new bridges across the Thames at [[Westminster Bridge|Westminster]] (1750) and [[Blackfriars Bridge|Blackfriars]] (1769), the first new bridges since the early Middle Ages, the city began to spread significantly south of river. The style colloquially known as 'Georgian' refers to the British interpretation of 18th-century [[neoclassical architecture]], with stylistic routes that lay firmly in [[Palladian architecture]], particularly in the writings of Scottish architect [[Colen Campbell|Colen Campell.]] Often described as the 'father of the Georgian style', [[Colen Campbell|Campell's]] highly influential book [[Colen Campbell|Vitruvius Britannicus]] set the stylistic tone for [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] for the rest of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=Georgian London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=74}}</ref> This more restrained style was a reaction against the exuberant [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of the late 17th century, with a strict emphasis on plain unadorned brickwork, geometrical harmony and restrained classically inspired ornament. Despite this reactionary motive, Georgian architects nonetheless took great influence from [[Christopher Wren]] and other English Baroque architects. A precursor to the more unobtrusive Georgian style can be seen in the simple plain terraces built after the [[Great Fire of London]] at 4 [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in [[Temple, London|Temple]] or the plain brick facades of [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]], both by Wren. Key architects of the Georgian period who built substantial works in London include [[James Gibbs]], [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adam,]] [[William Kent]] and [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]].\n\n====== The Georgian Terraced House ======\n[[File:10 Downing Street. MOD 45155532.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The front door of [[10 Downing Street]] (1734), a classic example of a Georgian porch.]]\nResidential houses of this era in London are distinctive for their sunken basement built on brick arch foundations, [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] base storey, taller [[piano nobile]] reception floor and attic storey. They are generally built from buff (pale yellow) London Stock Brick to [[golden section]] proportions, often generously spanning triple bay frontages with 'implied' columns or [[pilasters]] and carefully proportioned and very large off-white [[sash windows]], slate [[mansard]] roofs above an [[Attic style|Attic]] [[pediment]]. They were grouped in formal [[garden square]]s, [[Crescent (architecture)|crescents]] and [[Terraced house|terraces]] with wide pavements supported on brick [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s on wide, straight public streets, often with private access to [[Romanticism|romantic]]ally landscaped gardens. Later encroachment of commercial properties has significantly reduced the apparent width of historic streets in many parts of London, where the original plans were comparable to in size or in excess of those found in Continental urban planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fet.uwe.ac.uk/conweb/house_ages/flypast/print.htm |title=Domestic Architecture 1700 to 1960 |publisher=Fet.uwe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-16}}</ref> The area of [[Spitalfields]] in East London has many extant early Georgian properties with some unusual continental features;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/culture/step-back-into-the-spitalfields-of-huguenots/8646533.article|title=Step back into the Spitalfields of Huguenots|first1=15|last1=April|first2=2013By James|last2=Pallister|website=Architects Journal}}</ref> [[Soho]] \u2013 particularly [[Meard Street]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols33-4/pp238-246|title=The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: Meard Street &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> and [[Westminster]] also preserve a large number of properties at an early stage of development of the style.[[File:Spencer House.jpg|thumb|298x298px|[[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] (1756) [[John Vardy]], the grandest surviving aristocratic [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] from the Georgian period.]]\n\nA typical house was designed to accommodate a single family, with front and back rooms on each floor and a partial-width rear 'closet' wing projection. The ground floor was reserved for business, the tall ''piano nobile'' for formal entertaining, and upper storeys with family bedrooms all accessed from a stair positioned on the side party{{clarify|date=January 2020}}. Servants were accommodated in the below-ground kitchen and in attic rooms in the roof. Each of the distinctions in function was subtly indicated in the decorative scheme of the fa\u00e7ade by the sequential height of openings, projecting cornices and restrained decorative mouldings such as round-headed arches and rustication at the base and diminishing columns, sculptural capitals, [[balustrades]] and friezes expressing the top.[[File:St Martin-in-the-Fields, July 2011.jpg|thumb|366x366px|[[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1726) by [[James Gibbs]]]]Features include:\n* A tall panelled front door with an arched [[fanlight]] often flanked by columns and covered by a pedimented canopy is reached up a short walkway which extends from the street, arching over the basement cavity and protected from burglary by a run of wrought iron security railings. \n* [[Sash windows]] which allow the window to be held open on corded lead weights to ventilate the room. Developed in [[Holland]] and first seen in the Royal Palaces, they became common in Georgian times; previously [[casement window]]s had been the norm. The sash box joinery and [[ovolo]] or [[astragal]] moulded window frames were designed to be as slim and unobtrusive as achievable, using the largest available sheets of glass in either a \"6 over 6\" or \"6 over 9\" pattern. Since the 1980s, these are often now painted in brilliant white; however this modern colour did not exist in the period: originally they were painted ivory off-white, pale yellow or other darker colours of the period.\n* Window openings in the proportion of 1:2 or the [[golden section]]; the windows were headed by the Dutch style [[flat arch]] often made from [[gauged brickwork]] in the finest properties.\n* The roof is often hidden by a [[parapet]] above an [[attic]] frieze. This was initially to reduce the spread of fire; however, in much of London, parapets were added to Georgian houses for aesthetic reasons alone. From the street, the building appears to have a flat roof, but from the rear one can see that there is a double pitched 'butterfly' roof. \n*Elevational classical adornments such as [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]], [[pilaster]]s, [[columns]], [[medallions]], [[friezes]], [[cornices]] and false [[pediments]] often formed in timber, [[stucco]] or natural stone are obvious indicators of wealth and status; however, much care and restraint was exercised to avoid the excessive flamboyance of continental architecture, with a marked preference for severe simplicity, honesty of means and sparseness of ornament in line with [[Protestant]] and neo-Palladian thinking, best exemplified by the work of [[Scottish Enlightenment]] architect [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adams]] \u2013 a philosophy extended to interior furnishing by the [[Thomas Chippendale]] furniture.\n* Suburban buildings are usually constructed from [[London stock brick]], in a yellowish buff colour (which often appears grey \u2013 see [[10 Downing Street]]). More prestigious houses are rendered with [[stucco]] or built from imported natural stone.\n*Chimney breasts were located in shared party walls, with gable parapets projecting above the roof line. The great number of chimney pots on London properties indicates the relative wealth of the inhabitants, serving fireplaces in every room.[[File:Somerset House New Wing entrance.jpg|thumb|444x444px|The Western facade of [[Somerset House]] (1776) [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]]]\n\n====== The Georgian Townhouse ======\nBut Georgian houses in London did not just come in the form of simple terraces. Many much more sumptuous homes known as [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]] were built as city residences for the nobility and gentry as opposed to their [[English country house|country house]] or stately home. The grandest of the London townhouses were [[Single-family detached home|stand-alone buildings]] like [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] but some were [[Terraced house|terraced buildings]] such as [[Chandos House]]. In the Georgian period many of these grand houses once lined [[Piccadilly]] and [[Park Lane]] but the majority of these were demolished as they went out of fashion in the late 19th and early 20th century, including the famous [[Devonshire House]] on Piccadilly. The few that do survive to this day include [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Burlington House]], [[Apsley House]], [[Chandos House]], [[Cambridge House]], Melbourne House, [[Marlborough House]] and [[Lancaster House]]. As well as this in the Greater London area a number of fine stately homes from the Georgian period can be found. These include the Palladian villa [[Chiswick House]] with its famous landscape gardens by William Kent and [[Syon House]] with its lavish interiors by [[Robert Adam]].\n\n====== Georgian Church and Civic Architecture ======\n\nAn array of notable civic, commercial and religious structures were also built in the Georgian period. Churches of the Georgian period were still very heavily influenced by the work of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] who had pioneered the use of [[classical architecture]] in church design in England with his [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]]. But with the declining popularity of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], Georgian church design took a more restrained [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] approach than [[Christopher Wren|Wren]]. Arguably the most famous church of the period is [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1722) by [[James Gibbs]]. Often described as the archetypal church of the Georgian period, [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] is a simple neoclassical 'temple church' with restrained Palladian ornament on its exterior and a tall spire that evokes memories of Wren's City Churches. Its format was much copied across England and abroad. [[St Peter, Vere Street]] (1722) also by [[James Gibbs]] is a further indicator of the increasing simplicity of church design in the 18th century.\n\n[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] also dominated civic architecture in the Georgian period in London. This is exemplified by [[William Kent]]'s [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] on Whitehall (1750), an essay in the austere [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style of mid-18th century. Arguably the most significant secular architectural commission of Georgian London was [[Somerset House]], a collection of government offices on [[Strand, London|the Strand]] that was to replace a 16th-century house of the same name on the site. The resulting building was designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chamber]]<nowiki/>s and completed in 1776. The building is built in a quadrangle with a grand courtyard in the centre. On the south side of the exterior there is a grand terrace overlooking the River Thames and at ground level a watergate that would have once faced directly onto the River Thames before the construction of the [[Victoria Embankment]].\n\nNew bridges across the River Thames were also built in the Georgian period; the first bridges built in London since the early Middle Ages. These bridges included [[Westminster Bridge]] in 1750, [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in 1769 and [[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]] in 1777; all were built in a neoclassical style. With the exception of Richmond Bridge, all of these bridges have now been replaced. These bridges were highly significant as [[London Bridge]] had been the only bridge across the river for over 500 years. Their construction greatly encouraged development south of the river.<gallery>\nFile:Queen Anne's Gate 01.JPG|[[Queen Anne's Gate]], Westminster (1701).

This is aesthetically distinct from early Georgian architecture, though it falls within the scope of Georgian architecture and continues the stylistic trend of Neoclassicism. Technically the [[Regency era]] only lasted between 1811 and 1820, when the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] ruled as proxy for his incapacitated father George III, but the distinctive trends in art and architecture in fashion during the Regency extended roughly into the first 40 years of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book| title=Georgian London| author=Sir John Summerson| year=1945| p=135}}</ref> Regency is above all a very stringent form of Classicism, directly referencing Graeco-Roman architecture and structures.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/style/georgian.shtml| title=Architectural Style: Georgian Architecture (1740\u20131830)| publisher=buildinghistory.org| access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> Regency employed enhanced ornamentation like [[frieze]]s with high and low [[relief]] figural or vegetative motifs, statuary, urns, and porticos, all the while keeping the clean lines and symmetry of early Georgian architecture.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-regency-classicism/| title=Style Guide: Regency Classicism| publisher=vam.ac.uk| year=2016| access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> Typically Georgian features like [[sash windows]] were retained, along with first-floor balconies, which became especially popular in the Regency period, with either delicate cast iron scrollwork or traditional [[baluster]]s.<ref name=\"Matthew Weinreb 1999\">{{cite book| title=London: Portrait of a City| author=Matthew Weinreb| publisher=Phaidon| year=1999| p=218}}</ref>[[File:Athenaeum Club, London -

The most enduring legacy of this relationship is [[Buckingham Palace]], which was transformed from the modest Buckingham House of George III's reign into a grand Neoclassical palace to Nash's designs. Beginning in 1825, Nash extended the existing house westwards and added two flanking wings, which created an open forecourt, or ''[[Cour d'honneur]]'', facing [[St. James's Park]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Buckingham Palace| author=Jonathan Marsden| publisher=Royal Collection Publications| year=2011| p=18\u201320}}</ref> The style is remarkably similar to Nash's terraces on the edges of Regents Park, except that the Palace was built in golden-hued [[Bath stone]] instead of stucco-faced brick.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\">{{NHLE| num=1000795| desc=Buckingham Palace | accessdate=2018-07-13}}</ref> The front fa\u00e7ade of the main block features a two-storey porch of Doric columns on the bottom, tall fluted Corinthian columns above, with a pediment topped by statuary and adorned in high-relief sculpture.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\"/> All the hallmarks of Regency Neoclassicism also appear, including an encompassing frieze with vegetative scrollwork made of [[Coade stone]], balconies accessible from the first floor, and an attic with figural sculptures using the Elgin Marbles as their model. The west front overlooking the main garden features a bay window at its centre, with a long terrace with balustrades and large Classical urns made of Coade stone.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\"/> Preceding{{clarify|date=January 2020}} the forecourt was a monumental Roman arch, modelled on the ''[[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]]'' in Paris, which currently stands as the [[Marble Arch]] at the north-eastern corner of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Buckingham Palace| author=Jonathan Marsden| publisher=Royal Collection Publications| year=2011| p=27}}</ref> The addition of the East Wing early in the reign of Queen Victoria enclosed the forecourt and created the frontage of Buckingham Palace known ever since, but the bulk of the Palace exterior remains from Nash's Regency additions, particularly the long garden front on the west side.\n\nContemporaneous to Nash's building work in Regent's Park and St. James', the development of [[Belgravia]] further west offers the most uniform and extensive example of Regency architecture in London in the form of [[Belgrave Square]], [[Eaton Square]], [[Wilton Crescent]] and [[Chester Square]].

A '''Commissioners' church''', also known as a '''Waterloo church''' and '''Million Act church''', is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church built with money voted by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a result of the [[Church Building Act]]s of 1818 and 1824. The 1818 Act supplied a grant of money and established the Church Building Commission to direct its use, and in 1824 made a further grant of money. The First Parliamentary Grant for churches amounted to \u00a31 million (equivalent to \u00a373,550,000 in 2019), which is why the 1818 Act that provided for it is sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the '''Million Pound Act'''. The Second Parliamentary Grant of 1824 amounted to an additional \u00a3500,000 (\u00a344,320,000 in 2019), so the term \"million\" cannot apply to all the churches aided by the Commission. The Commission was founded on a wave of national triumph following the defeat of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815; hence the suggestion of the word \"Waterloo\" in the title. Commissioner's churches in London include [[All Souls Church, Langham Place|All Souls, Langham Place]] by John Nash; the church's unusual circular tower was deliberately placed on a bend on Nash's Regents Street to create a picturesque view from [[Oxford Circus]], the fine neoclassical [[St Mary, Bryanston Square|St Mary's, Bryanston Square]] by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] and [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea|St Luke's, Chelsea]] one of London's first Gothic-revival churches; an indication of the shift of a style away from neoclassicism that was to occur later in the 19th century.

There was little coherent urban planning in London during the Victorian era, apart from major infrastructure projects like the [[Thames Embankment]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. Critics compared London to cities like [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]], where state intervention and large scale demolition had created a more regular arrangement, with broad boulevards, panoramas and architectural uniformity.

These include [[The Dorchester]] (Art Deco) and the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] (Neo-Georgian) on Park Lane, both on the sites of grand London houses of the same names. Many buildings clustered around Georgian squares in central London were demolished and replaced, ironically enough, with Neo-Georgian edifices in near-identical styles but larger. [[Grosvenor Square]], the most exclusive of London's squares, saw the demolition of original Georgian buildings in favour of the uniform Neo-Georgian townhouses which currently surround the square on the north, east and south sides.<ref name=\"Simon Thurley\"/> In [[St James's Square]] several buildings were demolished and rebuilt in the Neo-Georgian style, the most famous of which was [[Norfolk House]].<ref>{{cite article| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols29-30/pt1/pp187-202| title=St. James's Square: No 31, Norfolk House| publisher=british-history.ac.uk| access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Express Building (1).jpg|thumb|The Art Deco [[Daily Express Building, London|Daily Express Building]] (1932) was one of the first glass curtain wall buildings in London.]][[Neo-Classical architecture]] remained popular for large building projects in London, but it dispensed with the heavy ornamentation and bold proportions of the Baroque.

Following an over ten-year gap, [[One Canada Square]] was completed in 1991 at 235 metres (771&nbsp;ft) and formed the centrepiece of the [[Canary Wharf]] development, which itself is part of the [[Isle of Dogs]] and can be considered the east-side of Central London. The development's main tower [[One Canada Square]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the encouragement of [[Ken Livingstone]] who was [[Mayor of London]] from 2000 to 2008, a renewed trend for building tall was established in the 2000s. Following another over 10-year gap, [[8 Canada Square]] and [[25 Canada Square]], both standing at 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft), were completed at Canary Wharf in 2002. Several others of a smaller height followed at Canary Wharf including: [[Heron Quays]], [[40 Bank Street]] in 2003 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft), [[10 Upper Bank Street]] in 2003 at 151 metres (495&nbsp;ft), and [[25 Bank Street]] in 2004 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft).

Notably, some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the [[Emporis Skyscraper Award]] in 2003 and the [[Stirling Prize|RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture]] in 2004.\n[[File:Ayuntamiento y Shard, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 076.JPG|thumb|396x396px|(left) [[City Hall, London|City Hall]] (2002) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]] and (right) The Shard (2012) Renzo Piano, two notable works of [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] and [[Neo-futurism|neo-futurist]] architecture.]]\n[[Boris Johnson]] who was Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016 approved the construction of more skyscrapers in London. [[The Shard]] topped out in 2012 at [[London Bridge]] and at 309.6 metres (1,016&nbsp;ft) remains London's tallest building. In 2014, the 225 metres (738&nbsp;ft) tall [[122 Leadenhall Street]], nicknamed \"the Cheesegrater\", was completed in the City of London. In September, 2016 a refit was completed of the 111m King's Reach Tower, originally built in the 1970s, which included an 11-storey height increase to bring it up to 150 metres (490&nbsp;ft) tall and it was renamed the [[South Bank Tower]]. [[One Blackfriars]], also located on the [[South Bank]], topped out in 2017 at 163 metres (535&nbsp;ft). [[The Scalpel]], at 190 metres (620&nbsp;ft) was completed in the City of London in 2018 and it was designed to protect views of St Paul's Catherdral. [[Newfoundland Quay]], at 220 metres (720&nbsp;ft) and [[Landmark Pinnacle]] at 233 metres (764&nbsp;ft) topped out in Canary Wharf in 2018 and 2019 respectively. [[One Park Drive]] at 205 metres (673&nbsp;ft) and [[South Quay Plaza]] at 215 metres (705&nbsp;ft) both also topped out at Canary Wharf in 2019. [[22 Bishopsgate]], at 278 metres (912&nbsp;ft) topped out in the City of London in 2019, after being approved by the current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]], in 2016.\n\n[[1 Undershaft]], at 290 metres (950&nbsp;ft), also approved by Sadiq Khan in 2016, is planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster. It is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London and will only be exceeded in height by The Shard. It will be built on the site of the aforementioned 1969 St Helen's building which will be demolished. [[100 Leadenhall]], at 249 metres (817&nbsp;ft), and already nicknamed the \"Cheesegrater 2\", is also planned for the City of London. [[Spire London]], at 235 metres (771&nbsp;ft) is planned for Canary Wharf. However, construction was halted after concerns that the building only had one escape stairwell for residents on the upper floors. The tallest of the two [[Riverside South (Canary Wharf)|Riverside South]] towers that have been planned for construction at Canary Wharf since 2008 would have exceeded that cluster's tallest building, One Canada Square, by 1 metre in height, but construction has been stalled since 2011. Construction has started on the 216 metres (709&nbsp;ft) tall [[Alpha Square|Consort Place]] (previously called Alpha Square) also at Canary Wharf.\n\nThere is another major skyscraper cluster emerging in the [[Vauxhall]] and [[Nine Elms]] districts of London. The first skyscraper to appear here was [[St George Wharf Tower]] at 181 metres (594&nbsp;ft) and which was completed in 2014. The tallest tower planned for this cluster is the 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft) [[One Nine Elms|One Nine Elms City Tower]]. In 2019, Sadiq Khan blocked the construction of the 290 metre tall [[Tulip (tower)|Tulip]] that would have been built in the City of London. However, in January, 2020, the developers of the tower launched an appeal against Khan's decision which is to be considered at a public inquiry in the middle of the year.<gallery>\nFile:Tower 42 looking north from Bishopsgate 2011-05-04.jpg|[[Tower 42|Natwest Tower]] \"Tower 42\" (1980)\nFile:Lloyd's insurance exterior at night.jpg|[[Lloyd's building]] (1986)\nFile:Charingcross-eye s.jpg|[[Charing Cross railway station|Charring Cross Station]] (1990) [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] \nFile:London MMB S6 Canary Wharf.jpg|[[One Canada Square]] (1991)\nFile:SIS building (26327425611).jpg|[[SIS Building]] (1996) [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]], a notable work of postmodern architecture.\nFile:British library london.jpg|[[British Library]] (1997)\nFile:No 1 Poultry (1398376326).jpg|[[No 1 Poultry|No.1 Poultry]] (1997) [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]\nFile:O2 Arena.jpg|[[Millennium Dome|The Millennium Dome]] (1999) [[Richard Rogers]]\nFile:British Museum Great Court, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|[[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court, British Museum]] (2000) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]]\nFile:London City Hall.jpg|[[City Hall, London]] (2002) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]]\nFile:HSBC Building London.jpg|[[8 Canada Square]] (2002)\nFile:Citigroup EMEA Centre.jpg|[[Citigroup Centre, London|25 Canada Square]] (2003)\nFile:30 St Mary Axe from Leadenhall Street.jpg|[[30 St Mary Axe]] (2003) [[Foster and Partners]]\nFile:Wembley-STadion 2013.JPG|[[Wembley Stadium]] (2007) [[Foster and Partners]]\nFile:Heron Tower, Bishopsgate, London.JPG|[[Heron Tower]] (2007) [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]]\nFile:Willis Building (London).jpg|[[Willis Building (London)|Willis Building]] (2008) [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]\nFile:Broadgate Tower.jpg|[[Broadgate Tower]] (2008)\nFile:Orbit Tower - Aquatics Centre.jpg|[[London Aquatics Centre]] (2012)\nFile:King's Cross Western Concourse - central position - 2012-05-02.75.jpg|Concourse, [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross Railway Station]] (2012)\nFile:The Shard from the Sky Garden 2015.jpg|[[The Shard]] (2012)\nFile:Cheesegrater and Gherkin.jpg|[[122 Leadenhall Street]] (2014)\nFile:St Georges Wharf Tower 2013-09-26.jpg|[[St George Wharf Tower|St George's Wharf Tower]] (2014)\nFile:Walkie-Talkie - Sept 2015.jpg|[[20 Fenchurch Street]] (2015)\nFile:Tate Modern Switch House (27633103611).jpg|[[Tate Modern|Switch House, Tate Modern]] (2016)\nFile:The Scalpel, August 2018.jpg|[[The Scalpel]] (2018)\nFile:One Blackfriars, The Shard and South Bank Tower - from Waterloo Bridge - 2019-01-04 - Afternoon.jpg|[[One Blackfriars]] (left) (2018)\nFile:22BishopsgateDec19.png|[[22 Bishopsgate]] (2019) \n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|London}}\n* [[List of tallest buildings and structures in London]]\n* [[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n===Sources===\n* Marianne Butler, ''London Architecture'', metropublications, 2006\n* Billings, Henrietta, ''Brutalist London Map'', [[Blue crow media|Blue Crow Media]], 2015\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Architecture of London}}\n* [http://archiseek.com/category/buildings/england/london-uk-buildings/ Architecture of London] From Archiseek.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161002021609/http://www.desarch.co.uk/projects/ Architecture of London Projects] from Design Architecture Limited\n* [https://bluecrowmedia.com/products/brutalist-london-map/ Brutalist Architecture in London] from [[Blue crow media]]\n* [https://bluecrowmedia.com/collections/architecture-maps/products/art-deco-london-map/ Art Deco Architecture in London] from [[Blue crow media]]\n\n{{Architecture of England}}\n{{London landmarks}}\n\n[[Category:London architecture| ]]\n[[Category:Architecture in the United Kingdom by city|London]]\n[[Category:History of the built environment of London]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Parliament at Sunset.JPG|thumb|right|338x338px|[[Palace of Westminster]] (1840\u201370) by [[Charles Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin]], one of London's most iconic works of architecture and a masterpiece of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] movement.]]\n[[File:London Greenwich.JPG|thumb|339x339px|[[Queen's House|Queens House]] (1633) [[Inigo Jones|Indigo Jones]] (centre) and [[Old Royal Naval College]] (1712) Christopher Wren, a masterpiece of the [[English Baroque|English Baroque Movement]]]]\n[[London]] is the largest and capital city of [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Founded as the ancient city of [[Londinium]] in the first century CE by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as capital of the Roman province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], London has been an inhabited settlement almost continuously since. After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in the 5th century, the layout of the Roman settlement became the approximate blueprint of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Medieval London|medieval city]]. This ancient core of London is known as the [[City of London]] with [[Westminster]], the ancient centre of political power in London, lying to the west. Relatively few structures survive from London's medieval past due to the city's near-total destruction in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]], but notable survivors include the [[Tower of London]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Westminster Hall]], [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], [[St James's Palace]], [[Lambeth Palace]] and a handful of scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivals. After the Great Fire, London was transformed as it was rebuilt and greatly modernised under the direction of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]], with the new Baroque [[St Paul's Cathedral]] as its centrepiece. After a period of dramatic expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries, London reached its zenith as the world's largest and populous city from 1831 to 1925, as well as being the capital of the [[British Empire]] at its greatest extent and power. In this period London sprawled vastly beyond its historical boundaries, absorbing many formerly rural settlements and creating vast suburbs. The city was also transformed by groundbreaking new infrastructure projects like the [[West India Docks]] which affirmed London's status as a major port, a system of canals which included the [[Regent's Canal]], [[London sewerage system|a modern sewage system]], some of the world's first intercity railway termini such as [[London Paddington station|Paddington Station]], and [[London Underground|the world's first underground railway system]]. These innovations set London apart as the pre-eminent city of the [[Industrial Age|industrial age]]. After suffering significant destruction during by [[The Blitz]] of [[World War II]] and a period of economic decline in the [[History of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|post-war]] period, London is once again a global capital of culture and commerce, with much new development adding to its eclectic cityscape.\n\nLondon contains a very wide variety of architectural styles from a variety of historical periods. London's great architectural eclecticism stems from its long history, constant redevelopment, destruction caused by [[The Blitz]] and historical government recognition of private property rights which often prevented large scale state planning. This sets London apart from other great European capitals like [[Paris]], [[Vienna]] and [[Rome]] which are more architecturally homogenous and were more rationally planned. London's eclectic architectural heritage ranges from Roman archaeological remains, the great medieval fortress the [[Tower of London]], the 13th-century gothic of [[Westminster Abbey]], the opulent [[English Baroque|baroque]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the elegant neoclassicism of [[Somerset House]], the urban set piece of [[Regent Street]], the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian High Gothic]] of [[St Pancras railway station]], the [[Art Deco|art deco]] [[Hoover Building]], the austere [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]] of the [[Barbican Estate]] and the [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] skyscraper [[30 St Mary Axe]].\n\nBeing the capital of the [[United Kingdom]], London contains many of the most important buildings of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British State]], [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|The Monarchy]] and [[Church of England|The Church of England]]. These include the [[Palace of Westminster]]; the centre of British democracy, [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham Palace;]] the official residence of the British Monarchy and [[Westminster Abbey]]; the site of all coronations of English and British monarchs since 1066. London also contains numerous [[monument]]s such as the ancient heart of London at [[London Stone]], the 17th-century [[The Monument|Monument]] to the Great Fire of London, [[Marble Arch]], [[Wellington Arch]], the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is an internationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], often regarded as the centre of London.\n[[File:Westminster Abbey London 8.jpg|thumb|339x339px|[[Westminster Abbey]], a predominantly 13th-14th century [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] abbey, one of London's most significant surviving buildings from the middle ages.]]\nThroughout most of London's history, the height of buildings has been restricted. These restrictions gradually eroded in the post-war period (except those protecting certain views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]) and high rise buildings have become ever more numerous since, particularly in the 21st century. Skyscrapers are now numerous in the [[City of London]] financial district and [[Canary Wharf]]: a new financial district created in the 1980s and 90s in the former London [[London Docklands|docklands]] area of the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Notable recent tall buildings include the 1980s skyscraper [[Tower 42]], the radical [[Lloyd's building]] by [[Richard Rogers]], [[One Canada Square]]; the centre piece of the Canary Wharf district and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (nicknamed the \"Gherkin\") which has set a precedent for other recent high-rise developments built in a similar [[High-tech architecture|high-tech style]].

But after the [[Boudica]]n Revolt of 61, when both cities were razed to the ground, the capital was removed to London, which rapidly grew to pre-eminence with the establishment of a [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]] and a provincial [[Praetorium]]. The city was originally laid out to a [[planned city|classical plan]] like many other cities in [[Britannia]] and throughout Europe, in a roughly rectangular form with the south side formed by the River Thames, and divided into blocks of [[insulae]].<ref>London Archaeology; Vol 15 Spring 2018</ref> Two east\u2013west streets (now [[Cheapside]] and [[Lower Thames Street]]) led from [[Newgate]] and [[Ludgate]] to form the [[cardo]], presumably leading to a lost gate (or gates) at the present location of the [[Tower of London]] with the road to [[Canterbury]] and [[Dover]]. An extension of Watling Street formed the [[decumanus maximus]], crossing the river from [[Billingsgate]] over the ancient [[London Bridge]] to [[Southwark]] and the south coast road beyond.

In the medieval period, the city lay predominantly within the boundaries of the city walls originally built by the Romans \u2013 the area now known as [[City of London|The City of London]] \u2013 with [[Westminster]] being a separate much smaller settlement to the west. Some aristocratic houses were constructed along the [[Strand, London|Strand]] which connected the two settlements. There was also some development on the south bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]] at [[Southwark]] with the famous [[London Bridge]] connecting the district to the rest of London as well as being the gateway to the South East of England. The earliest record of [[London Bridge|London bridge]] dates from the 10th century, a structure probably built of wood, but the most famous incarnation of this bridge was constructed between 1176 and 1209. This was a stone bridge 900&nbsp;ft wide and consisting of 19 arches, complete with its own street of shops, houses, a chapel and a drawbridge in the centre to allow large boat traffic pass through.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=124}}</ref> The River Thames was an important means of transportation within the city, as well as providing access to overseas trade by sea, with many wharfs and quays built along the north bank of the river.\n\n====== Norman and Gothic Architecture ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| total_width = 620\n| image1 = Tower_of_London_viewed_from_the_River_Thames.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The White Tower (1080) the romanesque central keep of the tower of London complex.\n| image2 = Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg\n| caption2 = An aerial view of The Tower of London complex, which reached it's current form c.14th century\n| header = The Tower of London\n}}\nMany of medieval London's most significant structures were initially constructed by the [[Normans]], who recognised the importance of architecture as a means of demonstrating their power and of subordinating the native Saxon population after [[Norman conquest of England|their conquest of England]]. The [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] was a major turning point in the history of [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] as they brought with them a new European [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style \nand a greater architectural ambition than their [[Saxons|Saxon]] predecessors. Almost immediately after their conquest of England the Normans built several fortresses along the River Thames in the centre of the London to consolidate their power, the most notable of which being [[Baynard's Castle]] which was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]] and the [[Tower of London]] which still survives today.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108}}</ref> The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]], the central keep of the Tower of London complex, was completed in the 1080s and built in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. Also of note within The White Tower is the chapel of [[St John's Chapel, London|St John's]], one of the oldest and least altered Romanesque churches in all of England.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clapham|first=A.W|title=English Romanesque Architecture|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The only other surviving [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in central London is [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in Smithfield, the remains of a former much larger priory church.\n\nAnother significant London structure initially constructed by the Normans is [[Westminster Hall]]. Completed in 1097 in the reign of [[William II of England|William II]] as a royal residence, the hall become the foundation of the [[Palace of Westminster]], a complex which gradually expanded throughout the Middle Ages. The hall was largely rebuilt in the reign of Richard II and became the largest such hall in medieval Europe. It is notable for its exceptionally wide span [[hammerbeam roof]] added in the 14th century, widely considered to be a marvel of medieval engineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE81VeStEFg&t=311s|title=Dan Cruickshank explores the Palace of Westminster|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Miraculously [[Westminster Hall]] still survives today having escaped the fire of 1834 which destroyed the majority of the medieval Palace of Westminster; it was then incorporated into [[Charles Barry|Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin|Pugin]]'s [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] [[Palace of Westminster]] who admired it's authentic gothic style. Other surviving examples of medieval halls in London can be found in the form of [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] (1440) which once served as London's city hall (it was greatly altered after [[Great Fire of London|the great fire]]) and the Old Hall of [[Lincoln's Inn]] (1492).\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| image1 = Towers of Westminster Abbey.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = (left) Twin Towers of the west front, c.18th century.\n| image2 = Westminster abbey.jpg\n| caption2 = (centre) North portal c.14th century.\n| image 3 = \n| image3 = London - Westminster abbey - chapter house 03.jpg\n| img_gap = 200\n| caption3 = (right) Chapter house c.14th century\n| caption_align = \n| header = Westminster Abbey\n}}\n\n[[Normans|The Normans]] also began the construction of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] on [[Ludgate Hill]], replacing a primitive [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] timber framed building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=136}}</ref> By the time of its completion in the 14th century the cathedral included elements of [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture]] alongside the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] nave constructed by the Normans.

The sophisticated [[gothic architecture]] of the abbey is reminiscent of French Cathedrals like that of [[Reims Cathedral|Reims]] rather than the [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] of the period, leading to much speculation as to whether the master mason was French.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Webb|first=Geoffrey|title=Architecture of Britain in the Middle Ages|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=109}}</ref>  The most significant later addition to the abbey was the [[Henry VII Chapel]] built in the late 15th to early 16th century, an exceptional example of late [[English Gothic architecture]] notable for its highly ornate [[fan vault]]ed ceiling. The twin-towered west front of the abbey was added in the 18th century to the designs of [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] in a faithful [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style intended to be in keeping with the rest of the medieval building. Other significant [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] churches surviving from the Middle Ages include [[Southwark Cathedral]], a former priory that was the first gothic church in London built between 1220 and 1420, as well as a handful of city churches that miraculously survived the great fire like [[St Andrew Undershaft]], [[St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate|St Helen's Bishopsgate]], [[St Olave's Church, Hart Street|St Olave's Hart Street]] and [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]].\n\n====== Tudor Architecture ======\n[[File:Great Gate, Hampton Court Palace.jpg|thumb|290x290px|[[Hampton Court Palace]] (1515\u20131540) residence of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] then [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]],]]A significant proportion of London's surviving architecture from the Middle Ages dates from the [[Tudor period]]. The Tudor period was a period of rapid expansion for London, both economically as a result of growing overseas trade and in terms of population which grew dramatically from roughly 50,000 in 1500 to 250,000 in 1600. As a result of this population boom the city sprawled considerably and by the end of the 16th century the majority of London's population lived outside the city walls for the first time.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Edward|title=A Guide to the Architecture of London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Henry VII and Henry VIII also commissioned a substantial number of royal works including the extension and construction of several palaces, these included the massive [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall Palace]] that stretched all the way from Westminster Hall to what is now [[Trafalgar Square]], the extravagant [[Nonsuch Palace]] in Greenwich and [[St James's Palace]] which survives today. By far the most substantial surviving Tudor palace in Greater London is [[Hampton Court Palace]], originally built for [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] and then later becoming a residence of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Greatly extended by Christopher Wren in the late 17th century, the palace still retains most of its original Tudor architecture with its original 16th-century great hall, chapel, astronomical clock and gatehouses; it is often regarded as the finest example of [[Tudor architecture|Tudor Architecture]] in England.<ref name=\":1\" /> Henry VIII also greatly influenced the current form of central London by establishing the hunting grounds of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[St James's Park]] giving London its exceptionally green city centre which survives to this day.

Examples of this can be seen in the form of the Tudor gatehouse of [[Lambeth Palace]] (1495) the London residence of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|The Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Lincoln's Inn]] (1521) and  [[St James's Palace]] (1536). [[Tudor architecture]] however is most closely associated with its distinctive vernacular houses which were typically timber framed and filled with [[wattle and daub]] giving the houses a black and white 'checkerboard' appearance. Most commercial and domestic buildings in London before [[Great Fire of London|the great fire]] resembled this from. Only a tiny handful of such buildings survive to this day including [[Staple Inn]]; an [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]] dating back to the [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] period, 41 [[Cloth Fair]]; central London's oldest house started in 1597 and [[Prince Henry's Room]]; a timber-framed [[jettying|jettied]] townhouse built in 1610. Although the vast majority of such structures were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] many timber-framed houses did, in fact, survive until as late as the late 19th and early 20th centuries but were demolished to make way for new development.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Daview|first=Phillip|title=Lost London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> A famous example of this is the demolition of [[Wych Street]] in the Edwardian period to make way for [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]], a new road built between the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and [[High Holborn]].<gallery>\nFile:White Tower, City of London.jpg|[[White Tower (Tower of London)|The White Tower]] (1080) the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] central keep of the [[Tower of London]].\nFile:Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg|[[Tower of London|The Tower of London]] fortress complex.

The pre-eminent architect in this architectural miletstone was [[Inigo Jones]], who was appointed Surveyor of the King's Works in 1615. Having travelled around Italy and owning a copy of ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' by [[Andrea Palladio]], Jones was one of the first English architects to be firmly influenced by [[classical architecture]], both of [[Classical architecture|classical antiquity]] and the [[Neoclassical architecture|revival of the style]] epitomised by the work of Italian architect [[Andrea Palladio]] his strongest influence. His first completed major work in inner London was [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]] (1622), an extension to the mostly medieval [[Palace of Whitehall]], with a Palladian portland stone facade and a fine painted ceiling by the famous Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. As the first truly classical building in London \u2013 a then primitive predominantly timber-framed medieval city \u2013 it is an extremely significant building in the history of London's Architecture, described by Eric de Mare as.\n\n\"an architectural innovation that must have startled Londoners with its sophisticated Palladian Masonry, for its main fa\u00e7ades containing rhythmical rows of tall windows, carved decorations and classical pilasters, all in mathematically, carefully proportioned precision, must have seemed to them like a stage set than a building.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wren's London|last=Eric|first=De Mare|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London.jpg|thumb|292x292px|[[St Paul's, Covent Garden]] (1633) Indigo Jones, London's first classical church and the centre piece of Jones's Covent Garden piazza.]]\n\nAnother royal commission [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] was completed in 1633 and again shows Jones's purist [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style that did not mirror the exuberant [[Baroque]] which was then fashionable in mainland Europe. But perhaps Jones' most significant architectural commission was the redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] in West London. In 1630 Jones was commissioned by the Earl of Bedford to redevelop the area in the west of the city with fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Between 1630 and 1633 Jones designed and constructed London's first modern square; a classical style piazza lined with colonnaded terraced houses and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] on the Western side; the first church in London built in a classical style notable for it's monumental tuscan portico. The piazza became a blueprint for the fashionable squares built across the [[West End of London]] in the [[Georgian era]] and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] was an architectural blueprint for the baroque [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|city churches]] built by Wren after the [[Great Fire of London]]. The outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642 greatly interrupted building activity in England and after the parliamentarian victory Jones was heavily fined due to his close connections to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He later died in poverty in 1652.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Outline of English Architecture|last=Gardner|first=A.

Despite this plan's rejection, London was still greatly modernised in its reconstruction.|alt=]]\n\nThe [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666 destroyed almost 90% of the largely medieval city, including a total of 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 [[Livery Company|Company]] Halls, the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[Bridewell Palace]] and other City prisons, the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Letter Office]], and the three western city gates; [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], and [[Aldersgate]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Fire of London|last=Porter|first=Stephen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Although the Great Fire is considered to be a cataclysmic event in the history of London, the enormous destruction it caused also presented a historic opportunity to completely replan and modernise the somewhat primitive, predominantly medieval city in its subsequent reconstruction. Radical classical style reconstruction plans were quickly drawn up by architects such as Christopher Wren which proposed to completely discard the city's chaotic medieval street plan in favour of a rationalised grid system with wide boulevards, piazzas and a uniform classical style for all new buildings. However, due to a shortage of labour necessary to complete such grandiose plans, complications with redistributing and compensating property that had been lost in the fire, as well as the intense urgency of rebuilding the city as quickly as possible, it was thus decided to rebuild the city around the original medieval street plan.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the rejection of a classical style replanning of the city, London nonetheless witnessed a radical architectural transformation in its subsequent reconstruction. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the new city compared to its predecessor was its architectural uniformity. In 1667 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] specified that all new houses were to be built to a uniform height and plot size, as well all being built of brick rather than wood to reduce fire hazard. As a result, the chaotic streets of overhanging timber-framed houses of medieval and Stuart London were replaced with neat rows of uniformly proportioned brick terraces. A good surviving example of the kind of simple brick terraces built immediately after the fire can be found at [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in the [[Inner Temple]], becoming a blue print for the Georgian terraced house.\n\n====== St Paul's Cathedral and The City Churches ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 600\n| image1 = St_Paul's_Cathedral_Dome_from_One_New_Change_-_Square_Crop.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The \t365ft (111 m) high dome of St Paul's Cathedral completed in 1710.

Much like his masterplan for the reconstruction of the city, Wren's original design for the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was also rejected and a compromise design had to be reached as a result. Inspired by [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basillica]] in Rome, Wren originally wanted to build a domed baroque style cathedral built in a [[Greek Cross|Greek cross]] layout, but this design was rejected by the church as a result of the excessive [[papist]] connotations of this very Southern European design.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Dlu-zVHq0&t=2307s|title=Baroque: From St Peter's to St Paul's - Part Three (Art History Documentary)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an act of compromise, the design that was eventually built is a hybrid design which utilises baroque ornamentation and a great dome but built on the Latin cross layout of the [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|former gothic cathedral]]. Largely as a result of the awkward incorporation of a Latin cross layout in a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] design, the overall composition of the cathedral is considered to be inferior to most comparable baroque cathedrals of the same period, however, the 111-metre-high dome completed in 1710 is widely considered to be one of the greatest ever built, and has since become one of London's most enduring landmarks; it was also London's tallest building from 1710 until 1962.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main west facade with its double [[corinthian order]] and fine baroque towers is another successful feature of the exterior, with a great imposing scale when viewed up [[Ludgate Hill]]. \n[[File:St Mary-le-Bow (15667683845).jpg|thumb|The tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow]] (1683) Christopher Wren, one of the finest of the City Churches.]]\nThe [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 city churches]] (25 of which survive today) designed by Wren and his team are also of great architectural significance. Stylistically they are very eclectic and inventive designs, that were often built on very small and limiting sites. The towers of the churches are the most architecturally notable and inventive feature of the church exteriors. Perhaps the most notable examples are the unusual tiered spire of [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's Fleet Street]] the tallest of the city churches and the famous tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow|St-Mary-le-bow]], an inventive mixture of classicism and gothic. Stylistically most of the churches are not purely baroque in their style, the most notable exception being [[St Stephen Walbrook|St Stephen's Walbrook]] with its fine domed interior.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pevsner|first=Nikolaus|title=An Outline of European Architecture|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Many of the churches such as [[St Peter upon Cornhill|St Peter Upon Cornhill]] showcase a strong influence from Dutch classicism and [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], whereas others like [[St Mary Aldermary]] are purely [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] recreations of the former medieval churches, complete with a fan vaulted ceiling harking back to the [[English Gothic architecture|perpendicular gothic]] of the late Middle Ages. Despite the architectural merit of these individual buildings, perhaps the most significant achievement of Wren's reconstruction of St Paul's and the city churches was their overall interaction as an ensemble. Observing Canaletto's views of the [[City of London]] painted in 1750, one can see how [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] and the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] soar prominently above the rest of the city as a result of the tightly restricted height of all new domestic and commercial buildings in the city. The result is a highly picturesque skyline whose beauty astounded visitors to the newly reconstructed city.<ref name=\":2\" /> And so paradoxically, the great catastrophe that was the [[Great Fire of London]] can be considered in hindsight to have given a great new lease of life to London, as it gave a much-needed opportunity drastically improve and modernise the city. In the words of the architectural historian [[Simon Thurley|Dr Simon Thurley]]:\n\n\"This apparent catastrophe [...] was in reality one of the best things that ever happened to London. [...] The Great Fire of London enabled a new start - a new type of mass housing, handsome paved streets populated with modern churches and public buildings. There was a new [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], a new [[St Paul's Cathedral|Cathedral]], a rebuilt [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]].

[[Christopher Wren]], very much the preeminent architect of this period, was tasked with the design of two new military hospitals; the first being the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] for army veterans completed in 1692, and the latter of which being the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]] (latterly known as the [[Old Royal Naval College]]) completed in 1712. [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]] is one of Wren's more restrained works, with its red brick facades resembling long residential terraces. It nonetheless has a fine chapel and great hall with decorative interiors. In contrast [[Old Royal Naval College]] with its ornate Painted Hall, St Paul's Chapel and symmetrical east and west wings that frame [[Queen's House|Queens House]] by [[Inigo Jones]] is widely considered to be the crowning glory of the [[English Baroque]] movement. Now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], the site is described as \"the finest and most dramatically sited architectural ensemble and landscape ensemble in the British Isles.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/795/|title=Maritime Greenwich, UNESCO|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther fine examples of English Baroque in London can be found in the form of the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches|Commissioner's Churches]], 12 highly original churches that were built in response to a [[New Churches in London and Westminster Act 1710|1710 act of Parliament]] requesting the building of 50 new churches in London (the further 38 were not completed). The majority of these churches were designed by Wren's former assistant [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] who made significant contributions to the design of the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] and [[Old Royal Naval College]]. [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] is well known for his highly eccentric and idiosyncratic style that draws upon influences in Greek, Roman, Egyptian and even medieval architecture. Perhaps the most lauded and best known of these churches is [[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] (1729) which showcases [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor's]] trademark blend of baroque and gothic, as well his tendency to create buildings with an imposing sense of monumentality. Other Commissioner's Churches such as [[St Mary le Strand|St Mary-le-Strand]] by James Gibbs and [[St John's, Smith Square|St John's Smith Square]] by [[Thomas Archer]] are also superlative examples of late English [[Baroque architecture|Baroque Architecture]] showing a much stronger European influence than the designs of [[Christopher Wren|Wren]] or [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] whilst still maintaining a distinctly English sensibility.[[File:Old Royal Naval College 2017-08-06.jpg|thumb|1213x1213px|[[Old Royal Naval College|The Old Royal Naval College]] by [[Christopher Wren]] (1712) and [[Queen's House|Queens House]] (1635) by [[Inigo Jones]] viewed from the River Thames.]]<gallery>\nFile:PaternosterSquare-TempleBar.jpg|[[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] (1672) [[Christopher Wren]], originally on [[Fleet Street]] then moved to [[Paternoster Square]].

This great rise in prestige and wealth is reflected in London's significant growth in size and population in the 18th century. The city sprawled significantly, with substantial new development in areas in the west of the city such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Marylebone]], [[Mayfair]] and [[Kensington]], as well as in London's Satellite villages like [[Hampstead]], [[Islington]], [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] and [[Dulwich]]<ref name=\":1\" />[[St James's|.]] This development was centred around the construction of terraces and fashionable new squares like [[Grosvenor Square]], [[Portman Square]] and [[Bedford Square]], which became the new home of the burgeoning middle classes that emerged from Britain's new mercantile economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McxRTW1vCoE|title=London's Great Estates|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As well as this, with the construction of new bridges across the Thames at [[Westminster Bridge|Westminster]] (1750) and [[Blackfriars Bridge|Blackfriars]] (1769), the first new bridges since the early Middle Ages, the city began to spread significantly south of river. The style colloquially known as 'Georgian' refers to the British interpretation of 18th-century [[neoclassical architecture]], with stylistic routes that lay firmly in [[Palladian architecture]], particularly in the writings of Scottish architect [[Colen Campbell|Colen Campell.]] Often described as the 'father of the Georgian style', [[Colen Campbell|Campell's]] highly influential book [[Colen Campbell|Vitruvius Britannicus]] set the stylistic tone for [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] for the rest of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=Georgian London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=74}}</ref> This more restrained style was a reaction against the exuberant [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of the late 17th century, with a strict emphasis on plain unadorned brickwork, geometrical harmony and restrained classically inspired ornament. Despite this reactionary motive, Georgian architects nonetheless took great influence from [[Christopher Wren]] and other English Baroque architects. A precursor to the more unobtrusive Georgian style can be seen in the simple plain terraces built after the [[Great Fire of London]] at 4 [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in [[Temple, London|Temple]] or the plain brick facades of [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]], both by Wren. Key architects of the Georgian period who built substantial works in London include [[James Gibbs]], [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adam,]] [[William Kent]] and [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]].\n\n====== The Georgian Terraced House ======\n[[File:10 Downing Street.

They are generally built from buff (pale yellow) London Stock Brick to [[golden section]] proportions, often generously spanning triple bay frontages with 'implied' columns or [[pilasters]] and carefully proportioned and very large off-white [[sash windows]], slate [[mansard]] roofs above an [[Attic style|Attic]] [[pediment]]. They were grouped in formal [[garden square]]s, [[Crescent (architecture)|crescents]] and [[Terraced house|terraces]] with wide pavements supported on brick [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s on wide, straight public streets, often with private access to [[Romanticism|romantic]]ally landscaped gardens. Later encroachment of commercial properties has significantly reduced the apparent width of historic streets in many parts of London, where the original plans were comparable to in size or in excess of those found in Continental urban planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fet.uwe.ac.uk/conweb/house_ages/flypast/print.htm |title=Domestic Architecture 1700 to 1960 |publisher=Fet.uwe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-16}}</ref> The area of [[Spitalfields]] in East London has many extant early Georgian properties with some unusual continental features;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/culture/step-back-into-the-spitalfields-of-huguenots/8646533.article|title=Step back into the Spitalfields of Huguenots|first1=15|last1=April|first2=2013By James|last2=Pallister|website=Architects Journal}}</ref> [[Soho]] \u2013 particularly [[Meard Street]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols33-4/pp238-246|title=The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: Meard Street &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> and [[Westminster]] also preserve a large number of properties at an early stage of development of the style.[[File:Spencer House.jpg|thumb|298x298px|[[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] (1756) [[John Vardy]], the grandest surviving aristocratic [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] from the Georgian period.]]\n\nA typical house was designed to accommodate a single family, with front and back rooms on each floor and a partial-width rear 'closet' wing projection. The ground floor was reserved for business, the tall ''piano nobile'' for formal entertaining, and upper storeys with family bedrooms all accessed from a stair positioned on the side party{{clarify|date=January 2020}}. Servants were accommodated in the below-ground kitchen and in attic rooms in the roof. Each of the distinctions in function was subtly indicated in the decorative scheme of the fa\u00e7ade by the sequential height of openings, projecting cornices and restrained decorative mouldings such as round-headed arches and rustication at the base and diminishing columns, sculptural capitals, [[balustrades]] and friezes expressing the top.[[File:St Martin-in-the-Fields, July 2011.jpg|thumb|366x366px|[[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1726) by [[James Gibbs]]]]Features include:\n* A tall panelled front door with an arched [[fanlight]] often flanked by columns and covered by a pedimented canopy is reached up a short walkway which extends from the street, arching over the basement cavity and protected from burglary by a run of wrought iron security railings. \n* [[Sash windows]] which allow the window to be held open on corded lead weights to ventilate the room. Developed in [[Holland]] and first seen in the Royal Palaces, they became common in Georgian times; previously [[casement window]]s had been the norm. The sash box joinery and [[ovolo]] or [[astragal]] moulded window frames were designed to be as slim and unobtrusive as achievable, using the largest available sheets of glass in either a \"6 over 6\" or \"6 over 9\" pattern. Since the 1980s, these are often now painted in brilliant white; however this modern colour did not exist in the period: originally they were painted ivory off-white, pale yellow or other darker colours of the period.\n* Window openings in the proportion of 1:2 or the [[golden section]]; the windows were headed by the Dutch style [[flat arch]] often made from [[gauged brickwork]] in the finest properties.\n* The roof is often hidden by a [[parapet]] above an [[attic]] frieze. This was initially to reduce the spread of fire; however, in much of London, parapets were added to Georgian houses for aesthetic reasons alone. From the street, the building appears to have a flat roof, but from the rear one can see that there is a double pitched 'butterfly' roof. \n*Elevational classical adornments such as [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]], [[pilaster]]s, [[columns]], [[medallions]], [[friezes]], [[cornices]] and false [[pediments]] often formed in timber, [[stucco]] or natural stone are obvious indicators of wealth and status; however, much care and restraint was exercised to avoid the excessive flamboyance of continental architecture, with a marked preference for severe simplicity, honesty of means and sparseness of ornament in line with [[Protestant]] and neo-Palladian thinking, best exemplified by the work of [[Scottish Enlightenment]] architect [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adams]] \u2013 a philosophy extended to interior furnishing by the [[Thomas Chippendale]] furniture.\n* Suburban buildings are usually constructed from [[London stock brick]], in a yellowish buff colour (which often appears grey \u2013 see [[10 Downing Street]]). More prestigious houses are rendered with [[stucco]] or built from imported natural stone.\n*Chimney breasts were located in shared party walls, with gable parapets projecting above the roof line. The great number of chimney pots on London properties indicates the relative wealth of the inhabitants, serving fireplaces in every room.[[File:Somerset House New Wing entrance.jpg|thumb|444x444px|The Western facade of [[Somerset House]] (1776) [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]]]\n\n====== The Georgian Townhouse ======\nBut Georgian houses in London did not just come in the form of simple terraces. Many much more sumptuous homes known as [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]] were built as city residences for the nobility and gentry as opposed to their [[English country house|country house]] or stately home. The grandest of the London townhouses were [[Single-family detached home|stand-alone buildings]] like [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] but some were [[Terraced house|terraced buildings]] such as [[Chandos House]]. In the Georgian period many of these grand houses once lined [[Piccadilly]] and [[Park Lane]] but the majority of these were demolished as they went out of fashion in the late 19th and early 20th century, including the famous [[Devonshire House]] on Piccadilly. The few that do survive to this day include [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Burlington House]], [[Apsley House]], [[Chandos House]], [[Cambridge House]], Melbourne House, [[Marlborough House]] and [[Lancaster House]]. As well as this in the Greater London area a number of fine stately homes from the Georgian period can be found. These include the Palladian villa [[Chiswick House]] with its famous landscape gardens by William Kent and [[Syon House]] with its lavish interiors by [[Robert Adam]].\n\n====== Georgian Church and Civic Architecture ======\n\nAn array of notable civic, commercial and religious structures were also built in the Georgian period. Churches of the Georgian period were still very heavily influenced by the work of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] who had pioneered the use of [[classical architecture]] in church design in England with his [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]]. But with the declining popularity of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], Georgian church design took a more restrained [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] approach than [[Christopher Wren|Wren]]. Arguably the most famous church of the period is [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1722) by [[James Gibbs]]. Often described as the archetypal church of the Georgian period, [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] is a simple neoclassical 'temple church' with restrained Palladian ornament on its exterior and a tall spire that evokes memories of Wren's City Churches. Its format was much copied across England and abroad. [[St Peter, Vere Street]] (1722) also by [[James Gibbs]] is a further indicator of the increasing simplicity of church design in the 18th century.\n\n[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] also dominated civic architecture in the Georgian period in London. This is exemplified by [[William Kent]]'s [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] on Whitehall (1750), an essay in the austere [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style of mid-18th century. Arguably the most significant secular architectural commission of Georgian London was [[Somerset House]], a collection of government offices on [[Strand, London|the Strand]] that was to replace a 16th-century house of the same name on the site. The resulting building was designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chamber]]<nowiki/>s and completed in 1776. The building is built in a quadrangle with a grand courtyard in the centre. On the south side of the exterior there is a grand terrace overlooking the River Thames and at ground level a watergate that would have once faced directly onto the River Thames before the construction of the [[Victoria Embankment]].\n\nNew bridges across the River Thames were also built in the Georgian period; the first bridges built in London since the early Middle Ages. These bridges included [[Westminster Bridge]] in 1750, [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in 1769 and [[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]] in 1777; all were built in a neoclassical style. With the exception of Richmond Bridge, all of these bridges have now been replaced. These bridges were highly significant as [[London Bridge]] had been the only bridge across the river for over 500 years. Their construction greatly encouraged development south of the river.<gallery>\nFile:Queen Anne's Gate 01.JPG|[[Queen Anne's Gate]], Westminster (1701).

This is aesthetically distinct from early Georgian architecture, though it falls within the scope of Georgian architecture and continues the stylistic trend of Neoclassicism.

The west front overlooking the main garden features a bay window at its centre, with a long terrace with balustrades and large Classical urns made of Coade stone.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\"/> Preceding{{clarify|date=January 2020}} the forecourt was a monumental Roman arch, modelled on the ''[[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]]'' in Paris, which currently stands as the [[Marble Arch]] at the north-eastern corner of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Buckingham Palace| author=Jonathan Marsden| publisher=Royal Collection Publications| year=2011| p=27}}</ref> The addition of the East Wing early in the reign of Queen Victoria enclosed the forecourt and created the frontage of Buckingham Palace known ever since, but the bulk of the Palace exterior remains from Nash's Regency additions, particularly the long garden front on the west side.\n\nContemporaneous to Nash's building work in Regent's Park and St. James', the development of [[Belgravia]] further west offers the most uniform and extensive example of Regency architecture in London in the form of [[Belgrave Square]], [[Eaton Square]], [[Wilton Crescent]] and [[Chester Square]]. An ultra-exclusive housing development built on a formerly rural swathe of land on the [[Grosvenor Estate]], building was entrusted to [[Thomas Cubitt]] and began in 1825 with Belgrave Square; the three main squares were completed and occupied by the 1840s.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Great Houses of London| author=James Stourton| publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd.| year=2012| p=169}}</ref> Like Nash, Cubitt designed elegant Classical terraces,.

A '''Commissioners' church''', also known as a '''Waterloo church''' and '''Million Act church''', is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church built with money voted by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a result of the [[Church Building Act]]s of 1818 and 1824. The 1818 Act supplied a grant of money and established the Church Building Commission to direct its use, and in 1824 made a further grant of money. The First Parliamentary Grant for churches amounted to \u00a31 million (equivalent to \u00a373,550,000 in 2019), which is why the 1818 Act that provided for it is sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the '''Million Pound Act'''. The Second Parliamentary Grant of 1824 amounted to an additional \u00a3500,000 (\u00a344,320,000 in 2019), so the term \"million\" cannot apply to all the churches aided by the Commission. The Commission was founded on a wave of national triumph following the defeat of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815; hence the suggestion of the word \"Waterloo\" in the title. Commissioner's churches in London include [[All Souls Church, Langham Place|All Souls, Langham Place]] by John Nash; the church's unusual circular tower was deliberately placed on a bend on Nash's Regents Street to create a picturesque view from [[Oxford Circus]], the fine neoclassical [[St Mary, Bryanston Square|St Mary's, Bryanston Square]] by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] and [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea|St Luke's, Chelsea]] one of London's first Gothic-revival churches; an indication of the shift of a style away from neoclassicism that was to occur later in the 19th century.

There was little coherent urban planning in London during the Victorian era, apart from major infrastructure projects like the [[Thames Embankment]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. Critics compared London to cities like [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]], where state intervention and large scale demolition had created a more regular arrangement, with broad boulevards, panoramas and architectural uniformity.

London contains some notable examples of postmodern architecture, mostly from the 1990s. [[Robert Venturi|Robert Venturi's]] [[National Gallery|Sailsbury Wing]] of the [[National Gallery]] (1991) is an poignant example of postmodern [[Historicism (art)|historical pastiche]], being built of [[portland stone]] and ironically imitating the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] of the original National Gallery in order to blend in with the older building. Two of the postmodern movement's most influential architects [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] were both British and many of their most significant works can be found in London. Perhaps London's best-known postmodernist building, [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell's]] [[SIS Building|SIS Building or MI6 Building]] (1996) in [[Vauxhall]], is a highly distinctive pyramidal design that was heavily influenced by [[Maya architecture|Maya]] and [[Aztec architecture|Aztec Architecture]]; it is the headquarters of [[Secret Intelligence Service|Britain's military intelligence agency]].

Its height was controversial, being contrary to the previous height restrictions, it was the tallest building in the United Kingdom at the time and also the tallest [[cantilever]] building in the world. Following an over ten-year gap, [[One Canada Square]] was completed in 1991 at 235 metres (771&nbsp;ft) and formed the centrepiece of the [[Canary Wharf]] development, which itself is part of the [[Isle of Dogs]] and can be considered the east-side of Central London. The development's main tower [[One Canada Square]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the encouragement of [[Ken Livingstone]] who was [[Mayor of London]] from 2000 to 2008, a renewed trend for building tall was established in the 2000s. Following another over 10-year gap, [[8 Canada Square]] and [[25 Canada Square]], both standing at 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft), were completed at Canary Wharf in 2002. Several others of a smaller height followed at Canary Wharf including: [[Heron Quays]], [[40 Bank Street]] in 2003 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft), [[10 Upper Bank Street]] in 2003 at 151 metres (495&nbsp;ft), and [[25 Bank Street]] in 2004 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft). In the City of London, [[30 St Mary Axe]], nicknamed \"the Gherkin\" was completed in 2003 at 180 metres (590&nbsp;ft), [[Heron Tower]] in 2007 at 230 metres (750&nbsp;ft), and the [[Broadgate Tower]] in 2008 at 165 metres (541&nbsp;ft). Notably, some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the [[Emporis Skyscraper Award]] in 2003 and the [[Stirling Prize|RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture]] in 2004.\n[[File:Ayuntamiento y Shard, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 076.JPG|thumb|396x396px|(left) [[City Hall, London|City Hall]] (2002) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]] and (right) The Shard (2012) Renzo Piano, two notable works of [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] and [[Neo-futurism|neo-futurist]] architecture.]]\n[[Boris Johnson]] who was Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016 approved the construction of more skyscrapers in London. [[The Shard]] topped out in 2012 at [[London Bridge]] and at 309.6 metres (1,016&nbsp;ft) remains London's tallest building. In 2014, the 225 metres (738&nbsp;ft) tall [[122 Leadenhall Street]], nicknamed \"the Cheesegrater\", was completed in the City of London. In September, 2016 a refit was completed of the 111m King's Reach Tower, originally built in the 1970s, which included an 11-storey height increase to bring it up to 150 metres (490&nbsp;ft) tall and it was renamed the [[South Bank Tower]]. [[One Blackfriars]], also located on the [[South Bank]], topped out in 2017 at 163 metres (535&nbsp;ft). [[The Scalpel]], at 190 metres (620&nbsp;ft) was completed in the City of London in 2018 and it was designed to protect views of St Paul's Catherdral. [[Newfoundland Quay]], at 220 metres (720&nbsp;ft) and [[Landmark Pinnacle]] at 233 metres (764&nbsp;ft) topped out in Canary Wharf in 2018 and 2019 respectively. [[One Park Drive]] at 205 metres (673&nbsp;ft) and [[South Quay Plaza]] at 215 metres (705&nbsp;ft) both also topped out at Canary Wharf in 2019. [[22 Bishopsgate]], at 278 metres (912&nbsp;ft) topped out in the City of London in 2019, after being approved by the current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]], in 2016.\n\n[[1 Undershaft]], at 290 metres (950&nbsp;ft), also approved by Sadiq Khan in 2016, is planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster. It is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London and will only be exceeded in height by The Shard. It will be built on the site of the aforementioned 1969 St Helen's building which will be demolished. [[100 Leadenhall]], at 249 metres (817&nbsp;ft), and already nicknamed the \"Cheesegrater 2\", is also planned for the City of London. [[Spire London]], at 235 metres (771&nbsp;ft) is planned for Canary Wharf. However, construction was halted after concerns that the building only had one escape stairwell for residents on the upper floors. The tallest of the two [[Riverside South (Canary Wharf)|Riverside South]] towers that have been planned for construction at Canary Wharf since 2008 would have exceeded that cluster's tallest building, One Canada Square, by 1 metre in height, but construction has been stalled since 2011. Construction has started on the 216 metres (709&nbsp;ft) tall [[Alpha Square|Consort Place]] (previously called Alpha Square) also at Canary Wharf.\n\nThere is another major skyscraper cluster emerging in the [[Vauxhall]] and [[Nine Elms]] districts of London. The first skyscraper to appear here was [[St George Wharf Tower]] at 181 metres (594&nbsp;ft) and which was completed in 2014. The tallest tower planned for this cluster is the 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft) [[One Nine Elms|One Nine Elms City Tower]].

Until the mid-20th century the traditional costume represented the everyday clothing in most of Sardinia, but even today in various parts of the island it is possible to meet elderly people dressed in costume.\n\nThe materials used for their packaging are among the most varied, ranging from the typical Sardinian woollen fabric (''orbace'') to silk and from [[linen]] to leather. The various components of the feminine apparel are: the headgear (''mucadore''), the shirt (''camisa''), the bodice (''palas'', ''cossu''), the jacket (''coritu'', ''gipone''), the skirt (''unnedda'', ''sauciu''), the apron (''farda'', ''antalena'', ''defentale''). Those of the male are: the headdress (''[[:it:Berrita|berrita]]''), the shirt (''bentone'' or ''camisa''), the jacket (''gipone''), the trousers (''cartzones'' or ''bragas''), the skirt (''ragas'' or ''bragotis''), the overcoat (''gabbanu'' and ''colletu''), and finally the piece of clothing most associated with the Sardinians, the ''mastruca'', a sheep or goatskin leather jacket without sleeves: \"''Sardi pelliti''\" and \"''mastrucati latrones''\"<ref>''Costumi: storia, linguaggio e prospettive del vestire in Sardegna'' (2003).
