It is a [[global network|globally distributed network]] comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body with each constituent network setting and enforcing its own policies. Its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international [[Multistakeholder governance model|multistakeholder]] network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, the academic and research communities and national and international organizations. They work cooperatively from their respective roles to create shared policies and standards that maintain the Internet's global interoperability for the public good.\n\nHowever, to help ensure interoperability, several key technical and policy aspects of the underlying core infrastructure and the principal [[namespace]]s are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), which is headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California]]. ICANN oversees the assignment of globally unique identifiers on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, [[Internet protocol address]]es, application [[Port (computer networking)|port]] numbers in the [[transport protocol]]s, and many other parameters. This seeks to create a globally unified namespace to ensure the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet's technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. However, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]], continues to have final approval over changes to the [[DNS root zone]].<ref>Klein, Hans.

The original [[ARPANET]] is one of the components which eventually evolved to become the Internet. As its name suggests the ARPANET was sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] within the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA115440|title=A History of the ARPANET: The First Decade |publisher=[[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek & Newman Inc.]] |location=Arlington, VA |date=1 April 1981}}</ref> During the development of ARPANET, a numbered series of [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs) memos documented technical decisions and methods of working as they evolved.

NSFNET became a general-purpose research network, a hub to connect the supercomputing centers to each other and to the regional research and education networks that would in turn connect campus networks.<ref>[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf ''NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report 19877-1995''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210181738/http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf |date=10 February 2015 }}, Karen D.

By the end of 1989, Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the UK were connected to the Internet, which had grown to contain more than 160,000 hosts.\n\nIn 1990, the ARPANET was formally terminated. In 1991 the NSF began to relax its restrictions on commercial use on NSFNET and commercial network providers began to interconnect. The final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic ended on 30 April 1995, when the NSF ended its sponsorship of the NSFNET Backbone Service and the service ended.<ref>[http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php \"Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101025735/http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |date=1 January 2016 }}, Susan R.

During 1984 it was renamed the Internet Advisory Board ([[Internet Architecture Board|IAB]]), and during 1986 it became the Internet Activities Board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iab.org/about/history.html|title=History page from the IAB website|accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2850}}: Charter of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), May 2000</ref>\n\nThe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) was formed during 1986 by the U.S. government to develop and promote Internet standards.

This function eventually became known as the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and as it expanded to include management of the global Domain Name System ([[Domain name system|DNS]]) root servers, a small organization grew. Postel also served as [[Request for Comments|RFC]] Editor.\n\nAllocation of IP addresses was delegated to five [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs):\n*[[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) for North America\n*[[RIPE|R\u00e9seaux IP Europ\u00e9ens - Network Coordination Centre]] (RIPE NCC) for Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia\n*[[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]] (APNIC) for Asia and the Pacific region\n*[[Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry]] (LACNIC) for Latin America and the Caribbean region\n* [[African network information center|African Network Information Center]] (AfriNIC) was created in 2004 to manage allocations for Africa\nAfter Jon Postel's death in 1998, IANA became part of ICANN, a California [[Not-for-profit corporation|nonprofit]] established in September 1998 by the U.S. government and awarded a contract by the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].

The IAB was renamed the [[Internet Architecture Board|Internet ''Architecture'' Board]], and became part of ISOC. The Internet Engineering Task Force also became part of the ISOC. The IETF is overseen currently by the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), and longer-term research is carried on by the [[Internet Research Task Force]] and overseen by the [[Internet Research Steering Group]].\n\nAt the first [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in [[Geneva]] in 2003, the topic of Internet governance was discussed. ICANN's status as a private corporation under contract to the U.S. government created controversy among other governments, especially Brazil, China, South Africa, and some Arab states. Since no general agreement existed even on the definition of what comprised Internet governance, [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] initiated a [[Working Group on Internet Governance]] ([[Working Group on Internet Governance|WGIG]]) to clarify the issues and report before the second part of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) in [[Tunis]] 2005. After much controversial debate, during which the U.S. delegation refused to consider surrendering the U.S. control of the Root Zone file, participants agreed on a compromise to allow for wider international debate on the policy principles. They agreed to establish an [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF), to be convened by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] before the end of the second quarter of 2006. The [[Greece|Greek]] government volunteered to host the first such meeting.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200511210250.html \"Internet governance: U.S., Developing countries strike deal\"], Innocent Gore, Africa News Service, 21 November 2005</ref>\n\nAnnual global IGFs have been held since 2006, with the Forum renewed for five years by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan045268.pdf|title=UN General Assembly Resolution 65/141.

It is a [[global network|globally distributed network]] comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body with each constituent network setting and enforcing its own policies. Its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international [[Multistakeholder governance model|multistakeholder]] network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, the academic and research communities and national and international organizations. They work cooperatively from their respective roles to create shared policies and standards that maintain the Internet's global interoperability for the public good.\n\nHowever, to help ensure interoperability, several key technical and policy aspects of the underlying core infrastructure and the principal [[namespace]]s are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), which is headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California]]. ICANN oversees the assignment of globally unique identifiers on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, [[Internet protocol address]]es, application [[Port (computer networking)|port]] numbers in the [[transport protocol]]s, and many other parameters. This seeks to create a globally unified namespace to ensure the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet's technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. However, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]], continues to have final approval over changes to the [[DNS root zone]].<ref>Klein, Hans.

The original [[ARPANET]] is one of the components which eventually evolved to become the Internet.

NSFNET became a general-purpose research network, a hub to connect the supercomputing centers to each other and to the regional research and education networks that would in turn connect campus networks.<ref>[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf ''NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report 19877-1995''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210181738/http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf |date=10 February 2015 }}, Karen D.

By the end of 1989, Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the UK were connected to the Internet, which had grown to contain more than 160,000 hosts.\n\nIn 1990, the ARPANET was formally terminated. In 1991 the NSF began to relax its restrictions on commercial use on NSFNET and commercial network providers began to interconnect. The final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic ended on 30 April 1995, when the NSF ended its sponsorship of the NSFNET Backbone Service and the service ended.<ref>[http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php \"Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101025735/http://merit.edu/research/nsfnet_article.php |date=1 January 2016 }}, Susan R.

This function eventually became known as the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and as it expanded to include management of the global Domain Name System ([[Domain name system|DNS]]) root servers, a small organization grew.

ICANN's status as a private corporation under contract to the U.S. government created controversy among other governments, especially Brazil, China, South Africa, and some Arab states. Since no general agreement existed even on the definition of what comprised Internet governance, [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] initiated a [[Working Group on Internet Governance]] ([[Working Group on Internet Governance|WGIG]]) to clarify the issues and report before the second part of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) in [[Tunis]] 2005. After much controversial debate, during which the U.S. delegation refused to consider surrendering the U.S. control of the Root Zone file, participants agreed on a compromise to allow for wider international debate on the policy principles. They agreed to establish an [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF), to be convened by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] before the end of the second quarter of 2006.

Primary food sources are [[ungulate]]s, particularly [[deer]]. It also hunts species as small as insects and [[rodents]]. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but can also live in open areas. The cougar is [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and survives at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the [[apex predator]] in its range, yielding prey it has killed to jaguars, [[American black bear]]s and [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American alligator]]s ([[Florida Panther]] predation mainly), and to groups of [[gray wolf|gray wolves]]. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. [[List of fatal cougar attacks in North America by decade|Fatal attacks on humans]] are rare, but have recently been increasing in North America as more people enter cougar territories, and build developments such as farms in their established territory.<ref name=\"Med\"/>\n\nIntensive hunting following [[European colonization of the Americas]] and the ongoing human development into cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the [[North American cougar]] is considered to have been mostly [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for the isolated [[Florida panther]] subpopulation.\n\n==Naming and etymology==\nThe word 'cougar' is borrowed from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''\u00e7u\u00e7uarana'', via [[French language|French]]; it was originally derived from the [[Tupi language]].

Although cougars are protected from all hunting in the [[Yukon]]; hunting is permitted in every U.S. state except California from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the Pacific Ocean. The cougar cannot be legally killed without a permit in California except under very specific circumstances, such as when a cougar is in act of pursuing livestock or domestic animals, or is declared a threat to public safety.<ref name=\"California\" />\n\nTexas is the only U.S. state with a viable cougar population that is not protected.

The [[University of Vermont]] also uses the mascot, but uses the term \"catamount\" instead of cougar, as was traditional in the region where the school is located. The [[Florida Panthers]] of the National Hockey League use the name/image of the southeastern United States cougar subspecies, the [[Florida panther]] (the state animal), as its mascot.\n\nThe [[University of Pittsburgh]] in western Pennsylvania also uses the cougar as its sports mascot and for many other clubs and organizations, but also uses the locally preferred name, \"panther\", corresponding to nearby geographic features [[Panther Hollow (valley)|Panther Hollow]] and [[Panther Hollow Lake]] which were named that by 1885, 24 years before the University selected the name for its teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://friendsofpantherhollowlake.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html|title=Friends of Panther Hollow Lake: PHL HISTORY}}</ref> The University of Pittsburgh campus has about 20 physical representations of panthers/cougars at different locations around the campus plus there are four such statues on the [[Panther Hollow Bridge]] over Panther Hollow. By contrast, [[Penn State University]] in central Pennsylvania uses the [[Nittany Lion]] as its mascot, \"Nittany\" being the name of a nearby mountain and of the valley in which the University is located, and \"lion\" being the abbreviated name of a stuffed mountain lion/cougar originally captioned as \"Brush Lion\" that was on display in a building at the University, and which is today housed in the Penn State All-Sports Museum.<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/30/sports/la-sp-sn-the-story-of-the-penn-state-nittany-lion-20120530|title=The story of the Penn State Nittany Lion|last=Cronin|first=Brian|date=May 20, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> The campus also has a [[Nittany Lion Shrine]] featuring a large statue of a mountain lion on campus. Many high schools also use the cougar as their sports team mascot.\n\nThe [[Sacramento Mountain Lions]] (2010\u20132012) of the [[United Football League (2009\u20132012)|United Football League]] used the California and southwestern United States regional name of the species.\n\nThe [[Carolina Panthers]] of the [[National Football League]] have a black cat on their uniforms as opposed to a brownish- or tawny-coloured cat so it is most often presumed to represent a [[black panther]], the black melanistic phase of either the [[jaguar]], which actually only lived in the far southwestern United States not the southeastern United States where Carolina is located, or the [[leopard]] of Africa and Asia. A previously existing \"Carolina\" sports team, the [[Carolina Cougars]], who operated in the [[American Basketball Association]] from 1969 to 1974, actually used the cougar as its nickname/mascot, as opposed to the panther.\n\nMost sports team named the \"Wildcats\" use a logo similar to a bobcat, or in some cases in Canada, a lynx, names which are often used for sports teams in their own right. By contrast, Wildcat Lager Beer brewed by Labatt, has always shown a picture of a cougar on its label.\n\n==Hybrids==\n[[File:Pumapard-1904.jpg|thumb|upright|Pumapard, photographed in 1904]]\n{{Main|Pumapard}}\nA pumapard is a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal resulting from a union between a puma and a [[leopard]]. Whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard or to a male puma mated to a female leopard, pumapards inherit a form of [[dwarfism]]. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or \"faded\" rosettes.<ref name=\"Geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|title=Geocites \u2013 Liger & Tigon Info|accessdate=June 9, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015110856/http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|archivedate=October 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acinonychini]]\n* [[List of largest cats]]\n{{Portal bar|Cats|Mammals}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Baron |first=David |title=The Beast in the Garden: A Modern Parable of Man and Nature |year=2004 |publisher=W.

Primary food sources are [[ungulate]]s, particularly [[deer]]. It also hunts species as small as insects and [[rodents]]. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but can also live in open areas. The cougar is [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and survives at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the [[apex predator]] in its range, yielding prey it has killed to jaguars, [[American black bear]]s and [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American alligator]]s ([[Florida Panther]] predation mainly), and to groups of [[gray wolf|gray wolves]]. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. [[List of fatal cougar attacks in North America by decade|Fatal attacks on humans]] are rare, but have recently been increasing in North America as more people enter cougar territories, and build developments such as farms in their established territory.<ref name=\"Med\"/>\n\nIntensive hunting following [[European colonization of the Americas]] and the ongoing human development into cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the [[North American cougar]] is considered to have been mostly [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for the isolated [[Florida panther]] subpopulation.\n\n==Naming and etymology==\nThe word 'cougar' is borrowed from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''\u00e7u\u00e7uarana'', via [[French language|French]]; it was originally derived from the [[Tupi language]].

Although cougars are protected from all hunting in the [[Yukon]]; hunting is permitted in every U.S. state except California from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the Pacific Ocean. The cougar cannot be legally killed without a permit in California except under very specific circumstances, such as when a cougar is in act of pursuing livestock or domestic animals, or is declared a threat to public safety.<ref name=\"California\" />\n\nTexas is the only U.S. state with a viable cougar population that is not protected.

The [[University of Vermont]] also uses the mascot, but uses the term \"catamount\" instead of cougar, as was traditional in the region where the school is located. The [[Florida Panthers]] of the National Hockey League use the name/image of the southeastern United States cougar subspecies, the [[Florida panther]] (the state animal), as its mascot.\n\nThe [[University of Pittsburgh]] in western Pennsylvania also uses the cougar as its sports mascot and for many other clubs and organizations, but also uses the locally preferred name, \"panther\", corresponding to nearby geographic features [[Panther Hollow (valley)|Panther Hollow]] and [[Panther Hollow Lake]] which were named that by 1885, 24 years before the University selected the name for its teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://friendsofpantherhollowlake.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html|title=Friends of Panther Hollow Lake: PHL HISTORY}}</ref> The University of Pittsburgh campus has about 20 physical representations of panthers/cougars at different locations around the campus plus there are four such statues on the [[Panther Hollow Bridge]] over Panther Hollow. By contrast, [[Penn State University]] in central Pennsylvania uses the [[Nittany Lion]] as its mascot, \"Nittany\" being the name of a nearby mountain and of the valley in which the University is located, and \"lion\" being the abbreviated name of a stuffed mountain lion/cougar originally captioned as \"Brush Lion\" that was on display in a building at the University, and which is today housed in the Penn State All-Sports Museum.<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/30/sports/la-sp-sn-the-story-of-the-penn-state-nittany-lion-20120530|title=The story of the Penn State Nittany Lion|last=Cronin|first=Brian|date=May 20, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> The campus also has a [[Nittany Lion Shrine]] featuring a large statue of a mountain lion on campus. Many high schools also use the cougar as their sports team mascot.\n\nThe [[Sacramento Mountain Lions]] (2010\u20132012) of the [[United Football League (2009\u20132012)|United Football League]] used the California and southwestern United States regional name of the species.\n\nThe [[Carolina Panthers]] of the [[National Football League]] have a black cat on their uniforms as opposed to a brownish- or tawny-coloured cat so it is most often presumed to represent a [[black panther]], the black melanistic phase of either the [[jaguar]], which actually only lived in the far southwestern United States not the southeastern United States where Carolina is located, or the [[leopard]] of Africa and Asia. A previously existing \"Carolina\" sports team, the [[Carolina Cougars]], who operated in the [[American Basketball Association]] from 1969 to 1974, actually used the cougar as its nickname/mascot, as opposed to the panther.\n\nMost sports team named the \"Wildcats\" use a logo similar to a bobcat, or in some cases in Canada, a lynx, names which are often used for sports teams in their own right. By contrast, Wildcat Lager Beer brewed by Labatt, has always shown a picture of a cougar on its label.\n\n==Hybrids==\n[[File:Pumapard-1904.jpg|thumb|upright|Pumapard, photographed in 1904]]\n{{Main|Pumapard}}\nA pumapard is a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal resulting from a union between a puma and a [[leopard]]. Whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard or to a male puma mated to a female leopard, pumapards inherit a form of [[dwarfism]]. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or \"faded\" rosettes.<ref name=\"Geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|title=Geocites \u2013 Liger & Tigon Info|accessdate=June 9, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015110856/http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|archivedate=October 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acinonychini]]\n* [[List of largest cats]]\n{{Portal bar|Cats|Mammals}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Baron |first=David |title=The Beast in the Garden: A Modern Parable of Man and Nature |year=2004 |publisher=W.

The key inquiry focuses on whether the driver's faculties were impaired by the substance that was consumed. The detection and successful prosecution of drivers impaired by prescription medication or illegal drugs can therefore be difficult. [[Breathalyzer]]s have been developed for the purpose of administering roadside or laboratory tests that can detect the actual level of a controlled substance in an individual's body.\n\n===History===\n[[File:Don't Mix 'Em 1937.jpg|thumb|left|1937 [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] drunk driving poster]]\nNew Jersey enacted the first law that specifically criminalized driving an automobile while intoxicated, in 1906.

At the same time, the [[National Safety Council]] set up a \"Committee on Tests for Intoxication\".\n\nIn the US, most of the laws and penalties were greatly enhanced starting in the late 1970s, and through the 1990s, largely due to pressure from groups like [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) and [[Students Against Destructive Decisions]] (SADD) and activists like [[Candy Lightner]] whose 13-year-old daughter Cari was killed by a drunk driver. [[Zero tolerance]] laws were enacted which criminalized driving a vehicle with 0.01% or 0.02% BAC for drivers under 21.

There is a split of authority across the country regarding this issue. Some states permit enforcement of DUI, DWI, and OWI/OVI statutes based on \"operation and control\" of a vehicle, while others require actual \"driving\". \"The distinction between these terms is material, for it is generally held that the word 'drive,' as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word 'operate' has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle, but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.\" (''State v.

This is often referred to as the \"legal limit\". It is a permissive presumption of guilt where the person's BAC is 0.08% or greater (units of milligrams per deciliter, representing 8 g of alcohol in 10 liters of blood).<ref name=\"NY DWI law\">See, ''e.g.'', [[New York Penal Law]] section 1192, found at [http://www.assembly.state.ny.us New York State Assembly web site], go to \"Bill Search and Legislative Materials\", then \"New York State Laws\".

These types of \"catch-all\" statutes cover situations involving a person under the influence of drugs or under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs. With the advent of the legalization of marijuana, these catch-all provisions cover those prosecutions pursuing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs or even drugs and alcohol.\n\nAll [[U.S. state|US states]] have [[implied consent]] laws which state that a licensed driver has given their consent to an evidential [[Breathalyzer]] or similar manner of determining [[blood alcohol concentration]];<ref name=\"nolo_ref-long\">[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press (\"As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.\")</ref> however, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidence from a chemical test, [[Probable cause|probable cause for arrest]] must be demonstrated.\n\nIn 2016, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in [[Birchfield v.

California also makes it illegal for persons who are on probation for a DUI conviction to drive with a blood or breath alcohol concentration of 0.01% or greater pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 23154. While the existence of a BAC of 0.01% or greater may not always result in prosecution for driving under the influence, it will expose such drivers to a one or two-year suspension through an administrative action by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. If that same person has a BAC of 0.08% or greater, it will prompt what is referred to as a \"dual action\", meaning a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.08% or greater and a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.01% or greater while on DUI Probation.\n\nIn California, in ''Mercer v. DMV'' (1991) 53 Cal.3d 753,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/mercer-v-department-motor-vehicles-31352|title=Mercer v. Department of Motor Vehicles - 53 Cal.3d 753 S017249 - Mon, 05/06/1991 {{!}} California Supreme Court Resources|website=Scocal.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-03-03}}</ref> the California State Supreme Court contrasted the term \"drive,\" commonly understood to require volitional movement of the vehicle, with the term \"driver,\" defined in California Vehicle Code \u00a7 305 as one who is either driving or in actual physical control. The court pointed out that the phrase \"actual physical control\" does not appear anywhere in the drunk driving offense statutes. Further, the court noted that since \"driver\" is defined as one who drives or is in actual physical control, the two terms (drive vs. actual physical control) must have different meanings. Construing these penal statutes strictly, rather than broadly, as is required by ''Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County'' (1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631, the court held that mere actual physical control is not enough to constitute driving. Therefore, the term: \"drive\", at least for purposes of the drunk driving statutes, requires volitional movement of the vehicle. In coming to this conclusion, the California Supreme Court held that in everyday usage the phrase, \"to drive a vehicle,\" is understood as requiring evidence of volitional movement of a vehicle. Numerous dictionary definitions-including Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1981), cited by the Court of Appeal in the case that led to the California Supreme Court's review of this case, support a definition of \"drive\" that includes movement. (See, e.g., ''Id''., at p.&nbsp;692.) fn. 5. The ''Mercer'' Court held that it believed that these definitions are consistent with the usual and ordinary understanding of that term, and suggest the sense in which the word was intended by the Legislature in the present context.\n\nCalifornia's \"catch-all\" provision was previously found in California Vehicle Code Section 23152(a); however new statutes that were made effective on January 1, 2014, two new sections were created to make sections specifically addressing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs, (which includes prescription medications if it can be shown that those medications impaired the driver), and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. \n* CVC 23152(a):  It is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug, or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug, to drive a vehicle\n* CVC 23152(b):  It is unlawful for any person who has 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle.\n* CVC 23152(e):  It is unlawful for a person who is under the influence of any drug to drive a vehicle\n* CVC 23152(f):  It is unlawful for a person who is under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug to drive a vehicle.\n====Idaho====\nUnder [[Idaho]] Law, any person in \"actual physical control\" of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any other intoxicating substance is guilty of driving under the influence.

Prior to increased emphasis on drinking and driving in the 1980s, standards of 0.10%-0.15% were in place.\n\n===Bicycle DUI===\nApproximately 20-30 states criminalized impaired riding a bicycle, whereas others have no sanctions relevant to cycling.<ref name=\"bikeleague\">[http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/bui_full_chart.pdf ''Bicycling under the influence'' chart], League of American Bicyclists ('''.pdf''')</ref><ref name=\"Avvobike\">[https://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/a-state-by-state-guide-to-biking-under-the-influence A state-by-state guide to biking under the influence], Avvo</ref>  Most such laws extend driving laws to all vehicles (\"all vehicles\" as opposed to \"motor vehicles\"), but a few address impaired bike riding separately.  In some states, enhanced penalties are automobile-specific.  Some states, notably Oregon, do not extend the [[implied consent|implied consent law]] to cyclists.<ref name=\"bikeleague\" />  While police activities targeting impaired cyclists are rare, a cyclist could encounter police in a circumstance where the cyclist would otherwise be ticketed.\n{{refn|group=nb|Cycling while impaired significantly increases the risk of injury and fatal accidents.

Criminal penalties are imposed as a result of criminal prosecution. Administrative penalties are imposed by a state agency, and in some cases may apply even if a person stopped for impaired driving is not convicted of the offense.\n\n===Criminal penalties===\nThe penalties for drunk driving vary among states and jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for the penalties to be different from county to county within any given state depending on the practices of the individual jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions require [[Prison|jail]] time and larger fines, even on a first offense. For instance, Ohio requires a mandatory 72-hour jail sentence for a first offense conviction; however, the jail time component is satisfied by attendance of the Ohio A.W.A.R.E. Program, which is a 72-hour alcohol-education program. Compared to many other countries, such as Sweden, penalties for drunk driving in the United States are considered less severe unless alcohol is involved in an incident causing injury or death of another, such DUI, DWI or OWI with Great Bodily Injury (GBI) or Vehicular Manslaughter.\n\n====Diversion programs====\nThe State of Washington used to permit those charged with a first offense drunk driving to complete a diversion program that resulted in the charges being dismissed upon the completion of a Diversion Program. In 1975, under the revised code of Washington or RCW Section 10.05, the Washington State Legislature established a deferred prosecution option for offenders arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or impairing drugs (DUI). It was intended to encourage individuals to seek appropriate treatment and, under this option, defendants with a significant alcohol or drug dependence problem could petition a court to defer disposition of their charge until they have completed intensive substance dependence treatment and met other conditions required by the court. If the defendant successfully completed the terms of the program, the charge was dismissed; for those who failed, the deferred status was revoked and the defendant was prosecuted for the original DUI charge. (RCW 10.05.010 and 10.05.020) In 1992, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute evaluated DUI deferred prosecution and concluded the program reduced DUI recidivism.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.wsipp.wa.gov/ReportFile/992\n| title = Washington State Institute for Public Policy\n| date = \n| website = \n| publisher = \n| access-date = \n}}</ref>\nIn 1998, the legislature modified the DUI statutes. Among other things, the length of deferred prosecution supervision was increased from two to five years and defendants were restricted to one deferred prosecution per lifetime.\n\n====Driving While Impaired court====\n{{main|DWI court}}\nThese innovative courts use substance abuse intervention with repeat offenders who plead guilty to driving while intoxicated. Those accepted into the diversionary program are required to abstain from alcohol. Some are required to wear a device that monitors and records any levels of alcohol detected in their bloodstreams.\n\n===Administrative penalties===\nThe federal [[Assimilative Crimes Act]], which makes [[State law (United States)|state law]] applicable on lands reserved or acquired by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of [[United States Congress|Congress]], recognizes collateral actions related to DUI convictions as punishments. According to {{UnitedStatesCode|18|13}}:\n\n{{quote|\u2026 that which may or shall be imposed through judicial or administrative action under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, for a conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol, shall be considered to be a punishment provided by that law \u2026}}\n\n====SR-22 - Proof of Financial Responsibility====\nAn [[SR-22 (insurance)|SR-22]] is an addendum to an insurance policy. It is an administrative form that attests to an insurance company's coverage, or the posting of a personal public bond in the amount of the state's minimum liability coverage for the licensed driver or vehicle registration. The SR in SR-22 stands for Safety Responsibility, and it is needed to reinstate a suspended driver's license after a DUI conviction in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is submitted to the State's DMV by an auto insurance company to serve as proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance that the states requires. They are essentially an agreement between a driver's insurance company and the respective State's DMV that requires the driver's insurance company to notify the respective State's DMV that the driver's insurance has either been terminated or lapsed; thus instituting a suspension of the driver's driving privileges until proof of insurance is re-filed with the State's DMV.\n\nWhile SR-22s are typically filed with the respective State's DMV, some States require the driver to carry proof of the SR-22 or to carry it in the registered vehicle, (particularly if the driver has been cited for coverage lapses or other administrative infractions). SR-22s may attest coverage for a vehicle regardless of operator (owner liability coverage), or cover a specific person regardless of the specific vehicle operated (operator liability coverage).\n\nAs stated, the form is required in 49 states and the US District of Columbia in order to register a vehicle for usage on public roads. It is also required to redeem a license which has been suspended due to coverage lapse in these required states. These states also, generally, require that the issuing insurance company provide the relevant state's DMV with timely updates as to the status of such coverage. If the policy with the SR22 cancels, a form called an SR26 is issued and sent to the state DMV.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/pages/driverid/sr22.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408113313/http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/driverid/sr22.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Oregon Department of Transportation : SR-22 Information : Oregon Driver & Motor Vehicle Services : State of Oregon|archivedate=April 8, 2008|website=Oregon.gov}}</ref>  Upon notice that there has been a lapse in coverage, the state will suspend the driver's license again.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Delbridge|first1=Emily|title=What Happens If I Let My SR22 Car Insurance Cancel?|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-happens-if-i-let-my-sr22-car-insurance-cancel-527270|website=The Balance|publisher=Dotdash|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> Another SR-22 filing will need to be submitted to regain driving privileges.\n\n====Alcohol education programs====\nEvery jurisdiction imposes the completion of alcohol education programs, commonly known as DUI programs, subsequent to a DUI/DWI/OWI conviction. Additionally, some states impose an additional requirement that a person attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP) administered by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD), which was established in 1982. Both DUI classes and Victim Impact Panels are available in some states for first offense DUIs dependent on the judge's decision.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victim Impact Panels|url=http://duijusticelink.aaa.com/issues/sanctions/victim-impact-panels/|website=AAA DUI Justice Link|publisher=AAA|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n====DUI Plates====\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=Ohio license plate issued to DUI offenders sample.jpg|caption1=Ohio DUI plate|image2=MN drunk plate.jpg|caption2=Minnesota drunk driver plate|image3=MN plate.jpg|caption3=By comparison, a regular Minnesota plate has colored graphics}}\nIn 1967, [[Ohio]] began to issue special [[vehicle registration plate|license plates]] to DUI offenders who are granted limited driving privileges such as work-related driving until a court can rule that they can have full privileges back.

When required under a high BAC level or multiple offense threshold, [[ignition interlock|ignition interlock requirements]] address a strong tendency of repeat offense by drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]] (AUD or alcoholism).\n\n[[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after positive [[#chemical_test|chemical blood alcohol tests]], as a physical deterrent for drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]], or as a [[Civil penalty|pseudo-civil punishment]].  [[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after an [[implied consent|implied consent refusal]] under similar forensic procedures.\n\n=====Operation of IIDs=====\nIn most US implementations, [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] are set to a \"[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]\" level (set to either levels consistent with culinary alcohol or measurement errors).  Violations can occur from a driver exceeding the \"[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]\" level, but can also occur from use by other drivers within legal limits, or from test anomalies.  In some states, anomalies are routinely discounted, for example as not consistent with patterns of BAC levels or at levels incompatible with life (e.g., significant mouth alcohol - which as BAC would be fatal).  In some states, \"fail\" readings not consistent with actual alcohol use can be cleared by a routine process, but other states automatically deem these \"fail\" readings as violations.\n\nIn operation, the driver blows into the [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] to enable the car's starter.  After a variable time period of approximately 20\u201340 minutes, the driver is required to re-certify (blow again) within a time period consistent with safely pulling off the roadway.  If the driver fails to re-certify within the time period, the car will alarm in a manner similar to setting off the car's immobilzer (but mechanically independent of the [[immobilizer]]).\n\nVarious US states have different penalties for disabling IIDs.  In some cases, the driver may be penalized if a family member or mechanic disables the IID when not in use by the sanctioned individual, or temporarily for servicing the vehicle.  In some implementations, disabling by mechanics and others is either permitted or authorisation easily obtained, but some jurisdictions restrict or deny authorisation.  (Such restrictions on mechanics can be problematic, for example, if limited to designated \"licensed mechanics\" or as applied to routine repair procedures requiring operation of the ignition and starter systems.)   Some jurisdictions criminalize such temporary bypass of IIDs.\n\n=====Universal IID installation=====\nProposals (none official) have been made to install [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] on all new vehicles, set to the legal limit for the driver.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  Issues to be solved, besides consumer and voter acceptance, include difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements without inconvenience, and a need to achieve [[Six Sigma|Six&nbsp;Sigma (6\u03c3)]] reliability,<ref>6\u03c3 refers to long-term defect levels below 3.4 [[defects per million opportunities]] (DPMO)</ref> in order to not interfere with vehicle usability.\n\nThere are no present plans to introduce universal IID installation in the US.\n\n====Vehicle impoundment and forfeiture====\nSome states, such as California, allow for the [[Vehicle impoundment|impoundment]] and [[asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of vehicles under certain conditions.<ref>California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 14600 et seq.</ref><ref>California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 23592 et seq.</ref>\n\n==Investigation and arrest==\nA drunk driving charge is a type of police arrest process, so a basic understanding of the process of police engagement is essential to understanding how that process applies to that process as applied to a drunk driving charge.\n\n===Legal Stages===\nFollowing are common procedures when a law enforcement officer has reason to suspect a driver is intoxicated.  While local procedures vary under the 10s of thousands of courts in the US having traffic jurisdiction, the basic procedure is:\n:'''1. reasonable suspicion'''\n:'''2. probable cause'''\n:'''3. arrest''' (including invoking the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] law)\n:'''4. criminal charge and [[Civil penalty|\"civil law\" sanctions]]'''<ref>[[Civil penalty|Civil penalties]] in this context are in most instances criminal in nature, but intentionally circumvent criminal due process under the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].</ref>\n\nThe legal stages are relevant because of the degree of evidence required at each stage.   (For example, the police need not demonstrate guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in order to execute a traffic stop.)\n\n===Investigation \"Phases\" (NHTSA)===\n<!-- POSSIBLY WILL CHANGE TO \"INVESTIGATION PHASES\" --> \nThe investigation and NHTSA \"phases\" are distinct from the legal stages of the police arrest process.  Instead, the investigation has, as its purpose, to take the process from initial contact through all of the evidence stages, through to prosecution.  The primary goals are to:\n\n* Identify impaired drivers;\n* Establish clear ''[[probable cause]] for arrest'', which is necessary to sustain the use of [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]] in court.  Without ''probable cause'', the [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]] are subject to the [[exclusionary rule]]\n* Proceed to obtain proof of intoxication, typically using [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]].\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, police officers should conduct DUI Investigations according to a specific protocol called phases. According to the NHTSA training, DUI Investigations are categorized by these phases:\n* Phase 1 - \"Vehicle in Motion\"\n* Phase 2 - \"Personal Contact\"\n* Phase 3 - \"Pre-Arrest Screening\"\n\nThe \"Vehicle in Motion\" Phase deals with the law enforcement officers' observations of the suspect's driving maneuvers. The \"Personal Contact\" Phase is where the officer actually comes into contact with the suspected impaired driver. The \"Pre-Arrest Screening\" Phase is portion of the DUI Investigation that encompasses the Pre-Field Sobriety Test Questioning and the Field Sobriety Testing, including a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test where applicable. This Phase also includes the post-arrest evidentiary chemical test despite that it occurs subsequent to a DUI arrest, not prior to a DUI arrest.\n\nThe officer will typically approach the driver's window and ask some preliminary questions. During this phase of the stop, the officer will note if they detect any of the following indicators of intoxication:\n*Odor of an alcoholic beverage on the driver's breath or in the car generally\n*Slurred speech in response to the questioning\n*Watery, blood shot, or reddish eyes\n*Flushed face\n*Droopy eyelids\n*Difficulty in understanding and responding intelligently to question\n*Fumbling with his or her driver's license and registration\n*The plain-view presence of containers of alcoholic beverages in the vehicle\n*Admission of consumption of alcoholic beverage\n\nIf the officer observes enough to have a reasonable suspicion to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle, and request that the driver submit to voluntary [[Field sobriety testing|field sobriety tests]].\n\n===Overall Stop and Arrest Process===\n''Note:  Local terminology will vary, but these general classifications fall under [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] guidelines.''\n\nEach stage has different requirements for establishing a basis for police or prosecutorial  action.   Without establishing that basis, the process is illegal and can cause a prosecution to fail under the [[exclusionary rule]].\n\n====1. Reasonable suspicion and traffic stop====\n{{main|Reasonable suspicion}}\nThe police must have a reason to engage in a traffic stop.  This typically involves either observing a traffic violation or observing behavior, such as weaving or lane departure, that would raise a \"reasonable suspicion\" of driving while impaired.  The police must have an articulable reason for the stop, but does not need probable cause for an arrest.\n\nOne exception is a roadblock (where legal).  Roadblocks do not involve reasonable suspicion, but must meet particular legal standards to avoid arbitrariness while still assuring randomness.\n\nDuring the traffic stop, the police will attempt to obtain sufficient evidence to support \"probable cause\".  This includes asking questions, and requesting further evidence or confession.\n\nThere are several situations in which the officer will come into contact with a driver, some examples are:\n*The officer on patrol has observed erratic, suspicious driving, or a series of traffic infractions indicating the possibility that the driver may be impaired. This is by far the most common reason for stopping a suspect.\n*A police officer has stopped a vehicle for a lesser traffic offense, notices the signs of intoxication, and begins the DUI investigation.\n*The driver has been involved in an automobile collision; the officer has responded to the scene and is conducting an investigation.\n*The driver has been stopped at a [[random checkpoint|sobriety checkpoint]] (also known as roadblocks).\n*The police have received a report, possibly from an anonymous citizen, that a described car has been driving erratically. The officer should verify the erratic driving before pulling the driver over. In some cases, the driver will no longer be in the vehicle.\n\nThe following list of DUI symptoms, from a publication issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (DOT HS-805-711),<ref>{{cite book|title=Guide for detecting drunk drivers at night|date=1985|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|edition=2}}</ref> is widely used in training officers to detect drunk drivers. After each symptom is a percentage figure which, according to NHTSA, indicates the statistical chances through research that a driver is over the legal limit.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Turning with wide radius                      || over 50%\n|-\n| Straddling center or lane marker              || 65%\n|-\n| Appearing to be drunk                         || 60%\n|-\n| Almost striking object or vehicle             || 60%\n|-\n| Weaving                                       || 60%\n|-\n| Driving on other than designated roadway      || 55%\n|-\n| Swerving                                      || 55%\n|-\n| Slow speed (more than 10&nbsp;mph below limit)|| 50%\n|-\n| Stopping (without cause) in traffic lane      || 50%\n|-\n| Drifting                                      || 50%\n|-\n| Following too closely                         || 45%\n|-\n| Tires on center or lane marker                || 45%\n|-\n| Braking erratically                           || 45%\n|-\n| Driving into opposing or crossing traffic     || 45%\n|-\n| Signaling inconsistent with driving actions  || 40%\n|-\n| Stopping inappropriately (other than in lane) || 35%\n|-\n| Turning abruptly or illegally                 || 35%\n|-\n| Accelerating or decelerating rapidly          || 30%\n|-\n| Headlights off                                || 30%\n|}\n\nIf the officer observes enough evidence to have a \"[[Reasonable suspicion|Reasonable Suspicion]]\" to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.\n\n====2. Probable cause====\n\"Probable cause\" is established by obtaining evidence from the police encounter sufficient to meet the \"probable cause\" standard for arrest.   \"Probable cause\" is not necessarily sufficient to obtain a conviction, but is a prerequisite for arrest.  Examples of \"probable cause\" for a drunk driving arrest includes:\n\n:1. Observation\n:2. [[Confession (law)|Confession]] of having consumed alcohol in the recent past.  '''Relevant examples of confessions:'''\n:::- \"I had a glass of wine.\"\n:::- \"I was at a friend's party.\"\n:::- \"I was at the Stone Balloon.\"\n::The confession is the easiest way to establish \"probable cause\", and police know that social convention encourages people to respond to police questions.  ''While it is inadvisable to lie to police, the suspect has the option to \"respectfully decline\" to answer questions.''<ref name=\"riskology\">[https://www.riskology.co/traffic-stop/ Pulled Over?

The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training.\n\n=====Issues with FSTs=====\nThe NHTSA have published numerous training manuals associated with FSTs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/standardized-field-sobriety-test-training-downloads|title=DWI Detection and Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) Resources|last=brandon.gobel@dot.gov|date=2019-07-19|website=NHTSA|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 pounds or greater overweight. The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered \"divided attention tests\" that test the suspect's ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile. However, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting [[proprioception]] (the awareness of the body's movement), such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]].\n\nThe three validated tests by NHTSA are:\n#The Horizontal Gaze [[Physiologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]] Test, which involves following an object with the eyes (such as a pen) to determine characteristic eye movement reaction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus: The Science and the Law|url=https://ntl.bts.gov/lib/25000/25900/25975/DOT-HS-808-938.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=American Prosecutors Research Institute|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n#The Walk-and-Turn Test ([[Tandem gait|heel-to-toe]] in a straight line). This test is designed to measure a person's ability to follow directions and remember a series of steps while dividing attention between physical and mental tasks.\n#The One-Leg-Stand Test\n\nAccording to NHTSA, these tests were not designed to measure impairment, but rather to give a probability that a driver is at or above a 0.08% BAC. However, studies have shown that there are reasons to doubt the tests' usefulness in helping an officer to make such a determination. In 1991, Dr. Spurgeon Cole of [[Clemson University]] conducted a study of the accuracy of FSTs. His staff videotaped people performing six common field sobriety tests, then showed the tapes to 14 police officers and asked them to decide whether the suspects had \"had too much to drink and drive\" (''sic''). The blood-alcohol concentration of each of the 21 DUI subjects was 0.00, unknown to the officers. The result: the officers gave their opinion that 46% of these innocent people were too drunk to be able to drive. This study showed the possible inaccuracy of FSTs.<ref>Cole and Nowaczyk, \"Field Sobriety Tests: Are they Designed for Failure?\", 79 Perceptual and Motor Skills Journal 99 (1994).</ref>\n\nAlternative tests, which have not been scientifically validated, include:\n*[[Romberg test]], or the Modified-Position-of-Attention Test, (feet together, head back, eyes closed for thirty seconds).\n*The Finger-to-Nose Test (tip head back, eyes closed, touch the tip of nose with tip of index finger).\n*The Alphabet Test (recite all or part of the alphabet).\n*The Finger Count Test (touch each finger of hand to thumb counting with each touch (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)).\n*The Counting Test (counting backwards from a number ending in a number other than 5 or 0 and stopping at a number ending other than 5 or 0.

These are often referred to as PAS Tests, or \"Preliminary Alcohol Screening\" Tests\", or a PBT, \"Preliminary Breath Test\" and precede the actual arrest and subsequent requirement to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of the suspect's breath or blood. These breath testing devices used are smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, more sophisticated instruments at the police stations, commonly known as an Evidentiary Breath Test using an EBT device, or Evidentiary Breath Test device. An increasing number jurisdictions began using Portable Evidentiary Breath Test devices, or PEBT devices, that are more sophisticated versions of the smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, larger instruments at the police stations. Another distinction is that, while the larger EBTs usually employ [[infrared spectroscopy]], the PEBT and PAS devices use a relatively simple electrochemical ([[fuel cell]]) technology. When used for purposes of a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, or PAS Test, their purpose, along with the other FSTs, is to assist the officer in determining whether he/she has [[probable cause]] for arrest.\n\nThe Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS) is sometimes categorised as part of ''field sobriety testing'', although it is not part of the series of performance tests.  The PBT (or PAS) uses a portable breath tester.   While the tester provides numerical blood alcohol content (BAC) readings, its primary use is for screening and establishing [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]], to invoke the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements.  In US law, this is necessary to sustain a conviction based on evidential testing (or implied consent refusal).<ref name=\"nolo_ref\">[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press</ref>  Regardless of the terminology, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidential tests, ''probable cause'' must be shown (or the suspect must volunteer to take the evidential test without [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements being invoked).<ref name=\"nolo_ref\" />\n\nPolice are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary.

Some US states, notably California, have statutes on the books penalizing PBT refusal for drivers under 21; however the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Constitutionality]] of those statutes has not been tested.  (As a practical matter, most criminal lawyers advise not engaging in discussion or \"justifying\" a refusal with the police.)\n\n====3. Arrest (including invoking the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] law)====\n\n=====Probable cause for arrest=====\n{{main|Probable cause}}\nIf the officer has sufficient probable cause that the suspect has been driving under the influence of alcohol, they will make the arrest, [[handcuff]] the suspect and transport them to the police station. En route, the officer may advise them of their legal [[implied consent]] obligation to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of blood, breath or possibly urine depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nLaws relating to what exactly constitutes probable cause vary from state to state. In California it is a refutable presumption that a person with a BAC of 0.08% or higher is driving under the influence. However, section 23610(a)(2) of the [[California Vehicle Code]] states that driving with a BAC between 0.05% and 0.08% \"shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage\".\n\n====Chemical test====\nAn arrestee will be offered a [[Chemistry|chemical]] test of breath, blood or, much less frequently, urine. Breath test results are usually available immediately; urine and blood samples are sent to a [[Laboratory|lab]] for later analysis to determine the BAC or possible presence of drugs. Some states sought to impose criminal punishment for a refusal to submit to a chemical test of his/her breath or blood; however, in ''[[Birchfield v. North Dakota]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] visited the issue of whether states can criminalize a refusal to submit to a chemical test. The United States Supreme Court decided that states may criminalize a refusal to submit to a breath test; but not a refusal to submit to a blood test absent a McNeely warrant, named after ''[[Missouri v. McNeely]]'' (2013). This was a case decided by United States Supreme Court, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri, regarding exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution under exigent circumstances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/569/141/|title=Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. 141 (2013)|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court ruled that police must generally obtain a warrant before subjecting a drunken-driving suspect to a blood test, and that the natural metabolism of blood alcohol does not establish a per se exigency that would justify a blood draw without consent.\n\nRegarding blood tests, some commentators, such as Brown University's Jacob Appel, have criticized the role of medical personnel in this process. According to Appel, \"If physicians acquiesce today in the removal of a resistant patient's blood, soon they may be called upon to pump the contents of an unwilling patient's stomach or even to perform involuntary surgery to retrieve an evidential bullet\".<ref>[[Jacob M. Appel]].

However, state laws usually provide for a rebuttable legal presumption of intoxication at a BAC of 0.08% or higher (see [[blood alcohol test assumptions]]).\n\n====4. Criminal charge, and \"civil law\" sanctions====\n=====Booking and charging=====\n{{further|Arrest#United States}}\nIf it is determined after arrest that the person's BAC is not at or above the legal limit of 0.08%, they will probably be released without any charges. One may, however, still be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on the basis of driving symptoms, observed impairment, admissions or performance on the field sobriety tests. And if there is suspicion of drug usage, a blood or urine test is likely, or at least the testimony of a specially trained officer called a [[Drug Recognition Expert]] (DRE). Assuming sufficient evidence of impaired driving from drugs, the arrested may face charges of driving under the influence of drugs or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.\n\nMost of the time, the driver will either be kept in a holding cell (sometimes referred to as the \"[[drunk tank]]\") until they are deemed sober enough to be released on [[bail]] or on his \"own [[recognizance]]\" (OR). A date to appear in court for an [[arraignment]] will be given to them. If they cannot make bail or is not granted OR, they will be kept in jail to wait for the arraignment on [[remand (detention)|remand]].\n\n==Cost of an impaired driving charge==\nIn the United States, paying the DUI ticket, court costs, and attorney fees is just the start of a person's financial obligations after a DUI conviction. Additional costs of a DUI conviction will often involve the installation and maintenance fees of a vehicle Ignition Interlock Device, which serves the same function as a Breathalyzer to enable the vehicle to start. A person convicted of a driving under the influence charge, can also expect to pay higher insurance rates and premiums.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Decotis|first1=Mark|title=The Real Cost of a DUI|url=http://spacecoast.floridaweekly.com/news/2012-05-17/Top_News/THE_REAL_COST_of_a_DUI.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|agency=Florida Weekly|publisher=Florida Media Group LLC|date=17 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cost of a DUI|url=http://www2.courtinfo.ca.gov/stopteendui/parents/cost/how-much-does-a-dui-cost.cfm|website=California Judicial Council|publisher=State of California|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DUI: The $10,000 Toast|url=https://dbhdd.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-12-29/dui-10000-toast|website=Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities|publisher=State of Georgia|accessdate=4 December 2017|date=29 December 2009}}</ref> In addition, DUI records prevent entry into Canada without proper documentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the new policy on criminal inadmissibility?|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=143&top=8|website=Immigration and Citizenship|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\n[[File:WHO BAC Relative risk.png|thumb|Relative risk of an accident based on blood alcohol levels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/87564/E82659.pdf|title=Preventing road traffic injury: A public health perspective for Europe|author=|date=|website=Who.int}}</ref>]]\nDrunk driving is a public health concern in the United States, and reducing its frequency may require an integrated community-based approach utilizing sanctions and treatments.<ref name=\"GEE2007\">{{cite journal |author1=Gee, R.

Commercial pilots found to be in violation of regulations are typically fired or resign voluntarily, and they may lose their pilot certificates and be subject to criminal prosecution under Federal or State laws, effectively ending their careers.\n\nSimilar laws apply to other activities involving transportation; [[Michigan]] prohibits intoxicated use of motorized farm implements, or boating, the latter whether a pilot or passenger, with much the same threshold of intoxication. In the case of boating, the laws extend to include kayaks, canoes, sailboats\u2014any flotation device that needs to be steered in water. Different states have different laws and classifications on the level of transgression attached to a citation for boating under the influence. For example, [[Virginia]] has very similar penalties for a BUI as it does for a DUI. Those convicted of boating while intoxicated face penalties including, fines of up to $2,500, jail time of up to one year, loss of one's operator's license for up to three years and mandatory enrollment and completion of a Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Penalties for Boating While Intoxicated|url=https://www.boat-ed.com/virginia/studyGuide/Penalties-for-Boating-While-Intoxicated/10104701_700061987/|website=Boat Virginia Course|publisher=Kalkomey Enterprises, LLC.|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accident Statistics |publisher=U.S. Coast Guard |url=http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/accident_statistics.aspx |accessdate=Sep 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814121613/http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/accident_statistics.aspx |archivedate=2013-08-14 }}</ref> A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a \"true figure\" of alcohol-related deaths in that country \"may lie between 46% and 56%\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Barss | first = Peter | title = Boating Immersion and Trauma Deaths in Canada: 18 Years of Research | publisher = Transport Canada and The Canadian Red Cross Society | year = 2011 | url = http://www.redcross.ca/cmslib/general/2011_boating_fnl.pdf | access-date = 2013-09-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515224343/http://www.redcross.ca/cmslib/general/2011_boating_fnl.pdf | archive-date = 2013-05-15 | url-status = dead }}</ref>{{rp|15}}\n\n==International comparisons==\n{{see also|Driving under the influence}}\n\nIn countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia drunk driving and deaths caused by drunk driving are considerably lower than in the United States.

This test involves speaking or blowing into a hand held device to give a reading. Refusing a roadside test is an offense, and is subject to the same penalty as high range drunk driving. This detection method is not employed in the UK, and it is not an offence in England or Wales for a fully licensed driver to drive with a BAC of less than 0.08% (Australia and Scotland have limits of 0.05%). Also in Australia it is an offence for any person driving on Learner or probationary ('P1 or P2') plates (aged under 20 years) to drive with any alcohol at all in their system. The BAC must be 0.00% and still remains under 0.05% for an \"instructing a learner\".\n\nUnlike the United States, these countries do not see restricting access to alcohol as having any useful role to play in reducing drunk driving.

The key inquiry focuses on whether the driver's faculties were impaired by the substance that was consumed. The detection and successful prosecution of drivers impaired by prescription medication or illegal drugs can therefore be difficult. [[Breathalyzer]]s have been developed for the purpose of administering roadside or laboratory tests that can detect the actual level of a controlled substance in an individual's body.\n\n===History===\n[[File:Don't Mix 'Em 1937.jpg|thumb|left|1937 [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] drunk driving poster]]\nNew Jersey enacted the first law that specifically criminalized driving an automobile while intoxicated, in 1906.

At the same time, the [[National Safety Council]] set up a \"Committee on Tests for Intoxication\".\n\nIn the US, most of the laws and penalties were greatly enhanced starting in the late 1970s, and through the 1990s, largely due to pressure from groups like [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) and [[Students Against Destructive Decisions]] (SADD) and activists like [[Candy Lightner]] whose 13-year old daughter Cari was killed by a drunk driver.

Some states permit enforcement of DUI, DWI, and OWI/OVI statutes based on \"operation and control\" of a vehicle, while others require actual \"driving\". \"The distinction between these terms is material, for it is generally held that the word 'drive,' as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word 'operate' has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle, but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.\" (''State v.

These types of \"catch-all\" statutes cover situations involving a person under the influence of drugs or under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.

California also makes it illegal for persons who are on probation for a DUI conviction to drive with a blood or breath alcohol concentration of 0.01% or greater pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 23154. While the existence of a BAC of 0.01% or greater may not always result in prosecution for driving under the influence, it will expose such drivers to a one or two-year suspension through an administrative action by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. If that same person has a BAC of 0.08% or greater, it will prompt what is referred to as a \"dual action\", meaning a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.08% or greater and a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.01% or greater while on DUI Probation.\n\nIn California, in ''Mercer v. DMV'' (1991) 53 Cal.3d 753,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/mercer-v-department-motor-vehicles-31352|title=Mercer v. Department of Motor Vehicles - 53 Cal.3d 753 S017249 - Mon, 05/06/1991 {{!}} California Supreme Court Resources|website=Scocal.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-03-03}}</ref> the California State Supreme Court contrasted the term \"drive,\" commonly understood to require volitional movement of the vehicle, with the term \"driver,\" defined in California Vehicle Code \u00a7 305 as one who is either driving or in actual physical control. The court pointed out that the phrase \"actual physical control\" does not appear anywhere in the drunk driving offense statutes. Further, the court noted that since \"driver\" is defined as one who drives or is in actual physical control, the two terms (drive vs. actual physical control) must have different meanings. Construing these penal statutes strictly, rather than broadly, as is required by ''Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County'' (1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631, the court held that mere actual physical control is not enough to constitute driving. Therefore, the term: \"drive\", at least for purposes of the drunk driving statutes, requires volitional movement of the vehicle. In coming to this conclusion, the California Supreme Court held that in everyday usage the phrase, \"to drive a vehicle,\" is understood as requiring evidence of volitional movement of a vehicle. Numerous dictionary definitions-including Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1981), cited by the Court of Appeal in the case that led to the California Supreme Court's review of this case, support a definition of \"drive\" that includes movement. (See, e.g., ''Id''., at p.&nbsp;692.) fn. 5. The ''Mercer'' Court held that it believed that these definitions are consistent with the usual and ordinary understanding of that term, and suggest the sense in which the word was intended by the Legislature in the present context.\n\nCalifornia's \"catch-all\" provision was previously found in California Vehicle Code Section 23152(a); however new statutes that were made effective on January 1, 2014, two new sections were created to make sections specifically addressing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs, (which includes prescription medications if it can be shown that those medications impaired the driver), and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. \n* CVC 23152(a):  It is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug, or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug, to drive a vehicle\n* CVC 23152(b):  It is unlawful for any person who has 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle.\n* CVC 23152(e):  It is unlawful for a person who is under the influence of any drug to drive a vehicle\n* CVC 23152(f):  It is unlawful for a person who is under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug to drive a vehicle.\n====Idaho====\nUnder [[Idaho]] Law, any person in \"actual physical control\" of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any other intoxicating substance is guilty of driving under the influence.

Prior to increased emphasis on drinking and driving in the 1980s, standards of 0.10%-0.15% were in place.\n\n===Bicycle DUI===\nApproximately 20-30 states criminalized impaired riding a bicycle, whereas others have no sanctions relevant to cycling.<ref name=\"bikeleague\">[http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/bui_full_chart.pdf ''Bicycling under the influence'' chart], League of American Bicyclists ('''.pdf''')</ref><ref name=\"Avvobike\">[https://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/a-state-by-state-guide-to-biking-under-the-influence A state-by-state guide to biking under the influence], Avvo</ref>  Most such laws extend driving laws to all vehicles (\"all vehicles\" as opposed to \"motor vehicles\"), but a few address impaired bike riding separately.  In some states, enhanced penalties are automobile-specific.  Some states, notably Oregon, do not extend the [[implied consent|implied consent law]] to cyclists.<ref name=\"bikeleague\" />  While police activities targeting impaired cyclists are rare, a cyclist could encounter police in a circumstance where the cyclist would otherwise be ticketed.\n{{refn|group=nb|Cycling while impaired significantly increases the risk of injury and fatal accidents.

Criminal penalties are imposed as a result of criminal prosecution. Administrative penalties are imposed by a state agency, and in some cases may apply even if a person stopped for impaired driving is not convicted of the offense.\n\n===Criminal penalties===\nThe penalties for drunk driving vary among states and jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for the penalties to be different from county to county within any given state depending on the practices of the individual jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions require [[Prison|jail]] time and larger fines, even on a first offense. For instance, Ohio requires a mandatory 72-hour jail sentence for a first offense conviction; however, the jail time component is satisfied by attendance of the Ohio A.W.A.R.E. Program, which is a 72-hour alcohol-education program. Compared to many other countries, such as Sweden, penalties for drunk driving in the United States are considered less severe unless alcohol is involved in an incident causing injury or death of another, such DUI, DWI or OWI with Great Bodily Injury (GBI) or Vehicular Manslaughter.\n\n====Diversion programs====\nThe State of Washington used to permit those charged with a first offense drunk driving to complete a diversion program that resulted in the charges being dismissed upon the completion of a Diversion Program. In 1975, under the revised code of Washington or RCW Section 10.05, the Washington State Legislature established a deferred prosecution option for offenders arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or impairing drugs (DUI). It was intended to encourage individuals to seek appropriate treatment and, under this option, defendants with a significant alcohol or drug dependence problem could petition a court to defer disposition of their charge until they have completed intensive substance dependence treatment and met other conditions required by the court. If the defendant successfully completed the terms of the program, the charge was dismissed; for those who failed, the deferred status was revoked and the defendant was prosecuted for the original DUI charge. (RCW 10.05.010 and 10.05.020) In 1992, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute evaluated DUI deferred prosecution and concluded the program reduced DUI recidivism.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.wsipp.wa.gov/ReportFile/992\n| title = Washington State Institute for Public Policy\n| date = \n| website = \n| publisher = \n| access-date = \n}}</ref>\nIn 1998, the legislature modified the DUI statutes. Among other things, the length of deferred prosecution supervision was increased from two to five years and defendants were restricted to one deferred prosecution per lifetime.\n\n====Driving While Impaired court====\n{{main|DWI court}}\nThese innovative courts use substance abuse intervention with repeat offenders who plead guilty to driving while intoxicated. Those accepted into the diversionary program are required to abstain from alcohol. Some are required to wear a device that monitors and records any levels of alcohol detected in their bloodstreams.\n\n===Administrative penalties===\nThe federal [[Assimilative Crimes Act]], which makes [[State law (United States)|state law]] applicable on lands reserved or acquired by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of [[United States Congress|Congress]], recognizes collateral actions related to DUI convictions as punishments. According to {{UnitedStatesCode|18|13}}:\n\n{{quote|\u2026 that which may or shall be imposed through judicial or administrative action under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, for a conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol, shall be considered to be a punishment provided by that law \u2026}}\n\n====SR-22 - Proof of Financial Responsibility====\nAn [[SR-22 (insurance)|SR-22]] is an addendum to an insurance policy. It is an administrative form that attests to an insurance company's coverage, or the posting of a personal public bond in the amount of the state's minimum liability coverage for the licensed driver or vehicle registration. The SR in SR-22 stands for Safety Responsibility, and it is needed to reinstate a suspended driver's license after a DUI conviction in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is submitted to the State's DMV by an auto insurance company to serve as proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance that the states requires. They are essentially an agreement between a driver's insurance company and the respective State's DMV that requires the driver's insurance company to notify the respective State's DMV that the driver's insurance has either been terminated or lapsed; thus instituting a suspension of the driver's driving privileges until proof of insurance is re-filed with the State's DMV.\n\nWhile SR-22s are typically filed with the respective State's DMV, some States require the driver to carry proof of the SR-22 or to carry it in the registered vehicle, (particularly if the driver has been cited for coverage lapses or other administrative infractions). SR-22s may attest coverage for a vehicle regardless of operator (owner liability coverage), or cover a specific person regardless of the specific vehicle operated (operator liability coverage).\n\nAs stated, the form is required in 49 states and the US District of Columbia in order to register a vehicle for usage on public roads. It is also required to redeem a license which has been suspended due to coverage lapse in these required states. These states also, generally, require that the issuing insurance company provide the relevant state's DMV with timely updates as to the status of such coverage. If the policy with the SR22 cancels, a form called an SR26 is issued and sent to the state DMV.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/pages/driverid/sr22.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408113313/http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/driverid/sr22.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Oregon Department of Transportation : SR-22 Information : Oregon Driver & Motor Vehicle Services : State of Oregon|archivedate=April 8, 2008|website=Oregon.gov}}</ref>  Upon notice that there has been a lapse in coverage, the state will suspend the driver's license again.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Delbridge|first1=Emily|title=What Happens If I Let My SR22 Car Insurance Cancel?|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-happens-if-i-let-my-sr22-car-insurance-cancel-527270|website=The Balance|publisher=Dotdash|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> Another SR-22 filing will need to be submitted to regain driving privileges.\n\n====Alcohol education programs====\nEvery jurisdiction imposes the completion of alcohol education programs, commonly known as DUI programs, subsequent to a DUI/DWI/OWI conviction. Additionally, some states impose an additional requirement that a person attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP) administered by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD), which was established in 1982. Both DUI classes and Victim Impact Panels are available in some states for first offense DUIs dependent on the judge's decision.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victim Impact Panels|url=http://duijusticelink.aaa.com/issues/sanctions/victim-impact-panels/|website=AAA DUI Justice Link|publisher=AAA|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n====DUI Plates====\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=Ohio license plate issued to DUI offenders sample.jpg|caption1=Ohio DUI plate|image2=MN drunk plate.jpg|caption2=Minnesota drunk driver plate|image3=MN plate.jpg|caption3=By comparison, a regular Minnesota plate has colored graphics}}\nIn 1967, [[Ohio]] began to issue special [[vehicle registration plate|license plates]] to DUI offenders who are granted limited driving privileges such as work-related driving until a court can rule that they can have full privileges back.

When required under a high BAC level or multiple offense threshold, [[ignition interlock|ignition interlock requirements]] address a strong tendency of repeat offense by drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]] (AUD or alcoholism).\n\n[[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after positive [[#chemical_test|chemical blood alcohol tests]], as a physical deterrent for drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]], or as a [[Civil penalty|pseudo-civil punishment]].  [[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after an [[implied consent|implied consent refusal]] under similar forensic procedures.\n\n=====Operation of IIDs=====\nIn most US implementations, [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] are set to a \"[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]\" level (set to either levels consistent with culinary alcohol or measurement errors).  Violations can occur from a driver exceeding the \"[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]\" level, but can also occur from use by other drivers within legal limits, or from test anomalies.  In some states, anomalies are routinely discounted, for example as not consistent with patterns of BAC levels or at levels incompatible with life (e.g., significant mouth alcohol - which as BAC would be fatal).  In some states, \"fail\" readings not consistent with actual alcohol use can be cleared by a routine process, but other states automatically deem these \"fail\" readings as violations.\n\nIn operation, the driver blows into the [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] to enable the car's starter.  After a variable time period of approximately 20\u201340 minutes, the driver is required to re-certify (blow again) within a time period consistent with safely pulling off the roadway.  If the driver fails to re-certify within the time period, the car will alarm in a manner similar to setting off the car's immobilzer (but mechanically independent of the [[immobilizer]]).\n\nVarious US states have different penalties for disabling IIDs.  In some cases, the driver may be penalized if a family member or mechanic disables the IID when not in use by the sanctioned individual, or temporarily for servicing the vehicle.  In some implementations, disabling by mechanics and others is either permitted or authorisation easily obtained, but some jurisdictions restrict or deny authorisation.  (Such restrictions on mechanics can be problematic, for example, if limited to designated \"licensed mechanics\" or as applied to routine repair procedures requiring operation of the ignition and starter systems.)   Some jurisdictions criminalize such temporary bypass of IIDs.\n\n=====Universal IID installation=====\nProposals (none official) have been made to install [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] on all new vehicles, set to the legal limit for the driver.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  Issues to be solved, besides consumer and voter acceptance, include difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements without inconvenience, and a need to achieve [[Six Sigma|Six&nbsp;Sigma (6\u03c3)]] reliability,<ref>6\u03c3 refers to long-term defect levels below 3.4 [[defects per million opportunities]] (DPMO)</ref> in order to not interfere with vehicle usability.\n\nThere are no present plans to introduce universal IID installation in the US.\n\n====Vehicle impoundment and forfeiture====\nSome states, such as California, allow for the [[Vehicle impoundment|impoundment]] and [[asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of vehicles under certain conditions.<ref>California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 14600 et seq.</ref><ref>California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 23592 et seq.</ref>\n\n==Investigation and arrest==\nA drunk driving charge is a type of police arrest process, so a basic understanding of the process of police engagement is essential to understanding how that process applies to that process as applied to a drunk driving charge.\n\n===Legal Stages===\nFollowing are common procedures when a law enforcement officer has reason to suspect a driver is intoxicated.  While local procedures vary under the 10s of thousands of courts in the US having traffic jurisdiction, the basic procedure is:\n:'''1. reasonable suspicion'''\n:'''2. probable cause'''\n:'''3. arrest''' (including invoking the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] law)\n:'''4. criminal charge and [[Civil penalty|\"civil law\" sanctions]]'''<ref>[[Civil penalty|Civil penalties]] in this context are in most instances criminal in nature, but intentionally circumvent criminal due process under the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].</ref>\n\nThe legal stages are relevant because of the degree of evidence required at each stage.   (For example, the police need not demonstrate guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in order to execute a traffic stop.)\n\n===Investigation \"Phases\" (NHTSA)===\n<!-- POSSIBLY WILL CHANGE TO \"INVESTIGATION PHASES\" --> \nThe investigation and NHTSA \"phases\" are distinct from the legal stages of the police arrest process.  Instead, the investigation has, as its purpose, to take the process from initial contact through all of the evidence stages, through to prosecution.  The primary goals are to:\n\n* Identify impaired drivers;\n* Establish clear ''[[probable cause]] for arrest'', which is necessary to sustain the use of [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]] in court.  Without ''probable cause'', the [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]] are subject to the [[exclusionary rule]]\n* Proceed to obtain proof of intoxication, typically using [[breathalyzer|chemical test results]].\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, police officers should conduct DUI Investigations according to a specific protocol called phases. According to the NHTSA training, DUI Investigations are categorized by these phases:\n* Phase 1 - \"Vehicle in Motion\"\n* Phase 2 - \"Personal Contact\"\n* Phase 3 - \"Pre-Arrest Screening\"\n\nThe \"Vehicle in Motion\" Phase deals with the law enforcement officers' observations of the suspect's driving maneuvers. The \"Personal Contact\" Phase is where the officer actually comes into contact with the suspected impaired driver. The \"Pre-Arrest Screening\" Phase is portion of the DUI Investigation that encompasses the Pre-Field Sobriety Test Questioning and the Field Sobriety Testing, including a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test where applicable. This Phase also includes the post-arrest evidentiary chemical test despite that it occurs subsequent to a DUI arrest, not prior to a DUI arrest.\n\nThe officer will typically approach the driver's window and ask some preliminary questions. During this phase of the stop, the officer will note if they detect any of the following indicators of intoxication:\n*Odor of an alcoholic beverage on the driver's breath or in the car generally\n*Slurred speech in response to the questioning\n*Watery, blood shot, or reddish eyes\n*Flushed face\n*Droopy eyelids\n*Difficulty in understanding and responding intelligently to question\n*Fumbling with his or her driver's license and registration\n*The plain-view presence of containers of alcoholic beverages in the vehicle\n*Admission of consumption of alcoholic beverage\n\nIf the officer observes enough to have a reasonable suspicion to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle, and request that the driver submit to voluntary [[Field sobriety testing|field sobriety tests]].\n\n===Overall Stop and Arrest Process===\n''Note:  Local terminology will vary, but these general classifications fall under [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] guidelines.''\n\nEach stage has different requirements for establishing a basis for police or prosecutorial  action.   Without establishing that basis, the process is illegal and can cause a prosecution to fail under the [[exclusionary rule]].\n\n====1. Reasonable suspicion and traffic stop====\n{{main|Reasonable suspicion}}\nThe police must have a reason to engage in a traffic stop.  This typically involves either observing a traffic violation or observing behavior, such as weaving or lane departure, that would raise a \"reasonable suspicion\" of driving while impaired.  The police must have an articulable reason for the stop, but does not need probable cause for an arrest.\n\nOne exception is a roadblock (where legal).  Roadblocks do not involve reasonable suspicion, but must meet particular legal standards to avoid arbitrariness while still assuring randomness.\n\nDuring the traffic stop, the police will attempt to obtain sufficient evidence to support \"probable cause\".  This includes asking questions, and requesting further evidence or confession.\n\nThere are several situations in which the officer will come into contact with a driver, some examples are:\n*The officer on patrol has observed erratic, suspicious driving, or a series of traffic infractions indicating the possibility that the driver may be impaired. This is by far the most common reason for stopping a suspect.\n*A police officer has stopped a vehicle for a lesser traffic offense, notices the signs of intoxication, and begins the DUI investigation.\n*The driver has been involved in an automobile collision; the officer has responded to the scene and is conducting an investigation.\n*The driver has been stopped at a [[random checkpoint|sobriety checkpoint]] (also known as roadblocks).\n*The police have received a report, possibly from an anonymous citizen, that a described car has been driving erratically. The officer should verify the erratic driving before pulling the driver over. In some cases, the driver will no longer be in the vehicle.\n\nThe following list of DUI symptoms, from a publication issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (DOT HS-805-711),<ref>{{cite book|title=Guide for detecting drunk drivers at night|date=1985|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|edition=2}}</ref> is widely used in training officers to detect drunk drivers. After each symptom is a percentage figure which, according to NHTSA, indicates the statistical chances through research that a driver is over the legal limit.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Turning with wide radius                      || over 50%\n|-\n| Straddling center or lane marker              || 65%\n|-\n| Appearing to be drunk                         || 60%\n|-\n| Almost striking object or vehicle             || 60%\n|-\n| Weaving                                       || 60%\n|-\n| Driving on other than designated roadway      || 55%\n|-\n| Swerving                                      || 55%\n|-\n| Slow speed (more than 10&nbsp;mph below limit)|| 50%\n|-\n| Stopping (without cause) in traffic lane      || 50%\n|-\n| Drifting                                      || 50%\n|-\n| Following too closely                         || 45%\n|-\n| Tires on center or lane marker                || 45%\n|-\n| Braking erratically                           || 45%\n|-\n| Driving into opposing or crossing traffic     || 45%\n|-\n| Signaling inconsistent with driving actions  || 40%\n|-\n| Stopping inappropriately (other than in lane) || 35%\n|-\n| Turning abruptly or illegally                 || 35%\n|-\n| Accelerating or decelerating rapidly          || 30%\n|-\n| Headlights off                                || 30%\n|}\n\nIf the officer observes enough evidence to have a \"[[Reasonable suspicion|Reasonable Suspicion]]\" to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.\n\n====2. Probable cause====\n\"Probable cause\" is established by obtaining evidence from the police encounter sufficient to meet the \"probable cause\" standard for arrest.   \"Probable cause\" is not necessarily sufficient to obtain a conviction, but is a prerequisite for arrest.  Examples of \"probable cause\" for a drunk driving arrest includes:\n\n:1. Observation\n:2. [[Confession (law)|Confession]] of having consumed alcohol in the recent past.  '''Relevant examples of confessions:'''\n:::- \"I had a glass of wine.\"\n:::- \"I was at a friend's party.\"\n:::- \"I was at the Stone Balloon.\"\n::The confession is the easiest way to establish \"probable cause\", and police know that social convention encourages people to respond to police questions.  ''While it is inadvisable to lie to police, the suspect has the option to \"respectfully decline\" to answer questions.''<ref name=\"riskology\">[https://www.riskology.co/traffic-stop/ Pulled Over?

The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training.\n\n=====Issues with FSTs=====\nThe NHTSA have published numerous training manuals associated with FSTs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/standardized-field-sobriety-test-training-downloads|title=DWI Detection and Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) Resources|last=brandon.gobel@dot.gov|date=2019-07-19|website=NHTSA|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 pounds or greater overweight. The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered \"divided attention tests\" that test the suspect's ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile. However, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting [[proprioception]] (the awareness of the body's movement), such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]].\n\nThe three validated tests by NHTSA are:\n#The Horizontal Gaze [[Physiologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]] Test, which involves following an object with the eyes (such as a pen) to determine characteristic eye movement reaction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus: The Science and the Law|url=https://ntl.bts.gov/lib/25000/25900/25975/DOT-HS-808-938.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=American Prosecutors Research Institute|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n#The Walk-and-Turn Test ([[Tandem gait|heel-to-toe]] in a straight line). This test is designed to measure a person's ability to follow directions and remember a series of steps while dividing attention between physical and mental tasks.\n#The One-Leg-Stand Test\n\nAccording to NHTSA, these tests were not designed to measure impairment, but rather to give a probability that a driver is at or above a 0.08% BAC. However, studies have shown that there are reasons to doubt the tests' usefulness in helping an officer to make such a determination. In 1991, Dr. Spurgeon Cole of [[Clemson University]] conducted a study of the accuracy of FSTs. His staff videotaped people performing six common field sobriety tests, then showed the tapes to 14 police officers and asked them to decide whether the suspects had \"had too much to drink and drive\" (''sic''). The blood-alcohol concentration of each of the 21 DUI subjects was 0.00, unknown to the officers. The result: the officers gave their opinion that 46% of these innocent people were too drunk to be able to drive. This study showed the possible inaccuracy of FSTs.<ref>Cole and Nowaczyk, \"Field Sobriety Tests: Are they Designed for Failure?\", 79 Perceptual and Motor Skills Journal 99 (1994).</ref>\n\nAlternative tests, which have not been scientifically validated, include:\n*[[Romberg test]], or the Modified-Position-of-Attention Test, (feet together, head back, eyes closed for thirty seconds).\n*The Finger-to-Nose Test (tip head back, eyes closed, touch the tip of nose with tip of index finger).\n*The Alphabet Test (recite all or part of the alphabet).\n*The Finger Count Test (touch each finger of hand to thumb counting with each touch (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)).\n*The Counting Test (counting backwards from a number ending in a number other than 5 or 0 and stopping at a number ending other than 5 or 0.

These are often referred to as PAS Tests, or \"Preliminary Alcohol Screening\" Tests\", or a PBT, \"Preliminary Breath Test\" and precede the actual arrest and subsequent requirement to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of the suspect's breath or blood. These breath testing devices used are smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, more sophisticated instruments at the police stations, commonly known as an Evidentiary Breath Test using an EBT device, or Evidentiary Breath Test device. An increasing number jurisdictions began using Portable Evidentiary Breath Test devices, or PEBT devices, that are more sophisticated versions of the smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, larger instruments at the police stations. Another distinction is that, while the larger EBTs usually employ [[infrared spectroscopy]], the PEBT and PAS devices use a relatively simple electrochemical ([[fuel cell]]) technology. When used for purposes of a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, or PAS Test, their purpose, along with the other FSTs, is to assist the officer in determining whether he/she has [[probable cause]] for arrest.\n\nThe Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS) is sometimes categorised as part of ''field sobriety testing'', although it is not part of the series of performance tests.  The PBT (or PAS) uses a portable breath tester.   While the tester provides numerical blood alcohol content (BAC) readings, its primary use is for screening and establishing [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]], to invoke the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements.  In US law, this is necessary to sustain a conviction based on evidential testing (or implied consent refusal).<ref name=\"nolo_ref\">[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press</ref>  Regardless of the terminology, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidential tests, ''probable cause'' must be shown (or the suspect must volunteer to take the evidential test without [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements being invoked).<ref name=\"nolo_ref\" />\n\nPolice are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary.

Some US states, notably California, have statutes on the books penalizing PBT refusal for drivers under 21; however the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Constitutionality]] of those statutes has not been tested.  (As a practical matter, most criminal lawyers advise not engaging in discussion or \"justifying\" a refusal with the police.)\n\n====3. Arrest (including invoking the [[Implied consent#Driving while intoxicated|implied consent]] law)====\n\n=====Probable cause for arrest=====\n{{main|Probable cause}}\nIf the officer has sufficient probable cause that the suspect has been driving under the influence of alcohol, they will make the arrest, [[handcuff]] the suspect and transport them to the police station. En route, the officer may advise them of their legal [[implied consent]] obligation to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of blood, breath or possibly urine depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nLaws relating to what exactly constitutes probable cause vary from state to state. In California it is a refutable presumption that a person with a BAC of 0.08% or higher is driving under the influence. However, section 23610(a)(2) of the [[California Vehicle Code]] states that driving with a BAC between 0.05% and 0.08% \"shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage\".\n\n====Chemical test====\nAn arrestee will be offered a [[Chemistry|chemical]] test of breath, blood or, much less frequently, urine. Breath test results are usually available immediately; urine and blood samples are sent to a [[Laboratory|lab]] for later analysis to determine the BAC or possible presence of drugs. Some states sought to impose criminal punishment for a refusal to submit to a chemical test of his/her breath or blood; however, in ''[[Birchfield v. North Dakota]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] visited the issue of whether states can criminalize a refusal to submit to a chemical test. The United States Supreme Court decided that states may criminalize a refusal to submit to a breath test; but not a refusal to submit to a blood test absent a McNeely warrant, named after ''[[Missouri v. McNeely]]'' (2013). This was a case decided by United States Supreme Court, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri, regarding exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution under exigent circumstances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/569/141/|title=Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. 141 (2013)|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court ruled that police must generally obtain a warrant before subjecting a drunken-driving suspect to a blood test, and that the natural metabolism of blood alcohol does not establish a per se exigency that would justify a blood draw without consent.\n\nRegarding blood tests, some commentators, such as Brown University's Jacob Appel, have criticized the role of medical personnel in this process. According to Appel, \"If physicians acquiesce today in the removal of a resistant patient's blood, soon they may be called upon to pump the contents of an unwilling patient's stomach or even to perform involuntary surgery to retrieve an evidential bullet\".<ref>[[Jacob M. Appel]].

However, state laws usually provide for a rebuttable legal presumption of intoxication at a BAC of 0.08% or higher (see [[blood alcohol test assumptions]]).\n\n====4. Criminal charge, and \"civil law\" sanctions====\n=====Booking and charging=====\n{{further|Arrest#United States}}\nIf it is determined after arrest that the person's BAC is not at or above the legal limit of 0.08%, they will probably be released without any charges. One may, however, still be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on the basis of driving symptoms, observed impairment, admissions or performance on the field sobriety tests. And if there is suspicion of drug usage, a blood or urine test is likely, or at least the testimony of a specially trained officer called a [[Drug Recognition Expert]] (DRE). Assuming sufficient evidence of impaired driving from drugs, the arrested may face charges of driving under the influence of drugs or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.\n\nMost of the time, the driver will either be kept in a holding cell (sometimes referred to as the \"[[drunk tank]]\") until they are deemed sober enough to be released on [[bail]] or on his \"own [[recognizance]]\" (OR). A date to appear in court for an [[arraignment]] will be given to them. If they cannot make bail or is not granted OR, they will be kept in jail to wait for the arraignment on [[remand (detention)|remand]].\n\n==Cost of an impaired driving charge==\nIn the United States, paying the DUI ticket, court costs, and attorney fees is just the start of a person's financial obligations after a DUI conviction. Additional costs of a DUI conviction will often involve the installation and maintenance fees of a vehicle Ignition Interlock Device, which serves the same function as a Breathalyzer to enable the vehicle to start. A person convicted of a driving under the influence charge, can also expect to pay higher insurance rates and premiums.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Decotis|first1=Mark|title=The Real Cost of a DUI|url=http://spacecoast.floridaweekly.com/news/2012-05-17/Top_News/THE_REAL_COST_of_a_DUI.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|agency=Florida Weekly|publisher=Florida Media Group LLC|date=17 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cost of a DUI|url=http://www2.courtinfo.ca.gov/stopteendui/parents/cost/how-much-does-a-dui-cost.cfm|website=California Judicial Council|publisher=State of California|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DUI: The $10,000 Toast|url=https://dbhdd.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-12-29/dui-10000-toast|website=Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities|publisher=State of Georgia|accessdate=4 December 2017|date=29 December 2009}}</ref> In addition, DUI records prevent entry into Canada without proper documentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the new policy on criminal inadmissibility?|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=143&top=8|website=Immigration and Citizenship|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\n[[File:WHO BAC Relative risk.png|thumb|Relative risk of an accident based on blood alcohol levels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/87564/E82659.pdf|title=Preventing road traffic injury: A public health perspective for Europe|author=|date=|website=Who.int}}</ref>]]\nDrunk driving is a public health concern in the United States, and reducing its frequency may require an integrated community-based approach utilizing sanctions and treatments.<ref name=\"GEE2007\">{{cite journal |author1=Gee, R.

Commercial pilots found to be in violation of regulations are typically fired or resign voluntarily, and they may lose their pilot certificates and be subject to criminal prosecution under Federal or State laws, effectively ending their careers.\n\nSimilar laws apply to other activities involving transportation; [[Michigan]] prohibits intoxicated use of motorized farm implements, or boating, the latter whether a pilot or passenger, with much the same threshold of intoxication. In the case of boating, the laws extend to include kayaks, canoes, sailboats\u2014any flotation device that needs to be steered in water. Different states have different laws and classifications on the level of transgression attached to a citation for boating under the influence. For example, [[Virginia]] has very similar penalties for a BUI as it does for a DUI. Those convicted of boating while intoxicated face penalties including, fines of up to $2,500, jail time of up to one year, loss of one's operator's license for up to three years and mandatory enrollment and completion of a Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Penalties for Boating While Intoxicated|url=https://www.boat-ed.com/virginia/studyGuide/Penalties-for-Boating-While-Intoxicated/10104701_700061987/|website=Boat Virginia Course|publisher=Kalkomey Enterprises, LLC.|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accident Statistics |publisher=U.S. Coast Guard |url=http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/accident_statistics.aspx |accessdate=Sep 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814121613/http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/accident_statistics.aspx |archivedate=2013-08-14 }}</ref> A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a \"true figure\" of alcohol-related deaths in that country \"may lie between 46% and 56%\".<ref>{{cite web | last = Barss | first = Peter | title = Boating Immersion and Trauma Deaths in Canada: 18 Years of Research | publisher = Transport Canada and The Canadian Red Cross Society | year = 2011 | url = http://www.redcross.ca/cmslib/general/2011_boating_fnl.pdf | access-date = 2013-09-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515224343/http://www.redcross.ca/cmslib/general/2011_boating_fnl.pdf | archive-date = 2013-05-15 | url-status = dead }}</ref>{{rp|15}}\n\n==International comparisons==\n{{see also|Driving under the influence}}\n\nIn countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia drunk driving and deaths caused by drunk driving are considerably lower than in the United States.

This test involves speaking or blowing into a hand held device to give a reading. Refusing a roadside test is an offense, and is subject to the same penalty as high range drunk driving. This detection method is not employed in the UK, and it is not an offence in England or Wales for a fully licensed driver to drive with a BAC of less than 0.08% (Australia and Scotland have limits of 0.05%). Also in Australia it is an offence for any person driving on Learner or probationary ('P1 or P2') plates (aged under 20 years) to drive with any alcohol at all in their system. The BAC must be 0.00% and still remains under 0.05% for an \"instructing a learner\".\n\nUnlike the United States, these countries do not see restricting access to alcohol as having any useful role to play in reducing drunk driving.

In 1947 the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] included two additional teams: [[Manly-Warringah DRLFC]] and [[Parramatta DRLFC]]. The new club adopted the nickname \"Sea Eagles\" and went on to compete in every season of top-level rugby league until merging with the nearby [[North Sydney Bears]] to form the [[Northern Eagles]] club at the end of 1999. After three years the joint-venture team was disbanded with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles returning as a sole entity once more to the [[National Rugby League]].\n\n==Background==\n\nIn Australia, before 1908, most football clubs in Sydney played by the rules of the [[Rugby Football Union]] and had done so since the first R.F.U. rules were written in 1871. As the [[rugby league|professional game]] came to Sydney, the bigger inner city districts left their affiliation with the Rugby Football Union and created a new top flight football competition in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1908|1908]].\n\nTwo factors prevented the initial inclusion of a Manly team into the competition. Firstly, with the Manly Rugby Union Club only recently gaining acceptance into the Sydney competition, many involved were not prepared to take a chance on the new code, which had yet to prove itself as a sustainable entity. Add to this a population base barely in the thousands, and well spread out among the many farms in the region, and sustainable support would have been difficult to envisage.\n\nWith a strong growth in local population through the 1920s, the Manly-Warringah Junior Rugby Football League was founded 11 February 1932 with six clubs established for the local competition. The formation of this League entitled Manly's inclusion into the President's Cup, a junior district competition run by the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]].\n\nFurther attempts were made for a Manly club to join the NSWRL top grades in both 1937 and 1944; however, both were unsuccessful. The backers of a Manly club were convinced only a President's Cup premiership would give them an opportunity to successfully apply for the senior competition.\n\nDuring 1946, two meetings involving the [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] club which would seal Manly's future. Their first encounter was played out on 17 June 1946 when the two districts met in the final of the President's Cup; played in front of 64,527 spectators as the curtain raiser for the First [[Test match (rugby league)|Test]] against the touring [[Great Britain national rugby league team|British Lions]]. Manly maintained an early lead to claim the match, 12\u20138.\n\nThe second meeting was between the senior NSWRL clubs on 4 November 1946, in which the North Sydney club supported the inclusion of Manly into the senior competition, despite knowing that many of its Manly players would no longer be eligible to play for North Sydney due to the district residential rule of the time.\n\nWith the Manly club being successful this time, a public meeting on 20 November 1946 saw the formation of the Manly-Warringah District Rugby League Football Club. The club took on the colours of maroon and white. These were adopted from the colours of the President's Cup side which appears to have utilised the colours of the local Freshwater Surf Lifesaving Club, established in 1908, and of which [[Ken Arthurson]] and other players were members. [[Brookvale Oval]] was established as the team's home ground.\n\n===1947-1949===\n12 April [[NSWRFL season 1947|1947]] saw the Manly club taking on the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] club in its first official game in the NSWRFL senior competition, but despite scoring three tries (the first of which came from Keith \"Meggsy\" Kirkwood) to Wests' one, the Manly side went down 15\u201313. The lineup for that match was: [[Bert Collins|A 'Bert' Collins]], [[Jim Walsh (rugby league)|Jim Walsh]], [[Kelly McMahon|C \u2018Kelly\u2019 McMahon]], [[Mackie Campbell]], [[Johnny Bliss]], [[Merv Gillmer]],\n[[Gary Maddrell]], [[James Hall (rugby league)|James Hall]], [[Keith Kirkwood]], [[Max Whitehead]] (c), [[Pat Hines]], [[Ern Cannon]], [[Harry Grew]]. The coach was [[Harold Johnson (rugby league)|Harold Johnson]].\n\nThe club's first win in the top league was a 15\u20137 victory against fellow newcomers [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]], at Brookvale Oval, 31 May 1947. By season's end, Manly had racked up just four victories from 18 rounds, which was enough to avoid the wooden spoon, with Parramatta winning one less game for the season.\n\nThe 1948-1950 period saw the club languish at the bottom of the table, coming ninth, eighth and eighth out of ten. However, the club did have local junior [[Roy Bull]] selected for an Australian Test team which played against New Zealand in October 1949, thus becoming Manly-Warringah's first home-grown International.\n\n===1950s===\n\nThe Manly-Warringah club originally had played in a maroon jersey with a large white 'V' on the front. The club was one of the first to feature a crest or emblem, with an MW on a crest appearing in the early 1950s. Far from the flashy emblems worn today, the Manly \u2018Sea Eagle\u2019 which appeared in the mid-1950s was often confused for a seagull by many, including the media. As there were no official nicknames for clubs at the time, more an adopted \u2018mascot\u2019, it was not considered an issue.\n\nOn 25 April 1951, a new attendance record at Brookvale was set at 9,447, with spectators overflowing onto the field for a match between Manly and South Sydney.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Goodman\n  | first = Tom\n  | title = Manly disputes penalty try by Graves\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | pages = 8\n  | date = 1951-04-26\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130124214524/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archive-date = 2013-01-24\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref> The [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1951|1951]] team won 11 games, finishing second at the end of the regular season, and were in their first finals campaign. After accounting for both [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the semi-finals, Manly were to meet a [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] side which were the reigning Premiers and had won the minor premiership by 11 points. The result was a 42\u201314 loss for Manly.\n\nIn 1952, Roy Bull became the club's first ever [[Kangaroo Tour]]ist when he was selected to go on the [[1952-53 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. He would play 17 games on the Kangaroo Tour, four of them test matches for Australia.\n\n[[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1956|1956]] saw the first of 11 Premierships for the St George club, resulting in two more runners-up trophies for Manly in both [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1957|1957]] (31-9) and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1959|1959]] (20-0). The 1957 season saw a young [[Ken Arthurson]] take the reins as the Manly coach, a position he held until the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1961|1961]] season.\n\n===1960s===\nFrom the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1960|1960]] to the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1969|1969]] seasons, Manly's form ranged from third-place finishes in [[NSWRFL season 1961|1961]] and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1966|1966]], to an eighth placing in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1964|1964]].\n\nThe combination of the return of Wally O'Connell to the club as coach in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1966|1966]], and the development of Ken Arthurson's skill as an administrator professionalized the club. With the groundwork laid and a couple of years of development of the future [[The Immortals (rugby league)|Immortal]] [[Bob Fulton]], the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1968|1968 competition]] saw Manly compete with St George and South Sydney.\n\nAt the end of the home and away season, Manly finished second, one point behind reigning Premiers, South Sydney. The Major Semi-Final saw Manly beat Souths, 23\u201315, but the clubs soon met again in the Grand Final where the Rabbitohs proved too strong and won the decider, 13\u20139.\n\n===1970s===\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1970|1970 season]] ended with Manly losing to the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] 23\u201312.\n\nBy the end of the regular [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1971|1971 season]], the club had both the best defence and attack record, lost three games and claimed their maiden Minor Premiership over second placed [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Rabbitohs]]. However, they did not made the final due to two successive losses.\n\nThe Sea Eagles finished as [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1972|1972]] Minor Premiers and heading into the finals series with 12 wins and 1 draw from the last 13 rounds.\n\nThe Major Semi saw Manly taking on [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters|Easts]] and winning 32\u20138, before meeting again in the decider two weeks later where Manly-Warringah claimed their maiden Premiership, 19\u201314 in front of 54,537 fans at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\n*'''16 September 1972'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Ken Irvine]], [[Ray Branighan]], [[Bob Fulton]], [[Max Brown (rugby league)|Max Brown]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Dennis Ward (rugby league)|Dennis Ward]], [[Mal Reilly]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Allan Thomson (rugby league)|Allan Thomson]], [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]], [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Fred Jones]] (c), [[Bill Hamilton (rugby league)|Bill Hamilton]]\n\nCoach: [[Ron Willey]]\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 19 (Jones, Branighan tries; Branighan 6 goals; Fulton field goal) defeated Eastern Suburbs Roosters - 14 (Ballesty, Mullins tries; McKean 4 goals)<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Clarkson\n  | first = Alan\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Manly - deserved winners\n  | work = [[The Sun-Herald]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | pages = 72\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date = 17 September 1972\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DaApAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eOUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5441,7161490\n  | accessdate = 19 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1973|1973]] finals were the first to feature five teams, allowing the Minor Premiers a week off during the first round of finals. The 14\u20134 win by Manly over [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]] in the first week of the finals saw the club with a week off before again meeting Cronulla in the Grand Final.\n\nThe 1973 Grand Final is often quoted as one of the most brutal games in Rugby League history. Led by a ferocious forward pack, the Cronulla side looked to unsettle the reigning Premiers, and the game was riddled with fights, late hits and illegal play from both sides. Key Manly playmaker [[Mal Reilly|Malcolm \"Mal\" Reilly]] was taken out early when hit late and did not return after halftime. [[Bob Fulton]]'s superior skills shone through, and the Sharks plan to unsettle the Sea Eagles was foiled. Fulton's two tries saw the Manly side win 10-7 and claim the Premiership for the second time.\n\n*'''15 September 1973'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Ken Irvine]], [[Ray Branighan]], [[Bob Fulton]], [[Max Brown (rugby league)|Max Brown]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Johnny Mayes]], [[Mal Reilly]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Peter Peters]], [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]], [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Fred Jones]] (c), [[Bill Hamilton (rugby league)|Bill Hamilton]]\n\nReplacement: [[John Bucknall]] for Mal Reilly, injured\n\nCoach: [[Ron Willey]].\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 10 (Fulton 2 tries; Eadie 2 goals) defeated Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks - 7 (Bourke try; Rogers 2 goals)\n\nIn the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1974|1974]] and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1975|1975]] seasons were dominated by an unstoppable Eastern Suburbs club, winning the Minor Premierships by 8 and 10 points. Against this juggernaut, the Manly club finished second on the table for both seasons, losing a total of four out the five finals game and failing to qualify for either Grand Final.\n\nManly held off the [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] to win the Minor Premiership in the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1976|1976 season]]. During their two meetings during the regular season, the Eels had proved too strong on both occasions and followed that up with another win, this time in the Major Semi Final. Manly went on to beat [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] to set up a rematch against Parramatta in the Grand Final, where Manly won their third Premiership in five years.\n\n*'''18 September 1976'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Tom Mooney (rugby league)|Tom Mooney]], [[Russel Gartner]], [[Bob Fulton]] (c), [[Rod Jackson (rugby league)|Rod Jackson]], [[Alan Thompson (rugby league)|Alan Thompson]], [[Gary Stephens]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Phil Lowe]], [[Steve Norton]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Max Krilich]], [[John Harvey (rugby league)|John Harvey]]\n\nReplacements: [[Gary Thoroughgood]] for Ian Martin; [[Mark Willoughby]] for Phil Lowe\n\nCoach: [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]]\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 13 (Lowe try; Eadie 5 goals) defeated [[Parramatta Eels]] - 10 (Porter, Gerard tries; Peard 2 goals)\n\nManly started the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1977|1977]] season with three solid wins, despite the loss of [[Bob Fulton]] to the Roosters, however, four losses in a row saw the club lose momentum with only a last round victory against the [[Balmain Tigers]] at [[Leichhardt Oval]] securing fifth spot from a fast-finishing Cronulla side. However, the Tigers reversed the result in the first week of the finals, to knock the Sea Eagles out of title contention. After the [[1977 NSWRFL season]] [[Roy Bull]] was elected the Manly-Warringah club's president, succeeding Bill Cameron who had held the position for the previous 19 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manly gets new president|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q4ARAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-eYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2684,2722727|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 December 1977}}</ref>\n\nSuccess for the club during the 1970s culminated with the club scoring a fourth Premiership in another Grand Final against the Cronulla Sharks during the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1978|1978]] season. Unlike the three previous titles, the club did not win the Minor Premiership. It also was unique insofar as Manly were required to replay two drawn matches through the finals campaign. Week one of the finals saw Manly beaten by Cronulla 17\u201312; the boot of [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]] proving the difference with both teams scoring three tries each. The Minor Semi Final against Paramatta ended in a draw: the teams met again three days later where Manly scored a 17\u201311 victory.\n\nAnother three-day turnaround saw Manly play and account for the Minor Premiers, [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] which allowed the team a full week off before the Grand Final. Like the decider of the previous year, the match was drawn and a replay was required. However, unlike in 1977, the 1978 Grand Final replay could not be played the following weekend as normal due to Australia's [[1978 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1978 Kangaroo tour]] squad (which Frank Stanton was the head coach) was due to depart for England. This the replay was played on the Tuesday, only 3 days after the drawn game. In their 6th game in 24 days, Manly scored a 16\u20130 victory over the Sharks, claiming their fourth Premiership in seven years.\n\n*'''1978, 19 September (Grand Final Replay)'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Tom Mooney (rugby league)|Tom Mooney]], [[Stephen Knight (rugby)|Stephen Knight]], [[Russel Gartner]], [[Simon Booth (Australian rugby league)|Simon Booth]], [[Alan Thompson (rugby league)|Alan Thompson]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Bruce Walker (rugby league)|Bruce Walker]], [[John Harvey (rugby league)|John Harvey]], [[Max Krilich]] (c), [[Ian Thomson (rugby league)|Ian Thomson]]\n\nReplacements: [[Ray Branighan]] for Simon Booth; [[Wayne Springall]] for Ian Martin\n\nCoach: [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]].\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 16 (Gartner 2, Eadie tries; Eadie 3 goals; field goal) defeated [[Cronulla Sharks]] - 0\n\nAfter the 1978 Grand Final victory, a record 9 Manly players were selected for the Kangaroo Tour, though both Terry Randall (exhaustion) and Bruce Walker (personal reasons) declined to tour. One notable omission from the touring squad was try scoring three-quarter Russel Gartner who had played in Australia's [[1977 Rugby League World Cup Final]] winning side.\n\nManly-Warringah missed the finals by finishing seventh in both the [[1979 NSWRFL season|1979]] and [[1980 NSWRFL season|1980]] seasons. Before the start of the 1979 season, Ken Arthurson signed a 19 year old lock forward from the [[Wests Panthers]] in [[Brisbane]] named [[Paul Vautin]].\n\n===1980s===\nClub officials lured three players from the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] across to the peninsula. The signings of Kangaroo internationals [[Les Boyd]], John Dorahy and [[Ray Brown (rugby league)|Ray Brown]] for the 1980 season led to a deep acrimony between the two clubs, quickly developing on the field into the \u2018Silvertails\u2019 versus \u2018Fibros\u2019; the haves against the have-nots.\n\nThe [[1981 NSWRFL season|1981]] season saw the club shake off the inconsistency of the previous two years and make the finals, holding off a challenge from Western Suburbs to claim fifth place. Beating [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]] in the elimination final, the Sea Eagles were not able to reproduce that form and were beaten the following week by eventual Runners-Up, [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]]. At the end of the season, Manly signed [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] centre [[Chris Close]] for 3 years.\n\nThe [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]] premiership saw a tight battle for finals placings which eventually saw Manly take second position and back in the hunt for a title. Manly's final campaign began strongly with a thrashing of [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]], followed by a shutout of the Parramatta team to move into the Grand Final. Parramatta had a strong win against [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] Preliminary Final, setting up another showdown against the Sea Eagles.\n\nIncluding the Major-Semi final just two weeks earlier, Manly entered the contest having defeated the Eels in their two recent encounters. However, a dominant [[Brett Kenny]] saw Parramatta take the game and successfully defend their crown, 21\u20138. Following the Grand Final loss, 6 players were selected to the [[1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1982 Kangaroo tour]]. Coached by Frank Stanton (now at Balmain), the 1982 Kangaroos became the first touring squad to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, thus earning themselves the nickname '''The Invincibles'''.\n\nThe [[1983 NSWRFL season|1983]] season saw Fulton return from Eastern Suburbs, this time as the coach, bringing with him NSW representative second row / centre [[Noel Cleal|Noel \"Crusher\" Cleal]] and Kangaroos test winger [[Kerry Boustead]]. Fulton guided the team to the Minor Premiership by eight points. Manly looked to be well on its way to breaking through for a fifth premiership after exacting revenge for two losses during the season to Parramatta, claiming victory against the Eels in the Major Semi final, 19\u201310. But, in an almost carbon-copy of the 1982 decider, Parramatta bounced back strongly in their next game before again beating Manly to claim the title, 18\u20136, Brett Kenny again the main destroyer scoring 2 tries (Kenny scored doubles in the 1981, 1982 and 1983 Grand Finals). During the 1983 season, teenage halfback [[Phil Blake]] scored 27 tries for Manly, breaking the record of 24 scored by Kevin Junee in 1974. As of 2017 this is still the club record for most tries in a season.\n\nAfter the disappointment of losing the 1983 Grand Final, the team were unable to make a strong claim for the title during the [[1984 NSWRL season|1984]] season. Just once did Manly enjoy a winning streak of more than two, but still finished in fourth position. After beating [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] in a mid-week play-off for fifth, South Sydney knocked the Sea Eagles out of the finals in the first weekend with a 22\u201318 win. Joining the club in 1984 was young Penrith Panthers reserve halfback [[Des Hasler]].\n\nEarly in the [[1985 NSWRL season|1985]] season, Manly were challenging for a top two position, but a lack of momentum in the last half of the season saw the club unable to build on this position. At the completion of the regular season, the Sea Eagles still needed to win a mid-week final against [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] to attempt to claim fifth position, but the boot of [[Greg Alexander]] carried the Penrith Panthers to a 10\u20137 victory and into their first finals campaign. Bob Fulton installed Queensland and Australian representative back rower Paul Vautin as the club captain in 1985. Prior to the season, Manly signed pacey 19 year old Sarina (Queensland) outside back [[Dale Shearer]].\n\nAlthough Manly finished in fourth in [[1986 NSWRL season|1986]], the closeness of the competition meant that any of the finals teams were capable of beating the others on their day. Fifth place again had to be decided by a mid-week play-off, this time Balmain beat [[North Sydney Bears|Norths]] and progressed to a meeting with Manly for the first week of the finals. The Tigers scored a strong 29\u201322 win and Manly were knocked out of the finals in the first week, for the second year in a row. Manly were without the services of captain Paul Vautin for most of the season after the test back rower had broken his arm in a game against Penrith in late April. At the end of the season, 4 players (Cleal, Hasler, Shearer and [[Phil Daley]], the son of club secretary [[Doug Daley]]) were selected to go on the [[1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1986 Kangaroo tour]]. Prior to the end of the season, Manly also signed goal kicking outside back and dual-rugby international [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] from St George for the 1987 season. O'Connor would give Manly fans cause for optimism by being the top point scorer on the Kangaroo Tour with 170 points (13 tries, 59 goals) including a personal haul of 44 points (4 tries, 14 goals) in the Kangaroos 3-0 [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes series]] win over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]].\n\nLed by captain Paul Vautin and coached by Manly legend [[Bob Fulton]], the [[1987 NSWRL season|1987]] Sea Eagles dominated the competition and took the Minor Premiership by six points, including a then premiership record 12 wins in a row. Meeting second placed [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters|Easts]] in the second week of the finals, the Sea Eagles did enough to get over the Roosters, 10\u20136, and move into the Grand Final.\n\nJoining Manly in the last [[Grand Final]] to be played in front of 50,201 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] were the [[Canberra Raiders]] who had joined the competition in 1982. On an unseasonably hot day, the Sea Eagles scored a solid 18\u20138 victory to secure their fifth title. Although the score was tight, it didn't show Manly's domination on the day. Canberra's only realistic scoring opportunity to score came when five-eighth [[Chris O'Sullivan (rugby league)|Chris O'Sullivan]] crossed for a try late in the game. Manly only scored two tries, though they had opportunities for another five or six but were thwarted each time (often by their own mistakes). Michael O'Connor kicked 5 goals from 5 attempts in the Grand Final, as well as scoring a try, to ensure the premiership would return to the peninsula for the first time since 1978. However, on the day there was none better than Manly five-eighth [[Cliff Lyons]] who made line breaks almost at will in the first half and brought up the first score of the game when he received a pass from fullback Dale Shearer from a scrum win 10 metres out from the Raiders line, and beat both O'Sullivan and Queensland Origin fullback [[Gary Belcher]] to score. For his efforts, Lyons was awarded the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] as the Man of the Match.\n\n*'''27 September 1987'''\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Dale Shearer]], [[David Ronson]], [[Darrell Williams (rugby league)|Darrell Williams]], [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]], [[Stuart Davis (rugby league)|Stuart Davis]], [[Cliff Lyons]], [[Des Hasler]], [[Paul Vautin]] (c), [[Noel Cleal]], [[Ron Gibbs]], [[Kevin Ward (rugby league)|Kevin Ward]], [[Mal Cochrane]], [[Phil Daley]]\n\nReplacements: [[Mark Pocock]] for [[Noel Cleal]]; [[Paul Shaw (rugby league)|Paul Shaw]] for head bin (twice for [[Ron Gibbs]])\n\nCoach: [[Bob Fulton]]\n, \n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 18 (Lyons, O'Connor tries; O'Connor 5 goals) defeated [[Canberra Raiders]] - 8 (O'Sullivan try; Meninga, Belcher goals). [[Clive Churchill Medal]] - Cliff Lyons\n\nLess than two weeks later, the premiers traveled to [[Wigan]], England, to face the reigning English champions, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in the [[1987 World Club Challenge]]. In only the second such [[World Club Challenge]] match since the Eastern Suburbs Roosters mid-season win against [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] at the SCG in 1976, Manly lost the match 8\u20132. The game was played at Wigan's home ground, the famous [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] in front of 36,895 fans, though it was rumoured that the actual attendance was closer to 50,000. Manly second rower [[Ron Gibbs|\"Rambo\" Ronny Gibbs]], in his last game for the club before moving to the new [[Gold Coast Seagulls]] in 1989, became the first player sent off in a [[World Club Challenge]] after a high tackle on Wigan's international centre [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]].\n\nWith the expansion of the NSWRL seeing new teams from Newcastle and Queensland, the first round of the [[1988 NSWRL season|1988 season]] saw the reigning premiers taking on a [[Brisbane Broncos]] team featuring many of Queensland's top players including Australian captain [[Wally Lewis]] and representative players [[Colin Scott (rugby league)|Colin Scott]], [[Gene Miles]], [[Allan Langer]], [[Bryan Neibling]], [[Greg Dowling]] and [[Greg Conescu]]. Manly were never in the match and lost to the Brisbane side, 44\u201310. By the end of the regular season, Manly finished third but were eliminated in the first week, 19\u20136, by Grand Final bound Balmain.\n\nDuring the 1988 season, Manly played the [[Great Britain Lions]] under lights at [[Brookvale Oval]] as part of the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]]. Missing six regular first grade players (Vautin, Shearer, O'Connor, Daley, Ronson and Cochrane), the makeshift Sea Eagles put the Mal Reilly coached Lions to the sword with a 30\u20130 win in front of 21,131 fans, the largest non-test attendance of the Lions tour. Teenage halfback [[Geoff Toovey]], playing only his third game of top grade football, scored one of Manly's 5 tries for the game and was awarded the Man of the Match. Among the beaten Lions that night were test players the caliber of [[Martin Offiah]], [[Karl Fairbank]], [[Phil Ford (rugby)|Phil Ford]], [[Carl Gibson]], [[Andy Platt]] and [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]].<ref>[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=1205 1988 Manly vs Great Britain]</ref>\n\nWith Bob Fulton taking on the Australian coaching job, another former Manly favourite was brought in to fill his shoes. International Alan Thompson distinguished himself in the maroon and white over a 263-game career at five-eighth had coached the club's Reserve Grade side to the 1987 Grand Final before winning the 1988 Grand Final. During the 1989 season the clubs attack stalled and finished twelfth. Thompson was sacked and the club bought in successful Wigan coach, Graham Lowe.\n\nThe 1989 season was one of disharmony for the Manly club. With Bob Fulton now gone, the club board took back control of the club (popular theory said that Fulton had almost total control during his time as coach). With the first grade side showing poor form, club secretary Doug Daley allegedly approached the playing group at a mid-season training session and offered a release for any player who wished to leave the club. Three days later, Dale Shearer asked for a release only to be denied by Daley who claimed that it was only for the time he offered it and no longer stood. The matter would end up in court and Shearer was granted his release to join the Brisbane Broncos. Also, at the end of the season long serving club captain Paul Vautin was offered only a 1-year contract at approximately half of his reported 1989 salary of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]95,000. Vautin subsequently left the club to join Eastern Suburbs. Club vice-captain Noel Cleal also faced the same situation and ultimately announced his retirement from playing at the end of the season. Cleal would take up the position of assistant coach with the [[Hull F.C.]] club in the English premiership.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=Mike|title=Fatty: The Strife and times of Paul Vautin|date=1992|publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia Pty, Limited|location=Sydney|isbn=9781875471171}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1990|1990]] and [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1991|1991]] seasons saw the club return to the finals football, but no premierships. The 1990 side, coached by former [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] and Wigan head coach Graham Lowe who had replaced 1989 coach Alan Thompson who had been sacked after failing to make the finals, started slow but eventually finished the regular season in fourth and facing Balmain in the first week of the finals, which the Sea Eagles won. However, a tryless effort against the Broncos in the second week saw the club go no further in their campaign. One of Lowe's biggest recruits for Manly in 1990 was goal kicking former [[All Blacks]] fullback [[Matthew Ridge]]. Such was Ridge's form after coming over from rugby union that he was selected to the New Zealand test team after only 5 games for the Sea Eagles.\n\nFinishing second in 1991, Manly succumbed in successive finals matches, losing first to North Sydney then knocked out in the second week by Canberra.\n\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1992|1992]] season featured only one team in the finals from the previous year. Manly's recent improvements in attack disappeared and they missed out, finishing eighth. At the end of the season, club captain and dual-rugby international Michael O'Connor retired from playing.\n\nDuring the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1993|1993 season]], after a previous health scare, Graham Lowe eventually succumbed to a serious health issue which forced him from his coaching role. This saw the club send out an SOS to Australian coach Bob Fulton to return to club coaching, an SOS he immediately answered. In one of the closest finishes to the top of the table, only two points separated first and fifth, with Manly finishing in fourth position. Manly's first match in the finals was against fifth-placed Brisbane and they were again outclassed by the reigning premiers and were eliminated on the first weekend of finals.\n\nOver the course of the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1994|1994 season]], the club displayed a further improvement in their attacking skills, including the club record 61\u20130 victory over 1993 grand finalists, [[St George Dragons|St George]]. Finishing fourth, the Sea Eagles again met the fifth placed Broncos in the first week of finals, but were unable to reverse the result of 1993 and were eliminated from the finals series, 16\u20134.\n\nThroughout the mid-1990s, rumours of a separate League developed into a major split of the code in Australia. With [[News Ltd]]'s backing, the Brisbane Broncos and Canberra Raiders pushed hard for better input to the game, feeling that the Sydney-centric ARL was not meeting their needs. Despite all the rhetoric of better player conditions, the resultant [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] developed into a push by Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd to develop a competition that would be used as the flagship of his fledgling Pay TV sports channel, Fox Sports.\n\nThe Manly-Warringah club remained solid with the ARL with only a handful of players, including [[Matthew Ridge]], [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]] and [[Owen Cunningham]], committing to Super League.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of [[Super League]] and resultant [[Super League War]] throughout the [[Australian Rugby League season 1995|1995 season]], Manly dominated the season losing only two matches to finish as minor premiers. They won their first 15 matches in a row, a club record, and missed out on the highest number of points scored by the club by just three.\n\nIn 1995, Manly's star representative forward [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]] became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first rugby footballer in the world to come out to the public as gay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peter|first=O'Shea|title=Out of the field|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|publisher=Here Publishing|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith the increase of teams from 16 to 20, a new finals format was introduced and consisted of the top eight sides at the end of the regular season. In the first week of the finals, Manly beat Cronulla before a two-week break and another victory, this time against the [[Newcastle Knights]]. Manly were to face the finals series surprise packet, [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Sydney Bulldogs (Canterbury)]], which despite finishing the season in sixth place, had already beaten favourites Brisbane and Canberra in the finals. Despite being clear favourites to hold off the Bulldogs challenge, Manly struggled to match the intensity of their rivals and lost, 17-4\n\nOver the course of the [[Australian Rugby League season 1996|1996 season]] Manly, on the back of its defence which conceded less than 9-points per game, produced one of its most dominant displays since joining the competition in 1947 to claim its eighth Minor Premiership. A tight win against the [[Sydney Roosters|Sydney City Roosters]] and a shutout of Cronulla saw the club meeting [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the Grand Final.\n\nManly won their sixth title with a comfortable 20\u20138 victory, but it wasn't without controversy, with a try just before halftime award on the back of the referee's decision to allow play-on after an apparent tackle put the Dragons' defence on the back foot.\n\n*'''29 September 1996'''\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\nMatthew Ridge, Danny Moore, Craig Innes, Terry Hill, [[John Hopoate]], Nik Kosef, [[Geoff Toovey]](c), David Gillespie, Jim Serdaris, Mark Carroll, Steve Menzies, [[Daniel Gartner]], [[Owen Cunningham]].\n\nInterchange: [[Cliff Lyons]], Neil Tierney, Craig Hancock, [[Des Hasler]]\n\nCoach: [[Bob Fulton]].\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 20 (Innes, Menzies, Moore tries; Ridge 3, Innes goals) defeated [[St George Dragons]] - 8 (Zisti try; Bartrim 2 goals)\n\nDespite the loss of a couple of players to Super League, the club still held the nucleus of the squad together for a tilt at back-to-back titles in the split [[Australian Rugby League season 1997|1997 season]] competition. By the end of the regular season, Manly finished on top of the table and earned a break from the first round of finals in the seven-team format.\n\nThe Sea Eagles accounted for the Knights in the second week of the finals, before scoring a tight win against the Roosters to qualify for the Grand Final. Manly were again clear favourites and for the first hour, they had the premiership in their grasp, holding on to a 10-point lead. Two tries to Newcastle fullback, [[Robbie O'Davis]], soon had the clubs tied at 16-all with full-time looming. Only seconds from seeing the game enter into extra-time, Newcastle halfback, [[Andrew Johns]], wrong-footed the defence to send his winger, [[Darren Albert]] over the try line.\n\nThe start of the [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998 season]] saw a much anticipated match up between the Super League champions Brisbane and the ARL high flyers, Manly. The Sea Eagles went down 22-6 and an inconsistent season saw the club rely on a late winning streak of six matches to finish out the regular season and limp into the finals in tenth place. Facing Canberra in the first week of the finals, Manly were convincingly beaten 17\u20134; the last time the club would play finals football until 2005.\n\nFrom one of the richer clubs in the League, Manly were by now struggling to keep up with player payments and were unable to entice players to the club. Much talk was made about a possible joint venture between local rivals Manly and Norths with both teams were in need of the $10M on offer. With these issues in the background, Manly turned up to the regular season seven rounds late and soon Bob Fulton quit his head coach position due to his wife's health concerns. Peter Sharp took over the reins and won his first three games, a record result for a caretaker coach in the League.\n\nBy halfway through the season, it was obvious that the club would be missing their first finals campaign since 1992 and when they finished thirteenth, it was their lowest relative placing since 1989. But unlike previous eras when the club could look to purchase key players, there was simply no money left.\n\nA consolidation of the competition meant that a criterion was imposed and those not making the cut would not be involved in the 2000 season. The NRL imposed a time limit on the acceptance of a merger offer, or clubs could try their luck through the criteria. Both Manly and Norths administrators were not keen on approaching a merger, but with Manly's financial problems and North Sydney effectively insolvent due to disastrous year when a planned move to the Central Coast was delayed, both sides met to talk of a joint venture. Although the criteria result was in the positive for the Manly club, financial realities meant that there was not much success likely in the future. Due to their insolvency, the North Sydney club were not even considered for the criteria.\n\nIn late 1999, the clubs agreed to a joint venture and the [[Northern Eagles]] were born.\n\n===Northern Eagles===\n{{Main|Northern Eagles}}\nUnlike the successful St. George Dragons and Illawarra Steelers merger of 1999, restrictions imposed on the clubs meant that half of the combined squad had to be released prior to kick-off as the [[Northern Eagles]], on 5 February 2000.\n\nDespite a first up win against the [[Newcastle Knights]], a lack of consistent on-field success and continuing financial problems saw the joint venture gradually suffer with a lack of support from the Central Coast supporters, who felt the team forced onto them, and the Manly faithful who disappeared from Brookvale Oval.\n\nAlthough officially dissolved in August 2001, the club continued to play out of both Brookvale and Graeme Park ([[Central Coast Stadium]]) until the lead up to the Round 16 clash with Melbourne in 2002. Originally scheduled for Graeme Park, fierce opposition by Central Coast locals and some media identities forced the club to cease playing in Gosford.\n\nWith the club returning to [[Brookvale Oval]] full-time they were by now the [[Northern Eagles]] in name only. In 2003 they re-entered the league as the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\n\n===2000s===\nEmerging from the failed merger through 2002, Manly were still on shaky ground both on and off the field. The reversion of the NRL licence to Manly meant that contracts with the Northern Eagles were now void. Waiting on further payments, many players left and the club soon developed a high turnover of [[Journeyman (sports)|journeyman]] and fringe first graders which saw a further lack of stability both on and off the field. With no major sponsor and little public interest with either spectators or through merchandise, the club's finances were so bad that the football club was only days from closing its doors midway through the 2002 season. In June, initial efforts by the Penn family and then a multimillion-dollar deal with local developer, Max Delmege, led to the future privatisation of the club and financial security.\n\nResults on the field during [[National Rugby League season 2003|2003 season]] were generally poor, with the club regularly conceding 50-plus score lines, even at Brookvale Oval. By the end of the regular season the club finished 14th; just one position above wooden-spooners, South Sydney.\n\nWith the club still suffering with poor finances, and despite the cash injection of $10,000,000 granted to the Northern Eagles entity, a change in direction was needed.\n\nIn November 2003, Scott Penn offered the Football Club $5,000,000 for a half-share of the Sea Eagles, with the partnership with the Football Club anticipated to contribute $10,000,000 over four years. The deal required 75 percent support by the football club members, and was tabled at the Annual General meeting on 18 December 2003.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 22 November 2003 - http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/21/1069027327726.html</ref> Despite football and leagues club board support, the necessary numbers did not favour privatisation and the motion was defeated.\n\nAfter initially saving the club from closure in early 2004, with an injection of much needed money in the form of sponsorship, Max Delmege received football club members support for his privatisation deal on 3 June 2004. The deal was passed with 93% support (162-10 in favour) and saw Delmege pay $3.5 million for a 65.5 per cent share, not including ongoing sponsorship of $1,000,000 per year.\n\nInitial share holdings saw Delmege hold 3.5mil, Manly Football Club with 2mil, and Penn Sports take 100,000.  An additional 4.4mil shares were to be made available to members, supporters and investors. The new board would feature six directors with two from the Football Club, two from the Leagues Club and two appointed from Delmege, with an independent chairman appointed by the six directors.<ref>Daily Telegraph, Dean Richie, 4 June 2004</ref>\n\nEffectively, the members voted for the approval of Special Resolutions to allow for the privatisation of the Football Club to proceed. The club was now '''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Limited'''. This entity holds the NRL Licence and manages the clubs employees from the players right through to the front office, organisation of sponsorships and merchandise, provides hospitality and prepares for games played out of Brookvale Oval. It is also responsible for running the lower grades in the NSWRL competitions.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I'm very passionate about this club and want to see it get back to where it was, a very successful rugby league team.\" Max Delmege, June 2004.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe club made no strong moves in the player market ahead of the [[National Rugby League season 2004|2004]] season, but there was one significant change to the roster with Peter Sharp axed and his assistant coach, Des Hasler, taking over the head coach role. Manly won just two more games than 2003 to finish thirteenth, but this slight improvement on the table was tempered by the club enduring their worst loss up to that time, going down 72\u201312 to the [[Penrith Panthers]] in Round 22. As if to highlight the inconsistencies of the team, the Sea Eagles produced their best result for the season with a 48\u201310 win against Newcastle the following week; the highest turn-around in NSWRL/ARL/NRL history.\n\nThe purchase of representative players [[Ben Kennedy (rugby league)|Ben Kennedy]], [[Michael Witt]] and [[Brent Kite]], ahead of the [[National Rugby League season 2005|2005 season]] were the clubs first significant signings since the mid-1990s and early success on the field was reflected by the clubs place at the top of the table midway through the season. But contract issues with captain [[Michael Monaghan]] coincided with a drop in form, including a record loss of the club against Cronulla, 68\u20136. Winning their final round game, Manly secured eighth spot, but were quickly dispatched from the finals in the first week with a 46\u201322 loss to Parramatta.\n\nIn January 2006, the new Manly Warringah Board unanimously approve Penn Sport to purchase the majority of the outstanding shares in the club.  This reshuffle saw both Delmege and Penn Sports each own just under 40% of the club, with the remainder held by the Manly Football Club. The intention of both majority owners was to see the Football Club further improve their finances, with the aim of the Football Club eventually buying back the privately held shares.<ref>MWSE News Release, 18 January 2006. http://www.pennsport.com.au/news.html</ref>\n\nThe new board grew to nine, with the addition of two directors appointed by Penn Sports.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"We\u2019re fortunate to have two partners who are willing to invest in the long term future of Manly and are absolutely, passionately committed to its success. The loyalty of Max Delmege to the club speaks for itself and the Penn family are life long fans and passionate supporters of the Sea Eagles. Penn Sport also has a depth of experience in sponsorship and sports management and will add value to the club and be of enormous advantage in moving the club forward.\u201d Paul Cummings, MWSE Board CEO.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe club further boosted its roster for the [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006]], with the signings of Orford and centre [[Steven Bell|Steve Bell]] from Melbourne. The club overcome a slow start to finish the regular season fifth and a match against the Newcastle Knights in the first week of finals. Despite an early lead, the Sea Eagles were run down in a physical encounter, eventually losing 25\u201318. The following week, Manly struggled for any impact against the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]], losing 28\u20130 to finish their tilt at the premiership.\n\nUntil September 2006, the Manly-Warringah Football Club had bought back 150,000 additional shares from MWSE Limited. Monies generated by Football Club come from memberships and other fund raising activities. Memberships to the MWSE Limited supporters club (Screaming Eagles) do not provide the Football Club with further monies.\n\nA restructure of the MWSE Limited Board saw the Manly Leagues Club lose one director, and Scott Penn resume the Chairman duties.\n\nThe [[2007 NRL season]] saw the club maintain a stable playing roster for the first time since the success of the mid-1990s, and on the back of a strong defensive platform, finished the regular season second place behind the [[Melbourne Storm]]. With their first top four finish in the NRL, the club hosted their first ever final at [[Brookvale Oval]], against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] which resulted in an easy 30\u20136 victory and a week off. In the qualifying final against [[North Queensland Cowboys]], a dominant second half saw the team win 28-6 and earn a place in the Grand Final against minor premiers Melbourne Storm. After a physical opening, Manly soon ran out of steam and were well beaten 8-34.\n\nIn mapping out Manly's future in 2003, Des Hasler and his coaching staff believed that the successful implementation of a 5-year plan would set the club up for a premiership for the 2008 season. In making the 2007 decider, many within the club stated that it was a year earlier than expected, but after the horror loss, they turned their eyes to the 2008 as the premiership year.\n\nThe season started off rocky with the club dropping their first two games, prompting many commentators to question the clubs ability to backup, particularly with the loss of [[Michael Monaghan]] to the ESL. Slowly, the club returned to form and by mid-season were again in a race for the minor premiership. It was not until the final game of the NRL season when the minor premiership was decided, with Melbourne requiring a 26-point win to claim it from Manly, on for-and-against. They easily did this, relegating Manly to second with Cronulla coming third on the same number of points but a significantly lower for-and against record.\n\nIn the build-up to the first week of the finals, halfback [[Matt Orford]] won the [[Dally M Medal]], beating out [[Melbourne Storm]] stars [[Billy Slater]] and [[Cameron Smith]]. On the back of this recognition, Orford led Manly to a comprehensive 38\u20136 victory over the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] in the Qualifying Final at [[Brookvale Oval]], earning the side a two-week rest and a home Preliminary Final at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. Another strong victory, this time a 32\u20136 win over the [[New Zealand Warriors]], ensured a rematch of the [[2007 NRL Grand Final]] against the Melbourne Storm.\n\nIn the week leading up to the 2008 Grand Final, the MWSE CEO Grant Mayer, used the publicity to press for further sponsorship opportunities, including a likely replacement of major sponsor Delmege. This action appears to be the catalyst for the subsequent long-running board room fracture, with the Board split on many 'front office' issues including the extension of contracts for coach Des Hasler, media manager Peter Peters and Board CEO Grant Mayer, infighting played out through the media by both factions, and a deal to purchase the Leagues Club jointly by the Penns and Delmege falling through.\n\n[[File:Manlyroosters.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Sydney Roosters in action against the Manly Sea Eagles at Brookvale Oval in June 2008]]On the back of strong on-field results and the turmoil which played around the Melbourne club during the finals series, including the loss of captain Cameron Smith (suspended) and [[Ryan Hoffman]] (injury), Manly entered the decider as slight favourites. The first half featured a disciplined performance by Manly, with Melbourne finding themselves on the wrong end of both field position and possession, and unable to apply any significant pressure. Manly led 8\u20130 at the break, but with the groundwork done in the first half, went on a six try, second half scoring spree to run out winners 40\u20130. Highlights of the result were a hat-trick of tries to winger Michael Robertson and a try each to [[Steve Menzies]] and [[Steven Bell]] in their final game for the Manly club.\n\n*'''2008, 6 October'''\n\n'''Manly Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Brett Stewart (rugby league)|Brett Stewart]], [[Michael Robertson (rugby league)|Michael Robertson]], Steven Bell, [[Steve Matai]], [[David Williams (rugby league)|David Williams]], [[Jamie Lyon]], [[Matt Orford]] \u00a9, [[Brent Kite]], [[Matt Ballin]], [[Josh Perry]], [[Anthony Watmough]], [[Glenn Hall (rugby league)|Glenn Hall]], [[Glenn Stewart]].\n\nInterchange: [[Heath L'Estrange]], [[Mark Bryant (rugby league)|Mark Bryant]], [[Jason King (rugby league)|Jason King]], Steve Menzies.\n\nCoach: [[Des Hasler]].\n\n'''Manly Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 40 (Robertson 3, Ballin, Kite, Williams, Menzies, Bell tries; Matai 2, Lyon 2 goals)<br/> defeated<br/> '''Melbourne Storm''' - 0\n\nAs of December 2008, there are three current shareholders in \"Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Limited\" which are the Manly-Warringah Football Club Ltd (16.97%), Delmege (Surfside) (41.515%) and Penn Sport Pty Ltd (41.515%).<ref>Family@MWSE - {{cite web |url=http://www.mwse.com.au/default.aspx?s=family |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730054641/http://www.mwse.com.au/default.aspx?s=family |archivedate=30 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe '''Manly-Warringah Rugby League Football Club Limited''' has no shareholders.

As well as the classic 'V' design, the club has broken up the maroon jersey with hoops, bars, large eagles, player numbers, stripes, double stripes, top and bottoms, collars, no collars, reversed colours and even the use of blue.\n\nDuring the 2007 pre-season, the club introduced a limited number of green jerseys for a trial match against the [[Melbourne Storm]].\n\n==Rivalries==\nThe Manly Sea Eagles have developed some rivalries since 1947. Some of them include:\n\n*[[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] - The first, and most obvious, was the local derby's between [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]]. As well as taking many of North's playing stock due to the residential rule imposed at the time, Manly had bought further stars from the North Sydney club including [[Ken Irvine]], [[Cliff Lyons]] and [[Martin Bella]]. Even the fact that North Sydney are not longer competing in the top league, has fueled this rivalry, with many Bears supporters believing that Manly systematically pushed the North Sydney element out of the Northern Eagles joint-venture.\n*[[Parramatta Eels]] - Another rivalry was with fellow debutants from 1947, [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]]. Not much was made of their clashes until the mid 1970s, and in particular the 1976 Grand Final in which Manly denied the Parramatta club a maiden premiership. Further clashes through to the mid 1980s, including Manly's [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]] and [[1983 NSWRFL season|1983]] Grand Final losses to the Eels, cemented a fierce rivalry between many of the clubs' supporters.\n*[[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] - There was a small rivalry between these two clubs from 1947 to 1971, as along with the [[St. George Dragons]], they were the powerhouses of the time and they played each other in the 1951, 1968 and 1970 Grand Finals. From 1972, the rivalry became bigger, as due to the abolishment of the rule where players could not freely negotiate with other clubs, the Sea Eagles signed many of South Sydney's stars, including [[Ray Branighan]] and [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]] in 1972, [[Tom Mooney (rugby league)|Tom Mooney]] in 1975, [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]] in 1990, [[Mark Carroll (rugby league)|Mark Carroll]] in 1993 and more recently [[Dylan Walker]] in 2016. Conversely, Manly also lost some players to the Rabbitohs including [[Phil Blake]] in 1987 and [[Glenn Stewart]] in 2015.\n*[[Western Suburbs Magpies]] - Also during this time, the clashes between [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] and Manly were billed as a battle between the \"Silvertails\" and the \"Fibros\". This distinction between perceived classes of people fuelled many tough matches between the clubs, particularly after Manly would secure top players from the Magpies such as John Dorahy, Les Boyd, David Gillespie. The Silvertails and Fibros monikers first appeared in stories written by reporter Chris Masters, in the late 1970s. Chris was the brother of the then Wests coach, Roy Masters.\n*[[Cronulla Sharks]] - This rivalry has been dubbed the \"Battle of the Beaches\", due to the geographical locations of the two clubs. Manly played the Sharks in two grand finals: 1973 and 1978, which are renowned for being the most brutal in history. Manly won both of these deciders, 10\u20137 in 1973 and 16\u20130 in the 1978 replay after the first game ended at 11-all. The Sea Eagles have traditionally had much success over the Sharks, with Cronulla winning at Manly's home ground just five times in their history. However the Sharks' biggest ever win came against Manly, a 68-6 thrashing in 2005. Cronulla and Manly play for the Steve Rogers Trophy when the two clubs meet in the NRL premiership each season. Most recently the two teams met in the 2013 finals, when Manly held off Cronulla by 24\u201318.\n*[[Newcastle Knights]] - Since the mid-1990s, Manly has also built a rivalry with the [[Newcastle Knights]] club. In many ways this mirrors the Manly/Wests clashes where class distinction is used to fuel the perceived underdogs, in this case the working class city of Newcastle. In 1997, both Manly and Newcastle fought out the decider, with Newcastle winning 22\u201316. Newcastle's coach in 1997 was 1972 and 1973 Manly premiership winner [[Mal Reilly]]. Manly's coach Bob Fulton was a teammate of Reilly's in those premiership wins. Recently, in the 10 August 2007 match to commemorate the 1997 grand final Manly took revenge, thumping the knights 50\u201316.\n*[[Melbourne Storm]] - Manly have recently built up a rivalry with the [[Melbourne Storm]] club. Over the last few years they have had very close games, they have been the top two teams in the premiership, and they have played each other in the 2007 and 2008 NRL Grand Finals. The Sea Eagles and Storm were also involved in the infamous '''[[Battle of Brookvale]]''' match in Round 25 of the 2011 season which saw all-in brawls, 2 players sent off and 6 players (5 from Manly) receiving an accumulated total of 13 weeks worth of suspensions.\n\n==Stadium==\nHome games are played at [[Brookvale Oval]], which has a capacity of 23,000.\n\nUpon entry into the top league, Manly were denied the use of Manly Oval by the pro-Rugby Union council of the time. This led to the acquisition of the Brookvale Showground as a home ground, supported by the former Warringah Council.\n\nMost development on the site had occurred between 1965 and 1980, with the latest additions being the Ken Arthurson Stand which opened in 1995 and an extension of the Jane Try Stand in 2014.\n\nThere is much conjecture on what the future development of the ground will include. As one of the few grounds to still have a substantial grassed hill area, many supporters believe that future plans must retain this unique feature.\n\nThe largest attendance for a Rugby League match at Brookvale Oval was 27,655 during the final round clash of the 1986 season, between Manly and Parramatta. Highest average crowd for a season was 15,484 over 11 games, in the 2006 season.\n\nIn total, Brookvale Oval has seen over five and half million spectators since 1947.\n\n==Premierships and Titles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n! colspan=11 |Manly Warringah Sea Eagles\n|-\n|'''Premiership Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1972|1972]], [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]], [[NSWRFL season 1976|1976]], [[NSWRFL season 1978|1978]], [[NSWRL season 1987|1987]], [[ARL season 1996|1996]], [[NRL season 2008|2008]], [[NRL season 2011|2011]] (8)\n|-\n|'''Premiership Runners-Up''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1951|1951]], [[NSWRFL season 1957|1957]], [[NSWRFL season 1959|1959]], [[NSWRFL season 1968|1968]], [[NSWRFL season 1970|1970]], [[NSWRFL season 1982|1982]], [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]], [[ARL season 1995|1995]], [[ARL season 1997|1997]], [[NRL season 2007|2007]] (10)\n|-\n|'''Minor Premiership Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1971|1971]], [[NSWRFL season 1972|1972]], [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]], [[NSWRFL season 1976|1976]], [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]], [[NSWRL season 1987|1987]], [[ARL season 1995|1995]], [[ARL season 1996|1996]], [[ARL season 1997|1997]] (9)\n|-\n|'''Pre-Season Cup''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1980|1980]]\n|-\n|'''Sevens Tournaments''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRL season 1990|1990]], [[NSWRL season 1994|1994]], [[ARL season 1995|1995]] (3)\n|-\n|'''[[NSWRL Premier League|Reserve Grade]] Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1954|1954]], [[NSWRFL season 1960|1960]], [[NSWRFL season 1969|1969]], [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]], [[NSWRL season 1988|1988]] (5)\n|-\n|'''[[Jersey Flegg Cup]] Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1961|1961]], [[NSWRFL season 1974|1974]], [[NSWRL season 1987|1987]] (3)\n|-\n|'''Third Grade Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1952|1952]] (1)\n|-\n|'''Presidents Cup''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1946|1946]], [[NSWRFL season 1970|1970]] (2)\n|-\n|'''KG Cup''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1982|1982]], [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]] (2)\n|-\n|'''[[S.G.

In 1947 the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] included two additional teams: [[Manly-Warringah DRLFC]] and [[Parramatta DRLFC]]. The new club adopted the nickname \"Sea Eagles\" and went on to compete in every season of top-level rugby league until merging with the nearby [[North Sydney Bears]] to form the [[Northern Eagles]] club at the end of 1999. After three years the joint-venture team was disbanded with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles returning as a sole entity once more to the [[National Rugby League]].\n\n==Background==\n\nIn Australia, before 1908, most football clubs in Sydney played by the rules of the [[Rugby Football Union]] and had done so since the first R.F.U. rules were written in 1871. As the [[rugby league|professional game]] came to Sydney, the bigger inner city districts left their affiliation with the Rugby Football Union and created a new top flight football competition in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1908|1908]].\n\nTwo factors prevented the initial inclusion of a Manly team into the competition. Firstly, with the Manly Rugby Union Club only recently gaining acceptance into the Sydney competition, many involved were not prepared to take a chance on the new code, which had yet to prove itself as a sustainable entity. Add to this a population base barely in the thousands, and well spread out among the many farms in the region, and sustainable support would have been difficult to envisage.\n\nWith a strong growth in local population through the 1920s, the Manly-Warringah Junior Rugby Football League was founded 11 February 1932 with six clubs established for the local competition. The formation of this League entitled Manly's inclusion into the President's Cup, a junior district competition run by the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]].\n\nFurther attempts were made for a Manly club to join the NSWRL top grades in both 1937 and 1944; however, both were unsuccessful. The backers of a Manly club were convinced only a President's Cup premiership would give them an opportunity to successfully apply for the senior competition.\n\nDuring 1946, two meetings involving the [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] club which would seal Manly's future. Their first encounter was played out on 17 June 1946 when the two districts met in the final of the President's Cup; played in front of 64,527 spectators as the curtain raiser for the First [[Test match (rugby league)|Test]] against the touring [[Great Britain national rugby league team|British Lions]]. Manly maintained an early lead to claim the match, 12\u20138.\n\nThe second meeting was between the senior NSWRL clubs on 4 November 1946, in which the North Sydney club supported the inclusion of Manly into the senior competition, despite knowing that many of its Manly players would no longer be eligible to play for North Sydney due to the district residential rule of the time.\n\nWith the Manly club being successful this time, a public meeting on 20 November 1946 saw the formation of the Manly-Warringah District Rugby League Football Club. The club took on the colours of maroon and white. These were adopted from the colours of the President's Cup side which appears to have utilised the colours of the local Freshwater Surf Lifesaving Club, established in 1908, and of which [[Ken Arthurson]] and other players were members. [[Brookvale Oval]] was established as the team's home ground.\n\n===1947-1949===\n12 April [[NSWRFL season 1947|1947]] saw the Manly club taking on the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] club in its first official game in the NSWRFL senior competition, but despite scoring three tries (the first of which came from Keith \"Meggsy\" Kirkwood) to Wests' one, the Manly side went down 15\u201313. The lineup for that match was: [[Bert Collins|A 'Bert' Collins]], [[Jim Walsh (rugby league)|Jim Walsh]], [[Kelly McMahon|C \u2018Kelly\u2019 McMahon]], [[Mackie Campbell]], [[Johnny Bliss]], [[Merv Gillmer]],\n[[Gary Maddrell]], [[James Hall (rugby league)|James Hall]], [[Keith Kirkwood]], [[Max Whitehead]] (c), [[Pat Hines]], [[Ern Cannon]], [[Harry Grew]]. The coach was [[Harold Johnson (rugby league)|Harold Johnson]].\n\nThe club's first win in the top league was a 15\u20137 victory against fellow newcomers [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]], at Brookvale Oval, 31 May 1947. By season's end, Manly had racked up just four victories from 18 rounds, which was enough to avoid the wooden spoon, with Parramatta winning one less game for the season.\n\nThe 1948-1950 period saw the club languish at the bottom of the table, coming ninth, eighth and eighth out of ten. However, the club did have local junior [[Roy Bull]] selected for an Australian Test team which played against New Zealand in October 1949, thus becoming Manly-Warringah's first home-grown International.\n\n===1950s===\n\nThe Manly-Warringah club originally had played in a maroon jersey with a large white 'V' on the front. The club was one of the first to feature a crest or emblem, with an MW on a crest appearing in the early 1950s. Far from the flashy emblems worn today, the Manly \u2018Sea Eagle\u2019 which appeared in the mid-1950s was often confused for a seagull by many, including the media. As there were no official nicknames for clubs at the time, more an adopted \u2018mascot\u2019, it was not considered an issue.\n\nOn 25 April 1951, a new attendance record at Brookvale was set at 9,447, with spectators overflowing onto the field for a match between Manly and South Sydney.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Goodman\n  | first = Tom\n  | title = Manly disputes penalty try by Graves\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | pages = 8\n  | date = 1951-04-26\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130124214524/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qfgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7073,7804476\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archive-date = 2013-01-24\n  | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref> The [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1951|1951]] team won 11 games, finishing second at the end of the regular season, and were in their first finals campaign. After accounting for both [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the semi-finals, Manly were to meet a [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] side which were the reigning Premiers and had won the minor premiership by 11 points. The result was a 42\u201314 loss for Manly.\n\nIn 1952, Roy Bull became the club's first ever [[Kangaroo Tour]]ist when he was selected to go on the [[1952-53 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. He would play 17 games on the Kangaroo Tour, four of them test matches for Australia.\n\n[[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1956|1956]] saw the first of 11 Premierships for the St George club, resulting in two more runners-up trophies for Manly in both [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1957|1957]] (31-9) and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1959|1959]] (20-0). The 1957 season saw a young [[Ken Arthurson]] take the reins as the Manly coach, a position he held until the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1961|1961]] season.\n\n===1960s===\nFrom the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1960|1960]] to the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1969|1969]] seasons, Manly's form ranged from third-place finishes in [[NSWRFL season 1961|1961]] and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1966|1966]], to an eighth placing in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1964|1964]].\n\nThe combination of the return of Wally O'Connell to the club as coach in [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1966|1966]], and the development of Ken Arthurson's skill as an administrator professionalized the club. With the groundwork laid and a couple of years of development of the future [[The Immortals (rugby league)|Immortal]] [[Bob Fulton]], the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1968|1968 competition]] saw Manly compete with St George and South Sydney.\n\nAt the end of the home and away season, Manly finished second, one point behind reigning Premiers, South Sydney. The Major Semi-Final saw Manly beat Souths, 23\u201315, but the clubs soon met again in the Grand Final where the Rabbitohs proved too strong and won the decider, 13\u20139.\n\n===1970s===\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1970|1970 season]] ended with Manly losing to the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] 23\u201312.\n\nBy the end of the regular [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1971|1971 season]], the club had both the best defence and attack record, lost three games and claimed their maiden Minor Premiership over second placed [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Rabbitohs]]. However, they did not made the final due to two successive losses.\n\nThe Sea Eagles finished as [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1972|1972]] Minor Premiers and heading into the finals series with 12 wins and 1 draw from the last 13 rounds.\n\nThe Major Semi saw Manly taking on [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters|Easts]] and winning 32\u20138, before meeting again in the decider two weeks later where Manly-Warringah claimed their maiden Premiership, 19\u201314 in front of 54,537 fans at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\n*'''16 September 1972'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Ken Irvine]], [[Ray Branighan]], [[Bob Fulton]], [[Max Brown (rugby league)|Max Brown]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Dennis Ward (rugby league)|Dennis Ward]], [[Mal Reilly]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Allan Thomson (rugby league)|Allan Thomson]], [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]], [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Fred Jones]] (c), [[Bill Hamilton (rugby league)|Bill Hamilton]]\n\nCoach: [[Ron Willey]]\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 19 (Jones, Branighan tries; Branighan 6 goals; Fulton field goal) defeated Eastern Suburbs Roosters - 14 (Ballesty, Mullins tries; McKean 4 goals)<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Clarkson\n  | first = Alan\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Manly - deserved winners\n  | work = [[The Sun-Herald]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | pages = 72\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date = 17 September 1972\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DaApAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eOUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5441,7161490\n  | accessdate = 19 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1973|1973]] finals were the first to feature five teams, allowing the Minor Premiers a week off during the first round of finals. The 14\u20134 win by Manly over [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]] in the first week of the finals saw the club with a week off before again meeting Cronulla in the Grand Final.\n\nThe 1973 Grand Final is often quoted as one of the most brutal games in Rugby League history. Led by a ferocious forward pack, the Cronulla side looked to unsettle the reigning Premiers, and the game was riddled with fights, late hits and illegal play from both sides. Key Manly playmaker [[Mal Reilly|Malcolm \"Mal\" Reilly]] was taken out early when hit late and did not return after halftime. [[Bob Fulton]]'s superior skills shone through, and the Sharks plan to unsettle the Sea Eagles was foiled. Fulton's two tries saw the Manly side win 10-7 and claim the Premiership for the second time.\n\n*'''15 September 1973'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Ken Irvine]], [[Ray Branighan]], [[Bob Fulton]], [[Max Brown (rugby league)|Max Brown]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Johnny Mayes]], [[Mal Reilly]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Peter Peters]], [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]], [[Fred Jones (rugby league)|Fred Jones]] (c), [[Bill Hamilton (rugby league)|Bill Hamilton]]\n\nReplacement: [[John Bucknall]] for Mal Reilly, injured\n\nCoach: [[Ron Willey]].\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 10 (Fulton 2 tries; Eadie 2 goals) defeated Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks - 7 (Bourke try; Rogers 2 goals)\n\nIn the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1974|1974]] and [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1975|1975]] seasons were dominated by an unstoppable Eastern Suburbs club, winning the Minor Premierships by 8 and 10 points. Against this juggernaut, the Manly club finished second on the table for both seasons, losing a total of four out the five finals game and failing to qualify for either Grand Final.\n\nManly held off the [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] to win the Minor Premiership in the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1976|1976 season]]. During their two meetings during the regular season, the Eels had proved too strong on both occasions and followed that up with another win, this time in the Major Semi Final. Manly went on to beat [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] to set up a rematch against Parramatta in the Grand Final, where Manly won their third Premiership in five years.\n\n*'''18 September 1976'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Tom Mooney (rugby league)|Tom Mooney]], [[Russel Gartner]], [[Bob Fulton]] (c), [[Rod Jackson (rugby league)|Rod Jackson]], [[Alan Thompson (rugby league)|Alan Thompson]], [[Gary Stephens]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Phil Lowe]], [[Steve Norton]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Max Krilich]], [[John Harvey (rugby league)|John Harvey]]\n\nReplacements: [[Gary Thoroughgood]] for Ian Martin; [[Mark Willoughby]] for Phil Lowe\n\nCoach: [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]]\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 13 (Lowe try; Eadie 5 goals) defeated [[Parramatta Eels]] - 10 (Porter, Gerard tries; Peard 2 goals)\n\nManly started the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1977|1977]] season with three solid wins, despite the loss of [[Bob Fulton]] to the Roosters, however, four losses in a row saw the club lose momentum with only a last round victory against the [[Balmain Tigers]] at [[Leichhardt Oval]] securing fifth spot from a fast-finishing Cronulla side. However, the Tigers reversed the result in the first week of the finals, to knock the Sea Eagles out of title contention. After the [[1977 NSWRFL season]] [[Roy Bull]] was elected the Manly-Warringah club's president, succeeding Bill Cameron who had held the position for the previous 19 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manly gets new president|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q4ARAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-eYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2684,2722727|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 December 1977}}</ref>\n\nSuccess for the club during the 1970s culminated with the club scoring a fourth Premiership in another Grand Final against the Cronulla Sharks during the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1978|1978]] season. Unlike the three previous titles, the club did not win the Minor Premiership. It also was unique insofar as Manly were required to replay two drawn matches through the finals campaign. Week one of the finals saw Manly beaten by Cronulla 17\u201312; the boot of [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]] proving the difference with both teams scoring three tries each. The Minor Semi Final against Paramatta ended in a draw: the teams met again three days later where Manly scored a 17\u201311 victory.\n\nAnother three-day turnaround saw Manly play and account for the Minor Premiers, [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] which allowed the team a full week off before the Grand Final. Like the decider of the previous year, the match was drawn and a replay was required. However, unlike in 1977, the 1978 Grand Final replay could not be played the following weekend as normal due to Australia's [[1978 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1978 Kangaroo tour]] squad (which Frank Stanton was the head coach) was due to depart for England. This the replay was played on the Tuesday, only 3 days after the drawn game. In their 6th game in 24 days, Manly scored a 16\u20130 victory over the Sharks, claiming their fourth Premiership in seven years.\n\n*'''1978, 19 September (Grand Final Replay)'''\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Graham Eadie]], [[Tom Mooney (rugby league)|Tom Mooney]], [[Stephen Knight (rugby)|Stephen Knight]], [[Russel Gartner]], [[Simon Booth (Australian rugby league)|Simon Booth]], [[Alan Thompson (rugby league)|Alan Thompson]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Ian Martin (rugby league)|Ian Martin]], [[Terry Randall]], [[Bruce Walker (rugby league)|Bruce Walker]], [[John Harvey (rugby league)|John Harvey]], [[Max Krilich]] (c), [[Ian Thomson (rugby league)|Ian Thomson]]\n\nReplacements: [[Ray Branighan]] for Simon Booth; [[Wayne Springall]] for Ian Martin\n\nCoach: [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]].\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 16 (Gartner 2, Eadie tries; Eadie 3 goals; field goal) defeated [[Cronulla Sharks]] - 0\n\nAfter the 1978 Grand Final victory, a record 9 Manly players were selected for the Kangaroo Tour, though both Terry Randall (exhaustion) and Bruce Walker (personal reasons) declined to tour. One notable omission from the touring squad was try scoring three-quarter Russel Gartner who had played in Australia's [[1977 Rugby League World Cup Final]] winning side.\n\nManly-Warringah missed the finals by finishing seventh in both the [[1979 NSWRFL season|1979]] and [[1980 NSWRFL season|1980]] seasons. Before the start of the 1979 season, Ken Arthurson signed a 19 year old lock forward from the [[Wests Panthers]] in [[Brisbane]] named [[Paul Vautin]].\n\n===1980s===\nClub officials lured three players from the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] across to the peninsula. The signings of Kangaroo internationals [[Les Boyd]], John Dorahy and [[Ray Brown (rugby league)|Ray Brown]] for the 1980 season led to a deep acrimony between the two clubs, quickly developing on the field into the \u2018Silvertails\u2019 versus \u2018Fibros\u2019; the haves against the have-nots.\n\nThe [[1981 NSWRFL season|1981]] season saw the club shake off the inconsistency of the previous two years and make the finals, holding off a challenge from Western Suburbs to claim fifth place. Beating [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland]] in the elimination final, the Sea Eagles were not able to reproduce that form and were beaten the following week by eventual Runners-Up, [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]]. At the end of the season, Manly signed [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]] [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] centre [[Chris Close]] for 3 years.\n\nThe [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]] premiership saw a tight battle for finals placings which eventually saw Manly take second position and back in the hunt for a title. Manly's final campaign began strongly with a thrashing of [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]], followed by a shutout of the Parramatta team to move into the Grand Final. Parramatta had a strong win against [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] Preliminary Final, setting up another showdown against the Sea Eagles.\n\nIncluding the Major-Semi final just two weeks earlier, Manly entered the contest having defeated the Eels in their two recent encounters. However, a dominant [[Brett Kenny]] saw Parramatta take the game and successfully defend their crown, 21\u20138. Following the Grand Final loss, 6 players were selected to the [[1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1982 Kangaroo tour]]. Coached by Frank Stanton (now at Balmain), the 1982 Kangaroos became the first touring squad to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, thus earning themselves the nickname '''The Invincibles'''.\n\nThe [[1983 NSWRFL season|1983]] season saw Fulton return from Eastern Suburbs, this time as the coach, bringing with him NSW representative second row / centre [[Noel Cleal|Noel \"Crusher\" Cleal]] and Kangaroos test winger [[Kerry Boustead]]. Fulton guided the team to the Minor Premiership by eight points. Manly looked to be well on its way to breaking through for a fifth premiership after exacting revenge for two losses during the season to Parramatta, claiming victory against the Eels in the Major Semi final, 19\u201310. But, in an almost carbon-copy of the 1982 decider, Parramatta bounced back strongly in their next game before again beating Manly to claim the title, 18\u20136, Brett Kenny again the main destroyer scoring 2 tries (Kenny scored doubles in the 1981, 1982 and 1983 Grand Finals). During the 1983 season, teenage halfback [[Phil Blake]] scored 27 tries for Manly, breaking the record of 24 scored by Kevin Junee in 1974. As of 2017 this is still the club record for most tries in a season.\n\nAfter the disappointment of losing the 1983 Grand Final, the team were unable to make a strong claim for the title during the [[1984 NSWRL season|1984]] season. Just once did Manly enjoy a winning streak of more than two, but still finished in fourth position. After beating [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] in a mid-week play-off for fifth, South Sydney knocked the Sea Eagles out of the finals in the first weekend with a 22\u201318 win. Joining the club in 1984 was young Penrith Panthers reserve halfback [[Des Hasler]].\n\nEarly in the [[1985 NSWRL season|1985]] season, Manly were challenging for a top two position, but a lack of momentum in the last half of the season saw the club unable to build on this position. At the completion of the regular season, the Sea Eagles still needed to win a mid-week final against [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] to attempt to claim fifth position, but the boot of [[Greg Alexander]] carried the Penrith Panthers to a 10\u20137 victory and into their first finals campaign. Bob Fulton installed Queensland and Australian representative back rower Paul Vautin as the club captain in 1985. Prior to the season, Manly signed pacey 19 year old Sarina (Queensland) outside back [[Dale Shearer]].\n\nAlthough Manly finished in fourth in [[1986 NSWRL season|1986]], the closeness of the competition meant that any of the finals teams were capable of beating the others on their day. Fifth place again had to be decided by a mid-week play-off, this time Balmain beat [[North Sydney Bears|Norths]] and progressed to a meeting with Manly for the first week of the finals. The Tigers scored a strong 29\u201322 win and Manly were knocked out of the finals in the first week, for the second year in a row. Manly were without the services of captain Paul Vautin for most of the season after the test back rower had broken his arm in a game against Penrith in late April. At the end of the season, 4 players (Cleal, Hasler, Shearer and [[Phil Daley]], the son of club secretary [[Doug Daley]]) were selected to go on the [[1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1986 Kangaroo tour]]. Prior to the end of the season, Manly also signed goal kicking outside back and dual-rugby international [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] from St George for the 1987 season. O'Connor would give Manly fans cause for optimism by being the top point scorer on the Kangaroo Tour with 170 points (13 tries, 59 goals) including a personal haul of 44 points (4 tries, 14 goals) in the Kangaroos 3-0 [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes series]] win over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]].\n\nLed by captain Paul Vautin and coached by Manly legend [[Bob Fulton]], the [[1987 NSWRL season|1987]] Sea Eagles dominated the competition and took the Minor Premiership by six points, including a then premiership record 12 wins in a row. Meeting second placed [[Eastern Suburbs Roosters|Easts]] in the second week of the finals, the Sea Eagles did enough to get over the Roosters, 10\u20136, and move into the Grand Final.\n\nJoining Manly in the last [[Grand Final]] to be played in front of 50,201 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] were the [[Canberra Raiders]] who had joined the competition in 1982. On an unseasonably hot day, the Sea Eagles scored a solid 18\u20138 victory to secure their fifth title. Although the score was tight, it didn't show Manly's domination on the day. Canberra's only realistic scoring opportunity to score came when five-eighth [[Chris O'Sullivan (rugby league)|Chris O'Sullivan]] crossed for a try late in the game. Manly only scored two tries, though they had opportunities for another five or six but were thwarted each time (often by their own mistakes). Michael O'Connor kicked 5 goals from 5 attempts in the Grand Final, as well as scoring a try, to ensure the premiership would return to the peninsula for the first time since 1978. However, on the day there was none better than Manly five-eighth [[Cliff Lyons]] who made line breaks almost at will in the first half and brought up the first score of the game when he received a pass from fullback Dale Shearer from a scrum win 10 metres out from the Raiders line, and beat both O'Sullivan and Queensland Origin fullback [[Gary Belcher]] to score. For his efforts, Lyons was awarded the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] as the Man of the Match.\n\n*'''27 September 1987'''\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\n[[Dale Shearer]], [[David Ronson]], [[Darrell Williams (rugby league)|Darrell Williams]], [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]], [[Stuart Davis (rugby league)|Stuart Davis]], [[Cliff Lyons]], [[Des Hasler]], [[Paul Vautin]] (c), [[Noel Cleal]], [[Ron Gibbs]], [[Kevin Ward (rugby league)|Kevin Ward]], [[Mal Cochrane]], [[Phil Daley]]\n\nReplacements: [[Mark Pocock]] for [[Noel Cleal]]; [[Paul Shaw (rugby league)|Paul Shaw]] for head bin (twice for [[Ron Gibbs]])\n\nCoach: [[Bob Fulton]]\n, \n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 18 (Lyons, O'Connor tries; O'Connor 5 goals) defeated [[Canberra Raiders]] - 8 (O'Sullivan try; Meninga, Belcher goals). [[Clive Churchill Medal]] - Cliff Lyons\n\nLess than two weeks later, the premiers traveled to [[Wigan]], England, to face the reigning English champions, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in the [[1987 World Club Challenge]]. In only the second such [[World Club Challenge]] match since the Eastern Suburbs Roosters mid-season win against [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] at the SCG in 1976, Manly lost the match 8\u20132. The game was played at Wigan's home ground, the famous [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] in front of 36,895 fans, though it was rumoured that the actual attendance was closer to 50,000. Manly second rower [[Ron Gibbs|\"Rambo\" Ronny Gibbs]], in his last game for the club before moving to the new [[Gold Coast Seagulls]] in 1989, became the first player sent off in a [[World Club Challenge]] after a high tackle on Wigan's international centre [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]].\n\nWith the expansion of the NSWRL seeing new teams from Newcastle and Queensland, the first round of the [[1988 NSWRL season|1988 season]] saw the reigning premiers taking on a [[Brisbane Broncos]] team featuring many of Queensland's top players including Australian captain [[Wally Lewis]] and representative players [[Colin Scott (rugby league)|Colin Scott]], [[Gene Miles]], [[Allan Langer]], [[Bryan Neibling]], [[Greg Dowling]] and [[Greg Conescu]]. Manly were never in the match and lost to the Brisbane side, 44\u201310. By the end of the regular season, Manly finished third but were eliminated in the first week, 19\u20136, by Grand Final bound Balmain.\n\nDuring the 1988 season, Manly played the [[Great Britain Lions]] under lights at [[Brookvale Oval]] as part of the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]]. Missing six regular first grade players (Vautin, Shearer, O'Connor, Daley, Ronson and Cochrane), the makeshift Sea Eagles put the Mal Reilly coached Lions to the sword with a 30\u20130 win in front of 21,131 fans, the largest non-test attendance of the Lions tour. Teenage halfback [[Geoff Toovey]], playing only his third game of top grade football, scored one of Manly's 5 tries for the game and was awarded the Man of the Match. Among the beaten Lions that night were test players the caliber of [[Martin Offiah]], [[Karl Fairbank]], [[Phil Ford (rugby)|Phil Ford]], [[Carl Gibson]], [[Andy Platt]] and [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]].<ref>[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=1205 1988 Manly vs Great Britain]</ref>\n\nWith Bob Fulton taking on the Australian coaching job, another former Manly favourite was brought in to fill his shoes. International Alan Thompson distinguished himself in the maroon and white over a 263-game career at five-eighth had coached the club's Reserve Grade side to the 1987 Grand Final before winning the 1988 Grand Final. During the 1989 season the clubs attack stalled and finished twelfth. Thompson was sacked and the club bought in successful Wigan coach, Graham Lowe.\n\nThe 1989 season was one of disharmony for the Manly club. With Bob Fulton now gone, the club board took back control of the club (popular theory said that Fulton had almost total control during his time as coach). With the first grade side showing poor form, club secretary Doug Daley allegedly approached the playing group at a mid-season training session and offered a release for any player who wished to leave the club. Three days later, Dale Shearer asked for a release only to be denied by Daley who claimed that it was only for the time he offered it and no longer stood. The matter would end up in court and Shearer was granted his release to join the Brisbane Broncos. Also, at the end of the season long serving club captain Paul Vautin was offered only a 1-year contract at approximately half of his reported 1989 salary of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]95,000. Vautin subsequently left the club to join Eastern Suburbs. Club vice-captain Noel Cleal also faced the same situation and ultimately announced his retirement from playing at the end of the season. Cleal would take up the position of assistant coach with the [[Hull F.C.]] club in the English premiership.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=Mike|title=Fatty: The Strife and times of Paul Vautin|date=1992|publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia Pty, Limited|location=Sydney|isbn=9781875471171}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1990|1990]] and [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1991|1991]] seasons saw the club return to the finals football, but no premierships. The 1990 side, coached by former [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] and Wigan head coach Graham Lowe who had replaced 1989 coach Alan Thompson who had been sacked after failing to make the finals, started slow but eventually finished the regular season in fourth and facing Balmain in the first week of the finals, which the Sea Eagles won. However, a tryless effort against the Broncos in the second week saw the club go no further in their campaign. One of Lowe's biggest recruits for Manly in 1990 was goal kicking former [[All Blacks]] fullback [[Matthew Ridge]]. Such was Ridge's form after coming over from rugby union that he was selected to the New Zealand test team after only 5 games for the Sea Eagles.\n\nFinishing second in 1991, Manly succumbed in successive finals matches, losing first to North Sydney then knocked out in the second week by Canberra.\n\nThe [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1992|1992]] season featured only one team in the finals from the previous year. Manly's recent improvements in attack disappeared and they missed out, finishing eighth. At the end of the season, club captain and dual-rugby international Michael O'Connor retired from playing.\n\nDuring the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1993|1993 season]], after a previous health scare, Graham Lowe eventually succumbed to a serious health issue which forced him from his coaching role. This saw the club send out an SOS to Australian coach Bob Fulton to return to club coaching, an SOS he immediately answered. In one of the closest finishes to the top of the table, only two points separated first and fifth, with Manly finishing in fourth position. Manly's first match in the finals was against fifth-placed Brisbane and they were again outclassed by the reigning premiers and were eliminated on the first weekend of finals.\n\nOver the course of the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1994|1994 season]], the club displayed a further improvement in their attacking skills, including the club record 61\u20130 victory over 1993 grand finalists, [[St George Dragons|St George]]. Finishing fourth, the Sea Eagles again met the fifth placed Broncos in the first week of finals, but were unable to reverse the result of 1993 and were eliminated from the finals series, 16\u20134.\n\nThroughout the mid-90's, rumours of a separate League developed into a major split of the code in Australia. With [[News Ltd]]'s backing, the Brisbane Broncos and Canberra Raiders pushed hard for better input to the game, feeling that the Sydney-centric ARL was not meeting their needs. Despite all the rhetoric of better player conditions, the resultant [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] developed into a push by Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd to develop a competition that would be used as the flagship of his fledgling Pay TV sports channel, Fox Sports.\n\nThe Manly-Warringah club remained solid with the ARL with only a handful of players, including [[Matthew Ridge]], [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]] and [[Owen Cunningham]], committing to Super League.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of [[Super League]] and resultant [[Super League War]] throughout the [[Australian Rugby League season 1995|1995 season]], Manly dominated the season losing only two matches to finish as minor premiers. They won their first 15 matches in a row, a club record, and missed out on the highest number of points scored by the club by just three.\n\nIn 1995, Manly's star representative forward [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]] became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first rugby footballer in the world to come out to the public as gay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peter|first=O'Shea|title=Out of the field|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|publisher=Here Publishing|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith the increase of teams from 16 to 20, a new finals format was introduced and consisted of the top eight sides at the end of the regular season. In the first week of the finals, Manly beat Cronulla before a two-week break and another victory, this time against the [[Newcastle Knights]]. Manly were to face the finals series surprise packet, [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Sydney Bulldogs (Canterbury)]], which despite finishing the season in sixth place, had already beaten favourites Brisbane and Canberra in the finals. Despite being clear favourites to hold off the Bulldogs challenge, Manly struggled to match the intensity of their rivals and lost, 17-4\n\nOver the course of the [[Australian Rugby League season 1996|1996 season]] Manly, on the back of its defence which conceded less than 9-points per game, produced one of its most dominant displays since joining the competition in 1947 to claim its eighth Minor Premiership. A tight win against the [[Sydney Roosters|Sydney City Roosters]] and a shutout of Cronulla saw the club meeting [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the Grand Final.\n\nManly won their sixth title with a comfortable 20\u20138 victory, but it wasn't without controversy, with a try just before halftime award on the back of the referee's decision to allow play-on after an apparent tackle put the Dragons' defence on the back foot.\n\n*'''29 September 1996'''\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''':\nMatthew Ridge, Danny Moore, Craig Innes, Terry Hill, [[John Hopoate]], Nik Kosef, [[Geoff Toovey]](c), David Gillespie, Jim Serdaris, Mark Carroll, Steve Menzies, [[Daniel Gartner]], [[Owen Cunningham]].\n\nInterchange: [[Cliff Lyons]], Neil Tierney, Craig Hancock, [[Des Hasler]]\n\nCoach: [[Bob Fulton]].\n\n'''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles''' - 20 (Innes, Menzies, Moore tries; Ridge 3, Innes goals) defeated [[St George Dragons]] - 8 (Zisti try; Bartrim 2 goals)\n\nDespite the loss of a couple of players to Super League, the club still held the nucleus of the squad together for a tilt at back-to-back titles in the split [[Australian Rugby League season 1997|1997 season]] competition. By the end of the regular season, Manly finished on top of the table and earned a break from the first round of finals in the seven-team format.\n\nThe Sea Eagles accounted for the Knights in the second week of the finals, before scoring a tight win against the Roosters to qualify for the Grand Final. Manly were again clear favourites and for the first hour, they had the premiership in their grasp, holding on to a 10-point lead. Two tries to Newcastle fullback, [[Robbie O'Davis]], soon had the clubs tied at 16-all with full-time looming. Only seconds from seeing the game enter into extra-time, Newcastle halfback, [[Andrew Johns]], wrong-footed the defence to send his winger, [[Darren Albert]] over the try line.\n\nThe start of the [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998 season]] saw a much anticipated match up between the Super League champions Brisbane and the ARL high flyers, Manly. The Sea Eagles went down 22-6 and an inconsistent season saw the club rely on a late winning streak of six matches to finish out the regular season and limp into the finals in tenth place. Facing Canberra in the first week of the finals, Manly were convincingly beaten 17\u20134; the last time the club would play finals football until 2005.\n\nFrom one of the richer clubs in the League, Manly were by now struggling to keep up with player payments and were unable to entice players to the club. Much talk was made about a possible joint venture between local rivals Manly and Norths with both teams were in need of the $10M on offer. With these issues in the background, Manly turned up to the regular season seven rounds late and soon Bob Fulton quit his head coach position due to his wife's health concerns. Peter Sharp took over the reins and won his first three games, a record result for a caretaker coach in the League.\n\nBy halfway through the season, it was obvious that the club would be missing their first finals campaign since 1992 and when they finished thirteenth, it was their lowest relative placing since 1989. But unlike previous eras when the club could look to purchase key players, there was simply no money left.\n\nA consolidation of the competition meant that a criterion was imposed and those not making the cut would not be involved in the 2000 season. The NRL imposed a time limit on the acceptance of a merger offer, or clubs could try their luck through the criteria. Both Manly and Norths administrators were not keen on approaching a merger, but with Manly's financial problems and North Sydney effectively insolvent due to disastrous year when a planned move to the Central Coast was delayed, both sides met to talk of a joint venture. Although the criteria result was in the positive for the Manly club, financial realities meant that there was not much success likely in the future. Due to their insolvency, the North Sydney club were not even considered for the criteria.\n\nIn late 1999, the clubs agreed to a joint venture and the [[Northern Eagles]] were born.\n\n===Northern Eagles===\n{{Main|Northern Eagles}}\nUnlike the successful St. George Dragons and Illawarra Steelers merger of 1999, restrictions imposed on the clubs meant that half of the combined squad had to be released prior to kick-off as the [[Northern Eagles]], on 5 February 2000.\n\nDespite a first up win against the [[Newcastle Knights]], a lack of consistent on-field success and continuing financial problems saw the joint venture gradually suffer with a lack of support from the Central Coast supporters, who felt the team forced onto them, and the Manly faithful who disappeared from Brookvale Oval.\n\nAlthough officially dissolved in August 2001, the club continued to play out of both Brookvale and Graeme Park ([[Central Coast Stadium]]) until the lead up to the Round 16 clash with Melbourne in 2002. Originally scheduled for Graeme Park, fierce opposition by Central Coast locals and some media identities forced the club to cease playing in Gosford.\n\nWith the club returning to [[Brookvale Oval]] full-time they were by now the [[Northern Eagles]] in name only. In 2003 they re-entered the league as the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\n\n===2000s===\nEmerging from the failed merger through 2002, Manly were still on shaky ground both on and off the field. The reversion of the NRL licence to Manly meant that contracts with the Northern Eagles were now void. Waiting on further payments, many players left and the club soon developed a high turnover of [[Journeyman (sports)|journeyman]] and fringe first graders which saw a further lack of stability both on and off the field. With no major sponsor and little public interest with either spectators or through merchandise, the club's finances were so bad that the football club was only days from closing its doors midway through the 2002 season. In June, initial efforts by the Penn family and then a multimillion-dollar deal with local developer, Max Delmege, led to the future privatisation of the club and financial security.\n\nResults on the field during [[National Rugby League season 2003|2003 season]] were generally poor, with the club regularly conceding 50-plus score lines, even at Brookvale Oval. By the end of the regular season the club finished 14th; just one position above wooden-spooners, South Sydney.\n\nWith the club still suffering with poor finances, and despite the cash injection of $10,000,000 granted to the Northern Eagles entity, a change in direction was needed.\n\nIn November 2003, Scott Penn offered the Football Club $5,000,000 for a half-share of the Sea Eagles, with the partnership with the Football Club anticipated to contribute $10,000,000 over four years. The deal required 75 percent support by the football club members, and was tabled at the Annual General meeting on 18 December 2003.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 22 November 2003 - http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/21/1069027327726.html</ref> Despite football and leagues club board support, the necessary numbers did not favour privatisation and the motion was defeated.\n\nAfter initially saving the club from closure in early 2004, with an injection of much needed money in the form of sponsorship, Max Delmege received football club members support for his privatisation deal on 3 June 2004. The deal was passed with 93% support (162-10 in favour) and saw Delmege pay $3.5 million for a 65.5 per cent share, not including ongoing sponsorship of $1,000,000 per year.\n\nInitial share holdings saw Delmege hold 3.5mil, Manly Football Club with 2mil, and Penn Sports take 100,000.  An additional 4.4mil shares were to be made available to members, supporters and investors. The new board would feature six directors with two from the Football Club, two from the Leagues Club and two appointed from Delmege, with an independent chairman appointed by the six directors.<ref>Daily Telegraph, Dean Richie, 4 June 2004</ref>\n\nEffectively, the members voted for the approval of Special Resolutions to allow for the privatisation of the Football Club to proceed. The club was now '''Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Limited'''. This entity holds the NRL Licence and manages the clubs employees from the players right through to the front office, organisation of sponsorships and merchandise, provides hospitality and prepares for games played out of Brookvale Oval. It is also responsible for running the lower grades in the NSWRL competitions.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I'm very passionate about this club and want to see it get back to where it was, a very successful rugby league team.\" Max Delmege, June 2004.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe club made no strong moves in the player market ahead of the [[National Rugby League season 2004|2004]] season, but there was one significant change to the roster with Peter Sharp axed and his assistant coach, Des Hasler, taking over the head coach role. Manly won just two more games than 2003 to finish thirteenth, but this slight improvement on the table was tempered by the club enduring their worst loss up to that time, going down 72\u201312 to the [[Penrith Panthers]] in Round 22. As if to highlight the inconsistencies of the team, the Sea Eagles produced their best result for the season with a 48\u201310 win against Newcastle the following week; the highest turn-around in NSWRL/ARL/NRL history.\n\nThe purchase of representative players [[Ben Kennedy (rugby league)|Ben Kennedy]], [[Michael Witt]] and [[Brent Kite]], ahead of the [[National Rugby League season 2005|2005 season]] were the clubs first significant signings since the mid-90's and early success on the field was reflected by the clubs place at the top of the table midway through the season. But contract issues with captain [[Michael Monaghan]] coincided with a drop in form, including a record loss of the club against Cronulla, 68\u20136. Winning their final round game, Manly secured eighth spot, but were quickly dispatched from the finals in the first week with a 46\u201322 loss to Parramatta.\n\nIn January 2006, the new Manly Warringah Board unanimously approve Penn Sport to purchase the majority of the outstanding shares in the club.  This reshuffle saw both Delmege and Penn Sports each own just under 40% of the club, with the remainder held by the Manly Football Club. The intention of both majority owners was to see the Football Club further improve their finances, with the aim of the Football Club eventually buying back the privately held shares.<ref>MWSE News Release, 18 January 2006. http://www.pennsport.com.au/news.html</ref>\n\nThe new board grew to nine, with the addition of two directors appointed by Penn Sports.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"We\u2019re fortunate to have two partners who are willing to invest in the long term future of Manly and are absolutely, passionately committed to its success. The loyalty of Max Delmege to the club speaks for itself and the Penn family are life long fans and passionate supporters of the Sea Eagles. Penn Sport also has a depth of experience in sponsorship and sports management and will add value to the club and be of enormous advantage in moving the club forward.\u201d Paul Cummings, MWSE Board CEO.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe club further boosted its roster for the [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006]], with the signings of Orford and centre [[Steven Bell|Steve Bell]] from Melbourne. The club overcome a slow start to finish the regular season fifth and a match against the Newcastle Knights in the first week of finals. Despite an early lead, the Sea Eagles were run down in a physical encounter, eventually losing 25\u201318. The following week, Manly struggled for any impact against the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]], losing 28\u20130 to finish their tilt at the premiership.\n\nUntil September 2006, the Manly-Warringah Football Club had bought back 150,000 additional shares from MWSE Limited. Monies generated by Football Club come from memberships and other fund raising activities. Memberships to the MWSE Limited supporters club (Screaming Eagles) do not provide the Football Club with further monies.\n\nA restructure of the MWSE Limited Board saw the Manly Leagues Club lose one director, and Scott Penn resume the Chairman duties.\n\nThe [[2007 NRL season]] saw the club maintain a stable playing roster for the first time since the success of the mid-1990s, and on the back of a strong defensive platform, finished the regular season second place behind the [[Melbourne Storm]]. With their first top four finish in the NRL, the club hosted their first ever final at [[Brookvale Oval]], against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] which resulted in an easy 30\u20136 victory and a week off. In the qualifying final against [[North Queensland Cowboys]], a dominant second half saw the team win 28-6 and earn a place in the Grand Final against minor premiers Melbourne Storm. After a physical opening, Manly soon ran out of steam and were well beaten 8-34.\n\nIn mapping out Manly's future in 2003, Des Hasler and his coaching staff believed that the successful implementation of a 5-year plan would set the club up for a premiership for the 2008 season. In making the 2007 decider, many within the club stated that it was a year earlier than expected, but after the horror loss, they turned their eyes to the 2008 as the premiership year.\n\nThe season started off rocky with the club dropping their first two games, prompting many commentators to question the clubs ability to backup, particularly with the loss of [[Michael Monaghan]] to the ESL. Slowly, the club returned to form and by mid-season were again in a race for the minor premiership. It was not until the final game of the NRL season when the minor premiership was decided, with Melbourne requiring a 26-point win to claim it from Manly, on for-and-against. They easily did this, relegating Manly to second with Cronulla coming third on the same number of points but a significantly lower for-and against record.\n\nIn the build-up to the first week of the finals, halfback [[Matt Orford]] won the [[Dally M Medal]], beating out [[Melbourne Storm]] stars [[Billy Slater]] and [[Cameron Smith]]. On the back of this recognition, Orford led Manly to a comprehensive 38\u20136 victory over the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] in the Qualifying Final at [[Brookvale Oval]], earning the side a two-week rest and a home Preliminary Final at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. Another strong victory, this time a 32\u20136 win over the [[New Zealand Warriors]], ensured a rematch of the [[2007 NRL Grand Final]] against the Melbourne Storm.\n\nIn the week leading up to the 2008 Grand Final, the MWSE CEO Grant Mayer, used the publicity to press for further sponsorship opportunities, including a likely replacement of major sponsor Delmege. This action appears to be the catalyst for the subsequent long-running board room fracture, with the Board split on many 'front office' issues including the extension of contracts for coach Des Hasler, media manager Peter Peters and Board CEO Grant Mayer, infighting played out through the media by both factions, and a deal to purchase the Leagues Club jointly by the Penns and Delmege falling through.\n\n[[File:Manlyroosters.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Sydney Roosters in action against the Manly Sea Eagles at Brookvale Oval in June 2008]]On the back of strong on-field results and the turmoil which played around the Melbourne club during the finals series, including the loss of captain Cameron Smith (suspended) and [[Ryan Hoffman]] (injury), Manly entered the decider as slight favourites. The first half featured a disciplined performance by Manly, with Melbourne finding themselves on the wrong end of both field position and possession, and unable to apply any significant pressure. Manly led 8\u20130 at the break, but with the groundwork done in the first half, went on a six try, second half scoring spree to run out winners 40\u20130.

As well as the classic 'V' design, the club has broken up the maroon jersey with hoops, bars, large eagles, player numbers, stripes, double stripes, top and bottoms, collars, no collars, reversed colours and even the use of blue.\n\nDuring the 2007 pre-season, the club introduced a limited number of green jerseys for a trial match against the [[Melbourne Storm]].\n\n==Rivalries==\nThe Manly Sea Eagles have developed some rivalries since 1947. Some of them include:\n\n*[[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] - The first, and most obvious, was the local derby's between [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]]. As well as taking many of North's playing stock due to the residential rule imposed at the time, Manly had bought further stars from the North Sydney club including [[Ken Irvine]], [[Cliff Lyons]] and [[Martin Bella]]. Even the fact that North Sydney are not longer competing in the top league, has fueled this rivalry, with many Bears supporters believing that Manly systematically pushed the North Sydney element out of the Northern Eagles joint-venture.\n*[[Parramatta Eels]] - Another rivalry was with fellow debutants from 1947, [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]]. Not much was made of their clashes until the mid 70's, and in particular the 1976 Grand Final in which Manly denied the Parramatta club a maiden premiership. Further clashes through to the mid 80's, including Manly's [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]] and [[1983 NSWRFL season|1983]] Grand Final losses to the Eels, cemented a fierce rivalry between many of the clubs' supporters.\n*[[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] - There was a small rivalry between these two clubs from 1947 to 1971, as along with the [[St. George Dragons]], they were the powerhouses of the time and they played each other in the 1951, 1968 and 1970 Grand Finals. From 1972, the rivalry became bigger, as due to the abolishment of the rule where players could not freely negotiate with other clubs, the Sea Eagles signed many of South Sydney's stars, including [[Ray Branighan]] and [[John O'Neill (rugby league)|John O'Neill]] in 1972, [[Tom Mooney (rugby league)|Tom Mooney]] in 1975, [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]] in 1990, [[Mark Carroll (rugby league)|Mark Carroll]] in 1993 and more recently [[Dylan Walker]] in 2016. Conversely, Manly also lost some players to the Rabbitohs including [[Phil Blake]] in 1987 and [[Glenn Stewart]] in 2015.\n*[[Western Suburbs Magpies]] - Also during this time, the clashes between [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] and Manly were billed as a battle between the \"Silvertails\" and the \"Fibros\". This distinction between perceived classes of people fuelled many tough matches between the clubs, particularly after Manly would secure top players from the Magpies such as John Dorahy, Les Boyd, David Gillespie. The Silvertails and Fibros monikers first appeared in stories written by reporter Chris Masters, in the late 70's. Chris was the brother of the then Wests coach, Roy Masters.\n*[[Cronulla Sharks]] - This rivalry has been dubbed the \"Battle of the Beaches\", due to the geographical locations of the two clubs. Manly played the Sharks in two grand finals: 1973 and 1978, which are renowned for being the most brutal in history. Manly won both of these deciders, 10\u20137 in 1973 and 16\u20130 in the 1978 replay after the first game ended at 11-all. The Sea Eagles have traditionally had much success over the Sharks, with Cronulla winning at Manly's home ground just five times in their history. However the Sharks' biggest ever win came against Manly, a 68-6 thrashing in 2005. Cronulla and Manly play for the Steve Rogers Trophy when the two clubs meet in the NRL premiership each season. Most recently the two teams met in the 2013 finals, when Manly held off Cronulla by 24\u201318.\n*[[Newcastle Knights]] - Since the mid-90's, Manly has also built a rivalry with the [[Newcastle Knights]] club. In many ways this mirrors the Manly/Wests clashes where class distinction is used to fuel the perceived underdogs, in this case the working class city of Newcastle. In 1997, both Manly and Newcastle fought out the decider, with Newcastle winning 22\u201316. Newcastle's coach in 1997 was 1972 and 1973 Manly premiership winner [[Mal Reilly]]. Manly's coach Bob Fulton was a teammate of Reilly's in those premiership wins. Recently, in the 10 August 2007 match to commemorate the 1997 grand final Manly took revenge, thumping the knights 50\u201316.\n*[[Melbourne Storm]] - Manly have recently built up a rivalry with the [[Melbourne Storm]] club. Over the last few years they have had very close games, they have been the top two teams in the premiership, and they have played each other in the 2007 and 2008 NRL Grand Finals. The Sea Eagles and Storm were also involved in the infamous '''[[Battle of Brookvale]]''' match in Round 25 of the 2011 season which saw all-in brawls, 2 players sent off and 6 players (5 from Manly) receiving an accumulated total of 13 weeks worth of suspensions.\n\n==Stadium==\nHome games are played at [[Brookvale Oval]], which has a capacity of 23,000.\n\nUpon entry into the top league, Manly were denied the use of Manly Oval by the pro-Rugby Union council of the time. This led to the acquisition of the Brookvale Showground as a home ground, supported by the former Warringah Council.\n\nMost development on the site had occurred between 1965 and 1980, with the latest additions being the Ken Arthurson Stand which opened in 1995 and an extension of the Jane Try Stand in 2014.\n\nThere is much conjecture on what the future development of the ground will include. As one of the few grounds to still have a substantial grassed hill area, many supporters believe that future plans must retain this unique feature.\n\nThe largest attendance for a Rugby League match at Brookvale Oval was 27,655 during the final round clash of the 1986 season, between Manly and Parramatta. Highest average crowd for a season was 15,484 over 11 games, in the 2006 season.\n\nIn total, Brookvale Oval has seen over five and half million spectators since 1947.\n\n==Premierships and Titles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n! colspan=11 |Manly Warringah Sea Eagles\n|-\n|'''Premiership Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1972|1972]], [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]], [[NSWRFL season 1976|1976]], [[NSWRFL season 1978|1978]], [[NSWRL season 1987|1987]], [[ARL season 1996|1996]], [[NRL season 2008|2008]], [[NRL season 2011|2011]] (8)\n|-\n|'''Premiership Runners-Up''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1951|1951]], [[NSWRFL season 1957|1957]], [[NSWRFL season 1959|1959]], [[NSWRFL season 1968|1968]], [[NSWRFL season 1970|1970]], [[NSWRFL season 1982|1982]], [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]], [[ARL season 1995|1995]], [[ARL season 1997|1997]], [[NRL season 2007|2007]] (10)\n|-\n|'''Minor Premiership Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1971|1971]], [[NSWRFL season 1972|1972]], [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]], [[NSWRFL season 1976|1976]], [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]], [[NSWRL season 1987|1987]], [[ARL season 1995|1995]], [[ARL season 1996|1996]], [[ARL season 1997|1997]] (9)\n|-\n|'''Pre-Season Cup''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1980|1980]]\n|-\n|'''Sevens Tournaments''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRL season 1990|1990]], [[NSWRL season 1994|1994]], [[ARL season 1995|1995]] (3)\n|-\n|'''[[NSWRL Premier League|Reserve Grade]] Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1954|1954]], [[NSWRFL season 1960|1960]], [[NSWRFL season 1969|1969]], [[NSWRFL season 1973|1973]], [[NSWRL season 1988|1988]] (5)\n|-\n|'''[[Jersey Flegg Cup]] Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1961|1961]], [[NSWRFL season 1974|1974]], [[NSWRL season 1987|1987]] (3)\n|-\n|'''Third Grade Titles''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1952|1952]] (1)\n|-\n|'''Presidents Cup''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1946|1946]], [[NSWRFL season 1970|1970]] (2)\n|-\n|'''KG Cup''' <td align=\"left\"> [[NSWRFL season 1982|1982]], [[NSWRFL season 1983|1983]] (2)\n|-\n|'''[[S.G.
