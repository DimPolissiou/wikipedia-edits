All indications pointed to an American drive toward the [[Mariana Islands]] and the Carolines. To counter such an offensive, the IJA and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas, and thence to Japan via the [[Volcano Islands]], and westward from the Marianas via the Carolines and the [[Palau Islands]] to [[the Philippines]].\n\nIn March 1944, the [[Thirty-First Army (Japan)|Japanese 31st Army]], commanded by General [[Hideyoshi Obata]], was activated to garrison this inner line. (Note that a Japanese army was about the size of an American, [[British Army]], or [[Canadian Army]] [[corps]]. The Japanese Army had many [[Armies of the Imperial Japanese Army#Armies|armies]], but the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] only had [[Formations of the United States Army during World War II#Field Armies|ten]] at its peak, with the 4th Army, the 6th Army, the 8th Army, and the 10th Army being in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. Also, the 10th Army only fought on [[Okinawa]] in the spring of 1945.)\n\nThe commander of the Japanese garrison on [[Chichi Jima]] was placed nominally in command of Army and Navy units in the [[Volcano Islands]].<ref name=\"morison\"/> After the American conquest of the Marianas, daily bomber raids from the Marianas hit the mainland as part of [[Operation Scavenger]]. Iwo Jima served as an early warning station that radioed reports of incoming bombers back to mainland Japan. This allowed Japanese air defenses to prepare for the arrival of American bombers.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n\nAfter the U.S. seized bases in the Marshall Islands in the battles of [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] and [[Battle of Eniwetok|Eniwetok]] in February 1944, Japanese Army and Navy reinforcements were sent to Iwo Jima: 500 men from the naval base at [[Yokosuka]] and 500 from Chichi Jima reached Iwo Jima during March and April 1944. At the same time, with reinforcements arriving from Chichi Jima and the home islands, the Army garrison on Iwo Jima reached a strength of more than 5,000 men.<ref name= \"morison\"/> The loss of the Marianas during the summer of 1944 greatly increased the importance of the Volcano Islands for the Japanese, who were aware that the loss of these islands would facilitate American air raids against the Home Islands, disrupting war manufacturing and severely damaging civilian morale.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n\nFinal Japanese plans for the defense of the Volcano Islands were overshadowed by several factors:\n\n# The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had already lost almost all of its power, and it could not prevent American landings.\n# Aircraft losses in 1944 had been so heavy that, even if war production were not affected by American air attacks, combined Japanese air strength was not expected to increase to 3,000 [[warplane]]s until March or April 1945.\n# These aircraft could not be used from bases in the Home Islands against Iwo Jima because their range was not more than {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n# Available warplanes had to be hoarded to defend [[Taiwan]] and the [[Japan|Japanese Home Islands]] from any attack.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n# There was a serious shortage of properly trained and experienced [[aviator|pilots]] and other aircrew to man the warplanes Japan had because such large numbers of pilots and crewmen had perished fighting over the [[Solomon Islands]] and during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944.\n\nIn a postwar study, Japanese staff officers described the strategy that was used in the defense of Iwo Jima in the following terms:\n\n{{quotation|In the light of the above situation, seeing that it was impossible to conduct our air, sea, and ground/ operations on Iwo Island [Jima] toward ultimate victory, it was decided that to gain time necessary for the preparation of the Homeland defense, our forces should rely solely upon the established defensive equipment in that area, checking the enemy by delaying tactics. Even the [[kamikaze|suicidal attacks]] by small groups of our Army and Navy airplanes, the surprise attacks by our [[submarine]]s, and the actions of parachute units, although effective, could be regarded only as a strategical ruse on our part. It was a most depressing thought that we had no available means left for the exploitation of the strategical opportunities which might from time to time occur in the course of these operations.<ref>USA, FEC, HistDiv, \"Operations in the Central Pacific\" \u2013 Japanese Studies in World War II (Japanese Monograph No. 48, OCMH), p. 62.; cited in George W.

Iwo Jima was strategically important: it provided an [[air base]] for Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighter planes]] to intercept long-range [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] bombers, and it provided a haven for Japanese naval units in dire need of any support available. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage [[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands|air attacks on the Mariana Islands]] from November 1944 through January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate these problems and provide a staging area for [[Operation Downfall]]\u2014the eventual invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The distance of B-29 raids could (hypothetically) be cut in half, and a base would be available for [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighters to escort and protect the bombers.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n\nAmerican intelligence sources were confident that Iwo Jima would fall in one week. In light of the optimistic intelligence reports, the decision was made to invade Iwo Jima and the operation was given the code name Operation Detachment.<ref name=\"morison\"/> American forces were unaware that the Japanese were preparing a complex and deep defense, radically departing from their usual strategy of a beach defense. So successful was the Japanese preparation that it was discovered after the battle that the hundreds of tons of Allied bombs and thousands of rounds of heavy naval gunfire had left the Japanese defenders almost undamaged and ready to inflict losses on the U.S. Marines.\n\n==Planning and preparation==\n{{Main|Planning for the Battle of Iwo Jima}}\n\n===Japanese preparations===\n[[File:Tadamichi Kuribayashi.jpg|upright|thumb|Lieut. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi]]\nBy June 1944, Lieutenant General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] was assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi knew that Japan could not win the battle, but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces, so that the United States and its Australian and British allies would reconsider carrying out [[Operation Downfall|the invasion of Japan Home Islands]].\n\nWhile drawing inspiration from the defense in the [[Battle of Peleliu]], Kuribayashi designed a defense that broke with Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establishing his defenses on the beach to face the landings directly, he created strong, mutually supporting [[defense in depth|defenses in depth]] using static and heavy weapons such as heavy [[machine gun]]s and artillery. [[Takeichi Nishi]]'s armored [[tank]]s were to be used as camouflaged artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking the mountain to the main forces was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around [[Mount Suribachi]] as a semi-independent sector, with his main defensive zone built up in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment further prompted the creation of an extensive system of tunnels that connected the prepared positions, so that a [[pillbox (military)|pillbox]] that had been cleared could be reoccupied. This network of [[bunker]]s and pillboxes favored the defense. For instance, The Nano Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water, and ammunition for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline-powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Tomb Called Iwo Jima|last=King|first=Dan|publisher=Pacific Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1500343385|location=|pages=58\u201359|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nBy February 19, 1945, the day the Americans invaded, {{convert|18|km|mi}} of a planned {{convert|27|km|mi}} of tunnel network had been dug. Besides the Nanpo Bunker, there were numerous command centers and barracks that were 75 feet deep.

Kuribayashi specially engineered the defenses so that every part of Iwo Jima was subject to Japanese defensive fire. He also received a handful of ''[[kamikaze]]'' pilots to use against the enemy fleet. Three hundred and eighteen American sailors were killed by ''kamikaze'' attacks during the battle. However, against his wishes, Kuribayashi's superiors on [[Honshu]] ordered him to erect some beach defenses.\n\n===American preparations===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=Well, this will be easy.

On 17 February, the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Blessman|DE-69|6}} sent [[Underwater Demolition Team]] 15 (UDT-15) toward Blue Beach for reconnaissance. The Japanese [[infantry]] fired on them, killing one American diver. On the evening of 18 February, the ''Blessman'' was hit by a bomb from a Japanese aircraft, killing 40 sailors, including 15 members of her UDT.\n\nUnaware of Kuribayashi's tunnel defense system, many of the Americans assumed the majority of the Japanese garrison were killed by the constant bombing raids.\n\n===Pre-landing bombardment===\n[[File:USS New York-11.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|New York|BB-34|6}} firing its {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} main guns on the island, 16 February 1945 (D minus 3)]]\nMaj. Gen. [[Harry Schmidt (USMC)|Harry Schmidt]], commander of the Marine landing force, requested a 10-day heavy shelling of the island immediately preceding the mid-February [[amphibious assault]]. However, Rear Adm. [[William H. P. Blandy]], commander of the Amphibious Support Force (Task Force 52), did not believe such a bombardment would allow him time to replenish his ships' ammunition before the landings; he thus refused Schmidt's request. Schmidt then asked for nine days of shelling; Blandy again refused and agreed to a three-day bombardment. This decision left much hard feeling among the Marines. After the war, Lieut. Gen. [[Holland Smith|Holland M. \"Howlin' Mad\" Smith]], commander Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56, which consisted of Schmidt's Fifth Amphibious Corps), bitterly complained that the lack of naval gunfire had cost Marine lives during the entire Allied island campaign.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 22</ref>\n\nEach heavy [[warship]] was given an area on which to fire that, combined with all the ships, covered the entire island. Each warship fired for approximately six hours before stopping for a certain amount of time. Poor weather on D minus 3 led to uncertain results for that day's bombardment. On D minus 2, the time and care that the Japanese had taken in preparing their artillery positions became clear. When [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Pensacola|CA-24|6}} got within range of shore batteries, the ship was quickly hit 6 times and suffered 17 crew deaths. Later, 12 small craft attempting to land an [[underwater demolition team]] were all struck by Japanese rounds and quickly retired. While aiding these vessels, the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Leutze|DD-481|6}} was also hit and suffered 7 crew deaths. On D minus 1, Adm. Blandy's gunners were once again hampered by rain and clouds. Gen. Schmidt summed up his feelings by saying, \"We only got about 13 hours worth of fire support during the 34 hours of available daylight.\"<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThe limited bombardment had questionable impact on the enemy due to the Japanese being heavily dug-in and fortified. However, many [[bunker]]s and caves were destroyed during the bombing, giving it some limited success. The Japanese had been preparing for this battle since March 1944, which gave them a significant head start.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naval Gunfire|url=http://ftp.metalab.unc.edu/hyperwar/USN/rep/Iwo/Cominch/Iwo-2.html|accessdate=28 February 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> By the time of the landing, about 450 American ships were located off Iwo Jima.

Mitscher's]] Task Force 58, a huge carrier force, arrived off Iwo Jima. Also in this flotilla was Adm. [[Raymond A. Spruance]], overall commander for the invasion, in his flagship, the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS |Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}. \"Howlin' Mad\" Smith was once again deeply frustrated that Mitscher's powerful carrier group had been bombing the Japanese home islands instead of softening up the defenses of Iwo Jima. Mitscher's fliers did contribute to the additional surface-ship bombardment that accompanied the formation of the amphibious craft.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 23\">Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 23</ref>\n\nUnlike the days of the pre-landing bombardment, D-Day dawned clear and bright.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 23\"/> At 08:59, one minute ahead of schedule, the first wave of Marines landed on the beaches of the southeastern coast of Iwo Jima. Major Howard Connor, [[5th Marine Division]] signal officer, had six [[Navajo code talkers]] working around the clock during the first two days of the battle. These six sent and received over 800 messages, all without error. Connor later stated, \"Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.\"<ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html \"Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104121421/https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html |date=4 November 2017 }}. [[Naval Historical Center]]. 1992. Retrieved 2014-03-12.</ref>\n\n===Situation on the beaches===\nUnfortunately for the landing force, the planners at Pearl Harbor had completely misjudged the situation that would face Gen. Schmidt's Marines. The beaches had been described as \"excellent\" and the thrust inland was expected to be \"easy.\" In reality, after crossing the beach, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of soft black volcanic ash.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 26\">Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 26</ref> This ash allowed for neither a secure footing nor the construction of [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb some of the [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] from Japanese artillery.<ref name=Allen/>\n\n{{quote|Marines were trained to move rapidly forward; here they could only plod. The weight and amount of equipment was a terrific hindrance and various items were rapidly discarded. First to go was the gas mask&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Wright, p. 26\"/>}}\n\nThe lack of a vigorous response led the Navy to conclude that their bombardment had suppressed the Japanese defenses and in good order the Marines began deployment to the Iwo Jima beach.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 26\"/> Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten, however. In the deathly silence, landed US Marines began to slowly inch their way forward inland, oblivious to the danger. After allowing the Americans to pile up men and machinery on the beach for just over an hour, Kuribayashi unleashed the undiminished force of his countermeasures. Shortly after 10:00, everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach, which was quickly transformed into a nightmarish bloodbath.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\n{{quote|At first it came as a ragged rattle of machine-gun bullets, growing gradually lower and fiercer until at last all the pent-up fury of a hundred hurricanes seemed to be breaking upon the heads of the Americans. Shells screeched and crashed, every hummock spat automatic fire and the very soft soil underfoot erupted underfoot with hundreds of exploding land mines&nbsp;... Marines walking erect crumpled and fell. Concussion lifted them and slammed them down, or tore them apart&nbsp;...<ref>Leckie, ''The Battle for Iwo Jima'', p. 28</ref>}}\n\n''Time-Life'' correspondent [[Robert Sherrod]] described it simply as \"a nightmare in hell.\"<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Japanese heavy artillery in Mount Suribachi opened their reinforced steel doors to fire, and then closed them immediately to prevent counterfire from the Marines and naval gunners. This made it difficult for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece.<ref name=Allen/> To make matters worse for the Americans, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with [[flamethrower]]s and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past the reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.<ref name=Allen/>\n\nIn response to the heavy resistance on the beach, the [[United States Army|Army's]] [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry Regiment]] was ordered to climb from landing craft with grappling hooks to scale a high ridge about {{convert|1.2|km|mi}} from [[Mount Suribachi]]. The mission was to fire on the enemy opposing the Marine landings on the beaches below and advance inland. They immediately found themselves in some of the fiercest fighting of the battle, and would engage in non-stop combat for 31 consecutive days.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestate.com/news/local/military/article14335403.html |title='We were receiving fire from everywhere' |website=The State |date=December 17, 2017 |first=Jeff |last=Wilkinson }}</ref>\n\n===Moving off the beaches===\n[[Amtrac]]s, unable to do more than uselessly churn the black ash, made no progress up the slopes; their Marine passengers had to dismount and slog forward on foot.<ref>Leckie, ''The Battle for Iwo Jima'', p. 25</ref> Men of the [[Seabee|Naval Construction Battalions]] 31 and 133, braving enemy fire, eventually were able to bulldoze roads off the beach. This allowed the Marines and equipment to finally make some progress inland and get off the jam-packed beaches. \"Even so, in virtually every shell hole there lay at least one dead Marine&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Wright, p. 32\">Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 32</ref>\n\nBy 11:30, some Marines had managed to reach the southern tip of Airfield No. 1, whose possession had been one of the (highly unrealistic) original American objectives for the first day. The Marines endured a fanatical 100-man charge by the Japanese, but were able to keep their toehold on Airfield No. 1 as night fell.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 32\"/>\n\n===Crossing the island===\nIn the left-most sector, the Americans did manage to achieve one of their objectives for the battle that day. Led by Col. [[Harry B. Liversedge|Harry B. \"Harry the Horse\" Liversedge]], the [[28th Marine Regiment|28th Marines]] drove across the island at its narrowest width, around {{convert|0.8|km|mi}}, thereby isolating the Japanese dug in on Mount Suribachi.\n\n===Action on the right flank===\nThe right-most landing area was dominated by Japanese positions at the Quarry. The [[25th Marine Regiment]] undertook a two-pronged attack to silence these guns. Their experience can be summarized by the ordeal of 2nd Lt. Benjamin Roselle, part of a ground team directing naval gunfire:\n\n{{quote|Within a minute a mortar shell exploded among the group&nbsp;... his left foot and ankle hung from his leg, held on by a ribbon of flesh&nbsp;... Within minutes a second round landed near him and fragments tore into his other leg. For nearly an hour he wondered where the next shell would land. He was soon to find out as a shell burst almost on top of him, wounding him for the third time in the shoulder. Almost at once another explosion bounced him several feet into the air and hot shards ripped into both thighs&nbsp;... as he lifted his arm to look at his watch a mortar shell exploded only feet away and blasted the watch from his wrist and tore a large jagged hole in his forearm: \"I was beginning to know what it must be like to be crucified,\" he was later to say.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 30\u201331</ref>}}\n\nThe [[25th Marine Regiment|25th Marines']] 3rd Battalion had landed approximately 900 men in the morning. Japanese resistance at the Quarry was so fierce that by nightfall only 150 Marines were left in fighting condition, an 83.3% casualty rate.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 31</ref>\n\nBy the evening, 30,000 Marines had landed. About 40,000 more would follow.<ref name=Allen/> Aboard the command ship ''Eldorado'', \"Howlin' Mad\" Smith saw the lengthy casualty reports and heard of the slow progress of the ground forces. To the war correspondents covering the operation he confessed, \"I don't know who he is, but the Japanese general running this show is one smart bastard.\"<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 33</ref>\n\n==Subsequent combat==\nIn the days after the landings, the Marines expected the usual Japanese [[Banzai charge|''banzai'' charge]] during the night. This had been the standard Japanese final defense strategy in previous battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific, such as during the [[Battle of Saipan]]. In those attacks, for which the Marines were prepared, the majority of the Japanese attackers had been killed and the Japanese strength greatly reduced. However, General Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden these \"[[human wave]]\" attacks by the Japanese infantrymen because he considered them to be futile.<ref name= Allen/>\n\nThe fighting on the beachhead at Iwo Jima was very fierce. The advance of the Marines was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery pieces. There, the Marines were ambushed by Japanese troops who occasionally sprang out of tunnels. At night, the Japanese left their defenses under cover of darkness to attack American foxholes, but U.S. Navy ships fired star shells to deny them the cover of darkness. On Iwo Jima (and other Japanese held islands), Japanese soldiers who knew English were used to harass and or deceive Marines in order to kill them if they could; they would yell \"corpsman\" pretending to be a wounded Marine, in order to lure in U.S. Navy medical corpsmen attached to Marine infantry companies.<ref name=Allen/>\n\nThe Marines learned that firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders and effectively used flamethrowers and grenades to flush out Japanese troops in the tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight [[M4 Sherman|Sherman M4A3R3]] medium tanks [[Flame tank|equipped with a flamethrower]] (\"Ronson\" or \"Zippo\" tanks), proved very effective at clearing Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, such that defenders were often compelled to assault them in the open, where they would fall victim to the superior numbers of Marines.<ref name=Allen/>\n\n[[Close air support]] was initially provided by fighters from [[escort carrier]]s off the coast. This shifted over to the [[15th Fighter Group]], flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares) which were used to light up the battlefield at night were initially provided by ships, shifting over later to landing force artillery. Navajo [[code talker]]s were part of the American ground communications, along with [[walkie-talkie]]s and [[SCR-610]] backpack radio sets.<ref name=Allen/>\n\nAfter running out of water, food and most supplies, the Japanese troops became desperate toward the end of the battle. Kuribayashi, who had argued against banzai attacks at the start of the battle, realized that defeat was imminent.\n\nMarines began to face increasing numbers of nighttime attacks; these were only repelled by a combination of machine-gun defensive positions and artillery support. At times, the Marines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to repel the Japanese attacks.<ref name=Allen/> With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore, and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death.<ref name=Allen/>\n\n==Raising the flag on Mt. Suribachi==\n{{Main|Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima}}\n[[File:Stars and Stripes on Mount Suribachi (Iwo Jima).jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. flag over Mount Suribachi]]\n[[File:3c-Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. postage stamp, 1945 issue, commemorating the Battle of Iwo Jima]]\n\n\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\" is a black and white photograph taken by [[Joe Rosenthal]] depicting six Marines from E Company, [[2nd Battalion 28th Marines|2nd Battalion, 28th Marines]], raising a [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945,<ref name=\"ap\"/> which was the second of two flag-raisings on the site that day. The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]] in the same year as its publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.<ref name=\"ap\"/> The flag raising picture was later used by [[Felix de Weldon]] to sculpt the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] which is located adjacent to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] since 1954.<ref name=\"ap\"/>\n\nThree of the six Marines depicted in the photograph, Sergeant [[Michael Strank]], Corporal [[Harlon Block]], and Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]], were killed in action days after the flag-raising. Surviving flag-raiser Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]], together with Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]] and [[Hospital corpsman|Navy corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], became celebrities upon their participation in a war bond selling tour after the battle; three subsequent Marine Corps investigations into the identities of the six men in the photograph determined: in 1946 and 1947, that [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] was incorrectly identified as being Harlon Block (both were killed six days after the photo was taken), in May and June 2016, that John Bradley was not in the photograph and Pfc.

The Marines knew that the Japanese defenders had an extensive network of below-ground defenses, and that in spite of its isolation above ground, the volcano was still connected to Japanese defenders via the tunnel network. They expected a fierce fight for the summit. Two small patrols from two rifle companies from the 2/28 Marines were sent up the volcano to reconnoiter routes on the mountain's north face. The recon patrols made it to the summit and scrambled down again, reporting any contact to the 2/28 Marines commander, Colonel Chandler Johnson.<ref name=Allen>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert E.|year=2004|title=The First Battalion of the 28th Marines on Iwo Jima: A Day-by-Day History from Personal Accounts and Official Reports, with Complete Muster Rolls|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0-7864-0560-0| oclc=41157682}}</ref> \n\nPopular accounts embroidered by the press in the aftermath of the release of the photo of the flag raising, had the Marines fighting all the way up to the summit. Although the Marine riflemen expected an ambush, the larger patrol going up afterwards encountered a few Japanese defenders once on top and after the flag was raised. The majority of the Japanese troops stayed in the tunnel network due to U.S. shelling, only occasionally attacking in small groups, and were generally all killed. Johnson called for a reinforced platoon size patrol from E Company to climb Suribachi and seize and occupy the crest. The patrol commander, 1st Lt. [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], was handed the battalion's American flag to be raised on top to signal Suribachi's capture, if they reached the summit. Johnson and the Marines anticipated heavy fighting, but the patrol encountered only a small amount of sniper fire on the way up the mountain. Once the top was secured by Schrier and his men, a length of Japanese water pipe was found there among the wreckage, and the American flag was attached to the pipe and then raised and planted on top of Mount Suribachi which became the first foreign flag to fly on Japanese soil.<ref name= LAT_20070626>{{cite news|access-date=30 November 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/26/local/me-lindberg26|title=Charles Lindberg, 86; Marine helped raise first U.S. flag over Iwo Jima|date=26 June 2007|page=B8|work=The Los Angeles Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022152425/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/26/local/me-lindberg26|archive-date=22 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Photographs of the flag and some of the patrol members around it were taken by Marine photographer [[Louis R. Lowery]], the only photographer who had accompanied Lt. Schrier's patrol up the mountain.\n\nAs the flag went up, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] had just landed on the beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Colonel Johnson, the battalion's commander, believed that the flag belonged to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, who had captured that section of the island. In the early afternoon, Johnson sent Pfc. Rene Gagnon, a runner (messenger) from his battalion for E Company, to take a larger flag up the volcano to replace the smaller and less visible flag. The replacement flag was attached to another and heavier section of water pipe and six Marines proceeded to raise it into place as the smaller flag was taken down and delivered to the battalion's headquarters down below. It was during this ''second'' flag-raising that Joseph Rosenthal took his exceptionally famous photograph ''Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima''. The second flag flew on Mount Suribachi until it was taken down on March 14, when at the same time an American flag was officially raised up a flagpole during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post near Mount Suribachi which was ordered by Lt. Gen. [[Holland Smith]] the commander of all the troops on Iwo Jima. Major General [[Graves B. Erskine]], the commander of the [[3rd Marine Division]] was also at the event with other troops of the division.\n\n==Northern Iwo Jima==\n[[File:Iwo Jima Tunnels.JPG|thumb|left|Sketch of Hill 362A, made by the 31st U.S. Naval Construction Battalion. Dotted lines show the Japanese tunnel system.]]\n\nDespite Japan's loss of Mount Suribachi on the south end of the island, the Japanese still held strong positions on the north end. The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi, which was much easier to hit with naval artillery fire.

The most arduous task left to the Marines was the overtaking of the Motoyama Plateau with its distinctive Hill 382 and Turkey knob and the area in between referred to as the Amphitheater. This formed the basis of what came to be known as the \"meatgrinder\". While this was being achieved on the right flank, the left was clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty. The overall objective at this point was to take control of Airfield No. 2 in the center of the island.

Consequently, General Erskine ordered the [[9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marine Regiment]] to attack under the cover of darkness with no preliminary barrage.

However, of the nearly 2,000 B-29s which landed from May-July 1945, more than 80% were for routine refueling.

All indications pointed to an American drive toward the [[Mariana Islands]] and the Carolines. To counter such an offensive, the IJA and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas, and thence to Japan via the [[Volcano Islands]], and westward from the Marianas via the Carolines and the [[Palau Islands]] to [[the Philippines]].\n\nIn March 1944, the [[Thirty-First Army (Japan)|Japanese 31st Army]], commanded by General [[Hideyoshi Obata]], was activated to garrison this inner line. (Note that a Japanese army was about the size of an American, [[British Army]], or [[Canadian Army]] [[corps]]. The Japanese Army had many [[Armies of the Imperial Japanese Army#Armies|armies]], but the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] only had [[Formations of the United States Army during World War II#Field Armies|ten]] at its peak, with the 4th Army, the 6th Army, the 8th Army, and the 10th Army being in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. Also, the 10th Army only fought on [[Okinawa]] in the spring of 1945.)\n\nThe commander of the Japanese garrison on [[Chichi Jima]] was placed nominally in command of Army and Navy units in the [[Volcano Islands]].<ref name=\"morison\"/> After the American conquest of the Marianas, daily bomber raids from the Marianas hit the mainland as part of [[Operation Scavenger]]. Iwo Jima served as an early warning station that radioed reports of incoming bombers back to mainland Japan. This allowed Japanese air defenses to prepare for the arrival of American bombers.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n\nAfter the U.S. seized bases in the Marshall Islands in the battles of [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] and [[Battle of Eniwetok|Eniwetok]] in February 1944, Japanese Army and Navy reinforcements were sent to Iwo Jima: 500 men from the naval base at [[Yokosuka]] and 500 from Chichi Jima reached Iwo Jima during March and April 1944. At the same time, with reinforcements arriving from Chichi Jima and the home islands, the Army garrison on Iwo Jima reached a strength of more than 5,000 men.<ref name= \"morison\"/> The loss of the Marianas during the summer of 1944 greatly increased the importance of the Volcano Islands for the Japanese, who were aware that the loss of these islands would facilitate American air raids against the Home Islands, disrupting war manufacturing and severely damaging civilian morale.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n\nFinal Japanese plans for the defense of the Volcano Islands were overshadowed by several factors:\n\n# The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had already lost almost all of its power, and it could not prevent American landings.\n# Aircraft losses in 1944 had been so heavy that, even if war production were not affected by American air attacks, combined Japanese air strength was not expected to increase to 3,000 [[warplane]]s until March or April 1945.\n# These aircraft could not be used from bases in the Home Islands against Iwo Jima because their range was not more than {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n# Available warplanes had to be hoarded to defend [[Taiwan]] and the [[Japan|Japanese Home Islands]] from any attack.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n# There was a serious shortage of properly trained and experienced [[aviator|pilots]] and other aircrew to man the warplanes Japan had because such large numbers of pilots and crewmen had perished fighting over the [[Solomon Islands]] and during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944.\n\nIn a postwar study, Japanese staff officers described the strategy that was used in the defense of Iwo Jima in the following terms:\n\n{{quotation|In the light of the above situation, seeing that it was impossible to conduct our air, sea, and ground/ operations on Iwo Island [Jima] toward ultimate victory, it was decided that to gain time necessary for the preparation of the Homeland defense, our forces should rely solely upon the established defensive equipment in that area, checking the enemy by delaying tactics. Even the [[kamikaze|suicidal attacks]] by small groups of our Army and Navy airplanes, the surprise attacks by our [[submarine]]s, and the actions of parachute units, although effective, could be regarded only as a strategical ruse on our part. It was a most depressing thought that we had no available means left for the exploitation of the strategical opportunities which might from time to time occur in the course of these operations.<ref>USA, FEC, HistDiv, \"Operations in the Central Pacific\" \u2013 Japanese Studies in World War II (Japanese Monograph No. 48, OCMH), p. 62.; cited in George W.

Iwo Jima was strategically important: it provided an [[air base]] for Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighter planes]] to intercept long-range [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] bombers, and it provided a haven for Japanese naval units in dire need of any support available. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage [[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands|air attacks on the Mariana Islands]] from November 1944 through January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate these problems and provide a staging area for [[Operation Downfall]]\u2014the eventual invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The distance of B-29 raids could (hypothetically) be cut in half, and a base would be available for [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighters to escort and protect the bombers.<ref name=\"morison\"/>\n\nAmerican intelligence sources were confident that Iwo Jima would fall in one week. In light of the optimistic intelligence reports, the decision was made to invade Iwo Jima and the operation was given the code name Operation Detachment.<ref name=\"morison\"/> American forces were unaware that the Japanese were preparing a complex and deep defense, radically departing from their usual strategy of a beach defense. So successful was the Japanese preparation that it was discovered after the battle that the hundreds of tons of Allied bombs and thousands of rounds of heavy naval gunfire had left the Japanese defenders almost undamaged and ready to inflict losses on the U.S. Marines.\n\n==Planning and preparation==\n{{Main|Planning for the Battle of Iwo Jima}}\n\n===Japanese preparations===\n[[File:Tadamichi Kuribayashi.jpg|upright|thumb|Lieut. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi]]\nBy June 1944, Lieutenant General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] was assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi knew that Japan could not win the battle, but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces, so that the United States and its Australian and British allies would reconsider carrying out [[Operation Downfall|the invasion of Japan Home Islands]].\n\nWhile drawing inspiration from the defense in the [[Battle of Peleliu]], Kuribayashi designed a defense that broke with Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establishing his defenses on the beach to face the landings directly, he created strong, mutually supporting [[defense in depth|defenses in depth]] using static and heavy weapons such as heavy [[machine gun]]s and artillery. [[Takeichi Nishi]]'s armored [[tank]]s were to be used as camouflaged artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking the mountain to the main forces was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around [[Mount Suribachi]] as a semi-independent sector, with his main defensive zone built up in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment further prompted the creation of an extensive system of tunnels that connected the prepared positions, so that a [[pillbox (military)|pillbox]] that had been cleared could be reoccupied. This network of [[bunker]]s and pillboxes favored the defense. For instance, The Nano Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water, and ammunition for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline-powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Tomb Called Iwo Jima|last=King|first=Dan|publisher=Pacific Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1500343385|location=|pages=58\u201359|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nBy February 19, 1945, the day the Americans invaded, {{convert|18|km|mi}} of a planned {{convert|27|km|mi}} of tunnel network had been dug.

Kuribayashi specially engineered the defenses so that every part of Iwo Jima was subject to Japanese defensive fire. He also received a handful of ''[[kamikaze]]'' pilots to use against the enemy fleet. Three hundred and eighteen American sailors were killed by ''kamikaze'' attacks during the battle. However, against his wishes, Kuribayashi's superiors on [[Honshu]] ordered him to erect some beach defenses.\n\n===American preparations===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=Well, this will be easy.

On 17 February, the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Blessman|DE-69|6}} sent [[Underwater Demolition Team]] 15 (UDT-15) toward Blue Beach for reconnaissance. The Japanese [[infantry]] fired on them, killing one American diver. On the evening of 18 February, the ''Blessman'' was hit by a bomb from a Japanese aircraft, killing 40 sailors, including 15 members of her UDT.\n\nUnaware of Kuribayashi's tunnel defense system, many of the Americans assumed the majority of the Japanese garrison were killed by the constant bombing raids.\n\n===Pre-landing bombardment===\n[[File:USS New York-11.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|New York|BB-34|6}} firing its {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} main guns on the island, 16 February 1945 (D minus 3)]]\nMaj. Gen. [[Harry Schmidt (USMC)|Harry Schmidt]], commander of the Marine landing force, requested a 10-day heavy shelling of the island immediately preceding the mid-February [[amphibious assault]]. However, Rear Adm. [[William H. P. Blandy]], commander of the Amphibious Support Force (Task Force 52), did not believe such a bombardment would allow him time to replenish his ships' ammunition before the landings; he thus refused Schmidt's request. Schmidt then asked for nine days of shelling; Blandy again refused and agreed to a three-day bombardment. This decision left much hard feeling among the Marines. After the war, Lieut. Gen. [[Holland Smith|Holland M. \"Howlin' Mad\" Smith]], commander Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56, which consisted of Schmidt's Fifth Amphibious Corps), bitterly complained that the lack of naval gunfire had cost Marine lives during the entire Allied island campaign.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 22</ref>\n\nEach heavy [[warship]] was given an area on which to fire that, combined with all the ships, covered the entire island. Each warship fired for approximately six hours before stopping for a certain amount of time. Poor weather on D minus 3 led to uncertain results for that day's bombardment. On D minus 2, the time and care that the Japanese had taken in preparing their artillery positions became clear. When [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Pensacola|CA-24|6}} got within range of shore batteries, the ship was quickly hit 6 times and suffered 17 crew deaths. Later, 12 small craft attempting to land an [[underwater demolition team]] were all struck by Japanese rounds and quickly retired. While aiding these vessels, the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Leutze|DD-481|6}} was also hit and suffered 7 crew deaths. On D minus 1, Adm. Blandy's gunners were once again hampered by rain and clouds. Gen. Schmidt summed up his feelings by saying, \"We only got about 13 hours worth of fire support during the 34 hours of available daylight.\"<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThe limited bombardment had questionable impact on the enemy due to the Japanese being heavily dug-in and fortified.

Mitscher's]] Task Force 58, a huge carrier force, arrived off Iwo Jima. Also in this flotilla was Adm. [[Raymond A. Spruance]], overall commander for the invasion, in his flagship, the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS |Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}. \"Howlin' Mad\" Smith was once again deeply frustrated that Mitscher's powerful carrier group had been bombing the Japanese home islands instead of softening up the defenses of Iwo Jima. Mitscher's fliers did contribute to the additional surface-ship bombardment that accompanied the formation of the amphibious craft.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 23\">Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 23</ref>\n\nUnlike the days of the pre-landing bombardment, D-Day dawned clear and bright.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 23\"/> At 08:59, one minute ahead of schedule, the first wave of Marines landed on the beaches of the southeastern coast of Iwo Jima. Major Howard Connor, [[5th Marine Division]] signal officer, had six [[Navajo code talkers]] working around the clock during the first two days of the battle. These six sent and received over 800 messages, all without error. Connor later stated, \"Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.\"<ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html \"Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104121421/https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html |date=4 November 2017 }}. [[Naval Historical Center]]. 1992. Retrieved 2014-03-12.</ref>\n\n===Situation on the beaches===\nUnfortunately for the landing force, the planners at Pearl Harbor had completely misjudged the situation that would face Gen. Schmidt's Marines. The beaches had been described as \"excellent\" and the thrust inland was expected to be \"easy.\" In reality, after crossing the beach, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of soft black volcanic ash.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 26\">Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 26</ref> This ash allowed for neither a secure footing nor the construction of [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb some of the [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] from Japanese artillery.<ref name=Allen/>\n\n{{quote|Marines were trained to move rapidly forward; here they could only plod. The weight and amount of equipment was a terrific hindrance and various items were rapidly discarded. First to go was the gas mask&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Wright, p. 26\"/>}}\n\nThe lack of a vigorous response led the Navy to conclude that their bombardment had suppressed the Japanese defenses and in good order the Marines began deployment to the Iwo Jima beach.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 26\"/> Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten, however. In the deathly silence, landed US Marines began to slowly inch their way forward inland, oblivious to the danger. After allowing the Americans to pile up men and machinery on the beach for just over an hour, Kuribayashi unleashed the undiminished force of his countermeasures. Shortly after 10:00, everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach, which was quickly transformed into a nightmarish bloodbath.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\n{{quote|At first it came as a ragged rattle of machine-gun bullets, growing gradually lower and fiercer until at last all the pent-up fury of a hundred hurricanes seemed to be breaking upon the heads of the Americans. Shells screeched and crashed, every hummock spat automatic fire and the very soft soil underfoot erupted underfoot with hundreds of exploding land mines&nbsp;... Marines walking erect crumpled and fell. Concussion lifted them and slammed them down, or tore them apart&nbsp;...<ref>Leckie, ''The Battle for Iwo Jima'', p. 28</ref>}}\n\n''Time-Life'' correspondent [[Robert Sherrod]] described it simply as \"a nightmare in hell.\"<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Japanese heavy artillery in Mount Suribachi opened their reinforced steel doors to fire, and then closed them immediately to prevent counterfire from the Marines and naval gunners. This made it difficult for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece.<ref name=Allen/> To make matters worse for the Americans, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with [[flamethrower]]s and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past the reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.<ref name=Allen/>\n\nIn response to the heavy resistance on the beach, the [[United States Army|Army's]] [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry Regiment]] was ordered to climb from landing craft with grappling hooks to scale a high ridge about {{convert|1.2|km|mi}} from [[Mount Suribachi]]. The mission was to fire on the enemy opposing the Marine landings on the beaches below and advance inland. They immediately found themselves in some of the fiercest fighting of the battle, and would engage in non-stop combat for 31 consecutive days.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestate.com/news/local/military/article14335403.html |title='We were receiving fire from everywhere' |website=The State |date=December 17, 2017 |first=Jeff |last=Wilkinson }}</ref>\n\n===Moving off the beaches===\n[[Amtrac]]s, unable to do more than uselessly churn the black ash, made no progress up the slopes; their Marine passengers had to dismount and slog forward on foot.<ref>Leckie, ''The Battle for Iwo Jima'', p. 25</ref> Men of the [[Seabee|Naval Construction Battalions]] 31 and 133, braving enemy fire, eventually were able to bulldoze roads off the beach. This allowed the Marines and equipment to finally make some progress inland and get off the jam-packed beaches. \"Even so, in virtually every shell hole there lay at least one dead Marine&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Wright, p. 32\">Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 32</ref>\n\nBy 11:30, some Marines had managed to reach the southern tip of Airfield No. 1, whose possession had been one of the (highly unrealistic) original American objectives for the first day. The Marines endured a fanatical 100-man charge by the Japanese, but were able to keep their toehold on Airfield No. 1 as night fell.<ref name=\"Wright, p. 32\"/>\n\n===Crossing the island===\nIn the left-most sector, the Americans did manage to achieve one of their objectives for the battle that day. Led by Col. [[Harry B. Liversedge|Harry B. \"Harry the Horse\" Liversedge]], the [[28th Marine Regiment|28th Marines]] drove across the island at its narrowest width, around {{convert|0.8|km|mi}}, thereby isolating the Japanese dug in on Mount Suribachi.\n\n===Action on the right flank===\nThe right-most landing area was dominated by Japanese positions at the Quarry. The [[25th Marine Regiment]] undertook a two-pronged attack to silence these guns. Their experience can be summarized by the ordeal of 2nd Lt. Benjamin Roselle, part of a ground team directing naval gunfire:\n\n{{quote|Within a minute a mortar shell exploded among the group&nbsp;... his left foot and ankle hung from his leg, held on by a ribbon of flesh&nbsp;... Within minutes a second round landed near him and fragments tore into his other leg. For nearly an hour he wondered where the next shell would land. He was soon to find out as a shell burst almost on top of him, wounding him for the third time in the shoulder. Almost at once another explosion bounced him several feet into the air and hot shards ripped into both thighs&nbsp;... as he lifted his arm to look at his watch a mortar shell exploded only feet away and blasted the watch from his wrist and tore a large jagged hole in his forearm: \"I was beginning to know what it must be like to be crucified,\" he was later to say.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 30\u201331</ref>}}\n\nThe [[25th Marine Regiment|25th Marines']] 3rd Battalion had landed approximately 900 men in the morning. Japanese resistance at the Quarry was so fierce that by nightfall only 150 Marines were left in fighting condition, an 83.3% casualty rate.<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 31</ref>\n\nBy the evening, 30,000 Marines had landed. About 40,000 more would follow.<ref name=Allen/> Aboard the command ship ''Eldorado'', \"Howlin' Mad\" Smith saw the lengthy casualty reports and heard of the slow progress of the ground forces. To the war correspondents covering the operation he confessed, \"I don't know who he is, but the Japanese general running this show is one smart bastard.\"<ref>Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 33</ref>\n\n==Subsequent combat==\nIn the days after the landings, the Marines expected the usual Japanese [[Banzai charge|''banzai'' charge]] during the night. This had been the standard Japanese final defense strategy in previous battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific, such as during the [[Battle of Saipan]]. In those attacks, for which the Marines were prepared, the majority of the Japanese attackers had been killed and the Japanese strength greatly reduced. However, General Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden these \"[[human wave]]\" attacks by the Japanese infantrymen because he considered them to be futile.<ref name= Allen/>\n\nThe fighting on the beachhead at Iwo Jima was very fierce. The advance of the Marines was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery pieces. There, the Marines were ambushed by Japanese troops who occasionally sprang out of tunnels. At night, the Japanese left their defenses under cover of darkness to attack American foxholes, but U.S. Navy ships fired star shells to deny them the cover of darkness. On Iwo Jima (and other Japanese held islands), Japanese soldiers who knew English were used to harass and or deceive Marines in order to kill them if they could; they would yell \"corpsman\" pretending to be a wounded Marine, in order to lure in U.S. Navy medical corpsmen attached to Marine infantry companies.<ref name=Allen/>\n\nThe Marines learned that firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders and effectively used flamethrowers and grenades to flush out Japanese troops in the tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight [[M4 Sherman|Sherman M4A3R3]] medium tanks [[Flame tank|equipped with a flamethrower]] (\"Ronson\" or \"Zippo\" tanks), proved very effective at clearing Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, such that defenders were often compelled to assault them in the open, where they would fall victim to the superior numbers of Marines.<ref name=Allen/>\n\n[[Close air support]] was initially provided by fighters from [[escort carrier]]s off the coast. This shifted over to the [[15th Fighter Group]], flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares) which were used to light up the battlefield at night were initially provided by ships, shifting over later to landing force artillery. Navajo [[code talker]]s were part of the American ground communications, along with [[walkie-talkie]]s and [[SCR-610]] backpack radio sets.<ref name=Allen/>\n\nAfter running out of water, food and most supplies, the Japanese troops became desperate toward the end of the battle. Kuribayashi, who had argued against banzai attacks at the start of the battle, realized that defeat was imminent.\n\nMarines began to face increasing numbers of nighttime attacks; these were only repelled by a combination of machine-gun defensive positions and artillery support. At times, the Marines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to repel the Japanese attacks.<ref name=Allen/> With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore, and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death.<ref name=Allen/>\n\n==Raising the flag on Mt. Suribachi==\n{{Main|Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima}}\n[[File:Stars and Stripes on Mount Suribachi (Iwo Jima).jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. flag over Mount Suribachi]]\n[[File:3c-Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. postage stamp, 1945 issue, commemorating the Battle of Iwo Jima]]\n\n\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\" is a black and white photograph taken by [[Joe Rosenthal]] depicting six Marines from E Company, [[2nd Battalion 28th Marines|2nd Battalion, 28th Marines]], raising a [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945,<ref name=\"ap\"/> which was the second of two flag-raisings on the site that day. The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]] in the same year as its publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.<ref name=\"ap\"/> The flag raising picture was later used by [[Felix de Weldon]] to sculpt the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] which is located adjacent to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] since 1954.<ref name=\"ap\"/>\n\nThree of the six Marines depicted in the photograph, Sergeant [[Michael Strank]], Corporal [[Harlon Block]], and Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]], were killed in action days after the flag-raising. Surviving flag-raiser Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]], together with Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]] and [[Hospital corpsman|Navy corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], became celebrities upon their participation in a war bond selling tour after the battle; three subsequent Marine Corps investigations into the identities of the six men in the photograph determined: in 1946 and 1947, that [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] was incorrectly identified as being Harlon Block (both were killed six days after the photo was taken), in May and June 2016, that John Bradley was not in the photograph and Pfc.

The Marines knew that the Japanese defenders had an extensive network of below-ground defenses, and that in spite of its isolation above ground, the volcano was still connected to Japanese defenders via the tunnel network. They expected a fierce fight for the summit. Two small patrols from two rifle companies from the 2/28 Marines were sent up the volcano to reconnoiter routes on the mountain's north face. The recon patrols made it to the summit and scrambled down again, reporting any contact to the 2/28 Marines commander, Colonel Chandler Johnson.<ref name=Allen>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert E.|year=2004|title=The First Battalion of the 28th Marines on Iwo Jima: A Day-by-Day History from Personal Accounts and Official Reports, with Complete Muster Rolls|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0-7864-0560-0| oclc=41157682}}</ref> \n\nPopular accounts embroidered by the press in the aftermath of the release of the photo of the flag raising, had the Marines fighting all the way up to the summit. Although the Marine riflemen expected an ambush, the larger patrol going up afterwards encountered a few Japanese defenders once on top and after the flag was raised. The majority of the Japanese troops stayed in the tunnel network due to U.S. shelling, only occasionally attacking in small groups, and were generally all killed. Johnson called for a reinforced platoon size patrol from E Company to climb Suribachi and seize and occupy the crest. The patrol commander, 1st Lt. [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], was handed the battalion's American flag to be raised on top to signal Suribachi's capture, if they reached the summit. Johnson and the Marines anticipated heavy fighting, but the patrol encountered only a small amount of sniper fire on the way up the mountain. Once the top was secured by Schrier and his men, a length of Japanese water pipe was found there among the wreckage, and the American flag was attached to the pipe and then raised and planted on top of Mount Suribachi which became the first foreign flag to fly on Japanese soil.<ref name= LAT_20070626>{{cite news|access-date=30 November 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/26/local/me-lindberg26|title=Charles Lindberg, 86; Marine helped raise first U.S. flag over Iwo Jima|date=26 June 2007|page=B8|work=The Los Angeles Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022152425/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/26/local/me-lindberg26|archive-date=22 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Photographs of the flag and some of the patrol members around it were taken by Marine photographer [[Louis R. Lowery]], the only photographer who had accompanied Lt. Schrier's patrol up the mountain.\n\nAs the flag went up, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] had just landed on the beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Colonel Johnson, the battalion's commander, believed that the flag belonged to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, who had captured that section of the island. In the early afternoon, Johnson sent Pfc.

The replacement flag was attached to another and heavier section of water pipe and six Marines proceeded to raise it into place as the smaller flag was taken down and delivered to the battalion's headquarters down below. It was during this ''second'' flag-raising that Joseph Rosenthal took his exceptionally famous photograph ''Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima''. The second flag flew on Mount Suribachi until it was taken down on March 14, when at the same time an American flag was officially raised up a flagpole during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post near Mount Suribachi which was ordered by Lt. Gen. [[Holland Smith]] the commander of all the troops on Iwo Jima. Major General [[Graves B. Erskine]], the commander of the [[3rd Marine Division]] was also at the event with other troops of the division.\n\n==Northern Iwo Jima==\n[[File:Iwo Jima Tunnels.JPG|thumb|left|Sketch of Hill 362A, made by the 31st U.S. Naval Construction Battalion.

The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi, which was much easier to hit with naval artillery fire. Coupled with this, the fortifications constructed by Kuribayashi were more impressive than at the southern end of the island.<ref name=\"Wheeler 1979\">{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Wheeler |title=The Road to Tokyo |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1979 |location=Alexandria, VA |page=50 |isbn=0-8094-2540-8 }}</ref> Remaining under the command of Kuribayashi was the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, and two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions. There were also about 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. The most arduous task left to the Marines was the overtaking of the Motoyama Plateau with its distinctive Hill 382 and Turkey knob and the area in between referred to as the Amphitheater. This formed the basis of what came to be known as the \"meatgrinder\". While this was being achieved on the right flank, the left was clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty. The overall objective at this point was to take control of Airfield No. 2 in the center of the island. However, every \"penetration seemed to become a disaster\" as \"units were raked from the flanks, chewed up, and sometimes wiped out.

It was observed that during bombardments, the Japanese would hide their guns and themselves in the caves only to reappear when the troops would advance and lay devastating fire on them. The Japanese had over time learned basic American strategy, which was to lay heavy bombardment before an infantry attack. Consequently, General Erskine ordered the [[9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marine Regiment]] to attack under the cover of darkness with no preliminary barrage.

However, of the nearly 2,000 B-29s which landed from May-July 1945, more than 80% were for routine refueling.

Mounted on an inside superstructure are about 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes that detect light from [[Cherenkov radiation]].

This creates a cone of light known as [[Cherenkov radiation]], which is the optical equivalent to a [[sonic boom]]. The Cherenkov light is projected as a ring on the wall of the detector and recorded by the PMTs. Using the timing and charge information recorded by each PMT, the interaction vertex, ring direction and flavor of the incoming neutrino is determined. From the sharpness of the edge of the ring the type of particle can be inferred. The [[scattering|multiple scattering]] of electrons is large, so electromagnetic showers produce fuzzy rings. Highly [[special relativity|relativistic]] [[muon]]s, in contrast, travel almost straight through the detector and produce rings with sharp edges.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Kamiokande89.JPG|thumb|right|A model of KamiokaNDE]]\nConstruction of the predecessor of the present [[Kamioka Observatory]], the [[Institute for Cosmic Ray Research]], [[University of Tokyo]] began in 1982 and was completed in April 1983. The purpose of the observatory was to detect whether [[proton decay]] exists, one of the most fundamental questions of elementary particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html|title=\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30da\u30fc\u30b8 - Kamioka Observatory, ICRR, University of Tokyo|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/|title=Physics Home|author=|date=|website=www.phys.washington.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/gallery/index-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Photo Gallery|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cause-committee/1st/report-nov22e.pdf|title=Official report on the accident (in PDF format)|author=|date=|website=u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000327|title=Logbook entry of first neutrinos seen at Super-K generated at KEK|author=|date=|website=symmetrymagazine.org}}</ref>\n\nThe detector, named KamiokaNDE for Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment, was a [[chemical tank|tank]] {{Convert|16.0|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and {{Convert|15.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in width, containing 3,048 metric tons (3,000 tons) of pure water and about 1,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) attached to its inner surface. The detector was upgraded, starting in 1985, to allow it to observe solar neutrinos. As a result, the detector (KamiokaNDE-II) had become sensitive enough to detect neutrinos from [[SN 1987A]], a [[supernova]] which was observed in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] in February 1987, and to observe solar neutrinos in 1988. The ability of the Kamiokande experiment to observe the direction of electrons produced in solar neutrino [[elastic scattering|interactions]] allowed experimenters to directly demonstrate for the first time that the sun was a source of neutrinos.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande project was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture in 1991 for total funding of approximately $100 M. The US portion of the proposal, which was primarily to build the OD system, was approved by the US Department of Energy in 1993 for $3 M. In addition the US has also contributed about 2000 20&nbsp;cm PMTs recycled from the [[Irvine\u2013Michigan\u2013Brookhaven (detector)|IMB experiment]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDespite successes in [[neutrino astronomy]] and neutrino astrophysics, Kamiokande did not achieve its primary goal, the detection of proton decay. Higher sensitivity was also necessary to obtain high statistical confidence in its results. This led to the construction of Super-Kamiokande, with fifteen times the water and ten times as many PMTs as Kamiokande. Super-Kamiokande started operation in 1996.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande Collaboration announced the first evidence of [[neutrino oscillation]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fukuda, Y. | display-authors = etal | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 81 | issue = 8 | pages = 1562\u20131567 | date = 1998 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1562 | title = Evidence for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos | arxiv = hep-ex/9807003 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.1562F }}</ref> This was the first experimental observation supporting the theory that the neutrino has non-zero [[mass]], a possibility that theorists had speculated about for years. The 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to Super-Kamiokande researcher [[Takaaki Kajita]] alongside [[Arthur B. McDonald|Arthur McDonald]] for their work on neutrino oscillations.\n\nOn 12 November 2001, about 6,600 of the photomultiplier tubes (costing about $3000 each<ref>{{cite web|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/accident-grounds-neutrino-lab/|title=Accident grounds neutrino lab|author=|date=|website=physicsworld.com}}</ref>) in the Super-Kamiokande detector [[Implosion (mechanical process)|imploded]], apparently in a [[chain reaction]] or [[cascading failure]], as the [[shock wave]] from the concussion of each imploding tube cracked its neighbours. The detector was partially restored by redistributing the photomultiplier tubes which did not implode, and by adding protective [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] shells that are hoped will prevent another chain reaction from recurring (Super-Kamiokande-II).\n\nIn July 2005, preparations began to restore the detector to its original form by reinstalling about 6,000 PMTs. The work was completed in June 2006, whereupon the detector was renamed Super-Kamiokande-III. This phase of the experiment collected data from October 2006 till August 2008. At that time, significant upgrades were made to the electronics. After the upgrade, the new phase of the experiment has been referred to as Super-Kamiokande-IV. SK-IV collected data on various natural sources of neutrinos, as well as acted as the far detector for the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.\n\nSK-IV continued until June 2018. After that, the detector underwent a full refurbishment during Autumn of 2018. On 29 January 2019 the detector resumed data-taking.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00440-2|pmid = 30728526| title=Neutrino hunt resumes, ITER's new confidence and Elsevier's woes| journal=Nature| volume=566| issue=7742| pages=12\u201313| year=2019| bibcode=2019Natur.566...12.}}</ref>\n\n==Detector==\nThe Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a Cherenkov detector used to study neutrinos from different sources including the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and accelerators. It is also used to search for proton decay. The experiment began in April 1996 and was shut down for maintenance in July 2001, a period known as \"SK-I\". Since an accident occurred during maintenance, the experiment resumed in October 2002 with only half of its original number of ID-PMTs.  In order to prevent further accidents, all of the ID-PMTs were covered by fiber-reinforced plastic with acrylic front windows. This phase from October 2002 to another closure for an entire reconstruction in October 2005 is called \"SK-II\". In July 2006, the experiment resumed with the full number of PMTs and stopped in September 2008 for electronics upgrades. This period was known as \"SK-III\". The period after 2008 is known as \"SK-IV\".

Beta decay in the Earth and in supernovas turns neutrons into protons with the emission of anti-neutrinos. The Super-Kamiokande detects electrons knocked off a water molecule producing a flash of blue Cherenkov light, and these are produced both by neutrinos and antineutrinos.  A rarer instance is when an antineutrino interacts with a proton in water to produce a neutron and a positron.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Castelvecchi|first=Davide|date=2019-02-27|title=Gigantic Japanese detector prepares to catch neutrinos from supernovae|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=566|issue=7745|pages=438\u2013439|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00598-9}}</ref>\n\nGadolinium has an affinity for neutrons and produces a bright flash of gamma rays when it absorbs one. Adding gadolinium to the Super-Kamiokande allows it to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Antineutrinos produce a double flash of light about 30 microseconds apart, first when the neutrino hits a proton and second when gadolinium absorbs a neutron.<ref name=\":0\" /> The brightness of the first flash allows physicists to distinguish between low energy antineutrinos from the Earth and high energy antineutrinos from supernovas. In addition to observing neutrinos from distant supernovas, the Super-Kamiokande will be able to set off an alarm to inform astronomers around the world of the presence of a supernova in the Milky Way within one second of it occurring.\n\nThe biggest challenge was whether the detector's water could be continuously filtered to remove impurities without removing the gadolinium at the same time. A 200-ton prototype called EGADS with added gadolinium sulfate was installed in the Kamioka mine and operated for years. It finished operation in 2018 and showed that the new water purification system would remove impurities while keeping the gadolinium concentration stable. It also showed that gadolinium sulfate would not significantly impair the transparency of the otherwise ultrapure water, or cause corrosion or deposition on existing equipment or on the new valves that will later be installed in the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Water tank===\nThe outer shell of the water tank is a cylindrical stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The tank is self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the tank is filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 ktons of water.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |volume=51 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |author1=S.

Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames are connected to each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected to the bottom of the tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, supermodules simplified the initial assembly of the ID. Each supermodule was assembled on the tank floor and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with supermodules. During installation, ID PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.[[File:The PMTs used in Super-Kamiokande.gif|thumb|right|Schematic view of a 50 cm PMT.]]\n\nCables from each group of 3 PMTs are bundled together. All cables run up the outer surface of the PMT support structure, i.e., on the OD PMT plane, pass through cable ports at the top of the tank, and are then routed into the electronics huts.\n\nThe thickness of the OD varies slightly, but is on average about 2.6 m on top and bottom, and 2.7 m on the barrel wall, giving the OD a total mass of 18 kilotons. OD PMTs were distributed with 302 on the top layer, 308 on the bottom, and 1275 on the barrel wall.\n\nTo protect against low energy background from radon decay products in the air, the roof of the cavity and the access tunnels were sealed with a coating called Mineguard. Mineguard is a spray-applied polyurethane membrane developed for use as a rock support system and radon gas barrier in the mining industry.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe average geomagnetic field is about 450 mG and is inclined by about 45\u00b0 with respect to the horizon at the detector site. This presents a problem for the large and very sensitive PMTs which prefer a much lower ambient field. The strength and uniform direction of the geomagnetic field could systematically bias photoelectron trajectories and timing in the PMTs. To counteract this 26 sets of horizontal and vertical Helmholtz coils are arranged around the inner surfaces of the tank. With these in operation the average field in the detector is reduced to about 50 mG. The magnetic field at various PMT locations were measured before the tank was filled with water.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nA standard fiducial volume of approximately 22.5 ktons is defined as the region inside a surface drawn 2.00 m from the ID wall to minimize the anomalous response causing by natural radioactivity in the surrounding rock.\n\n==Monitoring system==\n\n===Online monitoring system===\nAn online monitor computer located in the control room reads data from the DAQ host computer via an FDDI link. It provides shift operators with a flexible tool for selecting event display features, makes online and recent-history histograms to monitor detector performance, and performs a variety of additional tasks needed to efficiently monitor status and diagnose detector and DAQ problems. Events in the data stream can be skimmed off and elementary analysis tools can be applied to check data quality during calibrations or after changes in hardware or online software.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Realtime supernova monitor===\nTo detect and identify such bursts as efficiently and promptly as possible Super-Kamiokande is equipped with an online supernova monitor system. About 10,000 total events are expected in Super-Kamiokande for a supernova explosion at the center of our Galaxy. Super-Kamiokande can measure a burst with no dead-time, up to 30,000 events within the first second of a burst. Theoretical calculations of supernova explosions suggest that neutrinos are emitted over a total time-scale of tens of seconds with about a half of them emitted during the first one or two seconds. The Super-K will search for event clusters in specified time windows of 0.5, 2 and 10 s.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Data are transmitted to realtime SN-watch analysis process every 2 min and analysis is completed typically in 1 min. When supernova (SN) event candidates are found, <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is calculated if the event multiplicity is larger than 16, where <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is defined as the average spatial distance between events, i.e.\n\n<math>{R_\\text{mean}} =\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}} |{r_\\text{i}}-{r_\\text{j}}|} {{N_\\text{nulti}} {C_\\text{2}}}</math>\n\nNeutrinos from supernovae interact with free protons, producing positrons which are distributed so uniformly in the detector that <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> for SN events should be significantly larger than for ordinary spatial clusters of events. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, Rmean for uniformly distributed Monte Carlo events shows that no tail exists below <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7d1000&nbsp;cm. For the \u201calarm\u201d class of burst, the events are required to have <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e900&nbsp;cm for 25\u2a7d<math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>\u2a7d40 or <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e750&nbsp;cm for <math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>>40.

If the burst candidate passes these checks, the data will be reanalyzed using an offline process and a final decision will be made within a few hours. During the Super-Kamiokande I running, this never occurred.\nOne of the important capabilities for [Super-Kamiokande] is to reconstruct the direction to supernova. By neutrino\u2013electron scattering, <math>\\nu_\\text{x} + e^- \\to \\nu_\\text{x} + e^-</math>, a total of 100\u2013150 events are expected in case of a supernova at the center of our Galaxy.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The direction to supernova can be measured with angular resolution\n\n<math>\\delta \\theta \\sim {30^\\circ \\over \\sqrt{N}}</math>\n\nwhere N is the number of events produced by the \u03bd\u2013e scattering. The angular resolution, therefore, can be as good as \u03b4\u03b8\u223c3\u00b0 for a supernova at the center of our Galaxy.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this case, not only time profile and the energy spectrum of a neutrino burst, but also the information on direction of supernova can be provided.\n\n===Slow control monitor and offline process monitor===\nThere is a process called the \u201cslow control\u201d monitor, as part of the online monitoring system, watches the status of the HV systems, the temperatures of electronics crates and the status of the compensating coils used to cancel the geomagnetic field. When any deviation from norms is detected, it will alert physicists to prompt to investigate, take appropriate action, or notify experts.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nTo monitor and control the offline processes that analyze and transfer data, a set of software was sophisticatedly developed. This monitor allows non-expert shift physicists to identify and repair common problems to minimize down time, and the software package was a significant contribution to the smooth operation of the experiment and its overall high lifetime efficiency for data taking.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Research==\n\n===Solar neutrino===\n{{See also|Neutrino Oscillation}}\nThe energy of the Sun comes from the nuclear fusion in its core where a helium atom and an electron neutrino are generated by 4 protons. These neutrinos emitted from this reaction are called solar neutrinos. Photons, created by the nuclear fusion in the center of the Sun, take millions of years to reach the surface; on the other hand, solar neutrinos arrive at the earth in eight minutes due to their lack of interactions with matter. Hence, solar neutrinos make it possible for us to observe the inner Sun in \"real-time\" that takes millions of years for visible light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/solarnu-intro-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the Super-Kamiokande detected strong evidence of neutrino oscillation that successfully explained the [[solar neutrino problem]]. The Sun and about 80% of the visible stars produce their energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via\n\n<math>4p \\to {}^4\\!He + 2e^+ + 2 \\nu_e + 26.73</math> MeV\n\nConsequently, stars are a source of neutrinos, including our [[Sun]]. These neutrinos primarily come through the pp-chain in lower masses, and for cooler stars, primarily through CNO-chains of heavier masses.[[File:Pp-chain and CNO chain.jpg|thumb|right|The left frame shows the three principal cycles comprising the pp chain (ppI, ppII, and ppIII), the neutrinos sources associated with these cycles. The right frame shows the CN I cycle.]]\nIn the early 1990s, particularly with the uncertainties that accompanied the initial results from Kamioka II and the Ga experiments, no individual experiment required a non-astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem. But in aggregate, the Cl, Kamioka II, and Ga experiments indicated a pattern of neutrino fluxes that was not compatible with any adjustment of the SSM. This in turn helped motivate a new generation of spectacularly capable active detectors. These experiments are Super-Kamiokande, the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO), and [[Borexino]]. Super-Kamiokande was able to detect elastic scattering (ES) events\n\n<math>\\nu_x + e^- \\to \\nu_x + e^-</math>\n\nwhich, due to the charged-current contribution to <math>\\nu_e</math> scattering, has a relative sensitivity to <math>\\nu_e</math> s and heavy-flavor neutrinos of \u223c7:1.<ref>{{Citation |title=Neutrino oscillations |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |author1=A.B.

The observed atmospheric neutrino events fall into four categories. Fully contained (FC) events have all their tracks in the inner detector, while partially contained (PC) events have escaping tracks from the inner detector. Upward through-going muons (UTM) are produced in the rock beneath the detector and go through the inner detector. Upward stopping muons (USM) are also produced in the rock beneath the detector, but stop in the inner detector.\n\nThe number of observed number of neutrinos is predicted uniformly regardless of the zenith angle. However, Super-Kamiokande found that the number of upward going muon neutrinos (generated on the other side of the Earth) is half of the number of downward going muon neutrinos in 1998. This can be explained by the neutrinos changing or oscillating into some other neutrinos that are not detected. This is called [[neutrino oscillation]]; this discovery indicates the finite mass of neutrinos and suggests an extension of the Standard Model. Neutrinos oscillate in three flavors, and all neutrinos have their rest mass. Later analysis in 2004 suggested a sinsinusoidal dependence of the event rate as a function of \u201cLength/Energy\u201d, which confirmed the neutrino oscillations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/atmnu-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\n===K2K Experiment===\n{{Main|K2K experiment}}\n\nThe K2K experiment was a neutrino experiment from June 1999 to November 2004. This experiment was designed to verify oscillations observed by Super-Kamiokande through [[muon]] [[neutrinos]]. It gives first positive measurement of [[neutrino oscillations]] in conditions that both source and detector are under control. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays an important role in the experiment as the far detector. Later experiment [[T2K experiment]] continued as the second generation follow up to the [[K2K experiment]].\n\n===T2K Experiment===\n{{Main|T2K experiment}}\n{{wide image|T2K_experiment_beam.png|600px|Passage of the muon neutrino beam from J-PARC to Super K}}\n\nT2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a neutrino experiment collaborated by several countries including [[Japan]], [[United States]] and others. The goal of T2K is to gain deeper understanding of parameters of [[neutrino oscillation]]. T2K has made a search for oscillations from muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos, and announced the first experimental indications for them in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://t2k-experiment.org/t2k/|title=The T2K Experiment|first=The T2K Public Website|last=Committee|date=|website=t2k-experiment.org}}</ref> The Super-Kamiokande detector plays as the \"far detector\". The Super-K detector will record the [[Cherenkov radiation]] of muons and electrons created by interactions between high energy neutrinos and water.\n[[File:A Super-Kamiokande Realtime Monitor result.gif|thumb|right|An almost-live event display from Super-K]]\n\n===Proton Decay===\nThe proton is assumed to be absolutely stable in the [[Standard Model]]. However, the [[Grand Unified Theories]] (GUTs) predict that protons can [[Proton decay|decay]] into lighter energetic charged particles such as electrons, muons, pions, or others which can be observed. Kamiokande helps to rule out some of these theories. Super-Kamiokande is currently the largest detector for observation of proton decay.\n\n==Purification==\n\n===Water purification system===\n[[File:The water purification system of Super-Kamiokande.jpg|thumb|left|A schematic view of the water purification system.]]\nThe 50 ktons pure water is continually reprocessed at rate about 30 tons/h in a closed system since early 2002. Now, raw mine water is recycled through the first step (particle filters and RO) for some time before other processes, which involve expensive expendables, are imposed. Initially, water from the Super-Kamiokande tank is passed through nominal 1 \u03bcm mesh filters to remove dust and particles, which reduce the transparency of the water for Cherenkov photons, and provide a possible radon source inside the Super-Kamiokande detector. A heat exchanger is used to cool down the water in order to reduce the PMT dark noise level as well as suppress the growth of [[bacteria]]. Surviving bacteria are killed by UV sterilizer stage. A cartridge polisher (CP) eliminates heavy ions which also reduce water transparency and include radioactive species. The CP module increases the typical resistivity of recirculating water from 11M\u03a9 cm to 18.24 M\u03a9 cm, approaching chemical limit.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Originally, ion-exchanger (IE) was included in system, but it was removed when IE resin was found to be a significant radon source. The RO step that removes additional particulates, and the introduction of Rn-reduced air into the water that increases radon removal efficiency in the vacuum degasifier (VD) stage which follows were installed in 1999. After that, a VD removes dissolved gases in the water. These gases are dissolved in water with a serious background of events source for solar neutrinos in the MeV energy range and the dissolved [[oxygen]] encourages the growth of bacteria. The removal efficiency is about 96%. Then, the ultra filter (UF)  is introduced to remove particles whose minimum size corresponds to molecular weight approximately 10,000 (or about 10&nbsp;nm diameter) thanks to hollow fiber membrane filters. Finally, a membrane degasifier (MD) removes radon dissolved in water, and the measured removal efficiency for radon is about 83%. The concentration of radon gases is miniaturized by realtime detectors. In June 2001 typical radon concentrations in water coming into the purification system from the Super-Kamiokande tank were <2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, and in water output by the system, 0.4\u00b10.2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air purification system===\nPurified Air is supplied in the gap between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m<sup>3</sup> of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m<sup>3</sup>/h, \u221265&nbsp;\u00b0C (@+1&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and a few mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000\u20133000 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup> during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100\u2013300 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. This variation is due to the [[chimney effect]] in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Wide image|Air_Purification_system_of_Super-Kamiokande.jpg|600px|A schematic view of the air purification system.}}\nIn order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m<sup>3</sup>/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A \u201cRadon Hut\u201d (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40&nbsp;hp air pump with 10 m^3 min<sup>\u22121</sup> /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Data processing==\nOffline data processing is produced both in Kamioka and United States.\n\n===In Kamioka===\nThe offline data processing system is located in Kenkyuto and is connected to Super-Kamiokande detector with 4&nbsp;km FDDI optical fiber link. Data flow from online system is 450 kbytes s<sup>\u22121</sup> on average, corresponding to 40 Gbytes day<sup>\u22121</sup> or 14 Tbytes yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. Magnetic tapes are used in offline system to store data and most of the analysis is accomplished here. The offline processing system is designed platform-independent because different computer architectures are used for data analysis. Because of this, the data structures are based on ZEBRA bank system developed in [[CERN]] as well as the ZEBRA exchange system.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEvent data from Super-Kamiokande online DAQ system basically contains a list of number of hit PMT, TDC and ADC counts, GPS time-stamps and other housekeeping data. For solar neutrino analysis, lowering the energy threshold is a constant goal, so it is a continual effort to improve the efficiency of reduction algorithms; however, changes in calibrations or reduction methods require reprocessing of earlier data.  Typically, 10 Tbytes of raw data is processed every month so that a large amount of CPU power and high-speed I/O access to the raw data. In addition, extensive [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation processing is also necessary.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOffline system was designed to meet demand of all these: tape storage of a large database (14 Tbytes yr\u22121), stable semi-realtime processing, nearly continuous re-processing and Monte Carlo simulation. The computer system consists of 3 major sub-systems: the data server, the CPU farm and the network at the end of Run I.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===In US===\nA system dedicated to offsite offline data processing was set up at the [[Stony Brook University]] in Stony Brook, NY to process raw data sent from Kamioka. Most of the reformatted raw data is copied from system facility in Kamioka. At Stony Brook, a system was set up for analysis and further processing. At Stony Brook the raw data were processed with a multi-tape DLT drive. The first stage data reduction processes were done for the high energy analysis and for the low energy analysis. The data reduction for the high energy analysis was mainly for atmospheric neutrino events and proton decay search while the low energy analysis was mainly for the solar neutrino events. The reduced data for the high energy analysis was further filtered by other reduction processes and the resulting data were stored on disks. The reduced data for the low energy were stored on DLT tapes and sent to [[University of California]], Irvine for further processing.\n\nThis offset analysis system continued for 3 years until their analysis chains were proved to produce equivalent results. Thus, in order to limited manpower, collaborations were concentrated to single combined analysis<ref>{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande Detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |author1=S.

The purpose of the observatory was to detect whether [[proton decay]] exists, one of the most fundamental questions of elementary particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html|title=\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30da\u30fc\u30b8 - Kamioka Observatory, ICRR, University of Tokyo|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/|title=Physics Home|author=|date=|website=www.phys.washington.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/gallery/index-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Photo Gallery|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cause-committee/1st/report-nov22e.pdf|title=Official report on the accident (in PDF format)|author=|date=|website=u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000327|title=Logbook entry of first neutrinos seen at Super-K generated at KEK|author=|date=|website=symmetrymagazine.org}}</ref>\n\nThe detector, named KamiokaNDE for Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment, was a [[chemical tank|tank]] {{Convert|16.0|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and {{Convert|15.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in width, containing 3,048 metric tons (3,000 tons) of pure water and about 1,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) attached to its inner surface. The detector was upgraded, starting in 1985, to allow it to observe solar neutrinos. As a result, the detector (KamiokaNDE-II) had become sensitive enough to detect neutrinos from [[SN 1987A]], a [[supernova]] which was observed in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] in February 1987, and to observe solar neutrinos in 1988. The ability of the Kamiokande experiment to observe the direction of electrons produced in solar neutrino [[elastic scattering|interactions]] allowed experimenters to directly demonstrate for the first time that the sun was a source of neutrinos.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande project was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture in 1991 for total funding of approximately $100 M. The US portion of the proposal, which was primarily to build the OD system, was approved by the US Department of Energy in 1993 for $3 M. In addition the US has also contributed about 2000 20&nbsp;cm PMTs recycled from the [[Irvine\u2013Michigan\u2013Brookhaven (detector)|IMB experiment]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDespite successes in [[neutrino astronomy]] and neutrino astrophysics, Kamiokande did not achieve its primary goal, the detection of proton decay. Higher sensitivity was also necessary to obtain high statistical confidence in its results. This led to the construction of Super-Kamiokande, with fifteen times the water and ten times as many PMTs as Kamiokande. Super-Kamiokande started operation in 1996.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande Collaboration announced the first evidence of [[neutrino oscillation]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fukuda, Y. | display-authors = etal | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 81 | issue = 8 | pages = 1562\u20131567 | date = 1998 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1562 | title = Evidence for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos | arxiv = hep-ex/9807003 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.1562F }}</ref> This was the first experimental observation supporting the theory that the neutrino has non-zero [[mass]], a possibility that theorists had speculated about for years. The 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to Super-Kamiokande researcher [[Takaaki Kajita]] alongside [[Arthur B. McDonald|Arthur McDonald]] for their work on neutrino oscillations.\n\nOn 12 November 2001, about 6,600 of the photomultiplier tubes (costing about $3000 each<ref>{{cite web|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/accident-grounds-neutrino-lab/|title=Accident grounds neutrino lab|author=|date=|website=physicsworld.com}}</ref>) in the Super-Kamiokande detector [[Implosion (mechanical process)|imploded]], apparently in a [[chain reaction]] or [[cascading failure]], as the [[shock wave]] from the concussion of each imploding tube cracked its neighbours. The detector was partially restored by redistributing the photomultiplier tubes which did not implode, and by adding protective [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] shells that are hoped will prevent another chain reaction from recurring (Super-Kamiokande-II).\n\nIn July 2005, preparations began to restore the detector to its original form by reinstalling about 6,000 PMTs. The work was completed in June 2006, whereupon the detector was renamed Super-Kamiokande-III. This phase of the experiment collected data from October 2006 till August 2008. At that time, significant upgrades were made to the electronics. After the upgrade, the new phase of the experiment has been referred to as Super-Kamiokande-IV. SK-IV collected data on various natural sources of neutrinos, as well as acted as the far detector for the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.\n\nSK-IV continued until June 2018. After that, the detector underwent a full refurbishment during Autumn of 2018. On 29 January 2019 the detector resumed data-taking.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00440-2|pmid = 30728526| title=Neutrino hunt resumes, ITER's new confidence and Elsevier's woes| journal=Nature| volume=566| issue=7742| pages=12\u201313| year=2019| bibcode=2019Natur.566...12.}}</ref>\n\n==Detector==\nThe Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a Cherenkov detector used to study neutrinos from different sources including the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and accelerators. It is also used to search for proton decay. The experiment began in April 1996 and was shut down for maintenance in July 2001, a period known as \"SK-I\". Since an accident occurred during maintenance, the experiment resumed in October 2002 with only half of its original number of ID-PMTs.  In order to prevent further accidents, all of the ID-PMTs were covered by fiber-reinforced plastic with acrylic front windows. This phase from October 2002 to another closure for an entire reconstruction in October 2005 is called \"SK-II\". In July 2006, the experiment resumed with the full number of PMTs and stopped in September 2008 for electronics upgrades. This period was known as \"SK-III\". The period after 2008 is known as \"SK-IV\".

There were two pairs of QAC/TAC for each PMT input signal, this prevented dead time and allowed the readout of multiple sequential hits that may arise, e.g. from electrons that are decay products of stopping muons.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe SK system was upgraded in September 2008 in order to maintain the stability in the next decade and improve the throughput of the data acquisition systems, QTC-based electronics with Ethernet (QBEE).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1109/TNS.2009.2034854|title = Commissioning of the New Electronics and Online System for the Super-Kamiokande Experiment|journal = IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science|volume = 57|issue = 2|pages = 428\u2013432|year = 2010|last1 = Yamada|first1 = S.|last2 = Awai|first2 = K.|last3 = Hayato|first3 = Y.|last4 = Kaneyuki|first4 = K.|last5 = Kouzuma|first5 = Y.|last6 = Nakayama|first6 = S.|last7 = Nishino|first7 = H.|last8 = Okumura|first8 = K.|last9 = Obayashi|first9 = Y.|last10 = Shimizu|first10 = Y.|last11 = Shiozawa|first11 = M.|last12 = Takeda|first12 = A.|last13 = Heng|first13 = Y.|last14 = Yang|first14 = B.|last15 = Chen|first15 = S.|last16 = Tanaka|first16 = T.|last17 = Yokozawa|first17 = T.|last18 = Koshio|first18 = Y.|last19 = Moriyama|first19 = S.|last20 = Arai|first20 = Y.|last21 = Ishikawa|first21 = K.|last22 = Minegishi|first22 = A.|last23 = Uchida|first23 = T.|bibcode = 2010ITNS...57..428Y}}</ref> The QBEE provides high-speed signal processing by combining pipelined components.

Beta decay in the Earth and in supernovas turns neutrons into protons with the emission of anti-neutrinos. The Super-Kamiokande detects electrons knocked off a water molecule producing a flash of blue Cherenkov light, and these are produced both by neutrinos and antineutrinos.  A rarer instance is when an antineutrino interacts with a proton in water to produce a neutron and a positron.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Castelvecchi|first=Davide|date=2019-02-27|title=Gigantic Japanese detector prepares to catch neutrinos from supernovae|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=566|issue=7745|pages=438\u2013439|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00598-9}}</ref>\n\nGadolinium has an affinity for neutrons and produces a bright flash of gamma rays when it absorbs one. Adding gadolinium to the Super-Kamiokande allows it to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Antineutrinos produce a double flash of light about 30 microseconds apart, first when the neutrino hits a proton and second when gadolinium absorbs a neutron.<ref name=\":0\" /> The brightness of the first flash allows physicists to distinguish between low energy antineutrinos from the Earth and high energy antineutrinos from supernovas. In addition to observing neutrinos from distant supernovas, the Super-Kamiokande will be able to set off an alarm to inform astronomers around the world of the presence of a supernova in the Milky Way within one second of it occurring.\n\nThe biggest challenge was whether the detector's water could be continuously filtered to remove impurities without removing the gadolinium at the same time. A 200-ton prototype called EGADS with added gadolinium sulfate was installed in the Kamioka mine and operated for years. It finished operation in 2018 and showed that the new water purification system would remove impurities while keeping the gadolinium concentration stable. It also showed that gadolinium sulfate would not significantly impair the transparency of the otherwise ultrapure water, or cause corrosion or deposition on existing equipment or on the new valves that will later be installed in the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Water tank===\nThe outer shell of the water tank is a cylindrical stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The tank is self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the tank is filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 ktons of water.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |volume=51 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |author1=S.

Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames are connected to each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected to the bottom of the tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, supermodules simplified the initial assembly of the ID. Each supermodule was assembled on the tank floor and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with supermodules. During installation, ID PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.[[File:The PMTs used in Super-Kamiokande.gif|thumb|right|Schematic view of a 50 cm PMT.]]\n\nCables from each group of 3 PMTs are bundled together. All cables run up the outer surface of the PMT support structure, i.e., on the OD PMT plane, pass through cable ports at the top of the tank, and are then routed into the electronics huts.\n\nThe thickness of the OD varies slightly, but is on average about 2.6 m on top and bottom, and 2.7 m on the barrel wall, giving the OD a total mass of 18 kilotons. OD PMTs were distributed with 302 on the top layer, 308 on the bottom, and 1275 on the barrel wall.\n\nTo protect against low energy background from radon decay products in the air, the roof of the cavity and the access tunnels were sealed with a coating called Mineguard. Mineguard is a spray-applied polyurethane membrane developed for use as a rock support system and radon gas barrier in the mining industry.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe average geomagnetic field is about 450 mG and is inclined by about 45\u00b0 with respect to the horizon at the detector site. This presents a problem for the large and very sensitive PMTs which prefer a much lower ambient field. The strength and uniform direction of the geomagnetic field could systematically bias photoelectron trajectories and timing in the PMTs. To counteract this 26 sets of horizontal and vertical Helmholtz coils are arranged around the inner surfaces of the tank. With these in operation the average field in the detector is reduced to about 50 mG. The magnetic field at various PMT locations were measured before the tank was filled with water.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nA standard fiducial volume of approximately 22.5 ktons is defined as the region inside a surface drawn 2.00 m from the ID wall to minimize the anomalous response causing by natural radioactivity in the surrounding rock.\n\n==Monitoring system==\n\n===Online monitoring system===\nAn online monitor computer located in the control room reads data from the DAQ host computer via an FDDI link. It provides shift operators with a flexible tool for selecting event display features, makes online and recent-history histograms to monitor detector performance, and performs a variety of additional tasks needed to efficiently monitor status and diagnose detector and DAQ problems. Events in the data stream can be skimmed off and elementary analysis tools can be applied to check data quality during calibrations or after changes in hardware or online software.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Realtime supernova monitor===\nTo detect and identify such bursts as efficiently and promptly as possible Super-Kamiokande is equipped with an online supernova monitor system. About 10,000 total events are expected in Super-Kamiokande for a supernova explosion at the center of our Galaxy. Super-Kamiokande can measure a burst with no dead-time, up to 30,000 events within the first second of a burst. Theoretical calculations of supernova explosions suggest that neutrinos are emitted over a total time-scale of tens of seconds with about a half of them emitted during the first one or two seconds. The Super-K will search for event clusters in specified time windows of 0.5, 2 and 10 s.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Data are transmitted to realtime SN-watch analysis process every 2 min and analysis is completed typically in 1 min. When supernova (SN) event candidates are found, <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is calculated if the event multiplicity is larger than 16, where <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is defined as the average spatial distance between events, i.e.\n\n<math>{R_\\text{mean}} =\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}} |{r_\\text{i}}-{r_\\text{j}}|} {{N_\\text{nulti}} {C_\\text{2}}}</math>\n\nNeutrinos from supernovae interact with free protons, producing positrons which are distributed so uniformly in the detector that <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> for SN events should be significantly larger than for ordinary spatial clusters of events. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, Rmean for uniformly distributed Monte Carlo events shows that no tail exists below <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7d1000&nbsp;cm. For the \u201calarm\u201d class of burst, the events are required to have <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e900&nbsp;cm for 25\u2a7d<math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>\u2a7d40 or <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e750&nbsp;cm for <math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>>40.

During the Super-Kamiokande I running, this never occurred.\nOne of the important capabilities for [Super-Kamiokande] is to reconstruct the direction to supernova. By neutrino\u2013electron scattering, <math>\\nu_\\text{x} + e^- \\to \\nu_\\text{x} + e^-</math>, a total of 100\u2013150 events are expected in case of a supernova at the center of our Galaxy.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The direction to supernova can be measured with angular resolution\n\n<math>\\delta \\theta \\sim {30^\\circ \\over \\sqrt{N}}</math>\n\nwhere N is the number of events produced by the \u03bd\u2013e scattering.

When any deviation from norms is detected, it will alert physicists to prompt to investigate, take appropriate action, or notify experts.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nTo monitor and control the offline processes that analyze and transfer data, a set of software was sophisticatedly developed. This monitor allows non-expert shift physicists to identify and repair common problems to minimize down time, and the software package was a significant contribution to the smooth operation of the experiment and its overall high lifetime efficiency for data taking.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Research==\n\n===Solar neutrino===\n{{See also|Neutrino Oscillation}}\nThe energy of the Sun comes from the nuclear fusion in its core where a helium atom and an electron neutrino are generated by 4 protons. These neutrinos emitted from this reaction are called solar neutrinos. Photons, created by the nuclear fusion in the center of the Sun, take millions of years to reach the surface; on the other hand, solar neutrinos arrive at the earth in eight minutes due to their lack of interactions with matter. Hence, solar neutrinos make it possible for us to observe the inner Sun in \"real-time\" that takes millions of years for visible light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/solarnu-intro-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the Super-Kamiokande detected strong evidence of neutrino oscillation that successfully explained the [[solar neutrino problem]]. The Sun and about 80% of the visible stars produce their energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via\n\n<math>4p \\to {}^4\\!He + 2e^+ + 2 \\nu_e + 26.73</math> MeV\n\nConsequently, stars are a source of neutrinos, including our [[Sun]]. These neutrinos primarily come through the pp-chain in lower masses, and for cooler stars, primarily through CNO-chains of heavier masses.[[File:Pp-chain and CNO chain.jpg|thumb|right|The left frame shows the three principal cycles comprising the pp chain (ppI, ppII, and ppIII), the neutrinos sources associated with these cycles. The right frame shows the CN I cycle.]]\nIn the early 1990s, particularly with the uncertainties that accompanied the initial results from Kamioka II and the Ga experiments, no individual experiment required a non-astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem. But in aggregate, the Cl, Kamioka II, and Ga experiments indicated a pattern of neutrino fluxes that was not compatible with any adjustment of the SSM. This in turn helped motivate a new generation of spectacularly capable active detectors. These experiments are Super-Kamiokande, the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO), and [[Borexino]]. Super-Kamiokande was able to detect elastic scattering (ES) events\n\n<math>\\nu_x + e^- \\to \\nu_x + e^-</math>\n\nwhich, due to the charged-current contribution to <math>\\nu_e</math> scattering, has a relative sensitivity to <math>\\nu_e</math> s and heavy-flavor neutrinos of \u223c7:1.<ref>{{Citation |title=Neutrino oscillations |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |author1=A.B.

The solid line indicates the best fit considering the flux as a free parameter.]]\n\n===Atmospheric neutrino===\nAtmospheric neutrinos are secondary cosmic rays produced by the decay of particles resulting from interactions of primary cosmic rays (mostly [[proton]]s) with [[Earth atmosphere]]. The observed atmospheric neutrino events fall into four categories. Fully contained (FC) events have all their tracks in the inner detector, while partially contained (PC) events have escaping tracks from the inner detector. Upward through-going muons (UTM) are produced in the rock beneath the detector and go through the inner detector. Upward stopping muons (USM) are also produced in the rock beneath the detector, but stop in the inner detector.\n\nThe number of observed number of neutrinos is predicted uniformly regardless of the zenith angle. However, Super-Kamiokande found that the number of upward going muon neutrinos (generated on the other side of the Earth) is half of the number of downward going muon neutrinos in 1998. This can be explained by the neutrinos changing or oscillating into some other neutrinos that are not detected. This is called [[neutrino oscillation]]; this discovery indicates the finite mass of neutrinos and suggests an extension of the Standard Model. Neutrinos oscillate in three flavors, and all neutrinos have their rest mass. Later analysis in 2004 suggested a sinsinusoidal dependence of the event rate as a function of \u201cLength/Energy\u201d, which confirmed the neutrino oscillations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/atmnu-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\n===K2K Experiment===\n{{Main|K2K experiment}}\n\nThe K2K experiment was a neutrino experiment from June 1999 to November 2004. This experiment was designed to verify oscillations observed by Super-Kamiokande through [[muon]] [[neutrinos]]. It gives first positive measurement of [[neutrino oscillations]] in conditions that both source and detector are under control. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays an important role in the experiment as the far detector. Later experiment [[T2K experiment]] continued as the second generation follow up to the [[K2K experiment]].\n\n===T2K Experiment===\n{{Main|T2K experiment}}\n{{wide image|T2K_experiment_beam.png|600px|Passage of the muon neutrino beam from J-PARC to Super K}}\n\nT2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a neutrino experiment collaborated by several countries including [[Japan]], [[United States]] and others. The goal of T2K is to gain deeper understanding of parameters of [[neutrino oscillation]]. T2K has made a search for oscillations from muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos, and announced the first experimental indications for them in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://t2k-experiment.org/t2k/|title=The T2K Experiment|first=The T2K Public Website|last=Committee|date=|website=t2k-experiment.org}}</ref> The Super-Kamiokande detector plays as the \"far detector\". The Super-K detector will record the [[Cherenkov radiation]] of muons and electrons created by interactions between high energy neutrinos and water.\n[[File:A Super-Kamiokande Realtime Monitor result.gif|thumb|right|An almost-live event display from Super-K]]\n\n===Proton Decay===\nThe proton is assumed to be absolutely stable in the [[Standard Model]]. However, the [[Grand Unified Theories]] (GUTs) predict that protons can [[Proton decay|decay]] into lighter energetic charged particles such as electrons, muons, pions, or others which can be observed. Kamiokande helps to rule out some of these theories. Super-Kamiokande is currently the largest detector for observation of proton decay.\n\n==Purification==\n\n===Water purification system===\n[[File:The water purification system of Super-Kamiokande.jpg|thumb|left|A schematic view of the water purification system.]]\nThe 50 ktons pure water is continually reprocessed at rate about 30 tons/h in a closed system since early 2002. Now, raw mine water is recycled through the first step (particle filters and RO) for some time before other processes, which involve expensive expendables, are imposed. Initially, water from the Super-Kamiokande tank is passed through nominal 1 \u03bcm mesh filters to remove dust and particles, which reduce the transparency of the water for Cherenkov photons, and provide a possible radon source inside the Super-Kamiokande detector. Heat exchanger is used to cool down the water in order to reduce the PMT dark noise level as well as suppress the growth of [[bacteria]]. Surviving bacteria are killed by UV sterilizer stage. A cartridge polisher (CP) eliminates heavy ions which also reduce water transparency and include radioactive species. The CP module increases the typical resistivity of recirculating water from 11M\u03a9 cm to 18.24 M\u03a9 cm, approaching chemical limit.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Originally, ion-exchanger (IE) was included in system, but it was removed when IE resin was found to be a significant radon source. The RO step that removes additional particulates, and the introduction of Rn-reduced air into the water that increases radon removal efficiency in the vacuum degasifier (VD) stage which follows were installed in 1999. After that, a VD removes dissolved gases in the water. These gases are dissolved in water with a serious background of events source for solar neutrinos in the MeV energy range and the dissolved [[oxygen]] encourages the growth of bacteria. The removal efficiency is about 96%. Then, the ultra filter (UF)  is introduced to remove particles whose minimum size corresponds to molecular weight approximately 10,000 (or about 10&nbsp;nm diameter) thanks to hollow fiber membrane filters. Finally, a membrane degasifier (MD) removes radon dissolved in water, and the measured removal efficiency for radon is about 83%. The concentration of radon gases is miniaturized by realtime detectors. In June 2001 typical radon concentrations in water coming into the purification system from the Super-Kamiokande tank were <2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, and in water output by the system, 0.4\u00b10.2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air purification system===\nPurified Air is supplied in the gap between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m<sup>3</sup> of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m<sup>3</sup>/h, \u221265&nbsp;\u00b0C (@+1&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and a few mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000\u20133000 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup> during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100\u2013300 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. This variation is due to the [[chimney effect]] in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Wide image|Air_Purification_system_of_Super-Kamiokande.jpg|600px|A schematic view of the air purification system.}}\nIn order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m<sup>3</sup>/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A \u201cRadon Hut\u201d (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40&nbsp;hp air pump with 10 m^3 min<sup>\u22121</sup> /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Data processing==\nOffline data processing is produced both in Kamioka and United States.\n\n===In Kamioka===\nThe offline data processing system is located in Kenkyuto and is connected to Super-Kamiokande detector with 4&nbsp;km FDDI optical fiber link. Data flow from online system is 450 kbytes s<sup>\u22121</sup> on average, corresponding to 40 Gbytes day<sup>\u22121</sup> or 14 Tbytes yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. Magnetic tapes are used in offline system to store data and most of the analysis is accomplished here. The offline processing system is designed platform-independent because different computer architectures are used for data analysis. Because of this, the data structures are based on ZEBRA bank system developed in [[CERN]] as well as the ZEBRA exchange system.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEvent data from Super-Kamiokande online DAQ system basically contains a list of number of hit PMT, TDC and ADC counts, GPS time-stamps and other housekeeping data. For solar neutrino analysis, lowering the energy threshold is a constant goal, so it is a continual effort to improve the efficiency of reduction algorithms; however, changes in calibrations or reduction methods require reprocessing of earlier data.  Typically, 10 Tbytes of raw data is processed every month so that a large amount of CPU power and high-speed I/O access to the raw data. In addition, extensive [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation processing is also necessary.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOffline system was designed to meet demand of all these: tape storage of a large database (14 Tbytes yr\u22121), stable semi-realtime processing, nearly continuous re-processing and Monte Carlo simulation. The computer system consists of 3 major sub-systems: the data server, the CPU farm and the network at the end of Run I.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===In US===\nA system dedicated to offsite offline data processing was set up at the [[Stony Brook University]] in Stony Brook, NY to process raw data sent from Kamioka. Most of the reformatted raw data is copied from system facility in Kamioka. At Stony Brook, a system was set up for analysis and further processing. At Stony Brook the raw data were processed with a multi-tape DLT drive. The first stage data reduction processes were done for the high energy analysis and for the low energy analysis. The data reduction for the high energy analysis was mainly for atmospheric neutrino events and proton decay search while the low energy analysis was mainly for the solar neutrino events. The reduced data for the high energy analysis was further filtered by other reduction processes and the resulting data were stored on disks. The reduced data for the low energy were stored on DLT tapes and sent to [[University of California]], Irvine for further processing.\n\nThis offset analysis system continued for 3 years until their analysis chains were proved to produce equivalent results. Thus, in order to limited manpower, collaborations were concentrated to single combined analysis<ref>{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande Detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |author1=S.

The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the [[Trizone]], was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term ''Deutschland'' (\"Germany\"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], allowing all [[States of Germany|states or ''L\u00e4nder'']], then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and [[West Berlin]] did so.<ref>The initial states were the following: [[South Baden|Baden (south)]], [[Bavaria]], [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]]. The latter two and the first merged in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952.</ref> However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The [[Saarland]] joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the [[New states of Germany|\"new states\"]] of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.\n\nTherefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the [[Cold War]]. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism ''BRD'' began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary [[Duden]] in 1967.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8AqAAAAMAAJ&dq=duden+brd+1967&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=duden+brd''Deutschland - Ein Name im Wandel''], Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76</ref> The German Democratic Republic at first used the name ''Westdeutschland'' or \"West Germany\" (abbreviated \"WD\") for the Federal Republic of Germany,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8fAAAAMAAJ&q=Westdeutschland+wd&dq=Westdeutschland+wd&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjU__jHr8nKAhVE2RoKHfPfBG4Q6AEIRDAF ''Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung''], Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600</ref> but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany ''Deutsche Bundesrepublik'' or \"German Federal Republic\" (abbreviated \"DBR\"),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BLwAAAAMAAJ&dq=dbr+deutsche+bundesrepublik&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=dbr+ ''Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage''], Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46</ref> because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name \"Germany\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch3P_mZeDZ4C&lpg=PA143&dq=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&pg=PA143#v=onepage&q=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&f=false ''Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen f\u00fcr die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland''], Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143</ref>\n\n===Use in East Germany===\nThis changed in 1968 with the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|new constitution]] of the German Democratic Republic.

The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the [[Trizone]], was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term ''Deutschland'' (\"Germany\"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], allowing all [[States of Germany|states or ''L\u00e4nder'']], then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and [[West Berlin]] did so.<ref>The initial states were the following: [[South Baden|Baden (south)]], [[Bavaria]], [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]]. The latter two and the first merged in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952.</ref> However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The [[Saarland]] joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the [[New states of Germany|\"new states\"]] of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.\n\nTherefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the [[Cold War]]. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism ''BRD'' began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary [[Duden]] in 1967.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8AqAAAAMAAJ&dq=duden+brd+1967&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=duden+brd''Deutschland - Ein Name im Wandel''], Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76</ref> The German Democratic Republic at first used the name ''Westdeutschland'' or \"West Germany\" (abbreviated \"WD\") for the Federal Republic of Germany,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8fAAAAMAAJ&q=Westdeutschland+wd&dq=Westdeutschland+wd&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjU__jHr8nKAhVE2RoKHfPfBG4Q6AEIRDAF ''Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung''], Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600</ref> but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany ''Deutsche Bundesrepublik'' or \"German Federal Republic\" (abbreviated \"DBR\"),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BLwAAAAMAAJ&dq=dbr+deutsche+bundesrepublik&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=dbr+ ''Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage''], Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46</ref> because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name \"Germany\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch3P_mZeDZ4C&lpg=PA143&dq=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&pg=PA143#v=onepage&q=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&f=false ''Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen f\u00fcr die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland''], Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143</ref>\n\n===Use in East Germany===\nThis changed in 1968 with the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|new constitution]] of the German Democratic Republic.

Young New Zealand was established for the purpose of becoming a Political Party focusing on issues and matters pertaining particularly to young people, people with disabilities, seniors and animals. (incl. pets - the often politically neglected members of kiwi families). The Young New Zealand Party exists to contest New Zealand elections.\n\n== History ==\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}\nThe '''Young New Zealand Party''' was a faction in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in the 19th century. It predated the creation of [[political party|political parties]] as they are understood today.\n\nThe Young New Zealand Party was generally reformist in outlook, and would probably be considered [[left-wing]] in modern terms. It had connections to the [[labour movement]] (particularly miners), to small farmers, and to small businessmen. It was contrasted with another reformist faction, led by [[Julius Vogel]], [[Robert Stout]], and [[John Ballance]]. This group pursued a more academic type of reform, focused around socially [[liberalism|liberal]] causes such as [[women's suffrage]] and [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] rights.

(incl. pets - the often politically neglected members of kiwi families). The Young New Zealand Party exists to contest New Zealand elections.\n\n== History ==\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}\nThe '''Young New Zealand Party''' was a faction in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in the 19th century. It predated the creation of [[political party|political parties]] as they are understood today.\n\nThe Young New Zealand Party was generally reformist in outlook, and would probably be considered [[left-wing]] in modern terms. It had connections to the [[labour movement]] (particularly miners), to small farmers, and to small businessmen. It was contrasted with another reformist faction, led by [[Julius Vogel]], [[Robert Stout]], and [[John Ballance]]. This group pursued a more academic type of reform, focused around socially [[liberalism|liberal]] causes such as [[women's suffrage]] and [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] rights. Both groups were originally part of a government led by [[George Edward Grey|George Grey]], but fractured after Grey's government was defeated.\n\nKey figures in the Young New Zealand Party were [[William Montgomery (New Zealand politician)|William Montgomery]] (the de facto leader), [[Richard Seddon]], [[James McGowan (politician)|James McGowan]], [[John McKenzie (New Zealand politician)|John McKenzie]], [[Joseph Ward]] and [[William Hall-Jones]].
