And O'Donovan in his preceding remarks notes that the memory of Balor \"general of the Fomorians is still vividly remembered.. throughout Ireland\" (p. 18).}}{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|The flowery description of Balor such as \"float among the peasantry\" was lamented by O'Curry,{{sfnp|O'Curry|1863|p=166}} and the details are eschewed by Lady Gregory, who replaces it with an account from [[Cath Maige Tuired|CMT]] which O'Curry suggests deserves more attention.}}\n\nBalor learns from a druid's prophecy that he will be killed by his own grandson. To prevent this he imprisons his only daughter Ethnea in the tower which stands on a tall rock formation called the Tor M\u00f3r, or \"Great Tower\".{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|The spelling is \"Toremore\" as occurs in the original printed by O'Donovan, but [[Arbois de Jubainville]] gives ''tor-mor'' glossed as \"great tower\".{{sfnp|Arbois de Jubainville|1903|pp=117\u2013118}} Note that the tower of [[Conand (mythology)|Conan mac Febrail]] the Fomorian is recontexted and referred to as \"Tower of Glass\" floating in the sea in Nennius's geography of Ireland.{{sfnp|Arbois de Jubainville|1903|pp=67\u201368}} In Lady Gregory's retelling, Balor lives in the Glass Tower, and his daughter (given the name Ethlinn for consistency) is locked up in \"the tower on the island\".}}\n\nMac Kineely (=Cian) owns a prolific milch-cow called \"Glos Gavlin\" (''rect\u00e9'' {{lang-ga|Glas Gaibhnenn}}), which is coveted by everyone including Balor. While the cow is in the care of Mac Kineely's brother Mac Samthainn, Balor appears in the form of a little red-haired boy and tricks him into handing him the cow. Mac Kineely=Cian wishes to reclaim the cow, but is advised that he can only succeed when Balor is dead. Cian then consults Biroge ([[Bir\u00f3g]]<ref name=rolleston/>) of the Mountain, who is his ''[[leanan s\u00eddhe]]'' or [[familiar spirit]] and a  [[banshee]]{{efn|a druidess in Lady Gregory.}} and she transports him by magic to the top of Balor's tower, where he seduces Ehnea.{{efn|Presumably Mac Kineely{{=}}Cian (or Bir\u00f3g) knew that Balor was fated to be killed by his grandchild.}}{{efn|Also, Cian is sneaked into the tower disguised as a woman, wearing female attire, because only female attendants are allowed near the daughter.}}\n\nIn time Ethnea gives birth to triplets, which Balor gathers up in a sheet and sends out to be drowned in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies but unwittingly drops one child (unnamed in the original telling, but Lugh in Lady Gregory's version) into the harbour, where he is rescued by Bir\u00f3g. She takes the baby to his father, who gives him to his brother, [[Goibniu|Gavida]] the smith, in fosterage.{{efn|This is changed by Lady Gregory to fosterage under \"Taillte, daughter of the King of the Great Plain\",{{sfnp|Gregory|1905|p=121}} which conforms with adoption by [[Tailtiu]] as given in the LGE. [[Arthur C. L. Brown]] also favors \"foster-mother\" here, and footnotes that the banshee Birog who \"gave the boy to his father's brother, Gavida the Smith\" was still \"a kind of foster-mother\".{{sfnp|Brown|1924|p=87 and note 6}} In Larminie's version, the child, named Dul Dauna, is fostered by \"[[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Mananaun]]\".{{sfnp|Larminie|1893|pp=8\u20139}}}}\n</blockquote>\n\nAs noted, Cian's offspring is not explicitly called \"Lugh\" in O'Donovan's version of the cow folktale, but the boy is called \"Dul Dauna\" in Larminie's collected folktale. The name Dul Dauna taken at face value is glossed as \"the blind stubborn\" (< ''{{linktext|dall}}'') by Larminie  and \"black surly one\" (< ''{{linktext|doilbh}}''?) by Westropp, but is also thought to be a corruption of Lugh's byname ''Ildanach'' \"master of all knowledge\".{{sfnp|Larminie|1893|p=251}}<ref name=westropp/> However, the boy is called by something close to the god's name, namely Lui Lavada (Lui Longhand) in two tales collected by Curtin .<ref name=curtin-p283-donegal/><ref>{{harvp|Curtin|1911|pp=296\u2013311}} \"Balor of the Evil Eye and Lui Lavada his Grandson\" ([[Connemara]], [[County Galway|Co. Galway]])</ref>{{efn|It is possible Lugh as a boy did not receive a name, if [[William John Gruffydd]] hypothesis is correct. He reconstructs an original Irish tale in which Balor curses his grandson with three ''[[geasa]]'' including not receiving a name except by him. This is just what happens to [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]] in Mabinogi tale of ''Math'' (cf. [[#Welsh counterpart|\u00a7Welsh counterpart]] below. {{harvp|Gruffydd|1928|pp=102\u2013106}}, apud {{harvp|Loomis|1929|p=140}}<ref name=loomis-rev-gruffydd/>}}\n\n=== Cian's death by Balor ===\nIn Donovan's version, Mac Kineely=Cian does not succeed in regaining the magic cow in his life time (or rather, he himself is killed before the destruction of Balor, which was the prophesied prerequisite for the regaining of the cow). It is told that Mac Kineely's head was struck off by Balor, and a piece of white stone was permanently tainted with the blood, running in the form of red veins.<ref name=odonovan/> The supposed veined marble was propped on a pillar and became a local monument known as  \"Clogh-an-Neely\" (reconstructed {{lang-ga|cloch Chinnfhaolaidh}}).<ref name=odonovan/>\n\n== Welsh counterpart ==\nSome scholars argue that the Welsh deity [[Gwydion]] is the counterpart to Cian.\n\nThe story of the birth of [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]], the Welsh incarnation of Lugh, occurs in the Mabinogi tale of ''[[Math fab Mathonwy (branch)]]''. Although the tale does not explicitly identify Lleu's father, it has been asserted that Lleu was Gwydion's \"incestuously begotten son\",<ref name=mackillop-gwydion/> thus making Gwydion the Welsh equivalent of Cian.\n\nThe emphasis of study is the parallel between Gwydion and Cian=MacKineely of Irish folktale (rather than Cian of the mythological tracts or ''OCT'') in the case of Welsh scholar [[John Rhys]] has pursued.{{sfnp|Rhys|1886|pp=314\u2013321}}\n\nOne parallel is that the newborn are unwanted by their forebears and condemned to die, but survive.<ref>{{harvp|Rhys|1886|pp=314\u2013321}}. Rhys does not state this directly as a parallel between the Mabinogi tale ''Math'' (pp. 307\u2013308) and the Irish folktales of the Cow (p. 317), because he introduces additional tales that he deems to be cognate or related, namely the legends surrounding Cairbre M\u00fasc (pp. 308\u2013309) and [[Cairbre Cinnchait]] (p. 310). The explicit comparison (p. 317) is between \"Lug\" (son of Cian{{=}}Mackineely) and Moran, son of Cairbre Cinnchait.</ref> And the paralleling theme is recognizable as the ubiquitous one of \"King and His Prophesied Death\" according to other scholars. And certainly the prophecy of death by the hand of one's child or grandchild occurs in the Cian-Balor folktale as well as the Greek stories of [[Perseus]] and [[Oedipus Rex]].{{Refn|{{harvp|Gruffydd|1928|pp=8, 366}}, apud {{harvp|Loomis|1929|p=140}}<ref name=loomis-rev-gruffydd/>}}<ref name=olaverty/>\n\n==Explanatory notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n;Citations\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=brown-sirperceval5>{{citation|last=Brown|first=Arthur C.

And O'Donovan in his preceding remarks notes that the memory of Balor \"general of the Fomorians is still vividly remembered.. throughout Ireland\" (p. 18).}}{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|The flowery description of Balor such as \"float among the peasantry\" was lamented by O'Curry,{{sfnp|O'Curry|1863|p=166}} and the details are eschewed by Lady Gregory, who replaces it with an account from [[Cath Maige Tuired|CMT]] which O'Curry suggests deserves more attention.}}\n\nBalor learns from a druid's prophecy that he will be killed by his own grandson. To prevent this he imprisons his only daughter Ethnea in the tower which stands on a tall rock formation called the Tor M\u00f3r, or \"Great Tower\".{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|The spelling is \"Toremore\" as occurs in the original printed by O'Donovan, but [[Arbois de Jubainville]] gives ''tor-mor'' glossed as \"great tower\".{{sfnp|Arbois de Jubainville|1903|pp=117\u2013118}} Note that the tower of [[Conand (mythology)|Conan mac Febrail]] the Fomorian is recontexted and referred to as \"Tower of Glass\" floating in the sea in Nennius's geography of Ireland.{{sfnp|Arbois de Jubainville|1903|pp=67\u201368}} In Lady Gregory's retelling, Balor lives in the Glass Tower, and his daughter (given the name Ethlinn for consistency) is locked up in \"the tower on the island\".}}\n\nMac Kineely (=Cian) owns a prolific milch-cow called \"Glos Gavlin\" (''rect\u00e9'' {{lang-ga|Glas Gaibhnenn}}), which is coveted by everyone including Balor. While the cow is in the care of Mac Kineely's brother Mac Samthainn, Balor appears in the form of a little red-haired boy and tricks him into handing him the cow. Mac Kineely=Cian wishes to reclaim the cow, but is advised that he can only succeed when Balor is dead. Cian then consults Biroge ([[Bir\u00f3g]]<ref name=rolleston/>) of the Mountain, who is his ''[[leanan s\u00eddhe]]'' or [[familiar spirit]] and a  [[banshee]]{{efn|a druidess in Lady Gregory.}} and she transports him by magic to the top of Balor's tower, where he seduces Ehnea.{{efn|Presumably Mac Kineely{{=}}Cian (or Bir\u00f3g) knew that Balor was fated to be killed by his grandchild.}}{{efn|Also, Cian is sneaked into the tower disguised as a woman, wearing female attire, because only female attendants are allowed near the daughter.}}\n\nIn time Ethnea gives birth to triplets, which Balor gathers up in a sheet and sends out to be drowned in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies but unwittingly drops one child (unnamed in the original telling, but Lugh in Lady Gregory's version) into the harbour, where he is rescued by Bir\u00f3g. She takes the baby to his father, who gives him to his brother, [[Goibniu|Gavida]] the smith, in fosterage.{{efn|This is changed by Lady Gregory to fosterage under \"Taillte, daughter of the King of the Great Plain\",{{sfnp|Gregory|1905|p=121}} which conforms with adoption by [[Tailtiu]] as given in the LGE.

The name Dul Dauna taken at face value is glossed as \"the blind stubborn\" (< ''{{linktext|dall}}'') by Larminie  and \"black surly one\" (< ''{{linktext|doilbh}}''?) by Westropp, but is also thought to be a corruption of Lugh's byname ''Ildanach'' \"master of all knowledge\".{{sfnp|Larminie|1893|p=251}}<ref name=westropp/> However, the boy is called by something close to the god's name, namely Lui Lavada (Lui Longhand) in two tales collected by Curtin .<ref name=curtin-p283-donegal/><ref>{{harvp|Curtin|1911|pp=296\u2013311}} \"Balor of the Evil Eye and Lui Lavada his Grandson\" ([[Connemara]], [[County Galway|Co.

Although the tale does not explicitly identify Lleu's father, it has been asserted that Lleu was Gwydion's \"incestuously begotten son\",<ref name=mackillop-gwydion/> thus making Gwydion the Welsh equivalent of Cian.\n\nThe emphasis of study is the parallel between Gwydion and Cian=MacKineely of Irish folktale (rather than Cian of the mythological tracts or ''OCT'') in the case of Welsh scholar [[John Rhys]] has pursued.{{sfnp|Rhys|1886|pp=314\u2013321}}\n\nOne parallel is that the newborn are unwanted by their forebears and condemned to die, but survive.<ref>{{harvp|Rhys|1886|pp=314\u2013321}}. Rhys does not state this directly as a parallel between the Mabinogi tale ''Math'' (pp. 307\u2013308) and the Irish folktales of the Cow (p. 317), because he introduces additional tales that he deems to be cognate or related, namely the legends surrounding Cairbre M\u00fasc (pp. 308\u2013309) and [[Cairbre Cinnchait]] (p. 310). The explicit comparison (p. 317) is between \"Lug\" (son of Cian{{=}}Mackineely) and Moran, son of Cairbre Cinnchait.</ref> And the paralleling theme is recognizable as the ubiquitous one of \"King and His Prophesied Death\" according to other scholars. And certainly the prophecy of death by the hand of one's child or grandchild occurs in the Cian-Balor folktale as well as the Greek stories of [[Perseus]] and [[Oedipus Rex]].{{Refn|{{harvp|Gruffydd|1928|pp=8, 366}}, apud {{harvp|Loomis|1929|p=140}}<ref name=loomis-rev-gruffydd/>}}<ref name=olaverty/>\n\n==Explanatory notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n;Citations\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=brown-sirperceval5>{{citation|last=Brown|first=Arthur C.

He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] representing the state's [[Pennsylvania Senate, District 50|50th district]]. He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until he committed suicide during a press conference.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted \nfor accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.\n\nOn January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself with a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1638F930A15752C0A961948260|title=Official calls in press and kills himself|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=January 23, 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref> Dwyer's [[suicide]] was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution. In 2010, the prosecution's main witness, [[William Trickett Smith]], maintained that his testimony at Dwyer's 1986 trial\u2014 in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted this offer\u2014  was truthful, and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe; moreover, Smith stated in October 1984\u2014 the year before his own trial\u2014 that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted it.<ref name=\"Honest Man\">{{Cite web|url = http://dwyermovie.com/|title = Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (documentary movie)|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Eighty Four Films|last = |first =}}</ref><ref name=\"Latrobe\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42456853/latrobe_bulletin/|title=New evidence challenges Dwyer|last=Morris|first=David|date=February 18, 1987|work=Latrobe Bulletin|access-date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live|pages=4}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:R.

Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American [[Gulag]].\n\nI ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.\n\nWe were confident that right and truth would prevail and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system[,] people have said, 'Why bother? No one cares, you'll look foolish, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years and it doesn't bother anyone.'}}\n\nAt this point, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows:\n\n{{quote|I've repeatedly said that I'm not going to resign as State Treasurer. After many hours of thought and meditation I've made a decision that should not be an example to anyone because it is unique to my situation. Last May I told you that after the trial, I would give you the story of the decade. To those of you who are shallow, the events of this morning will be that story. But to those of you with depth and concern the real story will be what I hope and pray results from this morning\u2013in the coming months and years[,] the development of a true justice system here in the United States. I am going to die in office in an effort to ' ... see if the shame[-ful] facts, spread out in all their shame, will not burn through our civic shamelessness and set fire to American pride.' Please tell my story on every radio and television station and in every newspaper and magazine in the U.S. Please leave immediately if you have a weak stomach or mind since I don't want to cause physical or mental distress. Joanne, Rob, DeeDee [''sic''] - I love you! Thank you for making my life so happy. Good bye to you all on the count of 3. Please make sure that the sacrifice of my life is not in vain.}}\n\nAfter deciding to break from his speech, Dwyer called to three of his staffers, giving each a sealed envelope with the insignia of the treasury department.<ref name=\"PittsburghPress\" /> The first envelope, given to [[Bob Holste]], contained a letter addressed to then-Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert P. Casey|Bob Casey]], who had taken office just two days earlier. The second, given to deputy press secretary Gregory Penny, contained an [[organ donation|organ donor]] card and other related materials.

When the crowd in the room saw what Dwyer had pulled out of the envelope, the mood changed immediately from one of waiting to see whether he would resign his office to one of panic as nobody knew what he was planning to do with the gun. People gasped, and Dwyer backed up against the wall, holding the weapon close to his body.

However, the latter two allowed the audio of the shooting to continue under the frozen image. Group W's news cameraman William L. \"Bill\" Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze-frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth. Only a handful aired the unedited press conference.

[[WPXI-TV|WPXI]] in [[Pittsburgh]] is reported by the [[Associated Press]] to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast.

He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until he committed suicide during a press conference.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted \nfor accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.\n\nOn January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself with a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1638F930A15752C0A961948260|title=Official calls in press and kills himself|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=January 23, 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref> Dwyer's [[suicide]] was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution. In 2010, the prosecution's main witness, [[William Trickett Smith]], maintained that his testimony at Dwyer's 1986 trial\u2014 in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted this offer\u2014  was truthful, and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe; moreover, Smith stated in October 1984\u2014 the year before his own trial\u2014 that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted it.<ref name=\"Honest Man\">{{Cite web|url = http://dwyermovie.com/|title = Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (documentary movie)|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Eighty Four Films|last = |first =}}</ref><ref name=\"Latrobe\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42456853/latrobe_bulletin/|title=New evidence challenges Dwyer|last=Morris|first=David|date=February 18, 1987|work=Latrobe Bulletin|access-date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live|pages=4}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:R.

Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21-page prepared text later described as a \"rambling polemic about the criminal justice system\".<ref name=\"PennLiveNewFilm\" /> It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him.<ref name=\"philly-archives1987-01-24\" /> Dwyer stated that Attorney West purposely had Dwyer's trial not in Harrisburg but in Williamsport, since in Williamsport the jury pool was the most uneducated in the state of Pennsylvania.<ref>[https://www.dropbox.com/s/sao4iw2mrb76693/Dwyer_Final_Statements.pdf?dl=0 Dropbox - Dwyer_Final_Statements.pdf - Simplify your life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Dwyer spoke out against the death penalty and expressed regret for voting in favor of it while he was in the Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, \"Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet.\"<ref name=\"philly-archives1987-01-23\" />\n\nGiven the inflammatory nature of portions of Dwyer's text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him but concluded that he would hold his own press conference after Dwyer's. \"I had to make it known that I was not aware of the content of the statement. I didn't want it to be thought that I wrote that for him.\"<ref name=\"PittsburghPress\" />\n\nUpon reaching the final page of his statement, which had not been distributed to the press nor press secretary Horshock in advance, Dwyer paused. \"...and I'm on the last page now, and I don't have enough to pass out, but Duke [Horshock], I'll leave this here, and you can make copies for the people; there's a few extra copies here right now.\"<ref>Video containing audio of final words ([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6686827830708949101 link])</ref> Dwyer continued,\n\n{{quote|I thank the good Lord for giving me 47 years of exciting challenges, stimulating experiences, many happy occasions and most of all[,] the finest wife and children any man could ever desire.\n\nNow my life has changed for no apparent reason. People who call and write are exasperated and feel helpless. They know I am innocent and want to help, but in this nation, the worlds [''sic''] greatest democracy, there is nothing they can do to prevent me from being punished for a crime they know I did not commit. Some who have called have said that I am a modern day [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]].\n\nJudge Muir is also noted for his medieval sentences. I face a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison and a $305,000 fine for being innocent. Judge Muir has already told the press that he felt \"invigorated\" when we were found guilty and that he plans to imprison me as a \"deterrant\" to other public officials. But it wouldn't be a deterrant [''sic''] because every public official who knows me knows that I am innocent. It wouldn't be legitimate punishment because I've done nothing wrong. Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American [[Gulag]].\n\nI ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.\n\nWe were confident that right and truth would prevail and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system[,] people have said, 'Why bother? No one cares, you'll look foolish, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years and it doesn't bother anyone.'}}\n\nAt this point, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows:\n\n{{quote|I've repeatedly said that I'm not going to resign as State Treasurer. After many hours of thought and meditation I've made a decision that should not be an example to anyone because it is unique to my situation. Last May I told you that after the trial, I would give you the story of the decade. To those of you who are shallow, the events of this morning will be that story. But to those of you with depth and concern the real story will be what I hope and pray results from this morning\u2013in the coming months and years[,] the development of a true justice system here in the United States.

However, the latter two allowed the audio of the shooting to continue under the frozen image. Group W's news cameraman William L. \"Bill\" Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze-frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth. Only a handful aired the unedited press conference.

[[WPXI-TV|WPXI]] in [[Pittsburgh]] is reported by the [[Associated Press]] to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast.

In his [[will (law)|will]] dated 8 July 1557, he left the property and [[financial endowment|endowments]] towards establishing the school.\n\nThe will had left the property to his brother [[William Glyn (1504-1558)|William Glyn]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] and [[Maurice Griffith]], [[Bishop of Rochester]] to execute his wishes. Unfortunately both of these were to die in the following year,<ref>Barber & Lewis (1901), p.20</ref> but they further transferred the will to Sir [[William Petre]], a former [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], Sir [[William Garrard]], a former [[Lord Mayor of London]] and [[Simon Lowe alias Fyfield|Simon Lowe]], a London merchant tailor, who were able to execute Geoffrey Glyn's intentions.<ref name = WOW30>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.30</ref>\n\nAlthough a school had been meeting in the city before this date,<ref name = WOW30 /><ref>Griffith (1988), p.139</ref> the new school was only formally established when it received [[letter patent|letters patent]] from [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1561. The school was to be known as ''The free grammar school of Geoffrey Glyn, Doctor of Laws'', but because of the connection with the Black Friars, later became known as \"Friars School\". The letters patent established the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] and Chapter of [[Bangor Cathedral]] as the corporation to govern the school. In 1568, statutes were adopted to regulate the schools, based closely on the statutes of [[King Edward VI School (Bury St Edmunds)|Bury St. Edmunds School]] in Suffolk, founded a few years earlier.<ref name = WOW30 /><ref>Clarke (1955)</ref>\n\nThe school has been established to provide a free grammar school education for the boys of the poor. This comprised a [[Classics|classical education]], in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] only.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.34\u201336</ref> The children who benefited were not the most poor, but the middle class preparing for a career in the ministry or the law like Geoffrey Glyn himself.\n\nThe school was maintained from income on the endowments left by Geoffrey Glyn and later benefactors, mainly rents on land in [[Southwark]] and a rent charge on land in [[Oswestry]] purchased using money left by Glyn.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.29</ref>\n\nThe school continued in the old friary, close to the banks of the [[River Adda (Wales)|River Adda]] for over two centuries <small>(at {{Coord|53.231|-4.124|display=inline|format=dms|region:GB_type:edu|name=Friars School 1557 site}})</small>.\n\n===The second building, 1789===\n[[File:Friars-barber&lewis1789.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School building of 1789 to 1900]]\nUnder the patronage of [[John Warren (bishop)|John Warren]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] \u2013 a colourful and controversial character \u2013 the school was transferred to a better site, a little further from the river. This was financed partly by closing the school in 1786, an accumulating the money saved from the endowment for a building fund. The new school was built for \u00a32,076 12s 5\u00bdd, and opened in 1789 on a site <small> (at {{Coord|53.230|-4.122|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu|name=Friars School 1789 site}})</small>, all closer to the High Street and the present Glynne Road.<ref>[[Aled Eames]] in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.58</ref>\n\nThe curriculum slowly developed to include mathematics, writing and other subject more familiar to today's school students.\n\nThe school's fortunes were varied. The move boosted the school. But by the middle of the 19th century, under the headship of Totton, the schools\u2019 reputation suffered, and ultimately lost so many pupils that it was forced to close in 1861.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.66\u201368</ref> It re-opened in 1866 and a new headmaster, [[Daniel Lewis Lloyd|Lewis Lloyd]] appointed in 1872, when a new secular governing body was introduced in place of the Dean and Chapter.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.70</ref>\n\nIn 1881, an epidemic of [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] in Bangor caused the school to move to [[Penmaenmawr]] to avoid the disease.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.73</ref> The bottom of the valley, especially close to the river, was unhygienic, and this episode engendered consideration of moving away to a fresh site.\n\nAt this time, too, the [[Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889]] introduced a state system of secondary education in Wales. Some charity and private schools were exempted from its provisions and there had been advocates for Friars, too, to be exempted, but ultimately this brought Friars School into the state system, under [[Caernarfonshire]] [[County council]].<ref name = AE74>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.74</ref>\n\n===The third building, 1900===\n[[File:Friars-ffriddoedd.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School Ffriddoedd building, site of the school 1900\u20131999]]\nWith contributions from Caernarfonshire County Council, the proceeds of selling the old site, together with a public appeal for funds, a new school was built on Ffriddoedd Road for a cost of \u00a311,600. The architect was [[John Douglas, architect (1830-1911)|John Douglas]] of Douglas & Minishull, and builders Messrs. James Hamilton & son of [[Altrincham]]. A foundation stone was laid by [[Watkin Herbert Williams]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] on 12 April 1899, and the building was opened in December 1900 <small>(at {{Coord|53.2234|-4.1437|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu|name=Friars School 1900 site}})</small>.<ref name = AE74 />\n\nIn moving to the Ffriddoedd site, the intention had been to move out to the countryside. After the typhoid outbreak, and with the unsanitary condition of the lower Adda valley, Ffriddoedd was seen as a healthy rural alternative. However, the development of the city was to catch up. To preserve a little of that rural idyll as the area developed, Dr. R. L. Archer, a former Chairman of the Governors, in 1955 bequeathed to the school a small plot of land. Known as \"Dr. Archer's plot\", this was to be planted with flowers and kept for ever green.<ref>\u2019Recitation of Benefactors, Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving\u2019 (1957), Friars School</ref>\n\nIn 1957, several events commemorated the fourth centenary of the school.

As a grammar school, education was selective, boys having to pass the [[eleven plus exam]] to gain admission.\n\nA significant reorganisation in 1971 combined three schools \u2013 Friars School, the Bangor County School for Girls (also a grammar school), and Deiniol School, a co-educational [[Secondary modern school]]. The three schools brought together formed a new [[comprehensive school]], under the Friars name, but on three sites. The former girls\u2019 school became the Tryfan site, a [[Welsh language]] medium for the lower years, while the Ffriddoedd building was the location of the English language medium lower years. The senior years came together at a new building, built for \u00a3300,000<ref name = Dominican71>''The Dominican'', Summer Term 1971, Friars School</ref> on a new site at Eithinog.\n\nA further reorganisation in 1978 split the school in two: [[Ysgol Tryfan]] was formed as an 11\u201318 Welsh medium school on the Tryfan site. Friars School became a mainly English-medium school on Ffriddoedd and Eithinog sites.\n\nShoddy building practices of the 1960s meant that the Eithinog building had to be almost completely rebuilt over the following few decades. These were gradually replaced and expanded, until the whole school was able to relocate to Eithinog in 1999. The final contract for completing the school was valued at \u00a35.4 million.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | title = CLAW Annual Report, 2001 | author = CLAW | year = 2001 | accessdate = 15 August 2007 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006215354/http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | archivedate = 6 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn that year, the former Friars building at Ffriddoedd was sold to further education college [[Coleg Menai]] and continues in educational use.<ref name = civic />\n\n===Celebrating 450 years===\nA Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving was held in [[Bangor Cathedral]] in April 2007 to mark 450 years of Friars School.<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6574755.stm\n | title = BBC News article | accessdate = 22 April 2007\n | author = BBC | date=20 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==The modern school==\nSince 1999, the present school has been united on the Eithinog site.\n\nIt is a comprehensive school for the 11\u201318 age group, and draws pupils from a wide area around Bangor.

In his [[will (law)|will]] dated 8 July 1557, he left the property and [[financial endowment|endowments]] towards establishing the school.\n\nThe will had left the property to his brother [[William Glyn (1504-1558)|William Glyn]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] and [[Maurice Griffith]], [[Bishop of Rochester]] to execute his wishes. Unfortunately both of these were to die in the following year,<ref>Barber & Lewis (1901), p.20</ref> but they further transferred the will to Sir [[William Petre]], a former [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], Sir [[William Garrard]], a former [[Lord Mayor of London]] and [[Simon Lowe alias Fyfield|Simon Lowe]], a London merchant tailor, who were able to execute Geoffrey Glyn's intentions.<ref name = WOW30>W.

The school was to be known as ''The free grammar school of Geoffrey Glyn, Doctor of Laws'', but because of the connection with the Black Friars, later became known as \"Friars School\". The letters patent established the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] and Chapter of [[Bangor Cathedral]] as the corporation to govern the school. In 1568, statutes were adopted to regulate the schools, based closely on the statutes of [[King Edward VI School (Bury St Edmunds)|Bury St. Edmunds School]] in Suffolk, founded a few years earlier.<ref name = WOW30 /><ref>Clarke (1955)</ref>\n\nThe school has been established to provide a free grammar school education for the boys of the poor. This comprised a [[Classics|classical education]], in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] only.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.34\u201336</ref> The children who benefited were not the most poor, but the middle class preparing for a career in the ministry or the law like Geoffrey Glyn himself.\n\nThe school was maintained from income on the endowments left by Geoffrey Glyn and later benefactors, mainly rents on land in [[Southwark]] and a rent charge on land in [[Oswestry]] purchased using money left by Glyn.<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.29</ref>\n\nThe school continued in the old friary, close to the banks of the [[River Adda (Wales)|River Adda]] for over two centuries <small>(at {{Coord|53.231|-4.124|display=inline|format=dms|region:GB_type:edu|name=Friars School 1557 site}})</small>.\n\n===The second building, 1789===\n[[File:Friars-barber&lewis1789.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School building of 1789 to 1900]]\nUnder the patronage of [[John Warren (bishop)|John Warren]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] \u2013 a colourful and controversial character \u2013 the school was transferred to a better site, a little further from the river. This was financed partly by closing the school in 1786, an accumulating the money saved from the endowment for a building fund. The new school was built for \u00a32,076 12s 5\u00bdd, and opened in 1789 on a site <small> (at {{Coord|53.230|-4.122|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu|name=Friars School 1789 site}})</small>, all closer to the High Street and the present Glynne Road.<ref>[[Aled Eames]] in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.58</ref>\n\nThe curriculum slowly developed to include mathematics, writing and other subject more familiar to today's school students.\n\nThe school's fortunes were varied. The move boosted the school. But by the middle of the 19th century, under the headship of Totton, the schools\u2019 reputation suffered, and ultimately lost so many pupils that it was forced to close in 1861.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), pp.66\u201368</ref> It re-opened in 1866 and a new headmaster, [[Daniel Lewis Lloyd|Lewis Lloyd]] appointed in 1872, when a new secular governing body was introduced in place of the Dean and Chapter.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.70</ref>\n\nIn 1881, an epidemic of [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] in Bangor caused the school to move to [[Penmaenmawr]] to avoid the disease.<ref>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.73</ref> The bottom of the valley, especially close to the river, was unhygienic, and this episode engendered consideration of moving away to a fresh site.\n\nAt this time, too, the [[Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889]] introduced a state system of secondary education in Wales. Some charity and private schools were exempted from its provisions and there had been advocates for Friars, too, to be exempted, but ultimately this brought Friars School into the state system, under [[Caernarfonshire]] [[County council]].<ref name = AE74>Eames in Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.74</ref>\n\n===The third building, 1900===\n[[File:Friars-ffriddoedd.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friars School Ffriddoedd building, site of the school 1900\u20131999]]\nWith contributions from Caernarfonshire County Council, the proceeds of selling the old site, together with a public appeal for funds, a new school was built on Ffriddoedd Road for a cost of \u00a311,600. The architect was [[John Douglas, architect (1830-1911)|John Douglas]] of Douglas & Minishull, and builders Messrs. James Hamilton & son of [[Altrincham]]. A foundation stone was laid by [[Watkin Herbert Williams]], [[Bishop of Bangor]] on 12 April 1899, and the building was opened in December 1900 <small>(at {{Coord|53.2234|-4.1437|display=inline|format=dms|type:edu|name=Friars School 1900 site}})</small>.<ref name = AE74 />\n\nIn moving to the Ffriddoedd site, the intention had been to move out to the countryside. After the typhoid outbreak, and with the unsanitary condition of the lower Adda valley, Ffriddoedd was seen as a healthy rural alternative. However, the development of the city was to catch up. To preserve a little of that rural idyll as the area developed, Dr. R. L. Archer, a former Chairman of the Governors, in 1955 bequeathed to the school a small plot of land. Known as \"Dr. Archer's plot\", this was to be planted with flowers and kept for ever green.<ref>\u2019Recitation of Benefactors, Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving\u2019 (1957), Friars School</ref>\n\nIn 1957, several events commemorated the fourth centenary of the school.

As a grammar school, education was selective, boys having to pass the [[eleven plus exam]] to gain admission.\n\nA significant reorganisation in 1971 combined three schools \u2013 Friars School, the Bangor County School for Girls (also a grammar school), and Deiniol School, a co-educational [[Secondary modern school]]. The three schools brought together formed a new [[comprehensive school]], under the Friars name, but on three sites. The former girls\u2019 school became the Tryfan site, a [[Welsh language]] medium for the lower years, while the Ffriddoedd building was the location of the English language medium lower years. The senior years came together at a new building, built for \u00a3300,000<ref name = Dominican71>''The Dominican'', Summer Term 1971, Friars School</ref> on a new site at Eithinog.\n\nA further reorganisation in 1978 split the school in two: [[Ysgol Tryfan]] was formed as an 11\u201318 Welsh medium school on the Tryfan site. Friars School became a mainly English-medium school on Ffriddoedd and Eithinog sites.\n\nShoddy building practices of the 1960s meant that the Eithinog building had to be almost completely rebuilt over the following few decades. These were gradually replaced and expanded, until the whole school was able to relocate to Eithinog in 1999. The final contract for completing the school was valued at \u00a35.4 million.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | title = CLAW Annual Report, 2001 | author = CLAW | year = 2001 | accessdate = 15 August 2007 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006215354/http://www.claw.gov.uk/uploads/media/CLAW_Annual_Report-01.pdf | archivedate = 6 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn that year, the former Friars building at Ffriddoedd was sold to further education college [[Coleg Menai]] and continues in educational use.<ref name = civic />\n\n===Celebrating 450 years===\nA Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving was held in [[Bangor Cathedral]] in April 2007 to mark 450 years of Friars School.<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6574755.stm\n | title = BBC News article | accessdate = 22 April 2007\n | author = BBC | date=20 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==The modern school==\nSince 1999, the present school has been united on the Eithinog site.\n\nIt is a comprehensive school for the 11\u201318 age group, and draws pupils from a wide area around Bangor.
