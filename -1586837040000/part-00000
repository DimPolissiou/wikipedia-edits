The police alleged that the conclave was backed by Maoists.\n\nTeltumbde and Navlakha had approached the high court seeking pre-arrest bail in November last year after a sessions court in Pune had rejected their pleas.\n\nRepresenting Teltumbde and Navlakha, senior Congress leaders & lawyers, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal argued that there was no ''prima facie'' case against the accused. There was also no evidence that connected them to the Bhima Koregaon violence or that they were members of banned Maoists organisations, the lawyers said. However, the Supreme Court order said the bench felt that there was sufficient evidence to file a ''prima facie'' case and dismissed the plea for anticipatory bail.[https://thewire.in/law/bhima-koregaon-covid-19-gautam-navlakha-teltumbde/amp/]\n\n''The Washington Post'' reported that Teltumbe was arrested as part of \"a government crackdown on lawyers and pseudo-seculars\" who are against India's progress ..<ref name=washp /><ref name=nyt /> More than 600 international scholars issued a joint statement in support of Teltumbde, condemning the government's actions as a \"witch-hunt\" and demanding an immediate halt to the actions against Teltumbde.<ref name=twi1>{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/rights/anand-teltumbde-activists-arrested-petition |title=Academics Demand Dropping Charges Against Teltumbde, Other Activists |author= |date=7 February 2019 |website=The Wire (India)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=U.S., European scholars come out in support of Teltumbde |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-european-scholars-come-out-in-support-of-teltumbde/article26200491.ece |accessdate=28 March 2019 |work=The Hindu |date=7 February 2019}}</ref> In addition, over 150 organizations and intellectuals \u2014 including [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Cornel West]]\u2014signed a letter to [[United Nations]] secretary general [[Antonio Guterres]], describing the charges as \"fabricated\" and calling for the UN to intervene.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/asia/india-modi-intellectuals-dissent.html |title=Indian Professor Who Compared Modi to Hitler Is Waiting to Be Jailed |first1=Kai |last1=Schultz |first2=Jeffrey |last2=Gettleman |first3=Hari |last3=Kumar |date=20 February 2019 |newspaper=The New York Times |quote=Human rights activists say the allegations are part of a crackdown on intellectuals who criticize Mr. Modi's record, especially his government's treatment of religious minorities and lower castes.}}</ref>\n\nTeltumbde's mobile phone was hacked by Israeli spyware [[Pegasus (spyware)|Pegasus]] through [[WhatsApp]] along with over a dozen other activists, lawyers, and journalists in India.<ref name=hack>{{cite news |last1=Satheesh |first1=Shone |title=Indian activists, lawyers accuse government of spying on them |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/indian-activists-lawyers-accuse-government-spying-191101084129315.html |work=Al Jazerra |date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chishti |first1=Seema |title=WhatsApp confirms: Israeli spyware was used to snoop on Indian journalists, activists |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/ |work=The Indian Express |date=1 November 2019 |language=en-IN}}</ref> Teltumbe had noticed his phone had been \"acting up\" and was later contacted by [[Citizen Lab]] in October 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mahale |first1=Ajeet |title=Spyware targeted prominent human rights activists in Maharashtra |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/spyware-targeted-prominent-human-rights-activists-in-state/article29846805.ece |work=The Hindu |date=1 November 2019 |language=en-IN}}</ref>\nOn March 16 Indian Supreme Court rejected pre-arrest bail and gave him three weeks to surrender.
