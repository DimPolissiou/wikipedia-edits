{"title_page": "URL redirection", "text_new": "{{Selfref|For redirection on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Redirect]].}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n'''URL redirection''', also cccccalled '''URL forwarding''', is a [[World Wide Web]] technique gor making a [[web page]] available under more than one [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] address. When a [[web browser]] attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL [[Domain name|domain]] are redirected to a different domain, as when [http://www.wikipedia.com wikipedia.com] and [http://www.wikipedia.net wikipedia.net] are automatically redirected to [http://www.wikipedia.org wikipedia.org].\n\nURL redirection is done for various reasons:\n* for [[URL shortening]];\n* to prevent [[link rot|broken links]] when web pages are moved;\n* to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single [[website|web site]];\n* to guide navigation into and out of a website;\n* for privacy protection; and\n* for hostile purposes such as [[phishing]] attacks or malware distribution.\n\n== Purposes ==\nThere are several reasons to use URL redirection:\n\n=== Similar domain names ===\nA user might mistype a URL, for example, \"example.com\" and \"exmaple.com\". Organizations often register these \"misspelled\" domains and redirect them to the \"correct\" location: example.com. The addresses example.com and example.net could both redirect to a single domain, or web page, such as example.org. This technique is often used to \"reserve\" other [[top-level domain]]s (TLD) with the same name, or make it easier for a true \".edu\" or \".net\" to redirect to a more recognizable \".com\" domain.\n\n=== Moving pages to a new domain ===\nWeb pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons:\n* a site might desire, or need, to change its domain name;\n* an author might move his or her individual pages to a new domain;\n* two web sites might merge.\n\nWith URL redirects, incoming links to an outdated URL can be sent to the correct location. These links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks/favorites that users have saved in their browsers. The same applies to [[search engine]]s. They often have the older/outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old URLs. By using a \"moved permanently\" redirect to the new URL, visitors will still end up at the correct page. Also, in the next search engine pass, the search engine should detect and use the newer URL.\n\n=== Logging outgoing links ===\nThe access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site.  They do not, however, log which links visitors left by.  This is because the visitor's browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link. This information can be captured in several ways.  One way involves URL redirection.  Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website's domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website's server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | title = Google revives redirect snoopery\n  | journal = Blog.anta.net\n  | date = 29 January 2009\n  | url = http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | issn = 1797-1993\n  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817024348/http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | archivedate=17 August 2011\n}}</ref> The same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.\n\n=== Short aliases for long URLs ===\n{{Main|URL shortening}}\n\nWeb applications often include lengthy descriptive attributes in their URLs which represent data hierarchies, command structures, transaction paths and session information. This practice results in a URL that is aesthetically unpleasant and difficult to remember, and which may not fit within the size limitations of [[microblogging]] sites. [[URL shortening]] services provide a solution to this problem by redirecting a user to a longer URL from a shorter one.\n\n=== Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs ===\n{{See also|Permalink|PURL|Link rot}}\n\nSometimes the URL of a page changes even though the content stays the same. Therefore, URL redirection can help users who have bookmarks. This is routinely done on Wikipedia whenever a page is renamed.\n\n=== Post/Redirect/Get ===\n{{Main|Post/Redirect/Get}}\n\nPost/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a [[web development]] [[design pattern]] that prevents some duplicate [[form (web)|form]] submissions if the user clicks the refresh button after submitting the form, creating a more intuitive interface for [[user agent]]s (users).\n\n=== Device targeting and geotargeting ===\n\nRedirects can be effectively used for targeting purposes like [[geotargeting]]. Device targeting has become increasingly important with the rise of mobile clients. There are two approaches to serve mobile users: Make the website [[responsive web design|responsive]] or redirect to a mobile website version. If a mobile website version is offered, users with mobile clients will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding mobile content. For device targeting, client-side redirects or non-cacheable server-side redirects are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually server-side redirects are used for Geotargeting but client-side redirects might be an option as well, depending on requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Total Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating search engines ===\nRedirects have been used to manipulate search engines with unethical intentions, e.g., [[URL hijacking]]. The goal of misleading redirects is to drive search traffic to landing pages, which do not have enough ranking power on their own or which are only remotely or not at all related to the search target. The approach requires a rank for a range of search terms with a number of URLs that would utilize sneaky redirects to forward the searcher to the target page. This method had a revival with the uprise of mobile devices and device targeting. URL hijacking is an off-domain redirect technique<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-advice-discussing-302-redirects/ |title=SEO advice: discussing 302 redirects |date=4 January 2006 |publisher=Matt Cutts, former Head of Google Webspam Team}}</ref> that exploited the nature of the search engine's handling for temporary redirects. If a temporary redirect is encountered, search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the URL that initializes the redirect or to the redirect target URL. The URL that initiates the redirect may be kept to show up in search results, as the redirect indicates a temporary nature. Under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behaviour by applying temporary redirects to well-ranking URLs, leading to a replacement of the original URL in search results by the URL that initialized the redirect, therefore \"stealing\" the ranking. This method was usually combined with sneaky redirects to re-target the user stream from the search results to a target page. Search engines have developed efficient technologies to detect these kinds of manipulative approaches. Major search engines usually apply harsh ranking penalties on sites that get caught applying techniques like these.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en |title=Sneaky Redirects |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=Google Webmaster Guidelines}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating visitors ===\nURL redirection is sometimes used as a part of [[phishing]] attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet |title=Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet |date=21 August 2014 |publisher=Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)}}</ref> Because modern browsers always show the real URL in the address bar, the threat is lessened. However, redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways. For example, a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and installing a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] of some sort instead.\n\n=== Removing <code>referer</code> information ===\nWhen a link is clicked, the browser sends along in the [[HTTP request]] a field called [[HTTP referer|referer]] which indicates the source of the link. This field is populated with the URL of the current web page, and will end up in the [[server log|logs]] of the server serving the external link. Since sensitive pages may have sensitive URLs (for example, <code><nowiki>http://company.com/plans-for-the-next-release-of-our-product</nowiki></code>), it is not desirable for the <code>referer</code> URL to leave the organization. A redirection page that performs [[Referer#Referrer hiding|referrer hiding]] could be embedded in all external URLs, transforming for example <code><nowiki>http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code> into <code><nowiki>http://redirect.company.com/http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code>. This technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referer URL, such as the [[session ID]], and can reduce the chance of [[phishing]] by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site.\n\n== Implementation ==\nSeveral different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection.  These vary in whether they affect [[HTTP headers]] or HTML content.  The techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system.  For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a [[meta refresh|Refresh meta tag]] whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.\n\n=== Manual redirect ===\nThe simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis method is often used as a fall-back&nbsp;\u2014 if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.\n\n=== HTTP status codes 3xx ===\nIn the [[HTTP]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used by the [[World Wide Web]], a '''redirect''' is a response with a [[List of HTTP status codes|status code]] beginning with ''3'' that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a redirect, it needs to make a number of decisions how to handle the redirect. Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the redirect, how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.\n\nHTTP/1.1 defines several status codes for redirection (RFC 7231):\n* [[HTTP 300|300 multiple choices]] (e.g. offer different languages)\n* [[HTTP 301|301 moved permanently]] (redirects permanently from one URL to another passing link equity to the redirected page)\n* [[HTTP 302|302 found]] (originally \"temporary redirect\" in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)\n* [[HTTP 303|303 see other]] (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)\n* [[HTTP 307|307 temporary redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n* [[HTTP 308|308 permanent redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n\n==== Redirect status codes and characteristics ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! HTTP Status Code !! HTTP Version !! Temporary / Permanent !! Cacheable !! Request Method Subsequent Request\n|-\n| 301 || HTTP/1.0 || Permanent || {{yes}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 302 || HTTP/1.0 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 303 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no|never}} || always GET\n|-\n| 307 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || may not change\n|-\n| 308 || HTTP/1.1 || Permanent || {{yes2|by default}} || may not change\n|-\n|}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Complete Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\nAll of these status codes require the URL of the redirect target to be given in the Location: header of the HTTP response. The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the Location: header.\n\n(Status codes [[HTTP 304|304 not modified]] and [[HTTP 305|305 use proxy]] are not redirects).\n\n==== Example HTTP response for a 301 redirect ====\n\nA [[HTTP]] response with the 301 \"moved permanently\" redirect looks like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://www.example.org/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 174\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Moved</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Moved</h1>\n<p>This page has moved to <a href=\"http://www.example.org/\">http://www.example.org/</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Using server-side scripting for redirection ====\nWeb authors producing HTML content can't usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file.  The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling \"non-parsed-headers\").  Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a \"Location:\" header line.  For example, in [[PHP]], one can use the \"header\" function:\n\n<source lang=\"php\">\nheader('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');\nheader('Location: http://www.example.com/');\nexit();\n</source>\n\nMore headers may be required to prevent caching.<ref name=\"php-301-robust-solution\">{{cite web|url=http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution/ |title=PHP Redirects: 302 to 301 Rock Solid Robust Solution |publisher=WebSiteFactors.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012042703/http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution |archivedate=12 October 2012}}</ref> The programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body.  This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code.  To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data.  In the [[Active Server Pages|ASP scripting]] language, this can also be accomplished using <code>response.buffer=true</code> and <code>response.redirect <nowiki>\"http://www.example.com/\"</nowiki></code> HTTP/1.1 allows for either a relative URI reference or an absolute URI reference.<ref>{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 7.1.2 | sectionname = Location | page = 68 | editor1 = Roy T.

Typical configuration directives look like:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRedirect permanent /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\nRedirect 301 /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\n</source>\n\nFor more flexible [[URL rewriting]] and redirection, Apache mod_rewrite can be used. E.g., to redirect a requests to a canonical domain name:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.:]+\\.)*oldsite\\.example\\.com\\.?(:[0-9]*)?$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://newsite.example.net/$1 [R=301,L]\n</source>\n\nSuch configuration can be applied to one or all sites on the server through the server configuration files or to a single content directory through a <code>[[.htaccess]]</code> file.\n\n==== nginx rewrite ====\n[[Nginx]] has an integrated http rewrite module,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nginx.org/r/rewrite |title=Module ngx_http_rewrite_module - rewrite |publisher=nginx.org |accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> which can be used to perform advanced URL processing and even web-page generation (with the <tt>return</tt> directive).  A showing example of such advanced use of the rewrite module is [http://mdoc.su/ mdoc.su], which implements a deterministic [[URL shortening]] service entirely with the help of nginx configuration language alone.<ref>{{cite mailing list |date=18 February 2013 |url=http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2013-February/037592.html |mailinglist=nginx@nginx.org |title=A dynamic web-site written wholly in nginx.conf?

This can specify a new URL to replace one page with another.  This is supported by most web browsers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp|title=HTML meta tag|website=www.w3schools.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|title=An Exploration of Dynamic Documents|date=2 August 2002|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802170847/http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|archivedate=2 August 2002|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A timeout of zero seconds effects an immediate redirect. This is treated like a 301 permanent redirect by Google, allowing transfer of PageRank to the target page.<ref>[http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/google-and-yahoo-treat-undelayed-meta-refresh-as-301-redirect/ \"Google and Yahoo accept undelayed meta refreshs as 301 redirects\"]. Sebastian's Pamphlets. 3 September 2007.</ref>\n\nThis is an example of a simple HTML document that uses this technique:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Refresh\" content=\"0; url=http://www.example.com/\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n  <p>Please follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThis technique can be used by [[Web designer|web authors]] because the meta tag is contained inside the document itself.  The meta tag must be placed in the \"head\" section of the HTML file.  The number \"0\" in this example may be replaced by another number to achieve a delay of that many seconds.  The anchor in the \"body\" section is for users whose browsers do not support this feature.\n\nThe same effect can be achieved with an HTTP <code>refresh</code> header:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nRefresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 78\n\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis response is easier to generate by CGI programs because one does not need to change the default status code.\n\nHere is a simple CGI program that effects this redirect:\n<source lang=\"perl\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint \"Refresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Content-Type: text/html\\r\\n\";\nprint \"\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Please follow <a href=\\\"http://www.example.com/\\\">this link</a>!\"\n</source>\n\nNote: Usually, the HTTP server adds the status line and the Content-Length header automatically.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] discourage the use of meta refresh, since it does not communicate any information about either the original or new resource, to the browser (or [[search engine]]). The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#tech-no-periodic-refresh|title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate.  Some articles that they have written on the issue include [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-movement W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (1.0): Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes], Use standard redirects: don't break the back button!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback|title=Use standard redirects|first=the QA|last=Team|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> and Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 section 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#auto-page-refresh|title=Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref>\n\n=== JavaScript redirects ===\n[[JavaScript]] can cause a redirect by setting the <code>window.location</code> attribute, e.g.:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location='http://www.example.com/'\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNormally JavaScript pushes the redirector site's [[URL]] to the browser's history. It can cause redirect loops when users hit the back button. With the following command you can prevent this type of behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insider.zone/tools/client-side-url-redirect-generator/|title=Cross-browser client side URL redirect generator|publisher=Insider Zone}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location.replace('http://www.example.com/')\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHowever, HTTP headers or the refresh meta tag may be preferred for security reasons and because JavaScript will not be executed by some browsers and many [[web crawler]]s.\n\n=== Frame redirects ===\n\nA slightly different effect can be achieved by creating an inline frame:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<iframe height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"http://www.example.com/\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">link</a>.\n</iframe>\n</source>\n\nOne main difference to the above redirect methods is that for a frame redirect, the browser displays the URL of the frame document and not the URL of the target page in the URL bar. This ''cloaking'' technique may be used so that the reader sees a more memorable URL or to fraudulently conceal a [[phishing]] site as part of [[website spoofing]].<ref>Aaron Emigh (19 January 2005).

For example, the URL \"http://wikipedia.com\" (with \"*.com\" as domain) is first redirected to https://www.wikipedia.org/ (with domain name in [[.org]]), where you can navigate to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/ language-specific site]. This is unavoidable if the different links in the chain are served by different servers though it should be minimised by ''[[rewriting]]'' the URL as much as possible on the server before returning it to the browser as a redirect.\n\nWikipedia has been redirecting its pages to HTTPS by default since 2015.<ref>[https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/12/wikipedia-to-start-using-secure-https-by-default-for-all-users/ Wikipedia to start using secure HTTPS by default for all users] VentureBeat article, 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n=== Redirect loops ===\nSometimes a mistake can cause a page to end up redirecting back to itself, possibly via other pages, leading to an infinite sequence of redirects. Browsers should stop redirecting after a certain number of hops and display an error message.\n\nThe HTTP/1.1 Standard states:<ref name=\"rfc7231sec6.4\">{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 6.4 | sectionname = Redirection 3xx | page = 54 | editor1 = Roy T.

Reschke | year = 2014 | publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nA client ''SHOULD'' detect and intervene in cyclical redirections (i.e., \"infinite\" redirection loops).\n\nNote: An earlier version of this specification recommended a maximum of five redirections ([RFC 2068], Section 10.3).  Content developers need to be aware that some clients might implement such a fixed limitation.\n</blockquote>\nNote that the URLs in the sequence might not repeat, e.g.: http://www.example.com/1{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} -> http://www.example.com/2{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} -> http://www.example.com/3{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ...\n\n== Services ==\nThere exist services that can perform URL redirection on demand, with no need for technical work or access to the web server your site is hosted on.\n\n=== URL redirection services ===\nA '''redirect service''' is an information management system, which provides an internet link that redirects users to the desired content. The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the [[Domain Name System]]. Hyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis.  Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.\nRecently, URL redirection services have taken to using [[AJAX]] as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs. A major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.\n\n==== History ====\nThe first redirect services took advantage of [[top-level domains]] (TLD) such as \"[[.to]]\" (Tonga), \"[[.at]]\" (Austria) and \"[[.is]]\" (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000.  V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including \"r.im\", \"go.to\", \"i.am\", \"come.to\" and \"start.at\".  V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | work=BBC News | title=Net gains for tiny Pacific nation | date=14 September 2007 | accessdate=27 May 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232450/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | archivedate=12 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the sales price of top level domains started falling from $70.00 per year to less than $10.00, use of redirection services declined. With the launch of [[TinyURL]] in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely [[URL shortening]]. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular [[Twitter]] service, these short URL services have been heavily used.\n\n=== Referrer masking ===\nRedirection services can hide the [[referrer]] by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.) This type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a [[session ID]] in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective [[phishing]]  .\n\nHere is a simplistic example of such a service, written in [[PHP]].\n<source lang=\"html+php\">\n<?php\n$url = htmlspecialchars($_GET['url']);\nheader('Refresh: 0; url=http://' . $url);\n?>\n<!-- Fallback using meta refresh. -->\n<html>\n <head>\n  <title>Redirecting...</title>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=http://<?= $url; ?>\">\n </head>\n <body>\n Attempting to redirect to <a href=\"http://<?= $url; ?>\">http://<?= $url; ?></a>.\n </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed).  Also, it does not check the URL provided.  This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a URL parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server's resources.\n\n==Security issues==\nURL redirection can be abused by attackers for [[phishing]] attacks, such as [[Open Redirect|open redirect]] and [[Covert Redirect|covert redirect]]. \"An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation.\"<ref name=\"Open_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect | title=Open Redirect |publisher= OWASP |date=16 March 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> \"Covert redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value WITHOUT SUFFICIENT validation.\"<ref name=\"Covert_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=http://tetraph.com/covert_redirect/ | title=Covert Redirect |publisher= Tetraph |date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> It was disclosed in May 2014 by a mathematical doctoral student Wang Jing from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.<ref name=\"CNET\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/serious-security-flaw-in-oauth-and-openid-discovered/ | title=Serious security flaw in OAuth, OpenID discovered |publisher= CNET |date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canonical link element]]\n* [[Canonical meta tag]]\n* [[Domain masking]]\n* [[Link rot]]\n* [[Semantic URL]]\n* [[URL normalization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/urlmapping.html Mapping URLs to Filesystem Locations]\n* [http://www2007.org/workshops/paper_115.pdf Taxonomy of JavaScript Redirection Spam] (Microsoft Live Labs)\n* [http://projects.webappsec.org/URL-Redirector-Abuse Security vulnerabilities in URL Redirectors] The Web Application Security Consortium Threat Classification\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Url Redirection}}\n[[Category:URL]]\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Internet search]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Selfref|For redirection on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Redirect]].}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n'''URL redirection''', also called '''URL forwarding''', is a [[World Wide Web]] technique for making a [[web page]] available under more than one [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] address. When a [[web browser]] attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL [[Domain name|domain]] are redirected to a different domain, as when [http://www.wikipedia.com wikipedia.com] and [http://www.wikipedia.net wikipedia.net] are automatically redirected to [http://www.wikipedia.org wikipedia.org].\n\nURL redirection is done for various reasons:\n* for [[URL shortening]];\n* to prevent [[link rot|broken links]] when web pages are moved;\n* to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single [[website|web site]];\n* to guide navigation into and out of a website;\n* for privacy protection; and\n* for hostile purposes such as [[phishing]] attacks or malware distribution.\n\n== Purposes ==\nThere are several reasons to use URL redirection:\n\n=== Similar domain names ===\nA user might mistype a URL, for example, \"example.com\" and \"exmaple.com\". Organizations often register these \"misspelled\" domains and redirect them to the \"correct\" location: example.com. The addresses example.com and example.net could both redirect to a single domain, or web page, such as example.org. This technique is often used to \"reserve\" other [[top-level domain]]s (TLD) with the same name, or make it easier for a true \".edu\" or \".net\" to redirect to a more recognizable \".com\" domain.\n\n=== Moving pages to a new domain ===\nWeb pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons:\n* a site might desire, or need, to change its domain name;\n* an author might move his or her individual pages to a new domain;\n* two web sites might merge.\n\nWith URL redirects, incoming links to an outdated URL can be sent to the correct location. These links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks/favorites that users have saved in their browsers. The same applies to [[search engine]]s. They often have the older/outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old URLs. By using a \"moved permanently\" redirect to the new URL, visitors will still end up at the correct page. Also, in the next search engine pass, the search engine should detect and use the newer URL.\n\n=== Logging outgoing links ===\nThe access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site.  They do not, however, log which links visitors left by.  This is because the visitor's browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link. This information can be captured in several ways.  One way involves URL redirection.  Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website's domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website's server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n  | title = Google revives redirect snoopery\n  | journal = Blog.anta.net\n  | date = 29 January 2009\n  | url = http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | issn = 1797-1993\n  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817024348/http://blog.anta.net/2009/01/29/509/\n  | archivedate=17 August 2011\n}}</ref> The same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.\n\n=== Short aliases for long URLs ===\n{{Main|URL shortening}}\n\nWeb applications often include lengthy descriptive attributes in their URLs which represent data hierarchies, command structures, transaction paths and session information. This practice results in a URL that is aesthetically unpleasant and difficult to remember, and which may not fit within the size limitations of [[microblogging]] sites. [[URL shortening]] services provide a solution to this problem by redirecting a user to a longer URL from a shorter one.\n\n=== Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs ===\n{{See also|Permalink|PURL|Link rot}}\n\nSometimes the URL of a page changes even though the content stays the same. Therefore, URL redirection can help users who have bookmarks. This is routinely done on Wikipedia whenever a page is renamed.\n\n=== Post/Redirect/Get ===\n{{Main|Post/Redirect/Get}}\n\nPost/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a [[web development]] [[design pattern]] that prevents some duplicate [[form (web)|form]] submissions if the user clicks the refresh button after submitting the form, creating a more intuitive interface for [[user agent]]s (users).\n\n=== Device targeting and geotargeting ===\n\nRedirects can be effectively used for targeting purposes like [[geotargeting]]. Device targeting has become increasingly important with the rise of mobile clients. There are two approaches to serve mobile users: Make the website [[responsive web design|responsive]] or redirect to a mobile website version. If a mobile website version is offered, users with mobile clients will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding mobile content. For device targeting, client-side redirects or non-cacheable server-side redirects are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually server-side redirects are used for Geotargeting but client-side redirects might be an option as well, depending on requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Total Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating search engines ===\nRedirects have been used to manipulate search engines with unethical intentions, e.g., [[URL hijacking]]. The goal of misleading redirects is to drive search traffic to landing pages, which do not have enough ranking power on their own or which are only remotely or not at all related to the search target. The approach requires a rank for a range of search terms with a number of URLs that would utilize sneaky redirects to forward the searcher to the target page. This method had a revival with the uprise of mobile devices and device targeting. URL hijacking is an off-domain redirect technique<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-advice-discussing-302-redirects/ |title=SEO advice: discussing 302 redirects |date=4 January 2006 |publisher=Matt Cutts, former Head of Google Webspam Team}}</ref> that exploited the nature of the search engine's handling for temporary redirects. If a temporary redirect is encountered, search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the URL that initializes the redirect or to the redirect target URL. The URL that initiates the redirect may be kept to show up in search results, as the redirect indicates a temporary nature. Under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behaviour by applying temporary redirects to well-ranking URLs, leading to a replacement of the original URL in search results by the URL that initialized the redirect, therefore \"stealing\" the ranking. This method was usually combined with sneaky redirects to re-target the user stream from the search results to a target page. Search engines have developed efficient technologies to detect these kinds of manipulative approaches. Major search engines usually apply harsh ranking penalties on sites that get caught applying techniques like these.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en |title=Sneaky Redirects |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=Google Webmaster Guidelines}}</ref>\n\n=== Manipulating visitors ===\nURL redirection is sometimes used as a part of [[phishing]] attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet |title=Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet |date=21 August 2014 |publisher=Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)}}</ref> Because modern browsers always show the real URL in the address bar, the threat is lessened. However, redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways. For example, a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and installing a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] of some sort instead.\n\n=== Removing <code>referer</code> information ===\nWhen a link is clicked, the browser sends along in the [[HTTP request]] a field called [[HTTP referer|referer]] which indicates the source of the link. This field is populated with the URL of the current web page, and will end up in the [[server log|logs]] of the server serving the external link. Since sensitive pages may have sensitive URLs (for example, <code><nowiki>http://company.com/plans-for-the-next-release-of-our-product</nowiki></code>), it is not desirable for the <code>referer</code> URL to leave the organization. A redirection page that performs [[Referer#Referrer hiding|referrer hiding]] could be embedded in all external URLs, transforming for example <code><nowiki>http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code> into <code><nowiki>http://redirect.company.com/http://externalsite.com/page</nowiki></code>. This technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referer URL, such as the [[session ID]], and can reduce the chance of [[phishing]] by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site.\n\n== Implementation ==\nSeveral different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection.  These vary in whether they affect [[HTTP headers]] or HTML content.  The techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system.  For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a [[meta refresh|Refresh meta tag]] whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.\n\n=== Manual redirect ===\nThe simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis method is often used as a fall-back&nbsp;\u2014 if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.\n\n=== HTTP status codes 3xx ===\nIn the [[HTTP]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used by the [[World Wide Web]], a '''redirect''' is a response with a [[List of HTTP status codes|status code]] beginning with ''3'' that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a redirect, it needs to make a number of decisions how to handle the redirect. Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the redirect, how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.\n\nHTTP/1.1 defines several status codes for redirection (RFC 7231):\n* [[HTTP 300|300 multiple choices]] (e.g. offer different languages)\n* [[HTTP 301|301 moved permanently]] (redirects permanently from one URL to another passing link equity to the redirected page)\n* [[HTTP 302|302 found]] (originally \"temporary redirect\" in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)\n* [[HTTP 303|303 see other]] (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)\n* [[HTTP 307|307 temporary redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n* [[HTTP 308|308 permanent redirect]] (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n\n==== Redirect status codes and characteristics ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! HTTP Status Code !! HTTP Version !! Temporary / Permanent !! Cacheable !! Request Method Subsequent Request\n|-\n| 301 || HTTP/1.0 || Permanent || {{yes}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 302 || HTTP/1.0 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || GET / POST may change\n|-\n| 303 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no|never}} || always GET\n|-\n| 307 || HTTP/1.1 || Temporary || {{no2|not by default}} || may not change\n|-\n| 308 || HTTP/1.1 || Permanent || {{yes2|by default}} || may not change\n|-\n|}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://audisto.com/insights/guides/31/ |title=Redirects & SEO - The Complete Guide |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Audisto}}</ref>\n\nAll of these status codes require the URL of the redirect target to be given in the Location: header of the HTTP response. The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the Location: header.\n\n(Status codes [[HTTP 304|304 not modified]] and [[HTTP 305|305 use proxy]] are not redirects).\n\n==== Example HTTP response for a 301 redirect ====\n\nA [[HTTP]] response with the 301 \"moved permanently\" redirect looks like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://www.example.org/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 174\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Moved</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Moved</h1>\n<p>This page has moved to <a href=\"http://www.example.org/\">http://www.example.org/</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Using server-side scripting for redirection ====\nWeb authors producing HTML content can't usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file.  The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling \"non-parsed-headers\").  Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a \"Location:\" header line.  For example, in [[PHP]], one can use the \"header\" function:\n\n<source lang=\"php\">\nheader('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');\nheader('Location: http://www.example.com/');\nexit();\n</source>\n\nMore headers may be required to prevent caching.<ref name=\"php-301-robust-solution\">{{cite web|url=http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution/ |title=PHP Redirects: 302 to 301 Rock Solid Robust Solution |publisher=WebSiteFactors.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012042703/http://www.websitefactors.co.uk/php/2011/05/php-redirects-302-to-301-rock-solid-solution |archivedate=12 October 2012}}</ref> The programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body.  This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code.  To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data.  In the [[Active Server Pages|ASP scripting]] language, this can also be accomplished using <code>response.buffer=true</code> and <code>response.redirect <nowiki>\"http://www.example.com/\"</nowiki></code> HTTP/1.1 allows for either a relative URI reference or an absolute URI reference.<ref>{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 7.1.2 | sectionname = Location | page = 68 | editor1 = Roy T.

Typical configuration directives look like:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRedirect permanent /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\nRedirect 301 /oldpage.html http://www.example.com/newpage.html\n</source>\n\nFor more flexible [[URL rewriting]] and redirection, Apache mod_rewrite can be used. E.g., to redirect a requests to a canonical domain name:\n<source lang=\"apache\">\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([^.:]+\\.)*oldsite\\.example\\.com\\.?(:[0-9]*)?$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://newsite.example.net/$1 [R=301,L]\n</source>\n\nSuch configuration can be applied to one or all sites on the server through the server configuration files or to a single content directory through a <code>[[.htaccess]]</code> file.\n\n==== nginx rewrite ====\n[[Nginx]] has an integrated http rewrite module,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nginx.org/r/rewrite |title=Module ngx_http_rewrite_module - rewrite |publisher=nginx.org |accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> which can be used to perform advanced URL processing and even web-page generation (with the <tt>return</tt> directive).  A showing example of such advanced use of the rewrite module is [http://mdoc.su/ mdoc.su], which implements a deterministic [[URL shortening]] service entirely with the help of nginx configuration language alone.<ref>{{cite mailing list |date=18 February 2013 |url=http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2013-February/037592.html |mailinglist=nginx@nginx.org |title=A dynamic web-site written wholly in nginx.conf?

This can specify a new URL to replace one page with another.  This is supported by most web browsers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp|title=HTML meta tag|website=www.w3schools.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|title=An Exploration of Dynamic Documents|date=2 August 2002|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802170847/http://wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html|archivedate=2 August 2002|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A timeout of zero seconds effects an immediate redirect. This is treated like a 301 permanent redirect by Google, allowing transfer of PageRank to the target page.<ref>[http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/google-and-yahoo-treat-undelayed-meta-refresh-as-301-redirect/ \"Google and Yahoo accept undelayed meta refreshs as 301 redirects\"]. Sebastian's Pamphlets. 3 September 2007.</ref>\n\nThis is an example of a simple HTML document that uses this technique:\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Refresh\" content=\"0; url=http://www.example.com/\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n  <p>Please follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThis technique can be used by [[Web designer|web authors]] because the meta tag is contained inside the document itself.  The meta tag must be placed in the \"head\" section of the HTML file.  The number \"0\" in this example may be replaced by another number to achieve a delay of that many seconds.  The anchor in the \"body\" section is for users whose browsers do not support this feature.\n\nThe same effect can be achieved with an HTTP <code>refresh</code> header:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nRefresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 78\n\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">this link</a>.\n</source>\n\nThis response is easier to generate by CGI programs because one does not need to change the default status code.\n\nHere is a simple CGI program that effects this redirect:\n<source lang=\"perl\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint \"Refresh: 0; url=http://www.example.com/\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Content-Type: text/html\\r\\n\";\nprint \"\\r\\n\";\nprint \"Please follow <a href=\\\"http://www.example.com/\\\">this link</a>!\"\n</source>\n\nNote: Usually, the HTTP server adds the status line and the Content-Length header automatically.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] discourage the use of meta refresh, since it does not communicate any information about either the original or new resource, to the browser (or [[search engine]]). The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#tech-no-periodic-refresh|title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate.  Some articles that they have written on the issue include [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-movement W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (1.0): Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes], Use standard redirects: don't break the back button!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback|title=Use standard redirects|first=the QA|last=Team|website=www.w3.org}}</ref> and Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 section 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#auto-page-refresh|title=Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0|website=www.w3.org}}</ref>\n\n=== JavaScript redirects ===\n[[JavaScript]] can cause a redirect by setting the <code>window.location</code> attribute, e.g.:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location='http://www.example.com/'\n</syntaxhighlight>\nNormally JavaScript pushes the redirector site's [[URL]] to the browser's history. It can cause redirect loops when users hit the back button. With the following command you can prevent this type of behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insider.zone/tools/client-side-url-redirect-generator/|title=Cross-browser client side URL redirect generator|publisher=Insider Zone}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ecmascript\">\nwindow.location.replace('http://www.example.com/')\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHowever, HTTP headers or the refresh meta tag may be preferred for security reasons and because JavaScript will not be executed by some browsers and many [[web crawler]]s.\n\n=== Frame redirects ===\n\nA slightly different effect can be achieved by creating an inline frame:\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<iframe height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"http://www.example.com/\">\nPlease follow <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">link</a>.\n</iframe>\n</source>\n\nOne main difference to the above redirect methods is that for a frame redirect, the browser displays the URL of the frame document and not the URL of the target page in the URL bar. This ''cloaking'' technique may be used so that the reader sees a more memorable URL or to fraudulently conceal a [[phishing]] site as part of [[website spoofing]].<ref>Aaron Emigh (19 January 2005).

For example, the URL \"http://wikipedia.com\" (with \"*.com\" as domain) is first redirected to https://www.wikipedia.org/ (with domain name in [[.org]]), where you can navigate to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/ language-specific site]. This is unavoidable if the different links in the chain are served by different servers though it should be minimised by ''[[rewriting]]'' the URL as much as possible on the server before returning it to the browser as a redirect.\n\nWikipedia has been redirecting its pages to HTTPS by default since 2015.<ref>[https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/12/wikipedia-to-start-using-secure-https-by-default-for-all-users/ Wikipedia to start using secure HTTPS by default for all users] VentureBeat article, 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n=== Redirect loops ===\nSometimes a mistake can cause a page to end up redirecting back to itself, possibly via other pages, leading to an infinite sequence of redirects. Browsers should stop redirecting after a certain number of hops and display an error message.\n\nThe HTTP/1.1 Standard states:<ref name=\"rfc7231sec6.4\">{{cite IETF | title = Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content | rfc = 7231 | section = 6.4 | sectionname = Redirection 3xx | page = 54 | editor1 = Roy T. Fielding | editor1-link = Roy Fielding | editor2 = Julian F. Reschke | year = 2014 | publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nA client ''SHOULD'' detect and intervene in cyclical redirections (i.e., \"infinite\" redirection loops).\n\nNote: An earlier version of this specification recommended a maximum of five redirections ([RFC 2068], Section 10.3).  Content developers need to be aware that some clients might implement such a fixed limitation.\n</blockquote>\nNote that the URLs in the sequence might not repeat, e.g.: http://www.example.com/1{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} -> http://www.example.com/2{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} -> http://www.example.com/3{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ...\n\n== Services ==\nThere exist services that can perform URL redirection on demand, with no need for technical work or access to the web server your site is hosted on.\n\n=== URL redirection services ===\nA '''redirect service''' is an information management system, which provides an internet link that redirects users to the desired content. The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the [[Domain Name System]]. Hyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis.  Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.\nRecently, URL redirection services have taken to using [[AJAX]] as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs. A major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.\n\n==== History ====\nThe first redirect services took advantage of [[top-level domains]] (TLD) such as \"[[.to]]\" (Tonga), \"[[.at]]\" (Austria) and \"[[.is]]\" (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000.  V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including \"r.im\", \"go.to\", \"i.am\", \"come.to\" and \"start.at\".  V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | work=BBC News | title=Net gains for tiny Pacific nation | date=14 September 2007 | accessdate=27 May 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232450/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6991719.stm | archivedate=12 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the sales price of top level domains started falling from $70.00 per year to less than $10.00, use of redirection services declined. With the launch of [[TinyURL]] in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely [[URL shortening]]. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular [[Twitter]] service, these short URL services have been heavily used.\n\n=== Referrer masking ===\nRedirection services can hide the [[referrer]] by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.) This type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a [[session ID]] in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective [[phishing]]  .\n\nHere is a simplistic example of such a service, written in [[PHP]].\n<source lang=\"html+php\">\n<?php\n$url = htmlspecialchars($_GET['url']);\nheader('Refresh: 0; url=http://' . $url);\n?>\n<!-- Fallback using meta refresh. -->\n<html>\n <head>\n  <title>Redirecting...</title>\n  <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=http://<?= $url; ?>\">\n </head>\n <body>\n Attempting to redirect to <a href=\"http://<?= $url; ?>\">http://<?= $url; ?></a>.\n </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed).  Also, it does not check the URL provided.  This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a URL parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server's resources.\n\n==Security issues==\nURL redirection can be abused by attackers for [[phishing]] attacks, such as [[Open Redirect|open redirect]] and [[Covert Redirect|covert redirect]]. \"An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation.\"<ref name=\"Open_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect | title=Open Redirect |publisher= OWASP |date=16 March 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> \"Covert redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value WITHOUT SUFFICIENT validation.\"<ref name=\"Covert_Redirect\">{{cite web | url=http://tetraph.com/covert_redirect/ | title=Covert Redirect |publisher= Tetraph |date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> It was disclosed in May 2014 by a mathematical doctoral student Wang Jing from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.<ref name=\"CNET\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/serious-security-flaw-in-oauth-and-openid-discovered/ | title=Serious security flaw in OAuth, OpenID discovered |publisher= CNET |date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canonical link element]]\n* [[Canonical meta tag]]\n* [[Domain masking]]\n* [[Link rot]]\n* [[Semantic URL]]\n* [[URL normalization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/urlmapping.html Mapping URLs to Filesystem Locations]\n* [http://www2007.org/workshops/paper_115.pdf Taxonomy of JavaScript Redirection Spam] (Microsoft Live Labs)\n* [http://projects.webappsec.org/URL-Redirector-Abuse Security vulnerabilities in URL Redirectors] The Web Application Security Consortium Threat Classification\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Url Redirection}}\n[[Category:URL]]\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Internet search]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n", "name_user": "2402:3a80:abc:b185:abfc:6795:62e5:327f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection"}

The three main subplots include: Karen's younger sister Aubrey coming to Japan after finding out about Doug's death, a schoolgirl named Allison being hunted by the ghosts after entering the house with two of her classmates and a young boy named Jake whose apartment building is haunted by the ghosts of the Saeki family. \n\nThe film was announced after the release of the previous film in October 2004, due to its financial success. Shimizu was announced to return as director on January 2005 and casting begun on December, with the announcement of Gellar returning. The film was shot entirely in Japan, with Tamblyn performing re-shoots in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n\n''The Grudge 2'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 13, 2006, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received generally negative reviews, and made over $70 million worldwide against a $20 million budget. A sequel, ''[[The Grudge 3]]'', was released [[direct-to-video]] on May 12,  2009, while a [[sidequel]], [[The Grudge (2020 film)|''The Grudge'']], was theatrically released on January 3, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Grudge'' describes a curse that is born when someone dies in the grip of extreme rage or sorrow. The curse is an entity created where the person died. Those who encounter this supernatural force die, and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passing from victim to victim in an endless, growing chain of horror. The following events are explained in their actual order, however, the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative.\n\nIn 2004, American social worker [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]] tried to burn down the Saeki house to stop the curse, but failed, finding herself hospitalised and haunted by [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]].\n\nAubrey, Karen's younger sister, goes to Tokyo to retrieve her. In Japan, Aubrey struggles to communicate with the hospital staff but a journalist named Eason aids her. Aubrey briefly speaks with Karen, who panics and has to be restrained. Karen is later killed by Kayako in front of Aubrey and Eason. Eason explains the curse to Aubrey, revealing he rescued Karen from the house fire, and has been investigating the Saeki murders and surrounding events. The two go to the house to retrieve Kayako's diary, but [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]] drags Aubrey inside to curse her.\n\nEason takes the diary to an associate, who explains Kayako's mother was an ''[[itako]]'' who exorcised evil spirits from visitors and fed them to her daughter. Eason and Aubrey make plans to visit Kayako's mother. As Eason develops photographs he took of the Saeki house, Kayako emerges from a photo and murders him. After discovering his body, Aubrey travels alone to Kayako's mother's remote rural home. Kayako's mother warns her the curse is irreversible before being killed by her daughter. Aubrey ventures to the house, following an image of Karen inside. She encounters [[Takeo Saeki|Takeo]]'s ghost, who reenacts the night he discovered his wife's disloyalty, and snaps Aubrey's neck.\n\nIn 2006, school girls Allison Fleming, Vanessa, and Miyuki, break into the house on a dare but Allison is locked in the closet and encounters Kayako's ghost but the girls escape. After Miyuki and Vanessa are consumed by the curse, Allison speaks with school counsellor Ms. Dale about the curse, but Dale denies its existence, revealing she went to the house and is actually a ghost herself. Allison is haunted by the ghosts of her friends, and she eventually flees back to Chicago, where she stays with her parents.\n\nThe Kimbles move into an apartment block in Chicago. A young boy named Jake is disturbed by a strange presence in the building brought about by a hooded stranger who covers windows with newspaper. Jake's father Bill and stepmother Trish are influenced by the curse, Bill accusing his wife of having an affair but she bludgeons him with a frying pan. Jake and his sister Lacey return from school, but Jake finds his family are all dead. He runs into the hooded person, revealed to be Allison, who explains the curse followed her. Kayako appears in Allison's hood, finally taking her, and then emerges to attack Jake.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Grudge characters}}\n* [[Amber Tamblyn]] as Aubrey Davis, Karen's sister\n* [[Arielle Kebbel]] as Allison Fleming, a shy and emotional exchange student.\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]], the sole, traumatized survivor of ''[[The Grudge]]''\n* [[Takako Fuji]] as [[Kayako Saeki]]\n** Kyoka Takizawa as Young Kayako\n* [[Edison Chen]] as Eason, a journalist who is investigating the Saeki murders\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as Vanessa Cassidy, the popular bully of Japan International High School\n* [[Misako Uno]] as Miyuki Nazawa, Vanessa's best friend\n* [[Matthew Knight]] as Jake Kimble, a young boy who suspects something happening in their apartment\n* [[Sarah Roemer]] as Lacey Kimble, a cheerleader and Jake's kind and supporting older sister\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Trish Kimble, Bill's new wife\n* [[Christopher Cousins]] as Bill Kimble, Jake and Lacey's father\n* [[Jenna Dewan]] as Sally, Lacey's neighbor and best friend\n* [[Eve Gordon]] as Ms. Dale, Japan International High School's counselor\n* Ohga Tanaka and Yuya Ozeki (archive footage) as [[Toshio Saeki]]\n* [[Takashi Matsuyama (actor)|Takashi Matsuyama]] as [[Takeo Saeki]], Kayako's husband who becomes angry after seeing that she has feelings for another man\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Mrs. Davis, Karen and Aubrey's sick mother\n* [[Shaun Sipos]] as Michael, Miyuki's boyfriend\n* [[Jason Behr]] as Doug, Karen's boyfriend (in photographs)\n* [[Kim Miyori]] as Kayako's mother\n* [[Ryo Ishibashi]] as Detective Nakagawa (in interview video)\n* Paul Jarrett as John Fleming, Allison's father\n* Gwenda Lorenzetti as Annie Fleming, Allison's mother\n\n==Production==\n''The Grudge 2'' was announced three days after the release of ''[[The Grudge]]'' in 2004<ref>{{cite web | author= IMDB| date=September 10, 2006| title= Grudge 2 announced 4 days after the release of The Grudge| work= IMDB| url= http://imdb.com/title/tt0433386/trivia \n| accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> and was officially fasttracked<ref>{{cite web| author=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| date=October 6, 2006| title=Grudge 2 fasttracked| work=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| url=http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7057| accessdate=2006-10-06| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006071547/http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7057| archivedate=October 6, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| date=October 6, 2006| title=Sequel officially announced| work=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| url=http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7168| accessdate=2006-10-06| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006071454/http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7168| archivedate=October 6, 2007}}</ref> after a positive [[box office]] response with the film [[Revenue|grossing]] [[United States dollar|$]]110,175,871.<ref>{{cite web | author= IMDB | date=October 6, 2006| title= Box office gross for The Grudge | work= IMDB| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391198/business| accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> In early January 2005 [[Takashi Shimizu]] suggested ideas regarding the film's plot.

Many [[Internet forum|forum]] sites such as [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] were swamped with claims that [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] was playing an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's joke]]. A few days later, the site's authenticity was proven, and claims that it was a hoax were dismissed.\n\nOn September 10, 2006, Sony released a missing persons file on its official blog<ref>{{cite web|author=Official Blog |date=September 10, 2006 |title=Missing Person File for Jason C |work=Sony |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/blog/ |accessdate=2006-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318141237/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/blog/ |archivedate=2009-03-18 }}</ref> stating a student filmmaker known as \"Jason C\" (Jason Cutler) disappeared a few weeks after visiting the set of the film.

It introduces Ross (played by Daniel Sykes) as he wakes up in a Tokyo hotel room and coughs up quantities of Kayako's black hair. He wakes from this nightmare to the sound of the [[mobile phone]] and answers it. The caller is his girlfriend Abby (played by Stefanie Butler), who is safe at home in the US. Ross explains that his attempts to investigate ''the house'' and ''the woman with long black hair'' have led to a dead end. When the phone call ends, we stay with Ross as he takes a photo of himself with his mobile phone. He does not notice as Kayako passes by behind him at the precise moment he takes the shot. He then sends the picture to Abby. Ross then goes to brush his teeth and finds black hair in his toothbrush before being grabbed through the mirror by Kayako.\n* '''Part 2, \"School\":''' The second short film in which we follow the story of Abby as she ends the phone call from the first short. Abby then proceeds to call her friend, Brooke (played by Ginny Weirick), to ask about plans that evening. When the call ends, Abby receives a photo message from her boyfriend Ross (from the first short). When Abby looks closer at the image, she sees that Kayako is in the hotel room with Ross. Abby attempts to call her boyfriend and warn him, but she only hears Kayako and then it hangs up. Abby looks over at the girl that was sitting beside her to see Kayako.\n* '''Part 3, \"House\":''' The third short film that overlaps during the events in \"School\". The film opens with Brooke (as introduced in the second short) receiving a phone call from Abby. As the call ends, Brooke agrees to play [[hide and seek]] with the child, Josh, whom she is babysitting and chooses a walk-in closet as her hiding place. Brooke soon finds herself trapped and is dragged violently into the [[underworld]] by Kayako. Josh then gets up and says \"Come out, come out, wherever you are,\" before Brooke's cell phone begins ringing.\n\n===Home media===\n''The Grudge 2'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Universal Media Disc|UMD video]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]] on February 6, 2007. Both are available in a rated and unrated director's cut format. The unrated format is 6 minutes longer than the rated version, clocking in at 108 minutes as opposed to the theatrical cut which is 102 minutes.\n\nBoth DVD formats include the following extras:\n\n*''Tales from the Grudge'' webisodes <small>(Region 1 only)</small>\n*Cast and crew reel change montage\n*Four featurettes:\n**Holding a Grudge: Kayako & Toshio\n**East Meets West\n**''Grudge 2'' Storyline Development\n**Ready When You Are Mr Shimizu\n*Deleted scenes\n\nThe movie was also made available on [[iTunes]] in October 2008. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] version of the film has yet to be released in the United States, having only received a Blu-ray in [[France]] which is Region Locked, and a Blu-ray in [[Holland]] that is Region Free but missing the extras. Both contain the Unrated Cut. \n\n====Sales====\nThe DVD sold $5,233,327 in its first week, much lower than the previous film's $9 million.

The film was shot entirely in Japan, with Tamblyn performing re-shoots in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n\n''The Grudge 2'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 13, 2006, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received generally negative reviews, and made over $70 million worldwide against a $20 million budget. A sequel, ''[[The Grudge 3]]'', was released [[direct-to-video]] on May 12,  2009, while a [[sidequel]], [[The Grudge (2020 film)|''The Grudge'']], was theatrically released on January 3, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Grudge'' describes a curse that is born when someone dies in the grip of extreme rage or sorrow. The curse is an entity created where the person died. Those who encounter this supernatural force die, and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passing from victim to victim in an endless, growing chain of horror. The following events are explained in their actual order, however, the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative.\n\nIn 2004, American social worker [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]] tried to burn down the Saeki house to stop the curse, but failed, finding herself hospitalised and haunted by [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]].\n\nAubrey, Karen's younger sister, goes to Tokyo to retrieve her. In Japan, Aubrey struggles to communicate with the hospital staff but a journalist named Eason aids her. Aubrey briefly speaks with Karen, who panics and has to be restrained. Karen is later killed by Kayako in front of Aubrey and Eason. Eason explains the curse to Aubrey, revealing he rescued Karen from the house fire, and has been investigating the Saeki murders and surrounding events. The two go to the house to retrieve Kayako's diary, but [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]] drags Aubrey inside to curse her.\n\nEason takes the diary to an associate, who explains Kayako's mother was an ''[[itako]]'' who exorcised evil spirits from visitors and fed them to her daughter. Eason and Aubrey make plans to visit Kayako's mother. As Eason develops photographs he took of the Saeki house, Kayako emerges from a photo and murders him. After discovering his body, Aubrey travels alone to Kayako's mother's remote rural home. Kayako's mother warns her the curse is irreversible before being killed by her daughter. Aubrey ventures to the house, following an image of Karen inside. She encounters [[Takeo Saeki|Takeo]]'s ghost, who reenacts the night he discovered his wife's disloyalty, and snaps Aubrey's neck.\n\nIn 2006, school girls Allison Fleming, Vanessa, and Miyuki, break into the house on a dare but Allison is locked in the closet and encounters Kayako's ghost but the girls escape. After Miyuki and Vanessa are consumed by the curse, Allison speaks with school counsellor Ms. Dale about the curse, but Dale denies its existence, revealing she went to the house and is actually a ghost herself. Allison is haunted by the ghosts of her friends, and she eventually flees back to Chicago, where she stays with her parents.\n\nThe Kimbles move into an apartment block in Chicago. A young boy named Jake is disturbed by a strange presence in the building brought about by a hooded stranger who covers windows with newspaper. Jake's father Bill and stepmother Trish are influenced by the curse, Bill accusing his wife of having an affair but she bludgeons him with a frying pan. Jake and his sister Lacey return from school, but Jake finds his family are all dead. He runs into the hooded person, revealed to be Allison, who explains the curse followed her. Kayako appears in Allison's hood, finally taking her, and then emerges to attack Jake.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Grudge characters}}\n* [[Amber Tamblyn]] as Aubrey Davis, Karen's sister\n* [[Arielle Kebbel]] as Allison Fleming, a shy and emotional exchange student.\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]], the sole, traumatized survivor of ''[[The Grudge]]''.\n* [[Takako Fuji]] as [[Kayako Saeki]]\n** Kyoka Takizawa as Young Kayako\n* [[Edison Chen]] as Eason, a journalist who is investigating the Saeki murders\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as Vanessa Cassidy, the popular bully of Japan International High School\n* [[Misako Uno]] as Miyuki Nazawa, Vanessa's best friend\n* [[Matthew Knight]] as Jake Kimble, a young boy who suspects something happening in their apartment\n* [[Sarah Roemer]] as Lacey Kimble, a cheerleader and Jake's kind and supporting older sister\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Trish Kimble, Bill's new wife\n* [[Christopher Cousins]] as Bill Kimble, Jake and Lacey's father\n* [[Jenna Dewan]] as Sally, Lacey's neighbor and best friend\n* [[Eve Gordon]] as Ms. Dale, Japan International High School's counselor\n* Ohga Tanaka and Yuya Ozeki (archive footage) as [[Toshio Saeki]]\n* [[Takashi Matsuyama (actor)|Takashi Matsuyama]] as [[Takeo Saeki]], Kayako's husband who becomes angry after seeing that she has feelings for another man\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Mrs. Davis, Karen and Aubrey's sick mother\n* [[Shaun Sipos]] as Michael, Miyuki's boyfriend\n* [[Jason Behr]] as Doug, Karen's boyfriend (in photographs)\n* [[Kim Miyori]] as Kayako's mother\n* [[Ryo Ishibashi]] as Detective Nakagawa (in interview video)\n* Paul Jarrett as John Fleming, Allison's father\n* Gwenda Lorenzetti as Annie Fleming, Allison's mother\n\n==Production==\n''The Grudge 2'' was announced three days after the release of ''[[The Grudge]]'' in 2004<ref>{{cite web | author= IMDB| date=September 10, 2006| title= Grudge 2 announced 4 days after the release of The Grudge| work= IMDB| url= http://imdb.com/title/tt0433386/trivia \n| accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> and was officially fasttracked<ref>{{cite web| author=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| date=October 6, 2006| title=Grudge 2 fasttracked| work=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| url=http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7057| accessdate=2006-10-06| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006071547/http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7057| archivedate=October 6, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| date=October 6, 2006| title=Sequel officially announced| work=The Grudge 2 Move.Com| url=http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7168| accessdate=2006-10-06| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006071454/http://www.the-grudge-2-movie.com/article.php3?id_article=7168| archivedate=October 6, 2007}}</ref> after a positive [[box office]] response with the film [[Revenue|grossing]] [[United States dollar|$]]110,175,871.<ref>{{cite web | author= IMDB | date=October 6, 2006| title= Box office gross for The Grudge | work= IMDB| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391198/business| accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> In early January 2005 [[Takashi Shimizu]] suggested ideas regarding the film's plot.

On April 1, 2006, a teaser [[Website|site]] was launched with details revealing the October 13 release date. Many [[Internet forum|forum]] sites such as [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] were swamped with claims that [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] was playing an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's joke]]. A few days later, the site's authenticity was proven, and claims that it was a hoax were dismissed.\n\nOn September 10, 2006, Sony released a missing persons file on its official blog<ref>{{cite web|author=Official Blog |date=September 10, 2006 |title=Missing Person File for Jason C |work=Sony |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/blog/ |accessdate=2006-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318141237/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/blog/ |archivedate=2009-03-18 }}</ref> stating a student filmmaker known as \"Jason C\" (Jason Cutler) disappeared a few weeks after visiting the set of the film.

It introduces Ross (played by Daniel Sykes) as he wakes up in a Tokyo hotel room and coughs up quantities of Kayako's black hair. He wakes from this nightmare to the sound of the [[mobile phone]] and answers it. The caller is his girlfriend Abby (played by Stefanie Butler), who is safe at home in the US. Ross explains that his attempts to investigate ''the house'' and ''the woman with long black hair'' have led to a dead end. When the phone call ends, we stay with Ross as he takes a photo of himself with his mobile phone. He does not notice as Kayako passes by behind him at the precise moment he takes the shot. He then sends the picture to Abby. Ross then goes to brush his teeth and finds black hair in his toothbrush before being grabbed through the mirror by Kayako.\n* '''Part 2, \"School\":''' The second short film in which we follow the story of Abby as she ends the phone call from the first short. Abby then proceeds to call her friend, Brooke (played by Ginny Weirick), to ask about plans that evening. When the call ends, Abby receives a photo message from her boyfriend Ross (from the first short). When Abby looks closer at the image, she sees that Kayako is in the hotel room with Ross. Abby attempts to call her boyfriend and warn him, but she only hears Kayako and then it hangs up. Abby looks over at the girl that was sitting beside her to see Kayako.\n* '''Part 3, \"House\":''' The third short film that overlaps during the events in \"School\". The film opens with Brooke (as introduced in the second short) receiving a phone call from Abby. As the call ends, Brooke agrees to play [[hide and seek]] with the child, Josh, whom she is babysitting and chooses a walk-in closet as her hiding place. Brooke soon finds herself trapped and is dragged violently into the [[underworld]] by Kayako. Josh then gets up and says \"Come out, come out, wherever you are,\" before Brooke's cell phone begins ringing.\n\n===Home media===\n''The Grudge 2'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Universal Media Disc|UMD video]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]] on February 6, 2007. Both are available in a rated and unrated director's cut format. The unrated format is 6 minutes longer than the rated version, clocking in at 108 minutes as opposed to the theatrical cut which is 102 minutes.\n\nBoth DVD formats include the following extras:\n\n*''Tales from the Grudge'' webisodes <small>(Region 1 only)</small>\n*Cast and crew reel change montage\n*Four featurettes:\n**Holding a Grudge: Kayako & Toshio\n**East Meets West\n**''Grudge 2'' Storyline Development\n**Ready When You Are Mr Shimizu\n*Deleted scenes\n\nThe movie was also made available on [[iTunes]] in October 2008.

Acclaimed by critics as a masterpiece when a hastily transcribed version was finally published in 1924, it quickly took its place as a classic second only to ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' among Melville's works. Budd is a \"handsome sailor\" who strikes and inadvertently kills his false accuser, Master-at-arms John Claggart. The ship's Captain, Edward Vere, recognizes the innocence of Budd's intent but the law of [[mutiny]] requires him to sentence Billy to be hanged. \n\nMelville began work on it in November 1886, revising and expanding from time to time, but left the manuscript in disarray. Melville's widow Elizabeth began to edit the manuscript for publication, but was not able to decide her husband's intentions at key points, even his intended title. [[Raymond M. Weaver]], Melville's first biographer, was given the manuscript and published the 1924 version, which was marred by misinterpretation of Elizabeth's queries, misreadings of Melville's difficult handwriting, and even inclusion of a preface Melville had cut. Melville scholars [[Harrison Hayford]] and [[Merton M. Sealts Jr.]] published what is considered the best transcription and [[Textual criticism|critical reading text]] in 1962. <ref name=Parker>{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Hershel |title=\"Billy Budd, Foretopman\" and the Dynamics of Canonization |journal=College Literature |date=Winter 1990 |volume=17 |series=1 |pages=21\u201332 |jstor= 25111840}}</ref> In 2017, Northwestern University Press published a \"new reading text\" based on a \"corrected version\" of Hayford and Sealts' genetic text prepared by [[G.

Coxe]] and Robert Chapman and produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where it won the [[Donaldson Awards]] and [[Outer Critics Circle Awards]] for best play. [[Benjamin Britten]] adapted it as an [[Billy Budd (opera)|opera]] by the same name, first performed in December 1951. The play was adapted into a [[Billy Budd (film)|film]] in 1962, produced, directed, co-written, and starring [[Peter Ustinov]] with [[Terence Stamp]] receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination in his film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Budd is a seaman [[impressment|impressed]] into service aboard HMS ''Bellipotent'' in the year 1797, when the [[Royal Navy]] was reeling from two [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|major mutinies]] and was threatened by the [[French Revolution#The Constitutional Republic: The Directory (1795\u20131799)|Revolutionary French Republic]]'s military ambitions. He is impressed to this large warship from another, smaller, merchant ship, ''The Rights of Man'' (named after the [[Rights of Man|book]] by [[Thomas Paine]]). As his former ship moves off, Budd shouts, \"Good-bye to you too, old ''Rights-of-Man''.\"\n\nBilly, a [[child abandonment|foundling]] from [[Bristol]], has an innocence, good looks and a natural charisma that make him popular with the crew. His only physical defect is a [[stutter]] which grows worse when under intense emotion. He arouses the antagonism of the ship's [[master-at-arms]], John Claggart. Claggart, while not unattractive, seems somehow \"defective or abnormal in the constitution\", possessing a \"natural depravity.\" Envy is Claggart's explicitly stated emotion toward Budd, foremost because of his \"significant personal beauty,\" and also for his innocence and general popularity. (Melville further opines that envy is \"universally felt to be more shameful than even felonious crime.\") This leads Claggart to falsely charge Billy with conspiracy to mutiny. When the captain, Edward Fairfax \"Starry\" Vere, is presented with Claggart's charges, he summons Claggart and Billy to his cabin for a private meeting. Claggart makes his case and Billy, astounded, is unable to respond, due to his stutter. In his extreme frustration he strikes out at Claggart, killing him instantly.\n\nVere convenes a [[drumhead court-martial]]. He acts as [[convening authority]], [[prosecutor]], [[defense counsel]] and sole witness (except for Billy). He intervenes in the deliberations of the court-martial panel to persuade them to convict Billy, despite their and his beliefs in Billy's moral innocence. (Vere says in the moments following Claggart's death, \"Struck dead by an angel of God! Yet the angel must hang!\") Vere claims to be following the letter of the [[Mutiny Act]] and the [[Articles of War]].\n\nAlthough Vere and the other officers do not believe Claggart's charge of conspiracy and think Billy justified in his response, they find that their own opinions matter little. The martial law in effect states that during wartime the blow itself, fatal or not, is a capital crime. The court-martial convicts Billy following Vere's argument that any appearance of weakness in the officers and failure to enforce discipline could stir more mutiny throughout the British fleet. Condemned to be hanged the morning after his attack on Claggart, Billy before his execution says, \"God bless Captain Vere!\" His words were repeated by the gathered crew in a \"resonant and sympathetic echo.\"{{smallsup|CH 26}}\n\nThe novel closes with three chapters that present ambiguity:\n* Chapter 28 describes the death of Captain Vere. In a naval action against the French ship, ''Ath\u00e9e'' (the ''Atheist''), Captain Vere is mortally wounded. His last words are \"Billy Budd, Billy Budd.\"\n* Chapter 29 presents an extract from an official naval gazette purporting to give the facts of the fates of John Claggart and Billy Budd aboard HMS ''Bellipotent'' \u2013 but the \"facts\" offered turn the facts that the reader learned from the story upside down. The gazette article described Budd as a conspiring mutineer likely of foreign birth and mysterious antecedents who is confronted by John Claggart. The master-at-arms, loyally enforcing the law, is fatally stabbed by Budd. The gazette concludes that the crime and weapon used suggest a foreign birth and subversive character; it reports that the mutineer was executed and nothing is amiss aboard HMS ''Bellipotent''.\n* Chapter 30 reprints a cheaply printed ballad written by one of Billy's shipmates as an elegy. The adult, experienced man represented in the poem is not the innocent youth portrayed in the preceding chapters.\n\n==Writing history==\n[[File:Herman Melville 1885.jpg|thumb|right|The last known image of the author, taken in 1885.]]\n\nCreated slowly over the last five years of his life, the novella ''Billy Budd'' represents Melville's return to prose fiction after three decades of only writing poetry. He started it as a poem, a ballad entitled \"Billy in the Darbies\", which he intended to include in his book, ''John Marr and Other Sailors''. Melville composed a short, prose head-note to introduce the speaker and set the scene. The character of \"Billy\" in this early version was an older man condemned for inciting mutiny and apparently guilty as charged. He did not include the poem in his published book. Melville incorporated the ballad and expanded the head-note sketch into a story that eventually reached 150 manuscript pages. This was the first of what were to be three major expansions, each related to one of the principal characters.<ref name=\"Hayford Sealts\"/>\n\nMelville had a difficult time writing, describing his process with ''Moby-Dick'' as follows: \"Taking a book off the brain is akin to the ticklish & dangerous business of taking an old painting off a panel\u2014you have to scrape off the whole business in order to get at it with safety.\"<ref>{{cite book|last = Melville|first = Herman|title = Some Personal Letters of Herman Melville|year = 1922|publisher = Edmond Byrne Hackett|location = New York|pages = 71|editor = Meade Minnigerode|chapter = Letter to Evert Duyckinck|date = |orig-year = December 1850}}</ref>\nThe \"scrapings\" of ''Billy Budd'' lie in the 351 leaves of manuscript now in the [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]].\n\nThe state of this manuscript has been described as \"chaotic,\" with a bewildering array of corrections, cancellations, cut and pasted leaves, annotations inscribed by several hands, and with at least two different attempts made at a [[wikt:fair copy|fair copy]]. The composition proceeded in three general phases, as shown by the Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M.

She tried to follow through on what she perceived as her husband's objectives but her editing was confusing to the first professional editors, Weaver and Freeman, who mistook her writing for Melville's. At some point Elizabeth Melville placed the manuscript in \"a [[Japanning|japanned]] tin box\"<ref name=\"Parker Reading\">{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Hershel|title=Reading Billy Budd|year=1990|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, Ill.|isbn=0-8101-0961-1|pages=\"tin box\": 6, \"his proviso\": 45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MstCscWwSPkC&dq=reading+billy+budd+by+hershel+parker}}</ref> with the author's other literary materials, and it remained undiscovered for another 28 years.\n\n===Publication history===\n[[File:BillyBudd.png|thumb|right|First edition cover page, 1924.]]\n\nIn August 1918, Raymond M. Weaver, a professor at [[Columbia University]], doing research for what would become the first biography of Melville, paid a visit to Melville's granddaughter, Eleanor Melville Metcalf, at her [[South Orange, New Jersey]] home.  She gave him access to all the records of Melville which survived in the family: manuscripts, letters, journals, annotated books, photographs, and a variety of other material. Among these papers, Weaver was astonished to find a substantial manuscript for an unknown prose work entitled ''Billy Budd.''\n\nAfter producing a text that would later be described as \"hastily transcribed\",<ref name=Parker/> he published the first edition of the work in 1924 as ''Billy Budd, Foretopman'' in Volume XIII of the Standard Edition of Melville's ''Complete Works'' ([[Constable & Robinson|London: Constable and Company]]). In 1928 he published another version of the text which, despite numerous variations, may be considered essentially the same text.\n\nF. Barron Freeman published a second text in 1948, edited on different principles, as ''Melville's Billy Budd'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press). He believed he stayed closer to what Melville wrote, but still relied on Weaver's text, with what are now considered mistaken assumptions and textual errors. Subsequent editions of ''Billy Budd'' up through the early 1960s are, strictly speaking, versions of one or the other of these two basic texts.<ref>Hayford & Sealts, pp. 12\u201323</ref>\n\nAfter several years of study, in 1962, Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., established what is now considered the correct, authoritative text. It was published by the [[University of Chicago Press]], and contains both a \"reading\" and a \"genetic\" text. Most editions printed since then follow the Hayford-Sealts text.\n\nBased on the confusing manuscripts, the published versions had many variations. For example, early versions gave the book's title as ''Billy Budd, Foretopman'', while it now seems clear Melville intended ''Billy Budd, Sailor: (An Inside Narrative)''; some versions wrongly included as a preface a chapter that Melville had excised (the correct text has no preface). In addition, some early versions did not follow his change of the name of the ship to ''Bellipotent'' (from the [[Latin]] ''bellum'' war and ''potens'' powerful), from ''Indomitable'', as Melville called it in an earlier draft. It is unclear of his full intentions in changing the name of the ship since he used the name ''Bellipotent'' only six times.<ref>Hayford & Sealts, pp. 20</ref>\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\nThe book has undergone a number of substantial, critical reevaluations in the years since its discovery. Raymond Weaver, its first editor, was initially unimpressed and described it as \"not distinguished\". After its publication debut in England, and with critics of such caliber as [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[John Middleton Murry]] hailing it as a masterpiece, Weaver changed his mind. In the introduction to its second edition in the 1928 ''Shorter Novels of Herman Melville'', he declared: \"In ''Pierre'', Melville had hurled himself into a fury of vituperation against the world; with ''Billy Budd'' he would justify the ways of God to man.\" Outside of the English-speaking world, [[Thomas Mann]] declared ''Billy Budd'' \"one of the most beautiful stories in the world\" which \"made his heart wide open\" and declared that he wished he had written the dying scene of Billy.<ref>Andreas Platthaus: [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/autoren/zum-200-geburtstag-von-herman-melville-16304184-p2.html Melvilles 200. Geburtstag : Oh, h\u00e4tte ich das geschrieben!], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]], August 1, 2019 (German)</ref>\n\nIn mid-1924 Murry orchestrated the reception of ''Billy Budd, Foretopman,'' first in London, in the influential ''[[Times Literary Supplement]],'' in an essay called \"Herman Melville's Silence\" (July 10, 1924), then in a reprinting of the essay, slightly expanded, in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' (August 10, 1924). In relatively short order he and several other influential British literati had managed to canonize ''Billy Budd'', placing it alongside ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' as one of the great books of Western literature. Wholly unknown to the public until 1924, ''Billy Budd'' by 1926 had joint billing with the book that had just recently been firmly established as a literary masterpiece. In its first text and subsequent texts, and as read by different audiences, the book has kept that high status ever since.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\nIn 1990 the Melville biographer and scholar [[Hershel Parker]] pointed out that all the early estimations of ''Billy Budd'' were based on readings from the flawed transcription texts of Weaver. Some of these flaws were crucial to an understanding of Melville's intent, such as the famous \"coda\" at the end of the chapter containing the news account of the death of the \"admirable\" John Claggart and the \"depraved\" William Budd (25 in Weaver, 29 in Hayford & Sealts reading text, 344Ba in the genetic text) :\n\n''Weaver'': \"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this incongruous world of ours\u2014innocence and 'infirmary', spiritual depravity and fair 'respite'.\"\n\n''The Ms'': \"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this {''word undeciphered''} world of ours\u2014innocence and 'infamy', spiritual depravity and fair 'repute'.\"\n\nMelville had written this as an end-note after his second major revision. When he enlarged the book with the third major section, developing Captain Vere, he deleted the end-note, as it no longer applied to the expanded story. Many of the early readers, such as Murry and Freeman, thought this passage was a foundational statement of Melville's philosophical views on life. Parker wonders what they could possibly have understood from the passage as written.<ref name=\"Parker Reading\"/>\n\n==Analysis and interpretations==\n{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right  |quote=There appear to be three principal conceptions of the meaning of Melville's ''Billy Budd'': the first, and most heavily supported, that it is Melville's \"Testament of acceptance,\" his valedictory and his final benediction. The second view, a reaction against the first, holds that ''Billy Budd'' is ironic, and that its real import is precisely the opposite of its ostensible meaning. Still a third interpretation denies that interpretation is possible; a work of art has no meaning at all that can be abstracted from it, nor is a man's work in any way an index of his character or his opinion. All three of these views of ''Billy Budd'' are in their own sense true.|salign=right |source=\u2014R. H.

Vincent |chapter=Billy Budd \u2013 Acceptance or Irony |origyear=1958}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Hershel Parker]] agrees that \"masterpiece\" is an appropriate description of the book, but he adds a proviso. <blockquote>Examining the history and reputation of ''Billy Budd'' has left me more convinced than before that it deserves high stature (although not precisely the high stature it holds, whatever that stature is) and more convinced that it is a wonderfully teachable story\u2014as long as it is not taught as a finished, complete, coherent, and totally interpretable work of art.<ref name=\"Parker Reading\"/></blockquote> Given this unfinished quality and Melville's reluctance to present clear lessons, the range of critical response is not surprising.\n\nSome critics have interpreted ''Billy Budd'' as a historical novel that attempts to evaluate man's relation to the past. Thomas J. Scorza has written about the philosophical framework of the story. He understands the work as a comment on the historical feud between poets and philosophers. By this interpretation, Melville is opposing the scientific, rational systems of thought, which Claggart's character represents, in favor of the more comprehensive poetic pursuit of knowledge embodied by Billy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scorza|first=Thomas J.|title=In the Time Before Steamships: Billy Budd, the limits of politics and modernity|year=1979|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/intimebeforestea0000scor/page/210 210]|url=https://archive.org/details/intimebeforestea0000scor|url-access=registration|isbn=9780875800714}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Epistemology of the Closet'' (1990/2008), [[Eve Sedgwick]], expanding on earlier interpretations of the same themes, posits that the interrelationships between Billy, Claggart and Captain Vere are representations of male homosexual desire and the mechanisms of prohibition against this desire. She points out that Claggart's \"natural depravity,\" which is defined tautologically as \"depravity according to nature,\" and the accumulation of equivocal terms (\"phenomenal\", \"mystery\", etc.) used in the explanation of the fault in his character, are an indication of his status as the central homosexual figure in the text. She also interprets the mutiny scare aboard the ''Bellipotent'', the political circumstances that are at the center of the events of the story, as a portrayal of homophobia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Eve|title=Epistemology of the Closet|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-07042-9|pages=91\u2013130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMhUa25EPkIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMelville's dramatic presentation of the contradiction between the requirements of the law and the needs of humanity made the novella an \"iconic text\" in the field of [[law and literature]]. Earlier readers viewed Captain Vere as good man trapped by bad law. [[Richard Weisberg]], who holds degrees in both comparative literature and law, argued that Vere was wrong to play the roles of witness, prosecutor, judge and executioner, and that he went beyond the law when he sentenced Billy to immediate hanging.<ref>Tom Goldstein, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/10/us/the-law-once-again-billy-budd-is-standing-trial.html The Law: Once Again, Billy Budd is Standing Trial],\" ''New York Times'' June 10, 1989</ref>  Based on his study of statutory law and practices in the Royal Navy in the era in which the book takes place, Weisberg argues that Vere deliberately distorted the applicable substantive and procedural law to bring about Billy's death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weisberg|first=Richard|title='The Failure of the Word: The Lawyer as Protagonist in Modern Fiction|year=1989|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-04592-1|pages=131\u201376|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YqDkB365maYC&printsec=frontcover|chapter=The Case of Billy Budd, Sailor}}</ref> Judge [[Richard Posner]] has [[Law and literature#Criticisms of law and literature|sharply criticized these claims]].

[[Guert Gansevoort]], a defendant in a later investigation, was a first cousin of Melville. If so then the character Billy Budd was likely inspired by a young man named Philip Spencer who was hanged on USS ''Somers'' on December 1, 1842.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Andrew|title=Melville: His World and Work|year=2005|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-375-40314-0|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGsCgkhkq2QC&dq=Melville+His+World+and+Work}}</ref>\n\n[[Harold Schechter]], a professor who has written a number of books on American serial killers, has said that the author's description of Claggart could be considered to be a definition of a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]].

Acclaimed by British critics as a masterpiece when a hastily transcribed version was finally published in 1924, it quickly took its place as a classic second only to ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' among Melville's works. Budd is a \"handsome sailor\" who strikes and inadvertently kills his false accuser, Master-at-arms John Claggart. The ship's Captain, Edward Vere, recognizes the innocence of Budd's intent but the law of [[mutiny]] requires him to sentence Billy to be hanged. \n\nMelville began work on it in November 1886, revising and expanding from time to time, but left the manuscript in disarray. Melville's widow Elizabeth began to edit the manuscript for publication, but was not able to decide her husband's intentions at key points, even his intended title. [[Raymond M. Weaver]], Melville's first biographer, was given the manuscript and published the 1924 version, which was marred by misinterpretation of Elizabeth's queries, misreadings of Melville's difficult handwriting, and even inclusion of a preface Melville had cut. Melville scholars [[Harrison Hayford]] and [[Merton M. Sealts Jr.]] published what is considered the best transcription and [[Textual criticism|critical reading text]] in 1962. <ref name=Parker>{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Hershel |title=\"Billy Budd, Foretopman\" and the Dynamics of Canonization |journal=College Literature |date=Winter 1990 |volume=17 |series=1 |pages=21\u201332 |jstor= 25111840}}</ref> In 2017, Northwestern University Press published a \"new reading text\" based on a \"corrected version\" of Hayford and Sealts' genetic text prepared by [[G.

Coxe]] and Robert Chapman and produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where it won the [[Donaldson Awards]] and [[Outer Critics Circle Awards]] for best play. [[Benjamin Britten]] adapted it as an [[Billy Budd (opera)|opera]] by the same name, first performed in December 1951. The play was adapted into a [[Billy Budd (film)|film]] in 1962, produced, directed, co-written, and starring [[Peter Ustinov]] with [[Terence Stamp]] receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination in his film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Budd is a seaman [[impressment|impressed]] into service aboard HMS ''Bellipotent'' in the year 1797, when the [[Royal Navy]] was reeling from two [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|major mutinies]] and was threatened by the [[French Revolution#The Constitutional Republic: The Directory (1795\u20131799)|Revolutionary French Republic]]'s military ambitions. He is impressed to this large warship from another, smaller, merchant ship, ''The Rights of Man'' (named after the [[Rights of Man|book]] by [[Thomas Paine]]). As his former ship moves off, Budd shouts, \"Good-bye to you too, old ''Rights-of-Man''.\"\n\nBilly, a [[child abandonment|foundling]] from [[Bristol]], has an innocence, good looks and a natural charisma that make him popular with the crew. His only physical defect is a [[stutter]] which grows worse when under intense emotion. He arouses the antagonism of the ship's [[master-at-arms]], John Claggart. Claggart, while not unattractive, seems somehow \"defective or abnormal in the constitution\", possessing a \"natural depravity.\" Envy is Claggart's explicitly stated emotion toward Budd, foremost because of his \"significant personal beauty,\" and also for his innocence and general popularity. (Melville further opines that envy is \"universally felt to be more shameful than even felonious crime.\") This leads Claggart to falsely charge Billy with conspiracy to mutiny. When the captain, Edward Fairfax \"Starry\" Vere, is presented with Claggart's charges, he summons Claggart and Billy to his cabin for a private meeting. Claggart makes his case and Billy, astounded, is unable to respond, due to his stutter. In his extreme frustration he strikes out at Claggart, killing him instantly.\n\nVere convenes a [[drumhead court-martial]]. He acts as [[convening authority]], [[prosecutor]], [[defense counsel]] and sole witness (except for Billy). He intervenes in the deliberations of the court-martial panel to persuade them to convict Billy, despite their and his beliefs in Billy's moral innocence. (Vere says in the moments following Claggart's death, \"Struck dead by an angel of God! Yet the angel must hang!\") Vere claims to be following the letter of the [[Mutiny Act]] and the [[Articles of War]].\n\nAlthough Vere and the other officers do not believe Claggart's charge of conspiracy and think Billy justified in his response, they find that their own opinions matter little. The martial law in effect states that during wartime the blow itself, fatal or not, is a capital crime. The court-martial convicts Billy following Vere's argument that any appearance of weakness in the officers and failure to enforce discipline could stir more mutiny throughout the British fleet. Condemned to be hanged the morning after his attack on Claggart, Billy before his execution says, \"God bless Captain Vere!\" His words were repeated by the gathered crew in a \"resonant and sympathetic echo.\"{{smallsup|CH 26}}\n\nThe novel closes with three chapters that present ambiguity:\n* Chapter 28 describes the death of Captain Vere. In a naval action against the French ship, ''Ath\u00e9e'' (the ''Atheist''), Captain Vere is mortally wounded. His last words are \"Billy Budd, Billy Budd.\"\n* Chapter 29 presents an extract from an official naval gazette purporting to give the facts of the fates of John Claggart and Billy Budd aboard HMS ''Bellipotent'' \u2013 but the \"facts\" offered turn the facts that the reader learned from the story upside down. The gazette article described Budd as a conspiring mutineer likely of foreign birth and mysterious antecedents who is confronted by John Claggart. The master-at-arms, loyally enforcing the law, is fatally stabbed by Budd. The gazette concludes that the crime and weapon used suggest a foreign birth and subversive character; it reports that the mutineer was executed and nothing is amiss aboard HMS ''Bellipotent''.\n* Chapter 30 reprints a cheaply printed ballad written by one of Billy's shipmates as an elegy. The adult, experienced man represented in the poem is not the innocent youth portrayed in the preceding chapters.\n\n==Writing history==\n[[File:Herman Melville 1885.jpg|thumb|right|The last known image of the author, taken in 1885.]]\n\nCreated slowly over the last five years of his life, the novella ''Billy Budd'' represents Melville's return to prose fiction after three decades of only writing poetry. He started it as a poem, a ballad entitled \"Billy in the Darbies\", which he intended to include in his book, ''John Marr and Other Sailors''. Melville composed a short, prose head-note to introduce the speaker and set the scene. The character of \"Billy\" in this early version was an older man condemned for inciting mutiny and apparently guilty as charged. He did not include the poem in his published book. Melville incorporated the ballad and expanded the head-note sketch into a story that eventually reached 150 manuscript pages. This was the first of what were to be three major expansions, each related to one of the principal characters.<ref name=\"Hayford Sealts\"/>\n\nMelville had a difficult time writing, describing his process with ''Moby-Dick'' as follows: \"Taking a book off the brain is akin to the ticklish & dangerous business of taking an old painting off a panel\u2014you have to scrape off the whole business in order to get at it with safety.\"<ref>{{cite book|last = Melville|first = Herman|title = Some Personal Letters of Herman Melville|year = 1922|publisher = Edmond Byrne Hackett|location = New York|pages = 71|editor = Meade Minnigerode|chapter = Letter to Evert Duyckinck|date = |orig-year = December 1850}}</ref>\nThe \"scrapings\" of ''Billy Budd'' lie in the 351 leaves of manuscript now in the [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]].\n\nThe state of this manuscript has been described as \"chaotic,\" with a bewildering array of corrections, cancellations, cut and pasted leaves, annotations inscribed by several hands, and with at least two different attempts made at a [[wikt:fair copy|fair copy]]. The composition proceeded in three general phases, as shown by the Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M.

As the focus of his attention shifted from one to another of these three principals, the plot and thematic emphasis of the expanding novel underwent consequent modifications within each main phase.

She tried to follow through on what she perceived as her husband's objectives but her editing was confusing to the first professional editors, Weaver and Freeman, who mistook her writing for Melville's. At some point Elizabeth Melville placed the manuscript in \"a [[Japanning|japanned]] tin box\"<ref name=\"Parker Reading\">{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Hershel|title=Reading Billy Budd|year=1990|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, Ill.|isbn=0-8101-0961-1|pages=\"tin box\": 6, \"his proviso\": 45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MstCscWwSPkC&dq=reading+billy+budd+by+hershel+parker}}</ref> with the author's other literary materials, and it remained undiscovered for another 28 years.\n\n===Publication history===\n[[File:BillyBudd.png|thumb|right|First edition cover page, 1924.]]\n\nIn August 1918, Raymond M. Weaver, a professor at [[Columbia University]], doing research for what would become the first biography of Melville, paid a visit to Melville's granddaughter, Eleanor Melville Metcalf, at her [[South Orange, New Jersey]] home.  She gave him access to all the records of Melville which survived in the family: manuscripts, letters, journals, annotated books, photographs, and a variety of other material. Among these papers, Weaver was astonished to find a substantial manuscript for an unknown prose work entitled ''Billy Budd.''\n\nAfter producing a text that would later be described as \"hastily transcribed\",<ref name=Parker/> he published the first edition of the work in 1924 as ''Billy Budd, Foretopman'' in Volume XIII of the Standard Edition of Melville's ''Complete Works'' ([[Constable & Robinson|London: Constable and Company]]). In 1928 he published another version of the text which, despite numerous variations, may be considered essentially the same text.\n\nF. Barron Freeman published a second text in 1948, edited on different principles, as ''Melville's Billy Budd'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press). He believed he stayed closer to what Melville wrote, but still relied on Weaver's text, with what are now considered mistaken assumptions and textual errors. Subsequent editions of ''Billy Budd'' up through the early 1960s are, strictly speaking, versions of one or the other of these two basic texts.<ref>Hayford & Sealts, pp. 12\u201323</ref>\n\nAfter several years of study, in 1962, Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., established what is now considered the correct, authoritative text. It was published by the [[University of Chicago Press]], and contains both a \"reading\" and a \"genetic\" text. Most editions printed since then follow the Hayford-Sealts text.\n\nBased on the confusing manuscripts, the published versions had many variations. For example, early versions gave the book's title as ''Billy Budd, Foretopman'', while it now seems clear Melville intended ''Billy Budd, Sailor: (An Inside Narrative)''; some versions wrongly included as a preface a chapter that Melville had excised (the correct text has no preface). In addition, some early versions did not follow his change of the name of the ship to ''Bellipotent'' (from the [[Latin]] ''bellum'' war and ''potens'' powerful), from ''Indomitable'', as Melville called it in an earlier draft. It is unclear of his full intentions in changing the name of the ship since he used the name ''Bellipotent'' only six times.<ref>Hayford & Sealts, pp. 20</ref>\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\nThe book has undergone a number of substantial, critical reevaluations in the years since its discovery. Raymond Weaver, its first editor, was initially unimpressed and described it as \"not distinguished\". After its publication debut in England, and with critics of such caliber as [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[John Middleton Murry]] hailing it as a masterpiece, Weaver changed his mind. In the introduction to its second edition in the 1928 ''Shorter Novels of Herman Melville'', he declared: \"In ''Pierre'', Melville had hurled himself into a fury of vituperation against the world; with ''Billy Budd'' he would justify the ways of God to man.\" Outside of the English-speaking world, [[Thomas Mann]] declared ''Billy Budd'' \"one of the most beautiful stories in the world\" which \"made his heart wide open\" and declared that he wished he had written the dying scene of Billy.<ref>Andreas Platthaus: [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/autoren/zum-200-geburtstag-von-herman-melville-16304184-p2.html Melvilles 200. Geburtstag : Oh, h\u00e4tte ich das geschrieben!], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]], August 1, 2019 (German)</ref>\n\nIn mid-1924 Murry orchestrated the reception of ''Billy Budd, Foretopman,'' first in London, in the influential ''[[Times Literary Supplement]],'' in an essay called \"Herman Melville's Silence\" (July 10, 1924), then in a reprinting of the essay, slightly expanded, in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' (August 10, 1924). In relatively short order he and several other influential British literati had managed to canonize ''Billy Budd'', placing it alongside ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' as one of the great books of Western literature. Wholly unknown to the public until 1924, ''Billy Budd'' by 1926 had joint billing with the book that had just recently been firmly established as a literary masterpiece. In its first text and subsequent texts, and as read by different audiences, the book has kept that high status ever since.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\nIn 1990 the Melville biographer and scholar [[Hershel Parker]] pointed out that all the early estimations of ''Billy Budd'' were based on readings from the flawed transcription texts of Weaver. Some of these flaws were crucial to an understanding of Melville's intent, such as the famous \"coda\" at the end of the chapter containing the news account of the death of the \"admirable\" John Claggart and the \"depraved\" William Budd (25 in Weaver, 29 in Hayford & Sealts reading text, 344Ba in the genetic text) :\n\n''Weaver'': \"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this incongruous world of ours\u2014innocence and 'infirmary', spiritual depravity and fair 'respite'.\"\n\n''The Ms'': \"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this {''word undeciphered''} world of ours\u2014innocence and 'infamy', spiritual depravity and fair 'repute'.\"\n\nMelville had written this as an end-note after his second major revision. When he enlarged the book with the third major section, developing Captain Vere, he deleted the end-note, as it no longer applied to the expanded story. Many of the early readers, such as Murry and Freeman, thought this passage was a foundational statement of Melville's philosophical views on life. Parker wonders what they could possibly have understood from the passage as written.<ref name=\"Parker Reading\"/>\n\n==Analysis and interpretations==\n{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right  |quote=There appear to be three principal conceptions of the meaning of Melville's ''Billy Budd'': the first, and most heavily supported, that it is Melville's \"Testament of acceptance,\" his valedictory and his final benediction. The second view, a reaction against the first, holds that ''Billy Budd'' is ironic, and that its real import is precisely the opposite of its ostensible meaning. Still a third interpretation denies that interpretation is possible; a work of art has no meaning at all that can be abstracted from it, nor is a man's work in any way an index of his character or his opinion. All three of these views of ''Billy Budd'' are in their own sense true.|salign=right |source=\u2014R. H.

Vincent |chapter=Billy Budd \u2013 Acceptance or Irony |origyear=1958}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Hershel Parker]] agrees that \"masterpiece\" is an appropriate description of the book, but he adds a proviso. <blockquote>Examining the history and reputation of ''Billy Budd'' has left me more convinced than before that it deserves high stature (although not precisely the high stature it holds, whatever that stature is) and more convinced that it is a wonderfully teachable story\u2014as long as it is not taught as a finished, complete, coherent, and totally interpretable work of art.<ref name=\"Parker Reading\"/></blockquote> Given this unfinished quality and Melville's reluctance to present clear lessons, the range of critical response is not surprising.\n\nSome critics have interpreted ''Billy Budd'' as a historical novel that attempts to evaluate man's relation to the past. Thomas J. Scorza has written about the philosophical framework of the story. He understands the work as a comment on the historical feud between poets and philosophers. By this interpretation, Melville is opposing the scientific, rational systems of thought, which Claggart's character represents, in favor of the more comprehensive poetic pursuit of knowledge embodied by Billy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scorza|first=Thomas J.|title=In the Time Before Steamships: Billy Budd, the limits of politics and modernity|year=1979|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/intimebeforestea0000scor/page/210 210]|url=https://archive.org/details/intimebeforestea0000scor|url-access=registration|isbn=9780875800714}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Epistemology of the Closet'' (1990/2008), [[Eve Sedgwick]], expanding on earlier interpretations of the same themes, posits that the interrelationships between Billy, Claggart and Captain Vere are representations of male homosexual desire and the mechanisms of prohibition against this desire. She points out that Claggart's \"natural depravity,\" which is defined tautologically as \"depravity according to nature,\" and the accumulation of equivocal terms (\"phenomenal\", \"mystery\", etc.) used in the explanation of the fault in his character, are an indication of his status as the central homosexual figure in the text. She also interprets the mutiny scare aboard the ''Bellipotent'', the political circumstances that are at the center of the events of the story, as a portrayal of homophobia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Eve|title=Epistemology of the Closet|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-07042-9|pages=91\u2013130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMhUa25EPkIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMelville's dramatic presentation of the contradiction between the requirements of the law and the needs of humanity made the novella an \"iconic text\" in the field of [[law and literature]]. Earlier readers viewed Captain Vere as good man trapped by bad law.

The first two stages used [[hypergolic propellant|hypergolic propellants]] and the third stage used [[cryogenic]] [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] (LH2/LOX). Ariane 2\u20134 were enhancements of the basic vehicle. The major differences are improved versions of the [[Rocket engine|engines]], allowing stretched first- and third-stage tanks and greater payloads. The largest versions can launch two [[satellite]]s, mounted in the [[SPELDA]] (Structure Porteuse Externe pour Lancements Doubles Ariane) adapter.\n\nSuch later versions are often seen with strap-on [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]]. These layouts are designated by suffixes after the generation number. First is the total number of boosters, then letters designating [[liquid fuel|liquid]]- or [[solid fuel|solid-fueled]] stages. For example, an Ariane 42P is an Ariane 4 with two solid-fuel boosters. An Ariane 44LP has two solid, two liquid boosters, and a 44L has four liquid-fuel boosters.\n\nAriane 5 is a nearly complete redesign.

The name comes from the [[French language|French]] spelling of the mythological character [[Ariadne]]. France first proposed the '''Ariane project''' and it was officially agreed upon at the end of 1973 after discussions between France, Germany and the UK. The project was Western Europe's second attempt to develop its own launcher following the unsuccessful [[Europa rocket|Europa]] project. The Ariane project was code-named L3S (the French abbreviation for third-generation substitution launcher).\n\nThe [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) charged [[Airbus Defence and Space]], with the development of all Ariane launchers and of the testing facilities, while [[Arianespace]], a 32.5% [[CNES]] (French government space agency) commercial subsidiary created in 1980, handles production, operations and marketing.

The first two stages used [[hypergolic propellant|hypergolic propellants]] and the third stage used [[cryogenic]] [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] (LH2/LOX). Ariane 2\u20134 were enhancements of the basic vehicle. The major differences are improved versions of the [[Rocket engine|engines]], allowing stretched first- and third-stage tanks and greater payloads. The largest versions can launch two [[satellite]]s, mounted in the [[SPELDA]] (Structure Porteuse Externe pour Lancements Doubles Ariane) adapter.\n\nSuch later versions are often seen with strap-on [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]]. These layouts are designated by suffixes after the generation number. First is the total number of boosters, then letters designating [[liquid fuel|liquid]]- or [[solid fuel|solid-fueled]] stages. For example, an Ariane 42P is an Ariane 4 with two solid-fuel boosters. An Ariane 44LP has two solid, two liquid boosters, and a 44L has four liquid-fuel boosters.\n\nAriane 5 is a nearly complete redesign. The two hypergolic lower stages are replaced with a single LH2/LOX core stage. This simplifies the stack, along with the use of a single core engine ([[Vulcain]]). Because the core cannot lift its own weight, two solid-fuel boosters are strapped to the sides. The boosters can be recovered for examination, but are not reused.

To this group was added a man named Saturus, who voluntarily went before the magistrate and proclaimed himself a Christian.

When Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s feast was inserted into the Roman calendar, for celebration on the same day, the two African saints were thenceforth only commemorated. This was the situation in the [[Tridentine Calendar]] established by [[Pope Pius V]], and remained so until the year 1908, when [[Pope Pius X]] brought the date for celebrating them forward to 6 March.{{sfn|\"Calendarium\", p. 89}} In the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]] of the [[General Roman Calendar]] the feast of Saint Thomas Aquinas was moved, and that of Saints Perpetua and Felicity was restored to their traditional 7 March date.{{sfn|\"Calendarium\", p. 119}}\n\nOther Churches, including the [[Lutheran Church]] and the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], commemorate these two martyrs on 7 March, never having altered the date to 6 March.

They were put to death along with others at [[Carthage]] in the [[Africa (province)|Roman province of Africa]].\n\n''[[The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity]]'' narrates their death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heffernan |first1=Thomas J. |title=The passion of Perpetua and Felicity |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199777570 |doi=10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199777570.001.0001}}</ref><ref name=\"Gold\">{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Barbara K.|title=Perpetua: athlete of god|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195385458|location=Oxford|doi=10.1093/oso/9780195385458.001.0001}}</ref> According to the passion narrative, a slave named Revocatus, his fellow slave Felicitas, the two free men Saturninus and Secundulus, and Perpetua, who were [[catechumen]]s &ndash; that is, Christians being instructed in the faith but not yet baptized &ndash; were arrested and executed at the military games in celebration of the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]'s birthday. To this group was added a man named Saturus, who voluntarily went before the magistrate and proclaimed himself a Christian. Perpetua's diary was published posthumously, and has prompted extensive debate on families and gender in [[early Christianity]].\n\n==Veneration==\n[[File:Perpetua.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Mosaic of Saint Perpetua, Croatia]]\nIn Carthage a magnificent [[basilica]] was afterwards erected over the tomb of the martyrs, the Basilica Maiorum, where an ancient inscription bearing the names of Perpetua and Felicitas has been found.\n\nSaints Felicitas and Perpetua (in that order) are among the seven women and eight men commemorated by name in the list of ancient martyrs from the second part of the [[Canon of the Mass]]. The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] is commemorated in the first part.\n\nThe [[feast day]] of Saints Perpetua and Felicitas, 7 March, was celebrated even outside [[Africa (province)|Africa]], and is entered in the [[Chronography of 354|Philocalian Calendar]], the 4th-century calendar of martyrs venerated publicly at Rome. When Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s feast was inserted into the Roman calendar, for celebration on the same day, the two African saints were thenceforth only commemorated. This was the situation in the [[Tridentine Calendar]] established by [[Pope Pius V]], and remained so until the year 1908, when [[Pope Pius X]] brought the date for celebrating them forward to 6 March.{{sfn|\"Calendarium\", p. 89}} In the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]] of the [[General Roman Calendar]] the feast of Saint Thomas Aquinas was moved, and that of Saints Perpetua and Felicity was restored to their traditional 7 March date.{{sfn|\"Calendarium\", p. 119}}\n\nOther Churches, including the [[Lutheran Church]] and the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], commemorate these two martyrs on 7 March, never having altered the date to 6 March.  The [[Anglican Church of Canada]], however, historically commemorated them on 6 March (''[[The Book of Common Prayer]]'', 1962), but have since changed to the traditional 7 March date ([[Book of Alternative Services]], 1985).\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the feast day of Saints Perpetua of Carthage and the [[catechumens]] Saturus, Revocatus, Saturninus, Secundulus, and Felicitas is [[February 1 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|February 1]].<ref name=\"SYNAX\"/><ref name=\"OCA\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity]]''\n*[[List of Christian women of the patristic age]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Famous Carthaginians}}\n{{Catholic saints}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2nd-century births]]\n[[Category:203 deaths]]\n[[Category:Saints duos]]\n[[Category:Saints from Roman Africa (province)]]\n[[Category:Ante-Nicene Christian female saints]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Christian martyrs]]\n[[Category:Groups of Christian martyrs of the Roman era]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Christian martyrs]]\n[[Category:2nd-century Roman women]]\n[[Category:Christian slaves and freedmen|Felicity]]\n[[Category:3rd-century Roman women]]\n[[Category:3rd-century women writers]]\n[[Category:Carthaginian women]]\n[[Category:Executed Roman women]]\n[[Category:Punics]]\n[[Category:Vibii]]\n", "name_user": "Illegitimate Barrister", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetua_and_Felicity"}
