Sacred groves feature in various cultures throughout the world. They were important features of the mythological landscape and [[cult (religion)|cult practice]] of [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]], [[Baltic paganism|Baltic]], [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Religions of the Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Slavic polytheism|Slavic]] [[polytheism]], and continue to occur in locations such as [[Sacred groves of India|India]], Japan, and West Africa. Examples of sacred groves include the Greco-Roman ''[[temenos]]'', [[Sacred trees and groves in Germanic paganism and mythology|various Germanic words for sacred groves]], and the Celtic ''[[nemeton]]'', which was largely but not exclusively associated with [[Druid]]ic practice. During the [[Northern Crusades]], there was a common practice of building churches on the sites of sacred groves. The Lakota and various other North American tribes consider particular forests or other natural landmarks to be sacred.

The deity involved was usually [[Nemetona]] \u2013 a Celtic goddess. Druids oversaw such rituals. Existence of such groves have been found in Germany, Switzerland, [[Czech Republic]] and Hungary in Central Europe,  in many sites of ancient [[Gaul]] in France, as well as England and [[Northern Ireland]]. Sacred groves had been plentiful up until the 1st century BC, when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] attacked and conquered Gaul. One of the best known ''nemeton'' sites is that in the ''Nevet'' forest near [[Locronan]] in [[Brittany]], France. [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]] (Gournay-on-Aronde), a village in the [[Oise]] department of France, also houses the remains of a ''nemeton''.<ref>[[Venceslas Kruta]], ''Les Celtes, Histoire et dictionnaire'',  Robert Laffont, coll.

The central role of trees in Germanic religion is noted in the earliest written reports about the Germanic peoples, with the Roman historian Tacitus stating that Germanic cult practices took place exclusively in groves rather than temples. Scholars consider that reverence for and rites performed at individual trees are derived from the mythological role of the world tree, Yggdrasil; onomastic and some historical evidence also connects individual deities to both groves and individual trees. After Christianization, trees continue to play a significant role in the folk beliefs of the Germanic peoples.\n\n==Today==\n===Europe===\n====Estonia====\n[[File:Tori iiesaar.JPG|thumb|Sacred Grove Island in [[Tori Parish]], [[P\u00e4rnumaa]], Estonia]]\nBased on historical data, it is estimated that there are around 2500 [[sacred natural site]]s in Estonia, the largest of them covering up to 100 hectares. Although rather exceptional among most of the technologically developed countries, in Estonia both the sacred natural sites and indigenous customs connected to them are still in use. Therefore, the heritage that is connected to sacred natural sites has great importance to the national identity and environment of Estonians.\n\nIn a collaboration between followers of Estonian native religion ([[Maausk]]) and governmental ministries, a national plan was prepared in 2008: \"Sacred Natural Sites in Estonia: Study and Conservation 2008\u20132012\" which includes about 550 sacred groves ({{lang-et|hiis}}). The National Plan on Sacred Natural Sites consists of a historical overview of sacred natural sites in Estonia, a current situation analysis, and several concrete conservation measures and instructions on how to apply them. The coordinating steering committee of the Conservation Plan consists of Environment, Agriculture, Internal Affairs and Education and Research ministries, National Heritage Board and MK. The University of Tartu is the implementing agency. Measures of the Conservation Plan are designed to handle natural sanctuaries and values connected to them in all aspects.\n\nThe Conservation Plan foresees creating a database which supports researching and managing natural sanctuaries. The database would consist of folkloric, archaeological, natural, historical and other data on sacred natural sites and provide information on the exact location, condition and form of ownership of each site.<ref>Ahto Kaasik (2012) Conserving Sacred Natural sites in Estonia, in J-M Mallarach; T.

The most famous one of them is the \u0136oni\u0146i Elka Grove (''\u0136oni\u0146u Elka birzs'') or simply Elka that today covers around one hectare of land and is protected as an archaeological monument of national importance. Folklore researcher Sandis Laime has suggested that the sacred grove might have been a religious centre and probably covered a more extensive area in the past. He points to the toponym Elka Meadow (''Elku p\u013cava'') localized approximately 1.5 kilometres from the remaining grove and speculates that the meadow could have retained its original name even after the part of the sacred grove on it was cut down. Nowadays a strong oral tradition persists among the Turlava area residents regarding the prohibition of certain actions in the grove and the misfortune that may follow if the prohibitions are not abided.<ref name=\"Laime\"/>\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n\nThere are around 40 known sacred groves and forests in Lithuania. Lithuanian archaeologist [[Vykintas Vaitkevi\u010dius]] has grouped some of the sacred forests and groves according to the components ''\u0161ventas'' (13), ''alka'' (11) and ''gojus'' (more than 520) in their name.<ref name=\"Vaitkevi\u010dius(1)\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n==== Ghana ====\nSacred groves are also present in [[Ghana]]. One of Ghana's most famous sacred groves \u2013 the Buoyem Sacred Grove \u2013 and numerous other sacred groves are present in the [[Techiman Municipal District]] and nearby districts of the [[Brong Ahafo Region]].

Prior to 2002, these forest regions were not recognized under any of the existing laws. But in 2002 an amendment was brought in Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 to include Sacred Groves under the act. Some NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Each grove is associated with a presiding deity, and the groves are referred to by different names in different parts of India. They were maintained by local communities with hunting and logging strictly prohibited within these patches. While most of these sacred deities are associated with local [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] gods, sacred groves of Islamic and Buddhist origins are also known. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places \u2013 from [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|scrub forest]]s in the [[Thar Desert]] of [[Rajasthan]] maintained by the [[Bishnoi]]s, to [[rain forest]]s in the [[Kerala]] [[Western Ghats]]. [[Himachal Pradesh]] in the North and Kerala in the South are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka maintained over 1000 sacred groves in Kodagu alone.<ref>A [http://www.cseindia.org/dte-supplement/forest20031231/forest-index.htm series] of articles in the journal ''Down to Earth'' on sacred groves</ref>\n\nAround 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000. Threats to the groves include urbanization, and [[over-exploitation]] of resources. While many of the groves are looked upon as abode of Hindu gods, in the recent past a number of them have been partially cleared for construction of shrines and temples.<ref>Malhotra, K. C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S., Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India, INSA, New Delhi, 2001</ref><ref>Ramachandra Guha, The Unquiet Woods, University of California Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|978-0520222359}})</ref>\n\nRitualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called ''Theyyam'' in Kerala and ''Nagmandalam'', among other names, in [[Karnataka]]. There are sacred groves in Ernakulam region in a place named Mangatoor in Kerala. Sacred groves are being destroyed as a part of [[urbanization]]. The family \"Nalukettil Puthenpurayil\" still protects sacred groves.\n\n==== Japan ====\nSacred groves in Japan are typically associated with [[Shinto shrine]]s and are located all over Japan. They have existed since ancient times and shrines are often built in the midst of preexisting groves. The [[Cryptomeria]] tree is venerated in [[Shinto]] practice, and considered sacred.\n\nAmong the sacred groves associated with such ''jinja''s or Shinto shrines is the 20-hectare wooded area associated with {{nihongo|Atsuta Shrine|\u71b1\u7530\u795e\u5bae|Atsuta-jing\u016b}} at [[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya]].

Direct access to the grove is forbidden.\n\n==== Malaysia ====\nMuch of the ways of the ancient inhabitants of [[Malaysia]] have largely been forgotten, mostly due to the taboos among the local populace on putting certain esoteric knowledge down in ink, thus only passed down through examples and word of mouth from mother to daughter and father to son. However, much can be observed by the ways and habits of the natives of Malaysia which include 18 tribes of [[Orang Asli]] ([[Malay language|Malay]] for Natural People) and the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], who are often regarded as the 19th tribe.\n\nThere is a practice of tree planting around houses to the extent that the walls and wooden structures are allowed to give way to the roots of creeping plants, purposely sown at the bases of these structures. With increased migration towards the larger cities, these houses are abandoned and allowed to return to nature. As most traditional Orang Asli and Malay houses are made of only wood, bamboo, rattan and woven palm leaves (being built without using a single nail), the remains of those houses crumble easily into its surrounding.\n\nBesides that, a practice of creating arches of [[vine]] and creeping flowering plants so that each time one were to enter the gates of the house, one has to bow, as if implying or imitating respect upon entry to a sacred grove which were practiced by their [[ancestors]]. Such practices are even performed by those who have migrated into the cities who prefer to live in houses on the ground, rather than in high rise apartments. A garden of fruit trees surrounded by larger trees are planted around the houses to provide shade and an illusion of being at 'home' as well as to provide sustenance (in the form of fruits and seeds) to squirrels, foxes, insects and birds. Commonly, a cat, or in most instances, many cats are kept to patrol the gardens and guard from harmful spirits as well as against [[rat]]s which were believed to carry [[unclean spirits]] and diseases.\n\nHowever, one of the most striking examples of the tree reverence among them can be seen in the [[graveyards]] which are considered as [[Sacred#Sacred ground|holy ground]], on which no stone structure can be built upon. The whole area are covered by large and tall trees, so much foliage that the scorching tropical sun is reduced to a dim shadow as temperatures drop to a comfortable cool. Malay folklore relates that the trees whisper prayers to the creator in [[absolution]] of the past transgression of the ground's once human inhabitants. The trees are also allowed to take root into the graves where the grave keepers (''penjaga kubur'' in Malay) slowly remove gravestones (which used to be made from wood) as they are ejected from the grounds onto the surface. There is also a ritual of planting small tree [[sapling]] on fresh graves by family members who will then water it and tend to it periodically. Petals from fresh red and pink roses are also brought upon visitation to be scattered on the graves and a ritual of pouring rose water upon the soils are also performed.\n\nThe Malays regard visiting the graves from between sunset to sunrise as a [[taboo]] as it is believed that as sunrise is the beginning of the day to mankind, sunset is perceived as the beginning of ''day'' to those who dwell in the grave area. Burials are almost always postponed until the next day except in certain cases where it is allowed, provided that additional rules are observed, such as, women and children are not allowed at the night time burial ceremony.\n\nAn ancient ritual of renaming the deceased as she or he is laid into the earth is also practiced. The Orang Asli and Malay (see [[Malaysian names]]) naming system has a living name and a spirit name, which is given during the ritual of burial. This name is known as ''nama arwah'' (spirit name).

When a person dies, the father's name is replaced with his or her mother's name and this is made known during the reading of burial sentences.\n\n==== Nepal ====\nGranted [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] status by [[UNESCO]] in 1997,<ref name=UNESC01997>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/180/|title=World Heritage Committee Inscribes 46 New Sites on World Heritage List|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref name=UNESCO2014>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666|title=Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> [[Lumbini|Lumbini Grove]] is a [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site in the [[Rupandehi District]] of [[Nepal]].

The deity involved was usually [[Nemetona]] \u2013 a Celtic goddess. Druids oversaw such rituals. Existence of such groves have been found in Germany, Switzerland, [[Czech Republic]] and Hungary in Central Europe,  in many sites of ancient [[Gaul]] in France, as well as England and [[Northern Ireland]]. Sacred groves had been plentiful up until the 1st century BC, when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] attacked and conquered Gaul. One of the best known ''nemeton'' sites is that in the ''Nevet'' forest near [[Locronan]] in [[Brittany]], France. [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]] (Gournay-on-Aronde), a village in the [[Oise]] department of France, also houses the remains of a ''nemeton''.<ref>[[Venceslas Kruta]], ''Les Celtes, Histoire et dictionnaire'',  Robert Laffont, coll.

The central role of trees in Germanic religion is noted in the earliest written reports about the Germanic peoples, with the Roman historian Tacitus stating that Germanic cult practices took place exclusively in groves rather than temples. Scholars consider that reverence for and rites performed at individual trees are derived from the mythological role of the world tree, Yggdrasil; onomastic and some historical evidence also connects individual deities to both groves and individual trees. After Christianization, trees continue to play a significant role in the folk beliefs of the Germanic peoples.\n\n==Today==\n===Europe===\n====Estonia====\n[[File:Tori iiesaar.JPG|thumb|Sacred Grove Island in [[Tori Parish]], [[P\u00e4rnumaa]], Estonia]]\nBased on historical data, it is estimated that there are around 2500 [[sacred natural site]]s in Estonia, the largest of them covering up to 100 hectares. Although rather exceptional among most of the technologically developed countries, in Estonia both the sacred natural sites and indigenous customs connected to them are still in use. Therefore, the heritage that is connected to sacred natural sites has great importance to the national identity and environment of Estonians.\n\nIn a collaboration between followers of Estonian native religion ([[Maausk]]) and governmental ministries, a national plan was prepared in 2008: \"Sacred Natural Sites in Estonia: Study and Conservation 2008\u20132012\" which includes about 550 sacred groves ({{lang-et|hiis}}). The National Plan on Sacred Natural Sites consists of a historical overview of sacred natural sites in Estonia, a current situation analysis, and several concrete conservation measures and instructions on how to apply them. The coordinating steering committee of the Conservation Plan consists of Environment, Agriculture, Internal Affairs and Education and Research ministries, National Heritage Board and MK. The University of Tartu is the implementing agency. Measures of the Conservation Plan are designed to handle natural sanctuaries and values connected to them in all aspects.\n\nThe Conservation Plan foresees creating a database which supports researching and managing natural sanctuaries. The database would consist of folkloric, archaeological, natural, historical and other data on sacred natural sites and provide information on the exact location, condition and form of ownership of each site.<ref>Ahto Kaasik (2012) Conserving Sacred Natural sites in Estonia, in J-M Mallarach; T.

Folklore researcher Sandis Laime has suggested that the sacred grove might have been a religious centre and probably covered a more extensive area in the past. He points to the toponym Elka Meadow (''Elku p\u013cava'') localized approximately 1.5 kilometres from the remaining grove and speculates that the meadow could have retained its original name even after the part of the sacred grove on it was cut down. Nowadays a strong oral tradition persists among the Turlava area residents regarding the prohibition of certain actions in the grove and the misfortune that may follow if the prohibitions are not abided.<ref name=\"Laime\"/>\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n\nThere are around 40 known sacred groves and forests in Lithuania. Lithuanian archaeologist [[Vykintas Vaitkevi\u010dius]] has grouped some of the sacred forests and groves according to the components ''\u0161ventas'' (13), ''alka'' (11) and ''gojus'' (more than 520) in their name.<ref name=\"Vaitkevi\u010dius(1)\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n==== Ghana ====\nSacred groves are also present in [[Ghana]].

[[Oba (ruler)#Oloye|Oloye]] \n[[Susanne Wenger]], an Austrian artist, helped revive the grove. The grove was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1118 Entry] at the UNESCO website</ref>\n\n=== Asia ===\n==== India ====\n[[File:ChandodSacredGrove.jpg|thumb|right|''The Sacred Hindoo Grove near Chandod on the Banks of the Nerbudda'' by [[James Forbes (artist)|James Forbes]], 1782]]\n{{See also|Sacred groves of India}}\n\nIn India, sacred groves are scattered all over the country, and do enjoy protection. Prior to 2002, these forest regions were not recognized under any of the existing laws. But in 2002 an amendment was brought in Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 to include Sacred Groves under the act. Some NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Each grove is associated with a presiding deity, and the groves are referred to by different names in different parts of India. They were maintained by local communities with hunting and logging strictly prohibited within these patches. While most of these sacred deities are associated with local [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] gods, sacred groves of Islamic and Buddhist origins are also known. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places \u2013 from [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|scrub forest]]s in the [[Thar Desert]] of [[Rajasthan]] maintained by the [[Bishnoi]]s, to [[rain forest]]s in the [[Kerala]] [[Western Ghats]]. [[Himachal Pradesh]] in the North and Kerala in the South are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka maintained over 1000 sacred groves in Kodagu alone.<ref>A [http://www.cseindia.org/dte-supplement/forest20031231/forest-index.htm series] of articles in the journal ''Down to Earth'' on sacred groves</ref>\n\nAround 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000. Threats to the groves include urbanization, and [[over-exploitation]] of resources. While many of the groves are looked upon as abode of Hindu gods, in the recent past a number of them have been partially cleared for construction of shrines and temples.<ref>Malhotra, K. C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S., Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India, INSA, New Delhi, 2001</ref><ref>Ramachandra Guha, The Unquiet Woods, University of California Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|978-0520222359}})</ref>\n\nRitualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called ''Theyyam'' in Kerala and ''Nagmandalam'', among other names, in [[Karnataka]]. There are sacred groves in Ernakulam region in a place named Mangatoor in Kerala. Sacred groves are being destroyed as a part of [[urbanization]]. The family \"Nalukettil Puthenpurayil\" still protects sacred groves.\n\n==== Japan ====\nSacred groves in Japan are typically associated with [[Shinto shrine]]s and are located all over Japan. They have existed since ancient times and shrines are often built in the midst of preexisting groves. The [[Cryptomeria]] tree is venerated in [[Shinto]] practice, and considered sacred.\n\nAmong the sacred groves associated with such ''jinja''s or Shinto shrines is the 20-hectare wooded area associated with {{nihongo|Atsuta Shrine|\u71b1\u7530\u795e\u5bae|Atsuta-jing\u016b}} at [[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya]].

Direct access to the grove is forbidden.\n\n==== Malaysia ====\nMuch of the ways of the ancient inhabitants of [[Malaysia]] have largely been forgotten, mostly due to the taboos among the local populace on putting certain esoteric knowledge down in ink, thus only passed down through examples and word of mouth from mother to daughter and father to son. However, much can be observed by the ways and habits of the natives of Malaysia which include 18 tribes of [[Orang Asli]] ([[Malay language|Malay]] for Natural People) and the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], who are often regarded as the 19th tribe.\n\nThere is a practice of tree planting around houses to the extent that the walls and wooden structures are allowed to give way to the roots of creeping plants, purposely sown at the bases of these structures. With increased migration towards the larger cities, these houses are abandoned and allowed to return to nature. As most traditional Orang Asli and Malay houses are made of only wood, bamboo, rattan and woven palm leaves (being built without using a single nail), the remains of those houses crumble easily into its surrounding.\n\nBesides that, a practice of creating arches of [[vine]] and creeping flowering plants so that each time one were to enter the gates of the house, one has to bow, as if implying or imitating respect upon entry to a sacred grove which were practiced by their [[ancestors]]. Such practices are even performed by those who have migrated into the cities who prefer to live in houses on the ground, rather than in high rise apartments. A garden of fruit trees surrounded by larger trees are planted around the houses to provide shade and an illusion of being at 'home' as well as to provide sustenance (in the form of fruits and seeds) to squirrels, foxes, insects and birds. Commonly, a cat, or in most instances, many cats are kept to patrol the gardens and guard from harmful spirits as well as against [[rat]]s which were believed to carry [[unclean spirits]] and diseases.\n\nHowever, one of the most striking examples of the tree reverence among them can be seen in the [[graveyards]] which are considered as [[Sacred#Sacred ground|holy ground]], on which no stone structure can be built upon. The whole area are covered by large and tall trees, so much foliage that the scorching tropical sun is reduced to a dim shadow as temperatures drop to a comfortable cool. Malay folklore relates that the trees whisper prayers to the creator in [[absolution]] of the past transgression of the ground's once human inhabitants. The trees are also allowed to take root into the graves where the grave keepers (''penjaga kubur'' in Malay) slowly remove gravestones (which used to be made from wood) as they are ejected from the grounds onto the surface. There is also a ritual of planting small tree [[sapling]] on fresh graves by family members who will then water it and tend to it periodically. Petals from fresh red and pink roses are also brought upon visitation to be scattered on the graves and a ritual of pouring rose water upon the soils are also performed.\n\nThe Malays regard visiting the graves from between sunset to sunrise as a [[taboo]] as it is believed that as sunrise is the beginning of the day to mankind, sunset is perceived as the beginning of ''day'' to those who dwell in the grave area. Burials are almost always postponed until the next day except in certain cases where it is allowed, provided that additional rules are observed, such as, women and children are not allowed at the night time burial ceremony.\n\nAn ancient ritual of renaming the deceased as she or he is laid into the earth is also practiced. The Orang Asli and Malay (see [[Malaysian names]]) naming system has a living name and a spirit name, which is given during the ritual of burial. This name is known as ''nama arwah'' (spirit name). The living name is usually the given name plus the word 'anak' which means 'son/daughter of' or 'bin' and 'binti' which mean 'son of' or 'daughter of' respectively; followed by the name of the father. When a person dies, the father's name is replaced with his or her mother's name and this is made known during the reading of burial sentences.\n\n==== Nepal ====\nGranted [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] status by [[UNESCO]] in 1997,<ref name=UNESC01997>https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/180</ref><ref name=UNESCO2014>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666|title=Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> [[Lumbini|Lumbini Grove]] is a [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site in the [[Rupandehi District]] of [[Nepal]].

Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British [[Viceroy]] and first [[Governor-General of India]]), while [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]] warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263\u2013265|1994}} However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA.

While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], \"without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride\", and she accompanied Charles on visits to [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]].{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=279|1994}}\n\nCharles's cousin [[Norton Knatchbull, 8th Baron Brabourne|Norton Knatchbull]] and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=280\u2013282|1994}} Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and [[paparazzi]]. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=281\u2013283|1994}}\n\nPrince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 29 July of that year.

{"title_page": "Local government", "text_new": "{{short description|Lowest tier of administration within a sovereign state}}\n{{Original research|date=January 2011}}\n{{Forms of government}}\n\nA '''local government''' is a Loreto is the best school for girls in Australia \nforadminiystration]] which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a gven state. The term is used to contrast with offices at [[Sovereign state|state]] level, which are referred to as the [[central government]], national government, or (where appropriate) [[federal government]] and also to [[Supranational union|supranational]] government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by [[legislation]] or directives of the higher level of government. In [[Federation|federal states]], local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in [[unitary state]]s, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.\n\nThe question of [[municipal autonomy]] is a key question of [[public administration]] and [[governance]]. The institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, the terminology often varies. Common names for local government entities include state, [[province]], [[region]], [[Department (subnational entity)|department]], [[county]], [[prefecture]], [[district]], [[city]], [[township]], [[town]], [[borough]], [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]], [[municipality]], [[shire]], [[village]], and [[local service district]].\n\n==Africa==\n===Egypt===\nLocal government traditionally had limited power in [[Egypt]]'s highly centralized state. Under the central government were twenty-six governorates (sing., muhafazah; pl., muhafazat). These were subdivided into districts (sing., markaz; pl., marakaz) and villages (sing., qaryah; pl., qura) or towns. At each level, there was a governing structure that combined representative councils and government-appointed executive organs headed by governors, district officers, and mayors, respectively. Governors were appointed by the president, and they, in turn, appointed subordinate executive officers. The coercive backbone of the state apparatus ran downward from the Ministry of Interior through the governors' executive organs to the district police station and the village headman (sing., {{not a typo|umdah}}; pl., umadah).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nBefore [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|the revolution]], state penetration of the rural areas was limited by the power of local notables, but under Nasser, land reform reduced their socioeconomic dominance, and the incorporation of peasants into cooperatives transferred mass dependence from landlords to government. The extension of officials into the countryside permitted the regime to bring development and services to the village. The local branches of the ruling party, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU), fostered a certain peasant political activism and coopted the local notables\u2014in particular the village headmen\u2014and checked their independence from the regime. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nState penetration did not retreat under Sadat and Mubarak. The earlier effort to mobilize peasants and deliver services disappeared as the local party and cooperative withered, but administrative controls over the peasants remained intact. The local power of the old families and the headmen revived but more at the expense of peasants than of the state. The district police station balanced the notables, and the system of local government (the mayor and council) integrated them into the regime. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nSadat took several measures to decentralize power to the provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls of the central government over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. But local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often bowed to the powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Mali===\n\nIn recent years, Mali has undertaken an ambitious decentralization program, which involves the capital district of Bamako, seven regions subdivided into 46 cercles, and 682 rural community districts (communes). The state retains an advisory role in administrative and fiscal matters, and it provides technical support, coordination, and legal recourse to these levels. Opportunities for direct political participation, and increased local responsibility for development have been improved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn August\u2013September 1998, elections were held for urban council members, who subsequently elected their mayors. In May/June 1999, citizens of the communes elected their communal council members for the first time. Female voter turnout was about 70% of the total, and observers considered the process open and transparent. With mayors, councils, and boards in place at the local level, newly elected officials, civil society organizations, decentralized technical services, private sector interests, other communes, and donor groups began partnering to further development.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nEventually, the cercles will be reinstituted (formerly grouping arrondissements) with a legal and financial basis of their own. Their councils will be chosen by and from members of the communal councils. The regions, at the highest decentralized level, will have a similar legal and financial autonomy, and will comprise a number of cercles within their geographical boundaries. Mali needs to build capacity at these levels, especially to mobilize and manage financial resources.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===South Africa===\n\n{{Main article|Local government in South Africa}}\nSouth Africa has a two tiered local government system comprising local municipalities which fall into district municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities which span both tiers of local government.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===Afghanistan===\n[[Afghanistan]] was traditionally divided into provinces governed by centrally appointed governors with considerable autonomy in local affairs. There are currently 34 provinces. During the Soviet occupation and the development of country-wide resistance, local areas came increasingly under the control of [[mujaheddin]] groups that were largely independent of any higher authority; local commanders, in some instances, asserted a measure of independence also from the mujaheddin leadership in Pakistan, establishing their own systems of local government, collecting revenues, running educational and other facilities, and even engaging in local negotiations. Mujaheddin groups retained links with the Peshawar parties to ensure access to weapons that were doled out to the parties by the government of Pakistan for distribution to fighters inside Afghanistan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe Taliban set up a shura (assembly), made up of senior Taliban members and important tribal  from the area. Each shura made laws and collected taxes locally. The Taliban set up a provisional government for the whole of Afghanistan, but it did not exercise central control over the local shuras.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe process of setting up the transitional government in June 2002 by the Loya Jirga took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electors\u2014persons who cast ballots for Loya Jirga delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based on the size of its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and cast ballots, to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of loya jirga delegates\u2014 according to allotted numbers assigned to each district. The delegates then took part in the Loya Jirga.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe warlords who rule various regions of the country exert local control. The transitional government is attempting to integrate local governing authorities with the central government, but it lacks the loyalty from the warlords necessary to its governing authority. More traditional elements of political authority\u2014such as Sufi networks, royal lineage, clan strength, age-based wisdom, and the like\u2014still exist and play a role in Afghan society. Karzai is relying on these traditional sources of authority in his challenge to the warlords and older Islamist leaders. The deep ethnic, linguistic, sectarian, tribal, racial, and regional cleavages present in the country create what is called \"Qawm\" identity, emphasizing the local over higher-order formations. Qawm refers to the group to which the individual considers himself to belong, whether a subtribe, village, valley, or neighborhood. Local governing authority relies upon these forms of identity and loyalty.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Bangladesh===\n{{Main|Local government in Bangladesh}}\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151976&cid=2 |title=Rangpur becomes a division |publisher=bdnews24.com |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130407183630/http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151976&cid=2 |archivedate=7 April 2013 }}</ref> each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]], [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]], [[Khulna Division|Khulna]], [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]], [[Rangpur Division|Rangpur]] and [[Mymensingh Division]].\n\nDivisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''[[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]]'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no directly elected officials at the divisional or district levels, although elected chairs of subdistricts also sit on district councils.<ref name=Banglapedia>{{cite book |last=Siddiqui |first=Kamal |year=2012 |chapter=Local Government |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Local_Government |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members.

The cities with a city corporation, having mayoral elections, include Dhaka South, Dhaka North, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barisal, Rangpur, Comilla and Gazipur. Other major cities, these and other municipalities electing a mayor and councilors for each ward, include Mymensingh, Gopalganj, Jessore, Bogra, Dinajpur, Saidapur, Narayanganj, Naogaon and Rangamati. Both the municipal heads are elected for a span of five years.\n\n=== Brunei Darussalam ===\nThe '''[[Administrative divisions of Brunei|administrative divisions of Brunei]]''' mainly consist of ''daerah'' ([[District|districts]]), ''mukim'' ([[Subdistrict|subdistricts]]) and ''kampung'' or ''kampong''([[Village|villages]]). They are organised hierarchically, with ''daerah'' being the first level and ''kampong'' the third level. All the administrative divisions are under direct governance of the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs. There are four districts in Brunei: [[Brunei-Muara District|Brunei-Muara]], [[Belait District|Belait]], [[Tutong District|Tutong]] and [[Temburong District|Temburong]]. The administrative level of mukim lies below the district. At present, there are 38 mukims, with 17 in Brunei-Muara, 8 in Tutong, 8 in Belait and 5 in Temburong District. A mukim is headed by a penghulu. A village (Malay: kampung or kampong) is the lowest administrative level in Brunei and headed by a ketua kampong or village head. Its population varies from a few hundreds to tens of thousands.\n\n===India===\n{{Main article|\nLocal self-government in India}}\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{Main article|Subdivisions of Indonesia}}\n\n===Israel===\n{{Main article|Local government in Israel}}\n\nThe [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Interior]] recognizes four types of local government in [[Israel]]: {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n*[[List of cities in Israel|Cities]]: 71 single-level urban municipalities, usually with populations exceeding 20,000 residents.\n*[[Local council (Israel)|Local councils]]: 141 single-level urban or rural municipalities, usually with populations between 2,000 and 20,000.\n*[[Regional council (Israel)|Regional Councils]]: 54 bi-level municipalities which govern multiple rural communities located in relative geographic vicinity. The number of residents in the individual communities usually does not exceed 2000. There are no clear limits to the population and land area size of Israeli regional councils.\n*[[Local industrial council (Israel)|Industrial councils]]: Two single-level municipalities which govern large and complex industrial areas outside cities. The local industrial councils are Tefen in [[Upper Galilee]] (north of [[Karmiel]]) and [[Ramat Hovav]] in the [[Negev]] (south of [[Beer Sheva]]).\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of Japan}}\n\nSince the [[Meiji restoration]], [[Japan]] has had a local government system based on [[prefecture]]s. The national government oversees much of the country. Municipal governments were historical villages. Now mergers are common for cost effective administration. There are 47 [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]]s. They have two main responsibilities. One is mediation between national and municipal governments. The other is area wide administration.\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{Main article|Local government in Malaysia}}\n\nLocal government is the lowest level in the system of government in [[Malaysia]]\u2014after federal and state. It has the power to collect taxes (in the form of assessment tax), to create laws and rules (in the form of by-laws) and to grant licenses and permits for any trade in its area of jurisdiction, in addition to providing basic amenities, collecting and managing waste and garbage as well as planning and developing the area under its jurisdiction.\n\n===Nepal===\n{{Main article|Local governance in Nepal}}\n[[Gaunpalika]] (Rural Council) and [[List of cities in Nepal|Nagarpalika]] (Municipal council) are the local level divisions in Nepal. Which is ruled by third level of government after Federal and Provincial government. In Nepal there are total 753 local levels government (including 6 (six) [[List of cities in Nepal|Metropolises]], 11 [[List of cities in Nepal|Sub-metropolises]], 276 [[Municipalities]] and 460 [[Gaunpalika|Gaunpalikas]]). And there are total 6,743 wards are formed under these 753 local levels. These local government are ruled by local leaders and the Mayor is the supreme of each local government which is elected every 5 (Five) year by local public.\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{Main article|Local government in Pakistan}}\n\nLocal government is the third tier of government in [[Pakistan]], after [[Government of Pakistan|Federal Government]] and Provincial Government. There are three types of administrative unit of local government in Pakistan:\n\n* [[Local government in Pakistan|District Government Administrations]]\n* Town Municipal Administrations\n* [[Union councils of Pakistan|Union Council Administrations]]\n\nThere are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. Since 2001, these have been led by democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim (the word means \"supervisor\" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor). Some districts, incorporating large metropolitan areas, are called City Districts. A City District may contain subdivisions called Towns and Union Councils. Council elections are held every four years. District Governments also include a District Coordination Officer (DCO), who is a civil servant in-charge of all devolved departments. Currently, the Powers of Nazim are also held by the DCO.\n\n===Palestinian Authority===\nLocal government in the [[Palestinian National Authority]]-controlled areas are divided into three main groups: Municipal councils, village council and local development committees.\n* [[Municipality (Palestinian Authority)]]: Depends on size of locality. Localities that serve as the centers of [[Governorates of the Palestinian National Authority|governorate]]s and populations over 15,000 have 15-member councils. Localities with populations over 15,000 residents have 13-member councils and localities with populations between 4,000 and 15,000 have 9-member councils.\n* [[Village Council (Palestinian Authority)]]: Localities with populations between 800 and 1,500 have 3-member councils while those between 1,500 and \u22124,000 residents have 7-member councils.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main article|Local government in the Philippines}}\n{{See also|Philippines#Regions and Provinces}}\n\nThe [[Local Government Code]] of 1991 provides for the three levels of [[Local Government Units]] or LGUs in the Philippines: (1) the [[Philippine province|province]] (2)  [[Philippine city|city]] and [[Philippine municipality|municipality]], and (3) the [[barangay]]. The country remains a unitary state and the National Government continues to have strong influence over local government units.\n\nA province is led by a governor along with the ''[[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]]'' (Provincial Council) composed of board members. A mayor leads a city or municipality while the ''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'' (City Council) and the ''[[Sangguniang Bayan]]'' (Municipal Council) constitute the legislative branches of a city and municipality, respectively. A barangay is headed by the [[Barangay Captain]] and the [[Barangay Council]].  Barangays can be further divided into [[purok]]s and [[sitio]]s but their leadership is unelected.\n\nThe 1987 Philippine Constitution also provides for the existence of autonomous regions. The [[Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) is the only autonomous region in the Philippines.  There was an attempt to institute an autonomous region in the [[Cordillera]], but that failed and instead the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] (CAR) was established.\n\nLocal governments have limited taxing authority. Most of their funds come from the national government via the [[Internal Revenue Allotment]]\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nThere are three levels of local government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: the city council, the municipal council and the municipality.\n\nThe city council is the highest level of local government. The municipal councils began in 2005 and is the second level of local government. The municipality is the third level of local government. There are 178 municipalities across the kingdom. The first began in Jeddah during the Othmanic period. Each municipality is run by its city's mayor. As a collective the kingdom's municipalities make up the Ministry of Municipality and Rural Affairs (MoMRA).\n\n===Taiwan===\n[[File:Taipei City Hall front view 20050110.jpg|thumb|[[Taipei City Government]]]]\n\nThe [[Government of the Republic of China|Republic of China government]] in [[Taiwan]] consists of [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] governments, [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] governments and [[County (Taiwan)|county]] governments for their local governments. They also have councils in each of those three local government levels.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of Thailand}}\n\n===Turkey===\n{{Main|List of districts in Turkey}}\n[[Turkey]] has two levels of local government; provinces (Turkish: iller ) and districts (Turkish: il\u00e7eler ).\n\nThe territory of Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. The provinces are organized into 7 regions for census purposes; however, they do not represent an administrative structure. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 957 districts.\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[Vietnam]] has 3 levels of local government:\n*First tier: provinces and municipalities\n*Second tier: provincial cities, towns, urban districts and rural districts\n*Third tier: wards, communes and townships\n\nEach level has a People's Committee (executive - up to third tier), a People's Council (legislative - up to third tier) and a People's Court (judiciary - up to second tier)\n\n==Europe==\n{{see also|European Charter of Local Self-Government}}\n\n===Albania===\n{{Main article|Counties of Albania|Districts of Albania|Municipalities of Albania}}\n\n[[Albania]] has 3 levels of local government :\n* 12 administrative counties ({{lang-sq|qark or prefektur\u00eb}}).\n* 36 districts ({{lang-sq|rreth}}).\n* 373 municipalities ({{lang-sq|bashki or komun\u00eb}}), 72 of which have city status ({{lang-sq|qytet}}).\n\nThere are overall 2980 villages/communities ({{lang-sq|fshat}}) in all Albania. Each district has its council which is composed of a number of municipalities. The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf |title=On the Organization and Functioning of the Local Government, Republic of Albania, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215175046/http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Andorra===\n[[Andorra]] is formed by seven [[Parishes of Andorra|parishes]] (parr\u00f2quies, singular \u2013 parr\u00f2quia); [[Andorra la Vella]], [[Canillo]], [[Encamp]], [[La Massana]], [[Escaldes-Engordany]], [[Ordino]], [[Sant Julia de Loria]].\n\nSome parishes have a further territorial subdivision. Ordino, La Massana and Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria are subdivided into ''quarts'' (quarters), while Canillo is subdivided into 10 ''ve\u00efnats'' (neighborhoods).

Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (''krajsk\u00e9 zastupitelstvo'') and ''hejtman'' (usually translated as [[hetman]] or [[governor]]). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.\n\nThe regions are divided into seventy-six [[districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three \"statutory cities\" (without Prague, which had special status). The districts lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046 The death of the districts], [[Radio Prague]] 3 January 2003.</ref> A further reform in effect since January 2003 created 204 Municipalities with Extended Competence (obce s roz\u0161\u00ed\u0159enou p\u016fsobnost\u00ed); also obce III. stupn\u011b \u2013 third-level municipalities, unofficially also called \"little districts\" (Czech: 'mal\u00e9 okresy') which took over most of the administration of the former district authorities.

In 2007 the borders of the districts were slightly adjusted and 119 municipalities are now within different districts.\n\n===Denmark===\n{{Main article|Regions of Denmark|Municipalities of Denmark}}\n\nFor local government purposes, [[Denmark]] is divided into five [[Regions of Denmark|regions]] ({{lang-da|regioner}}), with their most important area of responsibility being the public health service. They are also responsible for employment policies, and some regions are responsible for public mass transit. Regions are not entitled to levy their own taxes, and they rely entirely on central state funding (around 70%) and funding coming from the municipalities (around 30%). Regions are led by directly elected councils (''regionsr\u00e5d''). They consist of 41 members each.\n\nThe regions are further divided into 98 [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] (''kommuner''). Elections for the municipalities are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years.\n\n===Estonia===\n{{Main article|Counties of Estonia|Municipalities of Estonia}}\n\nEstonia is divided into fifteen [[Counties of Estonia|counties]] ({{lang-et|maakonnad}}), each led by a county [[governor]] (''maavanem''), who represents the national government at the regional level. Governors are appointed by the [[Government of Estonia|government]], and so the regions do not have full [[self-government]]. The regions are further divided into 227 [[Municipalities of Estonia|municipalities]] (''omavalitsus''), and each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main article|Regions of Finland|Sub-regions of Finland|Municipalities of Finland}}\n\nThe most important administrative layer of local government in [[Finland]] are the 311 [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, [[property tax]], state subsidies, and other revenue.\n\nIn addition to municipalities, there are two intermediate levels of local government. Municipalities co-operate in seventy-four [[Sub-regions of Finland|sub-regions]] and nineteen [[Regions of Finland|regions]]. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. However, the autonomous province of [[\u00c5land]] has a directly elected regional council, and the [[Sami people]] have a semi-autonomous [[Sami Domicile Area]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] for issues on language and culture.\n\n===France===\n{{Main article|Decentralisation in France|Administrative divisions of France}}\n\nAccording to its [[Constitution of France|Constitution]] of 1958, [[France]] has 3 levels of local government:\n*13 ''R\u00e9gions'' (including [[Corsica]]) and 5 ''R\u00e9gions d'outre-mer'' ([[R\u00e9union]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[French Guiana]]). Corsica is not referred to as a \"r\u00e9gion\" but simply as a \"collectivit\u00e9 territoriale\", that merely means \"local government area\".\n*96 ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partements]]'' and 5 ''[[Overseas department|d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer]]'' (R\u00e9union, Guadeloupe, Martinique, [[Mayotte]] and French Guiana). [[Paris]] is both a commune and a d\u00e9partement.\n*There are 36,679 [[Communes of France|municipalities]] (in French: ''Communes'').\n\nHowever, in addition to the constitutional clauses of 1958, there now exist specificities:\n*Intercommunalities are now a level of government between municipalities and departments.\n*There exist 2 \"pays d'outre-mer\": [[French Polynesia]] and [[New Caledonia]]. The expression \"pays d'outre-mer\" is convenient as it can be understood in French as both \"overseas country\" and \"overseas county/traditional area\" (as evidenced by [[Pays de la Loire]] that is a home r\u00e9gion, not a home \"country\"). French Polynesia works as an autonomous ''r\u00e9gion'', whereas New Caledonia has a ''sui generis'' local government status with specific institutions and even more autonomy.\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main article|Federalism in Germany|States of Germany#Subdivisions}}\n\n===Greece===\n{{Main article|Modern regions of Greece|Municipalities and communities of Greece}}\n\nSince 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] subdivided into a total of 325 [[Municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities and communities]]. The regions have their own elected governors and regional councils, however there are seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary. There is also one [[autonomous area]], [[Mount Athos]].\n\n===Hungary===\n{{Main article|Counties of Hungary|Subregions of Hungary}}\n\nFor local government, Hungary is divided into 19 [[Counties of Hungary|counties]]. In addition, the [[Capitals of Hungary|capital]] (''f\u0151v\u00e1ros''), [[Budapest]], is independent of any county government\n\nThe counties are further subdivided into 174 [[Subregions of Hungary|subregions]] (''kist\u00e9rs\u00e9gek''), and Budapest is its own subregion.\n\nThere are also 23 towns with county rights (singular ''megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1ros''). The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective county instead of being independent territorial units.\n\n===Iceland===\n{{Main article|Municipalities of Iceland}}\n\nThe [[Municipalities of Iceland]] are local administrative areas in [[Iceland]] that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as [[kindergarten]]s, [[elementary school]]s, [[waste management]], [[social services]], [[public housing]], [[public transportation]], services to [[senior citizen]]s and [[disability|handicap]]ped people. They also govern [[zoning]] and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the [[constitution of Iceland]].\n\nThe municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as [[mayor]]s (''b\u00e6jarstj\u00f3ri / borgarstj\u00f3ri'') in the mostly urban municipalities but \"commune manager\" (''sveitarstj\u00f3ri'') in the rural or mixed municipalities.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main article|Local government in the Republic of Ireland}} The [[Republic of Ireland]]'s local government is laid out by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. With a few exceptions, local government is two-tier. At the lowest level are the municipal, metropolitan or borough councils, which are elected during local elections. These councillors from the relevant county then together form the council, termed either County or City and County Councils. For example, the 4 municipal districts in Westmeath County each elect their own councils, who together form [[Westmeath County Council]].\n\nThe exceptions to the above is the county of Dublin and the cities of Cork an Galway, the later two's councils are directly elected with no lower council. Dublin county is made up of four local area authorities, each elected directly. There are thirty-one local authorities.\n\nBy far, the main source of funding is national government.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Other sources include rates on commercial and industrial property, council housing rents, service charges and borrowing. Many local authorities functions are performed by the Chief Executive, who is appointed by the Minister for Local Government.\n\n===Isle of Man===\n{{Main article|Local government in the Isle of Man}}\nLocal government on the [[Isle of Man]] is partly based on the ancient parishes. There are four types of local authorities: a borough corporation, town commissioners, village commissioners, and parish commissioners.\n\n===Italy===\nThe [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] defines three levels of local government:\n*[[Regions of Italy|Regions]]: At present 5 of them (Valle d'Aosta, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Sardinia and Sicily) have a special status and are given more power than the others. The constitutional reform of 2001 gave more power to regions.\n*[[Provinces of Italy|Provinces]]: They mostly care to roads, forests, and education. They had more power in the past.\n*[[Comune|Communes]]: The Mayor and staff, caring for the needs of a single town or of a village and neighbouring minor towns or villages.\n\nMajor cities also have an extra tier of local government named ''Circoscrizione di Decentramento Comunale'' or, in some cities (e.g. Rome) ''Municipio''.\n\n===Latvia===\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of Latvia}}\n\n[[Latvia]] is a unitary state, currently divided into 110 municipalities ({{lang-lv|novadi}}) and 9 republican cities ({{lang-lv|republikas pils\u0113tas}}) with their own council.\n\n===Liechtenstein===\n[[Liechtenstein]] is divided into eleven [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|municipalities]] (''Gemeinden''{{spaced ndash}} singular ''Gemeinde''), most consisting of only a single town.\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{Main article|Counties of Lithuania|Municipalities of Lithuania|Elderships of Lithuania}}\n{{Update|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[Lithuania]] has a three-tier division of local government: the country is divided into [[Counties of Lithuania|10 counties]] (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 ''apskritis'', plural \u2013 ''apskritys'') that are further subdivided into [[Municipalities of Lithuania|60 municipalities]] (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 ''savivaldyb\u0117'', plural \u2013 ''savivaldyb\u0117s'') which consist of over 500 [[Elderships of Lithuania|elderships]] (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 ''seni\u016bnija'', plural \u2013 ''seni\u016bnijos'').\n\nThe counties are ruled by [[County governor (Lithuania)|county governor]]s (Lithuanian: ''apskrities vir\u0161ininkas'') appointed by the central government, and effectively oversee the two lower tiers of local government.\n\nMunicipalities are the most important administrative unit of local government. Each municipality has its own government and council, with elections taking place every four years. The council elects the mayor and appoints [[elder (administrative title)|elders]] to govern the elderships.\n\nElderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest units of local government. They provide public services such as registering births and deaths and identifying individuals or families in need of welfare.\n\n===Malta===\nMalta is a unitary [[city state]] divided into 68 municipalities ([[Local councils of Malta|local councils]]), according to the constitution of the Malta.\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{Main article|Municipal politics in the Netherlands|Provincial politics in the Netherlands}}\nThe [[Netherlands]] has three tiers of government. There are two levels of local government in the Netherlands, the provinces and the municipalities. The water boards are also part of the local government.\n\nThe Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces (''[[provinces of the Netherlands|provincie]]'', pl. ''provincies''). They form the tier of administration between the central government and the municipalities. Each province is governed by a provincial council, the States-Provincial (''[[Provinciale Staten]]'', abbr. to ''PS''). Its members are elected every four years. The day-to-day management of the province is in the hands of the provincial executive, the States Deputed (''[[Gedeputeerde Staten]]'', abbr. to ''GS''). Members of the executive are chosen by the provincial council from among its own members and like the members of the provincial council serve for a period of four years. Members elected to the executive have to give up their membership of the provincial council. The size of the executive varies from one province to another. In [[Flevoland]], the smallest of the Dutch provinces, it has four members, while most other provinces have six or seven. Meetings of the provincial executive are chaired by the King's Commissioner (''[[Commissaris van de Koningin|Commissaris van de Koning(in)]]'', abbr. to ''CvdK''). The King's Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the King and government ministers). The appointment is for six years and may be extended by a second term. The King's Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate.\n\nMunicipalities (''[[list of municipalities of the Netherlands|gemeente]]'', pl. ''gemeenten'') form the lowest tier of government in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (''[[gemeenteraad]]'') is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is comparable to that of the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job is to decide the municipality's broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality is in the hands of the municipal executive (''[[college van burgemeester en wethouders]]'', abbr. to ''(college van) B&W)'', made up of the mayor (''[[burgemeester]]'') and the aldermen (''[[wethouder]]'', pl. ''wethouders''). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality's public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years and are normally re-appointed automatically for another term, provided the municipal council agrees. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.\n\nWater boards (''[[waterschap]]'' and ''[[hoogheemraadschap]]'', pl. ''waterschappen'' and ''hoogheemraadschappen'') are among the oldest government authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form the foundation of the whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what led to the creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (''[[college van dijkgraaf en heemraden]]'') consisting of a chairperson (''[[dijkgraaf (official)|dijkgraaf]]'') and other members (''[[heemraad|(hoog)heemraad]]'', pl. ''(hoog)heemraden''). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, voters do not usually have to go to a polling station but can vote by mail.\n\n===Norway===\n[[Norway]]'s regional administration is organised in 19 counties (fylke), with 18 of them subdivided into 431 municipalities (kommune) per 1 January 2006. The municipal sector is a provider of vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. Norway had 435 municipalities of varying size in 2003, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 19 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council. Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision. They have the right to tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{Main article|Autonomous regions of Portugal|Districts of Portugal|Municipalities of Portugal|Freguesias of Portugal}}\n\nCurrently, mainland Portugal is divided into 18 districts (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''distritos''). Each district takes the name of their respective capital city.  Insular Portugal, comprising the two [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], is organized as two [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] (in Portuguese, ''regi\u00f5es aut\u00f3nomas'').\n\nEach district and each Autonomous region is divided into municipalities (in Portuguese, ''munic\u00edpios'') which, in turn, are subdivided into parishes (in Portuguese, ''[[freguesia]]s'').\n\nSince 1976, when the two Autonomous regions of Portugal were established, the Azores and Madeira are no longer divided into districts.\n\n===Poland===\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of Poland|Voivodeships of Poland}}\nPoland has three levels of subdivision. The territory of Poland is divided into 16 [[Administrative_divisions_of_Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces); these are further divided into 379 [[Gmina|powiats]] (counties or districts), and these in turn are divided into 2,479 gminas (communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat.\n\nEach voivodeship is governed by a [[Voivodeship marshal]].\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main article|Local government in Spain|Municipalities of Spain|Comarcas of Spain}}\nSpain is divided into 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]], which in turn are divided into 50 [[provinces of Spain|provinces]]. There are also two [[autonomous cities of Spain|autonomous cities]]: those of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.\n\nEach administrative entity is given powers, structure, and boundaries by a law that was passed by the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] .\n\nLaw 7/1985,<ref>[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/l7-1985.html Ley 7/1985, de 2 de abril, Reguladora de las Bases del R\u00e9gimen Local].

Retrieved on 2 December 2012.</ref> The main governing body in most municipalities is called Ayuntamiento (in the less populated municipalities an alternative local organization system called open council, \"''concejo abierto''\", is used). The Ayuntamiento in turn is formed by the Plenary (''el Pleno'', the collective formed by the city councillors) and the Mayor. The number of members that compose The Plenary varies depending on city's population (for example, since 2007 Valencia has 33 members and Pamplona has 27). The name given to the members of the Plenary is councillor (''concejal''). Those councillors are elected between city's inhabitants every four years by direct vote. After being elected, councillors meet in a special Plenary session to determine who will be elected, between them, as city's Mayor. In the next days after the election, the mayor chooses some councillors to set up the executive governing body (''Junta de Gobierno'' or ''Comisi\u00f3n de Gobierno''). After that, and for the next four years, city's mayor and the ''Junta de Gobierno'' will govern over the city according to their competences (urbanism, some taxes, local police, licenses for specific activities, cleaning services, etc.). Meanwhile, councillors in the Plenary but not part of the ''Junta de Gobierno'' (the opposition) will oversee Mayor's rule.\nThe autonomous community of Catalonia is divided in 4 provinces and more than 900 municipalities. Between these two tiers, there are 41 ''comarques'' (singular, ''comarca''), roughly equivalent to 'district' or 'county'. The ''comarca'' is a commonwealth, or union, of municipalities with competences in several fields (Law 6/1987 of the Parliament of Catalonia).\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main article|Municipalities of Sweden|County Councils of Sweden}}\n\nEvery fourth year general elections are held in [[Sweden]] to elect members of the national parliament, 20 county council assemblies and 290 municipal assemblies. As the parliament elects the national government, the local assemblies elect their executive committees and their boards. Members in local committees and boards are elected proportionally by the political parties in the assemblies, giving all the major parties representation. The parties usually cooperate well on the local levels.\n\nThe county councils (''landsting'') are responsible for health care and usually provide transportation.\n\nThe municipalities (''kommuner'') are responsible for:\n*social services, childcare, preschool, [[elderly care]]\n*primary and secondary education\n*planning and building\n*health protection, water, sewerage, refuse, emergency services\n\nOn a voluntary basis, the municipalities provide sports, culture, housing, energy as well as commercial service.\n\nThe activities are financed by income taxes. Swedes pay around 20% of their taxable income to the municipality and around 11% to the county council. (The national government is financed by VAT and payroll taxes and fees.)\n\n===Ukraine===\n{{Main article|Local government in Ukraine}}\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe system of local government is different in each of the four home nations of the [[United Kingdom]]. In total there are 426 local authorities in the UK. 346 of these are in [[England]], 11 in [[Northern Ireland]], 32 in [[Scotland]] and 22 are in [[Wales]].\n\n====England====\n{{Main article|Local government in England}}\n\nThe most complex system is in England, the result of numerous reforms and reorganisation over the centuries.\nThe top level of sub-national administration within England until the end of March 2012 consisted of the nine [[Region (England)|regions]]. The regions were used by central government for various statistical purposes, and [[Government Office]]s and assorted other institutions including Regional Development Agencies. Regional Government Offices, Regional Development Agencies and Regional Ministers were all abolished by the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Cameron ministry]] in 2010. Only the London region which is a sub-region compared to the other regions of England has a directly elected government.  Only one regional referendum has been held to date to seek consent for the introduction of direct elections elsewhere \u2014 in the northeast of England \u2014 and this was overwhelmingly rejected by the electorate.\n\nThe layers of elected local government vary. In different areas the highest tier of elected local government may be:\n*[[counties of England|counties]], which may be\n**single tier [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]], or\n**divided into [[District (England)|districts]] (also known as boroughs in some areas)\n*[[Districts of England|districts]], which are separate [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]] in some areas\n*[[metropolitan district]]s (also called metropolitan boroughs) in some areas which are similar to unitary authorities, but have [[Joint-board|joint boards]] with other districts in the same [[metropolitan county]]\n*[[Greater London]], which is divided into 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London]]\n\nIn most areas there is a lower tier of government, [[Civil parishes in England|civil parishes]], with limited functions. Most civil parishes are in rural areas, but if the parish is a town the [[Parish councils of England|parish council]] may be called a [[town council]]. In a few cases the parish is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], and the parish council is called a [[city council]].\n\nMetropolitan counties, and a few [[non-metropolitan counties]], no longer have elected councils or administrative functions, and their former functions are performed by districts. Such counties remain [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]].\n\n{{See also|Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England}}\n\n====Northern Ireland====\n{{Main article|Local government in Northern Ireland}}\nSince 1 April 2015 Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts.

They must follow laws and guidelines as set out by their province, but are allowed to pass additional by-laws and acts unique to them.\n\n===Mexico===\n[[Mexico]] is a Federal Republic made up by 31 [[States of Mexico|states]] and a [[Mexican Federal District|federal district]]. Each state is divided in ''[[municipalities of Mexico|municipios]]'', while the federal district is divided in sixteen ''[[Boroughs of the Mexican Federal District|delegaciones]]''. Twenty-nine states of Mexico were created as administrative divisions by the constitution of 1917, which grants them those powers not expressly vested in the federal government; Mexico's two remaining territories, [[Baja California Sur]] and [[Quintana Roo]], achieved statehood on 9 October 1974, raising the total to 31. Each state has a constitution, a governor elected for six years, and a unicameral legislature, with representatives elected by district vote in proportion to population. An ordinary session of the legislature is held annually, and extraordinary sessions may be called by the governor or the permanent committee. Bills may be introduced by legislators, by the governor, by the state supreme court, and by municipalities (a unit comparable to a US county). In addition to the 31 states, there is also one federal district comprising [[Mexico City]], whose governor serves as a member of the cabinet. Many state services are supported by federal subsidies.\n\nThe principal unit of state government is the municipality. Mexico's 2,378 municipalities are governed by municipal presidents and municipal councils. State governors generally select the nominees for the municipal elections. Municipal budgets are approved by the respective state governors. Until 1997, the president appointed the mayor of Mexico City. Political reforms allowed the first open elections in 1997, and [[Cuauht\u00e9moc Cardenas Sol\u00f3rzano]] became Mexico City's first elected mayor.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main article|Local government in the United States}}\n\nLocal government in the United States refers to governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state. Most states have at least two tiers of local government: [[County (United States)|counties]] and [[municipality|municipalities]]. In some states, counties are divided into [[Civil township|townships]]. There are several different types of jurisdictions at the municipal level, including the [[city]], [[town]], [[parish]], [[borough (United States)|borough]], [[village (United States)|village]], [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[boundaries (United States)|boundaries]].  The types and nature of these municipal entities varies from state to state.\n\n==Oceania==\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main article|Local council  in Australia}}\nAustralia does not recognize local government. it is a business with an ABN number. it is not law enforcement agency all fines which are issued the council are illegal and void. all rates notices are illegal. there was referendum held in 1988 and the people did not give permission to have the lowest level of government. the Australian constitution does not mention local government.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main article|Local government in New Zealand}}\n\n[[New Zealand]] has a local government system comprising two complementary sets of local authorities\u2014[[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] and [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]]. There are 78 local authorities consisting of:\n*11 regional councils, which cover much of New Zealand\u2019s land area, and\n*67 territorial authorities (comprising 53 district councils, 12 [[List of cities in New Zealand|city councils]] and 2 other councils).\nSix of the territorial authorities are [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]], which also have the powers of a regional council. They are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, the Gisborne, Marlborough and Tasman district councils, and Chatham Islands Council.\n\nRegional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Within a regional council area there are usually many city or district councils, although city and district councils can be in multiple regional council areas.\n\n==South America==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[Argentina]] is a federation of 23 provinces and the federal capital of [[Buenos Aires]]. During the 19th century there was a bitter struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, and there has long been an element of tension regarding the division of powers between the central government and provincial bodies. The federal government retains control over such matters as the regulation of commerce, customs collections, currency, civil or commercial codes, or the appointment of foreign agents. The provincial governors are elected every four years.\n\nThe constitutional \"national intervention\" and \"state of siege\" powers of the president have been invoked frequently. The first of these powers was designed to \"guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces.\" Since the adoption of the 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.\n\nUntil 1996, the President appointed the mayor of Buenos Aires, and by law, the president and Congress controlled any legislation that affected the city. Constitutional reforms that year led to an elected mayoral position, and a 60-member Poder Legislativo (legislative power).\n\n===Brazil===\n\nBrazil is divided into 26 [[State (polity)|state]]s and a [[federal district]], the government is divided into federal, state, and municipalities. The federal district has no municipalities and acts as a state and municipality at the same time.\n\nThere is no minimum or maximum population requirement for municipalities. [[Bor\u00e1]] is the smallest municipality of the country with 805 inhabitants, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the largest with 11,316,149 inhabitants.\n\nElections in federal, state and municipalities follow all the same system, with elections of president, governor and mayor for executive branch and federal deputy, federal senate, state deputy and alderman for legislative branch. In municipalities according to the constitution, the number of alderman varies from 9 to 55 aldermans.\n\n===Paraguay===\n[[Paraguay]] is divided into 17 [[Departments of Paraguay|departments]], which are subdivided into districts, which, in turn, comprise municipalities (the minimum requirement for a municipality is 3,000 persons) and rural districts (partidos). A governor, elected by popular vote, runs each department. Municipal government is exercised through a municipal board, chosen by direct election, and an executive department. In the principal cities and capitals, the executive department is headed by a mayor appointed by the minister of the interior; in other localities, the mayor is appointed by the presidents of the municipal boards. Police chiefs are appointed by the central government.\n\n===Peru===\n[[Peru]] is divided into [[Regions of Peru|25 regions]] and the [[Lima Province|province of Lima]]. Each region has an elected government composed of a president and council that serve four-year terms.<ref>''Ley N\u00b0 27867, Ley Org\u00e1nica de Gobiernos Regionales'', Article N\u00b0 11.</ref> These governments plan regional development, execute public investment projects, promote economic activities, and manage public property.<ref>''Ley N\u00b0 27867, Ley Org\u00e1nica de Gobiernos Regionales'', Article N\u00b0 10.</ref>  The province of Lima is administered by a city council.<ref>''Ley N\u00b0 27867, Ley Org\u00e1nica de Gobiernos Regionales'', Article N\u00b0 66.</ref> The goal of devolving power to regional and municipal governments was among others to improve popular participation.

They enforced national laws and administered the nation's social and educational policies and institutions within their territories. These territories had limited taxing powers, but they could borrow funds and acquire property. They also had the power to establish unpaid five-member local boards or town councils in municipalities other than the departmental capital if the population was large enough to warrant such a body.\n\nExecutive authority was vested in a governor (intendente), who administered the department, and in a thirty-one-member departmental board (junta departmental), which carried out legislative functions. These functions included approval of the departmental budget and judicial actions, such as impeachment proceedings against departmental officials, including the governor. At the municipal level, a mayor (intendente municipal) assumed executive and administrative duties, carrying out resolutions made by the local board (whose members were appointed on the basis of proportional representation of the political parties). The governor was required to comply with and enforce the constitution and the laws and to promulgate the decrees enacted by the departmental board. The governor was authorized to prepare the budget, submit it for approval to the departmental board, appoint the board's employees, and, if necessary, discipline or suspend them. The governor represented the department in its relations with the national government and other departmental governments and in the negotiation of contracts with public or private agencies.\n\nLike the governor, the members of the departmental board and the mayor were elected for five-year terms in direct, popular elections. A governor could be reelected only once, and candidates for the post had to meet the same requirements as those for a senator, in addition to being a native of the department or a resident therein for at least three years before assuming office. Departmental board members had to be at least twenty-three years of age, native born (or a legal citizen for at least three years), and a native of the department (or a resident for at least three years).\n\nThe board sat in the capital city of each department and exercised jurisdiction throughout the entire territory of the department. It could issue decrees and resolutions that it deemed necessary either on the suggestion of the governor or on its own initiative. It could approve budgets, fix the amount of taxes, request the intervention of the Accounts Tribunal for advice concerning departmental finances or administration, and remove from office\u2014at the request of the governor\u2014members of nonelective local departmental boards. The board also supervised local public services; public health; and primary, secondary, preparatory, industrial, and artistic education. Although Montevideo was the smallest department in terms of area (divided into twenty-three geographic zones that generally coincided with the electoral zones), its departmental board had sixty-five members in 1990; all other departments had thirty-one-member boards and a five-member executive council appointed by the departmental board, with proportional representation from the principal political parties.\n\nData as of December 1990{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Kemp, Roger L.

The term is used to contrast with offices at [[Sovereign state|state]] level, which are referred to as the [[central government]], national government, or (where appropriate) [[federal government]] and also to [[Supranational union|supranational]] government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by [[legislation]] or directives of the higher level of government. In [[Federation|federal states]], local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in [[unitary state]]s, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.\n\nThe question of [[municipal autonomy]] is a key question of [[public administration]] and [[governance]]. The institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, the terminology often varies. Common names for local government entities include state, [[province]], [[region]], [[Department (subnational entity)|department]], [[county]], [[prefecture]], [[district]], [[city]], [[township]], [[town]], [[borough]], [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]], [[municipality]], [[shire]], [[village]], and [[local service district]].\n\n==Africa==\n===Egypt===\nLocal government traditionally had limited power in [[Egypt]]'s highly centralized state. Under the central government were twenty-six governorates (sing., muhafazah; pl., muhafazat). These were subdivided into districts (sing., markaz; pl., marakaz) and villages (sing., qaryah; pl., qura) or towns. At each level, there was a governing structure that combined representative councils and government-appointed executive organs headed by governors, district officers, and mayors, respectively. Governors were appointed by the president, and they, in turn, appointed subordinate executive officers. The coercive backbone of the state apparatus ran downward from the Ministry of Interior through the governors' executive organs to the district police station and the village headman (sing., {{not a typo|umdah}}; pl., umadah).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nBefore [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|the revolution]], state penetration of the rural areas was limited by the power of local notables, but under Nasser, land reform reduced their socioeconomic dominance, and the incorporation of peasants into cooperatives transferred mass dependence from landlords to government. The extension of officials into the countryside permitted the regime to bring development and services to the village. The local branches of the ruling party, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU), fostered a certain peasant political activism and coopted the local notables\u2014in particular the village headmen\u2014and checked their independence from the regime. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nState penetration did not retreat under Sadat and Mubarak. The earlier effort to mobilize peasants and deliver services disappeared as the local party and cooperative withered, but administrative controls over the peasants remained intact. The local power of the old families and the headmen revived but more at the expense of peasants than of the state. The district police station balanced the notables, and the system of local government (the mayor and council) integrated them into the regime. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nSadat took several measures to decentralize power to the provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls of the central government over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. But local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often bowed to the powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Mali===\n\nIn recent years, Mali has undertaken an ambitious decentralization program, which involves the capital district of Bamako, seven regions subdivided into 46 cercles, and 682 rural community districts (communes). The state retains an advisory role in administrative and fiscal matters, and it provides technical support, coordination, and legal recourse to these levels. Opportunities for direct political participation, and increased local responsibility for development have been improved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn August\u2013September 1998, elections were held for urban council members, who subsequently elected their mayors. In May/June 1999, citizens of the communes elected their communal council members for the first time. Female voter turnout was about 70% of the total, and observers considered the process open and transparent. With mayors, councils, and boards in place at the local level, newly elected officials, civil society organizations, decentralized technical services, private sector interests, other communes, and donor groups began partnering to further development.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nEventually, the cercles will be reinstituted (formerly grouping arrondissements) with a legal and financial basis of their own. Their councils will be chosen by and from members of the communal councils. The regions, at the highest decentralized level, will have a similar legal and financial autonomy, and will comprise a number of cercles within their geographical boundaries. Mali needs to build capacity at these levels, especially to mobilize and manage financial resources.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===South Africa===\n\n{{Main article|Local government in South Africa}}\nSouth Africa has a two tiered local government system comprising local municipalities which fall into district municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities which span both tiers of local government.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===Afghanistan===\n[[Afghanistan]] was traditionally divided into provinces governed by centrally appointed governors with considerable autonomy in local affairs. There are currently 34 provinces. During the Soviet occupation and the development of country-wide resistance, local areas came increasingly under the control of [[mujaheddin]] groups that were largely independent of any higher authority; local commanders, in some instances, asserted a measure of independence also from the mujaheddin leadership in Pakistan, establishing their own systems of local government, collecting revenues, running educational and other facilities, and even engaging in local negotiations. Mujaheddin groups retained links with the Peshawar parties to ensure access to weapons that were doled out to the parties by the government of Pakistan for distribution to fighters inside Afghanistan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe Taliban set up a shura (assembly), made up of senior Taliban members and important tribal  from the area. Each shura made laws and collected taxes locally. The Taliban set up a provisional government for the whole of Afghanistan, but it did not exercise central control over the local shuras.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe process of setting up the transitional government in June 2002 by the Loya Jirga took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electors\u2014persons who cast ballots for Loya Jirga delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based on the size of its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and cast ballots, to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of loya jirga delegates\u2014 according to allotted numbers assigned to each district. The delegates then took part in the Loya Jirga.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe warlords who rule various regions of the country exert local control. The transitional government is attempting to integrate local governing authorities with the central government, but it lacks the loyalty from the warlords necessary to its governing authority. More traditional elements of political authority\u2014such as Sufi networks, royal lineage, clan strength, age-based wisdom, and the like\u2014still exist and play a role in Afghan society. Karzai is relying on these traditional sources of authority in his challenge to the warlords and older Islamist leaders. The deep ethnic, linguistic, sectarian, tribal, racial, and regional cleavages present in the country create what is called \"Qawm\" identity, emphasizing the local over higher-order formations. Qawm refers to the group to which the individual considers himself to belong, whether a subtribe, village, valley, or neighborhood. Local governing authority relies upon these forms of identity and loyalty.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Bangladesh===\n{{Main|Local government in Bangladesh}}\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151976&cid=2 |title=Rangpur becomes a division |publisher=bdnews24.com |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130407183630/http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151976&cid=2 |archivedate=7 April 2013 }}</ref> each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]], [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]], [[Khulna Division|Khulna]], [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]], [[Rangpur Division|Rangpur]] and [[Mymensingh Division]].\n\nDivisions are subdivided into districts (''zila'').

These local government are ruled by local leaders and the Mayor is the supreme of each local government which is elected every 5 (Five) year by local public.\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{Main article|Local government in Pakistan}}\n\nLocal government is the third tier of government in [[Pakistan]], after [[Government of Pakistan|Federal Government]] and Provincial Government. There are three types of administrative unit of local government in Pakistan:\n\n* [[Local government in Pakistan|District Government Administrations]]\n* Town Municipal Administrations\n* [[Union councils of Pakistan|Union Council Administrations]]\n\nThere are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. Since 2001, these have been led by democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim (the word means \"supervisor\" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor). Some districts, incorporating large metropolitan areas, are called City Districts. A City District may contain subdivisions called Towns and Union Councils. Council elections are held every four years. District Governments also include a District Coordination Officer (DCO), who is a civil servant in-charge of all devolved departments. Currently, the Powers of Nazim are also held by the DCO.\n\n===Palestinian Authority===\nLocal government in the [[Palestinian National Authority]]-controlled areas are divided into three main groups: Municipal councils, village council and local development committees.\n* [[Municipality (Palestinian Authority)]]: Depends on size of locality. Localities that serve as the centers of [[Governorates of the Palestinian National Authority|governorate]]s and populations over 15,000 have 15-member councils. Localities with populations over 15,000 residents have 13-member councils and localities with populations between 4,000 and 15,000 have 9-member councils.\n* [[Village Council (Palestinian Authority)]]: Localities with populations between 800 and 1,500 have 3-member councils while those between 1,500 and \u22124,000 residents have 7-member councils.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main article|Local government in the Philippines}}\n{{See also|Philippines#Regions and Provinces}}\n\nThe [[Local Government Code]] of 1991 provides for the three levels of [[Local Government Units]] or LGUs in the Philippines: (1) the [[Philippine province|province]] (2)  [[Philippine city|city]] and [[Philippine municipality|municipality]], and (3) the [[barangay]]. The country remains a unitary state and the National Government continues to have strong influence over local government units.\n\nA province is led by a governor along with the ''[[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]]'' (Provincial Council) composed of board members. A mayor leads a city or municipality while the ''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'' (City Council) and the ''[[Sangguniang Bayan]]'' (Municipal Council) constitute the legislative branches of a city and municipality, respectively. A barangay is headed by the [[Barangay Captain]] and the [[Barangay Council]].  Barangays can be further divided into [[purok]]s and [[sitio]]s but their leadership is unelected.\n\nThe 1987 Philippine Constitution also provides for the existence of autonomous regions. The [[Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) is the only autonomous region in the Philippines.  There was an attempt to institute an autonomous region in the [[Cordillera]], but that failed and instead the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] (CAR) was established.\n\nLocal governments have limited taxing authority. Most of their funds come from the national government via the [[Internal Revenue Allotment]]\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nThere are three levels of local government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: the city council, the municipal council and the municipality.\n\nThe city council is the highest level of local government. The municipal councils began in 2005 and is the second level of local government. The municipality is the third level of local government. There are 178 municipalities across the kingdom. The first began in Jeddah during the Othmanic period. Each municipality is run by its city's mayor. As a collective the kingdom's municipalities make up the Ministry of Municipality and Rural Affairs (MoMRA).\n\n===Taiwan===\n[[File:Taipei City Hall front view 20050110.jpg|thumb|[[Taipei City Government]]]]\n\nThe [[Government of the Republic of China|Republic of China government]] in [[Taiwan]] consists of [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] governments, [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] governments and [[County (Taiwan)|county]] governments for their local governments. They also have councils in each of those three local government levels.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of Thailand}}\n\n===Turkey===\n{{Main|List of districts in Turkey}}\n[[Turkey]] has two levels of local government; provinces (Turkish: iller ) and districts (Turkish: il\u00e7eler ).\n\nThe territory of Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. The provinces are organized into 7 regions for census purposes; however, they do not represent an administrative structure. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 957 districts.\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[Vietnam]] has 3 levels of local government:\n*First tier: provinces and municipalities\n*Second tier: provincial cities, towns, urban districts and rural districts\n*Third tier: wards, communes and townships\n\nEach level has a People's Committee (executive - up to third tier), a People's Council (legislative - up to third tier) and a People's Court (judiciary - up to second tier)\n\n==Europe==\n{{see also|European Charter of Local Self-Government}}\n\n===Albania===\n{{Main article|Counties of Albania|Districts of Albania|Municipalities of Albania}}\n\n[[Albania]] has 3 levels of local government :\n* 12 administrative counties ({{lang-sq|qark or prefektur\u00eb}}).\n* 36 districts ({{lang-sq|rreth}}).\n* 373 municipalities ({{lang-sq|bashki or komun\u00eb}}), 72 of which have city status ({{lang-sq|qytet}}).\n\nThere are overall 2980 villages/communities ({{lang-sq|fshat}}) in all Albania. Each district has its council which is composed of a number of municipalities. The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf |title=On the Organization and Functioning of the Local Government, Republic of Albania, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215175046/http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Andorra===\n[[Andorra]] is formed by seven [[Parishes of Andorra|parishes]] (parr\u00f2quies, singular \u2013 parr\u00f2quia); [[Andorra la Vella]], [[Canillo]], [[Encamp]], [[La Massana]], [[Escaldes-Engordany]], [[Ordino]], [[Sant Julia de Loria]].\n\nSome parishes have a further territorial subdivision. Ordino, La Massana and Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria are subdivided into ''quarts'' (quarters), while Canillo is subdivided into 10 ''ve\u00efnats'' (neighborhoods). Those mostly coincide with villages, which are found in all parishes. Each parish has its own elected mayor who is the nominal head of the local government known as a ''com\u00fa'' in Catalan.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main article|Provinces of Bulgaria|Municipalities of Bulgaria}}\n\nSince the 1880s, the number of territorial management units in [[Bulgaria]] has varied from seven to 26.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrrb.government.bg/index.php?do=atums&id=5&lang=bg&type=69|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e \u2013 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f|publisher=Ministry of Regional Development|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref> Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (''oblasti'', singular ''[[oblast]]'').

Bulgaria is a highly [[centralization|centralised]] state, where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|p=17}}\n\n===Croatia===\n{{Main article|Counties of Croatia|List of cities in Croatia|Municipalities of Croatia}}\n\n[[Croatia]] is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of [[Zagreb]], the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time.

Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (''krajsk\u00e9 zastupitelstvo'') and ''hejtman'' (usually translated as [[hetman]] or [[governor]]). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.\n\nThe regions are divided into seventy-six [[districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three \"statutory cities\" (without Prague, which had special status). The districts lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046 The death of the districts], [[Radio Prague]] 3 January 2003.</ref> A further reform in effect since January 2003 created 204 Municipalities with Extended Competence (obce s roz\u0161\u00ed\u0159enou p\u016fsobnost\u00ed); also obce III. stupn\u011b \u2013 third-level municipalities, unofficially also called \"little districts\" (Czech: 'mal\u00e9 okresy') which took over most of the administration of the former district authorities.

In 2007 the borders of the districts were slightly adjusted and 119 municipalities are now within different districts.\n\n===Denmark===\n{{Main article|Regions of Denmark|Municipalities of Denmark}}\n\nFor local government purposes, [[Denmark]] is divided into five [[Regions of Denmark|regions]] ({{lang-da|regioner}}), with their most important area of responsibility being the public health service. They are also responsible for employment policies, and some regions are responsible for public mass transit. Regions are not entitled to levy their own taxes, and they rely entirely on central state funding (around 70%) and funding coming from the municipalities (around 30%). Regions are led by directly elected councils (''regionsr\u00e5d''). They consist of 41 members each.\n\nThe regions are further divided into 98 [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] (''kommuner''). Elections for the municipalities are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years.\n\n===Estonia===\n{{Main article|Counties of Estonia|Municipalities of Estonia}}\n\nEstonia is divided into fifteen [[Counties of Estonia|counties]] ({{lang-et|maakonnad}}), each led by a county [[governor]] (''maavanem''), who represents the national government at the regional level. Governors are appointed by the [[Government of Estonia|government]], and so the regions do not have full [[self-government]]. The regions are further divided into 227 [[Municipalities of Estonia|municipalities]] (''omavalitsus''), and each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main article|Regions of Finland|Sub-regions of Finland|Municipalities of Finland}}\n\nThe most important administrative layer of local government in [[Finland]] are the 311 [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, [[property tax]], state subsidies, and other revenue.\n\nIn addition to municipalities, there are two intermediate levels of local government. Municipalities co-operate in seventy-four [[Sub-regions of Finland|sub-regions]] and nineteen [[Regions of Finland|regions]]. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. However, the autonomous province of [[\u00c5land]] has a directly elected regional council, and the [[Sami people]] have a semi-autonomous [[Sami Domicile Area]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] for issues on language and culture.\n\n===France===\n{{Main article|Decentralisation in France|Administrative divisions of France}}\n\nAccording to its [[Constitution of France|Constitution]] of 1958, [[France]] has 3 levels of local government:\n*13 ''R\u00e9gions'' (including [[Corsica]]) and 5 ''R\u00e9gions d'outre-mer'' ([[R\u00e9union]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[French Guiana]]). Corsica is not referred to as a \"r\u00e9gion\" but simply as a \"collectivit\u00e9 territoriale\", that merely means \"local government area\".\n*96 ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partements]]'' and 5 ''[[Overseas department|d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer]]'' (R\u00e9union, Guadeloupe, Martinique, [[Mayotte]] and French Guiana). [[Paris]] is both a commune and a d\u00e9partement.\n*There are 36,679 [[Communes of France|municipalities]] (in French: ''Communes'').\n\nHowever, in addition to the constitutional clauses of 1958, there now exist specificities:\n*Intercommunalities are now a level of government between municipalities and departments.\n*There exist 2 \"pays d'outre-mer\": [[French Polynesia]] and [[New Caledonia]]. The expression \"pays d'outre-mer\" is convenient as it can be understood in French as both \"overseas country\" and \"overseas county/traditional area\" (as evidenced by [[Pays de la Loire]] that is a home r\u00e9gion, not a home \"country\"). French Polynesia works as an autonomous ''r\u00e9gion'', whereas New Caledonia has a ''sui generis'' local government status with specific institutions and even more autonomy.\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main article|Federalism in Germany|States of Germany#Subdivisions}}\n\n===Greece===\n{{Main article|Modern regions of Greece|Municipalities and communities of Greece}}\n\nSince 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] subdivided into a total of 325 [[Municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities and communities]]. The regions have their own elected governors and regional councils, however there are seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary. There is also one [[autonomous area]], [[Mount Athos]].\n\n===Hungary===\n{{Main article|Counties of Hungary|Subregions of Hungary}}\n\nFor local government, Hungary is divided into 19 [[Counties of Hungary|counties]]. In addition, the [[Capitals of Hungary|capital]] (''f\u0151v\u00e1ros''), [[Budapest]], is independent of any county government\n\nThe counties are further subdivided into 174 [[Subregions of Hungary|subregions]] (''kist\u00e9rs\u00e9gek''), and Budapest is its own subregion.\n\nThere are also 23 towns with county rights (singular ''megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1ros''). The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective county instead of being independent territorial units.\n\n===Iceland===\n{{Main article|Municipalities of Iceland}}\n\nThe [[Municipalities of Iceland]] are local administrative areas in [[Iceland]] that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as [[kindergarten]]s, [[elementary school]]s, [[waste management]], [[social services]], [[public housing]], [[public transportation]], services to [[senior citizen]]s and [[disability|handicap]]ped people. They also govern [[zoning]] and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the [[constitution of Iceland]].\n\nThe municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as [[mayor]]s (''b\u00e6jarstj\u00f3ri / borgarstj\u00f3ri'') in the mostly urban municipalities but \"commune manager\" (''sveitarstj\u00f3ri'') in the rural or mixed municipalities.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main article|Local government in the Republic of Ireland}} The [[Republic of Ireland]]'s local government is laid out by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. With a few exceptions, local government is two-tier. At the lowest level are the municipal, metropolitan or borough councils, which are elected during local elections. These councillors from the relevant county then together form the council, termed either County or City and County Councils. For example, the 4 municipal districts in Westmeath County each elect their own councils, who together form [[Westmeath County Council]].\n\nThe exceptions to the above is the county of Dublin and the cities of Cork an Galway, the later two's councils are directly elected with no lower council. Dublin county is made up of four local area authorities, each elected directly. There are thirty-one local authorities.\n\nBy far, the main source of funding is national government.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Other sources include rates on commercial and industrial property, council housing rents, service charges and borrowing. Many local authorities functions are performed by the Chief Executive, who is appointed by the Minister for Local Government.\n\n===Isle of Man===\n{{Main article|Local government in the Isle of Man}}\nLocal government on the [[Isle of Man]] is partly based on the ancient parishes. There are four types of local authorities: a borough corporation, town commissioners, village commissioners, and parish commissioners.\n\n===Italy===\nThe [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] defines three levels of local government:\n*[[Regions of Italy|Regions]]: At present 5 of them (Valle d'Aosta, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Sardinia and Sicily) have a special status and are given more power than the others. The constitutional reform of 2001 gave more power to regions.\n*[[Provinces of Italy|Provinces]]: They mostly care to roads, forests, and education. They had more power in the past.\n*[[Comune|Communes]]: The Mayor and staff, caring for the needs of a single town or of a village and neighbouring minor towns or villages.\n\nMajor cities also have an extra tier of local government named ''Circoscrizione di Decentramento Comunale'' or, in some cities (e.g. Rome) ''Municipio''.\n\n===Latvia===\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of Latvia}}\n\n[[Latvia]] is a unitary state, currently divided into 110 municipalities ({{lang-lv|novadi}}) and 9 republican cities ({{lang-lv|republikas pils\u0113tas}}) with their own council.\n\n===Liechtenstein===\n[[Liechtenstein]] is divided into eleven [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|municipalities]] (''Gemeinden''{{spaced ndash}} singular ''Gemeinde''), most consisting of only a single town.\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{Main article|Counties of Lithuania|Municipalities of Lithuania|Elderships of Lithuania}}\n{{Update|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[Lithuania]] has a three-tier division of local government: the country is divided into [[Counties of Lithuania|10 counties]] (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 ''apskritis'', plural \u2013 ''apskritys'') that are further subdivided into [[Municipalities of Lithuania|60 municipalities]] (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 ''savivaldyb\u0117'', plural \u2013 ''savivaldyb\u0117s'') which consist of over 500 [[Elderships of Lithuania|elderships]] (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 ''seni\u016bnija'', plural \u2013 ''seni\u016bnijos'').\n\nThe counties are ruled by [[County governor (Lithuania)|county governor]]s (Lithuanian: ''apskrities vir\u0161ininkas'') appointed by the central government, and effectively oversee the two lower tiers of local government.\n\nMunicipalities are the most important administrative unit of local government. Each municipality has its own government and council, with elections taking place every four years. The council elects the mayor and appoints [[elder (administrative title)|elders]] to govern the elderships.\n\nElderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest units of local government. They provide public services such as registering births and deaths and identifying individuals or families in need of welfare.\n\n===Malta===\nMalta is a unitary [[city state]] divided into 68 municipalities ([[Local councils of Malta|local councils]]), according to the constitution of the Malta.\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{Main article|Municipal politics in the Netherlands|Provincial politics in the Netherlands}}\nThe [[Netherlands]] has three tiers of government. There are two levels of local government in the Netherlands, the provinces and the municipalities. The water boards are also part of the local government.\n\nThe Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces (''[[provinces of the Netherlands|provincie]]'', pl. ''provincies''). They form the tier of administration between the central government and the municipalities. Each province is governed by a provincial council, the States-Provincial (''[[Provinciale Staten]]'', abbr. to ''PS''). Its members are elected every four years. The day-to-day management of the province is in the hands of the provincial executive, the States Deputed (''[[Gedeputeerde Staten]]'', abbr. to ''GS''). Members of the executive are chosen by the provincial council from among its own members and like the members of the provincial council serve for a period of four years. Members elected to the executive have to give up their membership of the provincial council. The size of the executive varies from one province to another. In [[Flevoland]], the smallest of the Dutch provinces, it has four members, while most other provinces have six or seven. Meetings of the provincial executive are chaired by the King's Commissioner (''[[Commissaris van de Koningin|Commissaris van de Koning(in)]]'', abbr. to ''CvdK''). The King's Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the King and government ministers). The appointment is for six years and may be extended by a second term. The King's Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate.\n\nMunicipalities (''[[list of municipalities of the Netherlands|gemeente]]'', pl. ''gemeenten'') form the lowest tier of government in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (''[[gemeenteraad]]'') is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is comparable to that of the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job is to decide the municipality's broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality is in the hands of the municipal executive (''[[college van burgemeester en wethouders]]'', abbr. to ''(college van) B&W)'', made up of the mayor (''[[burgemeester]]'') and the aldermen (''[[wethouder]]'', pl. ''wethouders''). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality's public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years and are normally re-appointed automatically for another term, provided the municipal council agrees. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.\n\nWater boards (''[[waterschap]]'' and ''[[hoogheemraadschap]]'', pl. ''waterschappen'' and ''hoogheemraadschappen'') are among the oldest government authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form the foundation of the whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what led to the creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (''[[college van dijkgraaf en heemraden]]'') consisting of a chairperson (''[[dijkgraaf (official)|dijkgraaf]]'') and other members (''[[heemraad|(hoog)heemraad]]'', pl. ''(hoog)heemraden''). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, voters do not usually have to go to a polling station but can vote by mail.\n\n===Norway===\n[[Norway]]'s regional administration is organised in 19 counties (fylke), with 18 of them subdivided into 431 municipalities (kommune) per 1 January 2006. The municipal sector is a provider of vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. Norway had 435 municipalities of varying size in 2003, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 19 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council. Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision. They have the right to tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{Main article|Autonomous regions of Portugal|Districts of Portugal|Municipalities of Portugal|Freguesias of Portugal}}\n\nCurrently, mainland Portugal is divided into 18 districts (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''distritos''). Each district takes the name of their respective capital city.  Insular Portugal, comprising the two [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], is organized as two [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] (in Portuguese, ''regi\u00f5es aut\u00f3nomas'').\n\nEach district and each Autonomous region is divided into municipalities (in Portuguese, ''munic\u00edpios'') which, in turn, are subdivided into parishes (in Portuguese, ''[[freguesia]]s'').\n\nSince 1976, when the two Autonomous regions of Portugal were established, the Azores and Madeira are no longer divided into districts.\n\n===Poland===\n{{Main article|Administrative divisions of Poland|Voivodeships of Poland}}\nPoland has three levels of subdivision. The territory of Poland is divided into 16 [[Administrative_divisions_of_Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces); these are further divided into 379 [[Gmina|powiats]] (counties or districts), and these in turn are divided into 2,479 gminas (communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat.\n\nEach voivodeship is governed by a [[Voivodeship marshal]].\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main article|Local government in Spain|Municipalities of Spain|Comarcas of Spain}}\nSpain is divided into 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]], which in turn are divided into 50 [[provinces of Spain|provinces]]. There are also two [[autonomous cities of Spain|autonomous cities]]: those of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.\n\nEach administrative entity is given powers, structure, and boundaries by a law that was passed by the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] .\n\nLaw 7/1985,<ref>[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/l7-1985.html Ley 7/1985, de 2 de abril, Reguladora de las Bases del R\u00e9gimen Local].

Noticias.juridicas.com. Retrieved on 2 December 2012.</ref> The main governing body in most municipalities is called Ayuntamiento (in the less populated municipalities an alternative local organization system called open council, \"''concejo abierto''\", is used). The Ayuntamiento in turn is formed by the Plenary (''el Pleno'', the collective formed by the city councillors) and the Mayor. The number of members that compose The Plenary varies depending on city's population (for example, since 2007 Valencia has 33 members and Pamplona has 27). The name given to the members of the Plenary is councillor (''concejal''). Those councillors are elected between city's inhabitants every four years by direct vote. After being elected, councillors meet in a special Plenary session to determine who will be elected, between them, as city's Mayor. In the next days after the election, the mayor chooses some councillors to set up the executive governing body (''Junta de Gobierno'' or ''Comisi\u00f3n de Gobierno''). After that, and for the next four years, city's mayor and the ''Junta de Gobierno'' will govern over the city according to their competences (urbanism, some taxes, local police, licenses for specific activities, cleaning services, etc.). Meanwhile, councillors in the Plenary but not part of the ''Junta de Gobierno'' (the opposition) will oversee Mayor's rule.\nThe autonomous community of Catalonia is divided in 4 provinces and more than 900 municipalities. Between these two tiers, there are 41 ''comarques'' (singular, ''comarca''), roughly equivalent to 'district' or 'county'. The ''comarca'' is a commonwealth, or union, of municipalities with competences in several fields (Law 6/1987 of the Parliament of Catalonia).\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main article|Municipalities of Sweden|County Councils of Sweden}}\n\nEvery fourth year general elections are held in [[Sweden]] to elect members of the national parliament, 20 county council assemblies and 290 municipal assemblies. As the parliament elects the national government, the local assemblies elect their executive committees and their boards. Members in local committees and boards are elected proportionally by the political parties in the assemblies, giving all the major parties representation. The parties usually cooperate well on the local levels.\n\nThe county councils (''landsting'') are responsible for health care and usually provide transportation.\n\nThe municipalities (''kommuner'') are responsible for:\n*social services, childcare, preschool, [[elderly care]]\n*primary and secondary education\n*planning and building\n*health protection, water, sewerage, refuse, emergency services\n\nOn a voluntary basis, the municipalities provide sports, culture, housing, energy as well as commercial service.\n\nThe activities are financed by income taxes. Swedes pay around 20% of their taxable income to the municipality and around 11% to the county council. (The national government is financed by VAT and payroll taxes and fees.)\n\n===Ukraine===\n{{Main article|Local government in Ukraine}}\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe system of local government is different in each of the four home nations of the [[United Kingdom]]. In total there are 426 local authorities in the UK. 346 of these are in [[England]], 11 in [[Northern Ireland]], 32 in [[Scotland]] and 22 are in [[Wales]].\n\n====England====\n{{Main article|Local government in England}}\n\nThe most complex system is in England, the result of numerous reforms and reorganisation over the centuries.\nThe top level of sub-national administration within England until the end of March 2012 consisted of the nine [[Region (England)|regions]]. The regions were used by central government for various statistical purposes, and [[Government Office]]s and assorted other institutions including Regional Development Agencies. Regional Government Offices, Regional Development Agencies and Regional Ministers were all abolished by the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Cameron ministry]] in 2010. Only the London region which is a sub-region compared to the other regions of England has a directly elected government.  Only one regional referendum has been held to date to seek consent for the introduction of direct elections elsewhere \u2014 in the northeast of England \u2014 and this was overwhelmingly rejected by the electorate.\n\nThe layers of elected local government vary. In different areas the highest tier of elected local government may be:\n*[[counties of England|counties]], which may be\n**single tier [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]], or\n**divided into [[District (England)|districts]] (also known as boroughs in some areas)\n*[[Districts of England|districts]], which are separate [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]] in some areas\n*[[metropolitan district]]s (also called metropolitan boroughs) in some areas which are similar to unitary authorities, but have [[Joint-board|joint boards]] with other districts in the same [[metropolitan county]]\n*[[Greater London]], which is divided into 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London]]\n\nIn most areas there is a lower tier of government, [[Civil parishes in England|civil parishes]], with limited functions. Most civil parishes are in rural areas, but if the parish is a town the [[Parish councils of England|parish council]] may be called a [[town council]]. In a few cases the parish is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], and the parish council is called a [[city council]].\n\nMetropolitan counties, and a few [[non-metropolitan counties]], no longer have elected councils or administrative functions, and their former functions are performed by districts. Such counties remain [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]].\n\n{{See also|Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England}}\n\n====Northern Ireland====\n{{Main article|Local government in Northern Ireland}}\nSince 1 April 2015 Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts. Local government in Northern Ireland does not carry out the same range of functions as those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n====Scotland====\n{{Main article|Local government of Scotland}}\nLocal government in Scotland is arranged on the lines of [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]], with the nation divided into 32 [[council areas of Scotland|council areas]].\n\n====Wales====\n{{Main article|Local government in Wales}}\nWales has a uniform system of 22 unitary authorities, variously styled as county, county borough, city or city and county local authorities. There are also [[Community (Wales)|communities]], equivalent to parishes.\n\n==North America==\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main article|Local government in Canada}}\n\n[[Canada]] has a federal system with three orders of government. The largest is the federal government, followed by the provincial and local governments.<ref>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/guide/section-07.asp#8 Fact Sheet: Government in Canada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303135748/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/guide/section-07.asp#8 |date=2009-03-03 }}. Cic.gc.ca (2010-08-23). Retrieved on 2 December 2012.</ref> Municipal governments are separately elected. They must follow laws and guidelines as set out by their province, but are allowed to pass additional by-laws and acts unique to them.\n\n===Mexico===\n[[Mexico]] is a Federal Republic made up by 31 [[States of Mexico|states]] and a [[Mexican Federal District|federal district]]. Each state is divided in ''[[municipalities of Mexico|municipios]]'', while the federal district is divided in sixteen ''[[Boroughs of the Mexican Federal District|delegaciones]]''. Twenty-nine states of Mexico were created as administrative divisions by the constitution of 1917, which grants them those powers not expressly vested in the federal government; Mexico's two remaining territories, [[Baja California Sur]] and [[Quintana Roo]], achieved statehood on 9 October 1974, raising the total to 31. Each state has a constitution, a governor elected for six years, and a unicameral legislature, with representatives elected by district vote in proportion to population. An ordinary session of the legislature is held annually, and extraordinary sessions may be called by the governor or the permanent committee. Bills may be introduced by legislators, by the governor, by the state supreme court, and by municipalities (a unit comparable to a US county). In addition to the 31 states, there is also one federal district comprising [[Mexico City]], whose governor serves as a member of the cabinet. Many state services are supported by federal subsidies.\n\nThe principal unit of state government is the municipality. Mexico's 2,378 municipalities are governed by municipal presidents and municipal councils. State governors generally select the nominees for the municipal elections. Municipal budgets are approved by the respective state governors. Until 1997, the president appointed the mayor of Mexico City. Political reforms allowed the first open elections in 1997, and [[Cuauht\u00e9moc Cardenas Sol\u00f3rzano]] became Mexico City's first elected mayor.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main article|Local government in the United States}}\n\nLocal government in the United States refers to governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state. Most states have at least two tiers of local government: [[County (United States)|counties]] and [[municipality|municipalities]]. In some states, counties are divided into [[Civil township|townships]]. There are several different types of jurisdictions at the municipal level, including the [[city]], [[town]], [[parish]], [[borough (United States)|borough]], [[village (United States)|village]], [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[boundaries (United States)|boundaries]].  The types and nature of these municipal entities varies from state to state.\n\n==Oceania==\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main article|Local council  in Australia}}\nAustralia does not recognize local government. it is a business with an ABN number. it is not law enforcement agency all fines which are issued the council are illegal and void. all rates notices are illegal. there was referendum held in 1988 and the people did not give permission to have the lowest level of government. the Australian constitution does not mention local government.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main article|Local government in New Zealand}}\n\n[[New Zealand]] has a local government system comprising two complementary sets of local authorities\u2014[[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] and [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]]. There are 78 local authorities consisting of:\n*11 regional councils, which cover much of New Zealand\u2019s land area, and\n*67 territorial authorities (comprising 53 district councils, 12 [[List of cities in New Zealand|city councils]] and 2 other councils).\nSix of the territorial authorities are [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]], which also have the powers of a regional council. They are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, the Gisborne, Marlborough and Tasman district councils, and Chatham Islands Council.\n\nRegional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Within a regional council area there are usually many city or district councils, although city and district councils can be in multiple regional council areas.\n\n==South America==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[Argentina]] is a federation of 23 provinces and the federal capital of [[Buenos Aires]]. During the 19th century there was a bitter struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, and there has long been an element of tension regarding the division of powers between the central government and provincial bodies. The federal government retains control over such matters as the regulation of commerce, customs collections, currency, civil or commercial codes, or the appointment of foreign agents. The provincial governors are elected every four years.\n\nThe constitutional \"national intervention\" and \"state of siege\" powers of the president have been invoked frequently. The first of these powers was designed to \"guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces.\" Since the adoption of the 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.\n\nUntil 1996, the President appointed the mayor of Buenos Aires, and by law, the president and Congress controlled any legislation that affected the city. Constitutional reforms that year led to an elected mayoral position, and a 60-member Poder Legislativo (legislative power).\n\n===Brazil===\n\nBrazil is divided into 26 [[State (polity)|state]]s and a [[federal district]], the government is divided into federal, state, and municipalities. The federal district has no municipalities and acts as a state and municipality at the same time.\n\nThere is no minimum or maximum population requirement for municipalities. [[Bor\u00e1]] is the smallest municipality of the country with 805 inhabitants, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] is the largest with 11,316,149 inhabitants.\n\nElections in federal, state and municipalities follow all the same system, with elections of president, governor and mayor for executive branch and federal deputy, federal senate, state deputy and alderman for legislative branch. In municipalities according to the constitution, the number of alderman varies from 9 to 55 aldermans.\n\n===Paraguay===\n[[Paraguay]] is divided into 17 [[Departments of Paraguay|departments]], which are subdivided into districts, which, in turn, comprise municipalities (the minimum requirement for a municipality is 3,000 persons) and rural districts (partidos). A governor, elected by popular vote, runs each department. Municipal government is exercised through a municipal board, chosen by direct election, and an executive department. In the principal cities and capitals, the executive department is headed by a mayor appointed by the minister of the interior; in other localities, the mayor is appointed by the presidents of the municipal boards. Police chiefs are appointed by the central government.\n\n===Peru===\n[[Peru]] is divided into [[Regions of Peru|25 regions]] and the [[Lima Province|province of Lima]]. Each region has an elected government composed of a president and council that serve four-year terms.<ref>''Ley N\u00b0 27867, Ley Org\u00e1nica de Gobiernos Regionales'', Article N\u00b0 11.</ref> These governments plan regional development, execute public investment projects, promote economic activities, and manage public property.<ref>''Ley N\u00b0 27867, Ley Org\u00e1nica de Gobiernos Regionales'', Article N\u00b0 10.</ref>  The province of Lima is administered by a city council.<ref>''Ley N\u00b0 27867, Ley Org\u00e1nica de Gobiernos Regionales'', Article N\u00b0 66.</ref> The goal of devolving power to regional and municipal governments was among others to improve popular participation.

They enforced national laws and administered the nation's social and educational policies and institutions within their territories. These territories had limited taxing powers, but they could borrow funds and acquire property. They also had the power to establish unpaid five-member local boards or town councils in municipalities other than the departmental capital if the population was large enough to warrant such a body.\n\nExecutive authority was vested in a governor (intendente), who administered the department, and in a thirty-one-member departmental board (junta departmental), which carried out legislative functions. These functions included approval of the departmental budget and judicial actions, such as impeachment proceedings against departmental officials, including the governor. At the municipal level, a mayor (intendente municipal) assumed executive and administrative duties, carrying out resolutions made by the local board (whose members were appointed on the basis of proportional representation of the political parties). The governor was required to comply with and enforce the constitution and the laws and to promulgate the decrees enacted by the departmental board. The governor was authorized to prepare the budget, submit it for approval to the departmental board, appoint the board's employees, and, if necessary, discipline or suspend them. The governor represented the department in its relations with the national government and other departmental governments and in the negotiation of contracts with public or private agencies.\n\nLike the governor, the members of the departmental board and the mayor were elected for five-year terms in direct, popular elections. A governor could be reelected only once, and candidates for the post had to meet the same requirements as those for a senator, in addition to being a native of the department or a resident therein for at least three years before assuming office. Departmental board members had to be at least twenty-three years of age, native born (or a legal citizen for at least three years), and a native of the department (or a resident for at least three years).\n\nThe board sat in the capital city of each department and exercised jurisdiction throughout the entire territory of the department. It could issue decrees and resolutions that it deemed necessary either on the suggestion of the governor or on its own initiative. It could approve budgets, fix the amount of taxes, request the intervention of the Accounts Tribunal for advice concerning departmental finances or administration, and remove from office\u2014at the request of the governor\u2014members of nonelective local departmental boards. The board also supervised local public services; public health; and primary, secondary, preparatory, industrial, and artistic education. Although Montevideo was the smallest department in terms of area (divided into twenty-three geographic zones that generally coincided with the electoral zones), its departmental board had sixty-five members in 1990; all other departments had thirty-one-member boards and a five-member executive council appointed by the departmental board, with proportional representation from the principal political parties.\n\nData as of December 1990{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Kemp, Roger L.
