The stadium is also used for [[college football]], and from December 2008 to December 2017 was the home of the [[St. Petersburg Bowl]], an annual postseason [[bowl game]]. It is currently the only non-retractable domed stadium in Major League Baseball, making it the only year-round indoor venue in MLB. Tropicana Field is the [[List of Major League Baseball stadiums|smallest MLB stadium by seating capacity]] when obstructed-view rows in the uppermost sections are covered with tarps as they are for most Rays games.\n\nTropicana Field opened in 1990 and was originally known as the '''Florida Suncoast Dome'''. In 1993, the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] moved to the facility and its name was changed to the '''ThunderDome'''<ref>{{cite web|last=Davey|first=Monica|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/324374156/?terms=ThunderDome|title=That rumbling's not so distant|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|date=July 31, 1993|page=1B|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref> until the team moved to [[Amalie Arena|their new home]] in downtown Tampa in 1996. In October 1996, [[Tropicana Products]], a fruit juice company then based in nearby [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], signed a 30-year naming rights deal.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Baseball in the Tampa Bay area|Sports in the Tampa Bay area}}\nAfter Tampa was awarded the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u201393)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] in the 1970s, St. Petersburg decided it wanted a share of the professional sports scene in [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]]. City officials decided early on that the city would attempt to attract [[Major League Baseball]]. Possible designs for a [[baseball park]] or [[multi-purpose stadium]] were proposed as early as 1983. One such design, in the same location where Tropicana Field would ultimately be built, called for an open-air stadium with a circus tent-like covering. It took several design cues from [[Kauffman Stadium]], including [[fountain]]s beyond the outfield wall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/ballpark/2008/05/the-original-tr.html|title=Rays stadium debate topic page {{!}} Tampa Bay Times|website=blogs.tampabay.com|access-date=2016-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730111639/http://blogs.tampabay.com/ballpark/2008/05/the-original-tr.html|archivedate=July 30, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, city officials decided that a stadium with a fixed permanent dome was necessary for a prospective major league team to be viable in the area, due to its hot, humid summers and frequent thunderstorms. Ballpark construction began in 1986 in the hope that it would lure a Major League Baseball team to the facility.\n\nThe stadium, built originally as the Florida Suncoast Dome, was first used in an attempt to entice the [[Chicago White Sox]] to relocate if a new ballpark was not built to replace the aging [[Comiskey Park]]. The governments of Chicago and [[Illinois]] eventually agreed to build a [[Guaranteed Rate Field|New Comiskey Park]] in 1989.\n\n===1990s===\nThe stadium was finished in 1990.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-02-25/sports/9002253309_1_building-the-dome-suncoast-dome-florida-suncoast|title=Florida Suncoast Dome: A Gem Without A Diamond St. Petersburg's $309 Million Arena To Open Saturday|last=White|first=Russ|date=February 25, 1990|work=|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=2016-11-13|via=}}</ref> It hosted the [[1990 Davis Cup|1990 Davis Cup Finals]] that autumn, as well as several rock concerts, but still had no tenants.

The completion of what is now [[Amalie Arena]] in downtown Tampa permitted \"The Trop\" to be vacated for preparation for its intended purpose, as the Lightning and Storm moved into that facility. A [[United States dollar|US$]]70&nbsp;million renovation then took place\u2014to upgrade a stadium that had cost $130&nbsp;million to complete only eight years earlier. [[Ebbets Field]] was the model for the renovations, which included a replica of the famous rotunda that greeted [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodger]] fans for many years. The first regular season baseball game took place at the park on March 31, 1998, when the [[1998 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Devil Rays]] faced the [[1998 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], losing 11&ndash;6.\n\nAlthough Tropicana was purchased by [[PepsiCo]] in 1998, PepsiCo did not elect to make any changes to Tropicana's naming rights, as the Tropicana brand is popular among the local fanbase (similar to [[Gillette Stadium]] which continued on with its current name after [[Gillette]] was acquired by [[Procter & Gamble]]).\n\n===2000s===\nThe park was initially built with an [[AstroTurf]] surface, but it was replaced in [[2000 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2000]] by softer [[FieldTurf]]. A new version of FieldTurf, FieldTurf Duo, was installed prior to the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2007]] season. It has always featured a traditional \"full dirt\" infield, instead of the \"sliding pits\" design that was common during the 1970s and 1980s, making it the first artificial turf field with a full dirt infield since [[Busch Stadium II]] in 1976. Since Tropicana Field does not need to convert between baseball and football, sliding pits, designed to save re-configuration time, were unnecessary. The only other artificial turf field in MLB, [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto, converted to the full dirt infield after the departure of the [[Toronto Argonauts]] to [[BMO Field]]. Tropicana has hosted football games, but never during baseball season. On August 6, 2007, the AstroTurf [[warning track]] was replaced by brown-colored stone filled FieldTurf Duo.\n\nTropicana Field underwent a further $25 million facelift prior to the [[2006 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2006]] season. Another $10&nbsp;million in improvements were added during the season. In 2006, the Devil Rays added a live [[Cownose ray]] tank to Tropicana Field. The tank is located just behind the center field wall, in clear view of the play on the field. People can go up to the tank to touch the creatures. Further improvements prior to the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2007]] offseason, in addition to the new FieldTurf, include additional family features in the right field area, the creation of a new premium club, and several new video boards including a new {{convert|35|x|64|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Daktronics]] LED main video board that is four times larger than the original video board. The 2007 renovation also added built-in [[high-definition television|HDTV]] capabilities to the ballpark, with [[Fox Sports Florida]] and [[WXPX]] airing at least a quarter of the schedule in HD in 2007 and accommodating the new video board's 16x9 aspect ratio.\n\n[[Image:TropicanaFieldEntrance.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Entrance rotunda fa\u00e7ade as it appeared in 2008]]\n\nOn September 3, 2008, in a game between the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Rays]] and the [[2008 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], Tropicana Field saw the first official use of [[instant replay]] in the history of [[Major League Baseball]]. The disputed play involved a home run hit above the left field foul pole by Yankee [[Alex Rodriguez]]. The ball was called a home run on the field, but was close enough that the umpires opted to view the replay to verify the call.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080903&content_id=3412816&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Instant replay used for first time &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Tampabay.rays.mlb.com |date=May 24, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref> Later, the Trop saw the first case of a call being overturned by instant replay, when a fly ball by [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] originally ruled a ground-rule double due to fan interference, was overturned and made a home run on September 19.

It hosted the on-field trophy presentations for the Rays when they became the American League Champions on October 19, following Game 7 of the ALCS.

It was designed at an angle to reduce the interior volume in order to reduce cooling costs, and to better protect the stadium from [[hurricane]]s. The dome is supported by a [[tensegrity]] structure and is lit up with orange lights after the Rays win a home game. When the [[Minnesota Twins]] vacated the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] following the 2009 season and moved into [[Target Field]] in 2010, Tropicana Field became the only active Major League Baseball stadium with a fixed (i.e., not retractable) roof. The catwalks attached to the non-retractable roof have been rare but occasional obstructions in the way of batted balls.\n\nThe main rotunda, on the east end of the stadium, resembles the [[Ebbets Field]] rotunda on the interior. The walkway to the main entrance of the park features a {{convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}} long [[ceramic]] [[tile]] mosaic, made of 1,849,091 one-inch-square tiles. It is the largest outdoor tile mosaic in Florida, and the fifth-largest in the United States. It was sponsored by [[Florida Power Corporation]], which is now a part of [[Duke Energy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/tb/ballpark/index.jsp|title=Tropicana Field|website=Tampa Bay Rays|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref>\n\nThe primary 100-level concourse is at street level, with elevators, escalators and stairs separating the outfield and infield sections, since the ground is at different grades on either side.

The hallway behind sections 133-149 is nicknamed \"Left Field Street.\" The hallway behind sections 136-150 is nicknamed \"Right Field Street.\" The 100-level seating wraps around the entire field with a 360\u00b0 walkway. Behind the stadium's batter's eye is a center field common area, known as The Porch, which provides fans with open seating and standing room to watch games. The Porch, along with other facility improvements, was part of a multimillion-dollar renovation project that was completed before the start of the 2014 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/tampa-bay-rays-unveil-new-360-degree-walkway-around-tropicana-field/2172378|title=Tampa Bay Rays unveil new 360-degree walkway around Tropicana Field|website=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref> Loge boxes are featured along the infield of the 100-level from foul pole to foul pole. 200-level seating features 20 sections along the foul lines, broken by the press box behind home plate, with the luxury boxes directly behind and above them. 300-level seating wraps around the infield along the lines, and also features the \"[[tbt*]] Party Deck\", a small-capacity seating area above the left field outfield seats with separate concessions inside.

The Dex Imaging Home Plate Club features its own entrance, recliner seats, and a premium buffet with in-seat service. The second club section, the Rays Club, is along the first-base side on the 100-level at the Loge Box level. It features its own premium buffet and premium seating.\n\nMacDillville is a section located on the right field line, behind the Rays' bullpen.

The left field party section is available for groups of 75-136 people and now named the \"Ducky's 162 Landing\". The section was named \"162 Landing\", in reference to [[Evan Longoria]]'s [[walk-off home run]] in the 162nd and final regular season game of the {{mlby|2011}} season that landed in that section, which clinched the [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] for the Rays. In 2017 the section was renamed after the Tampa sports bar, \"Ducky's\" that is featured in The Porch, and co-owned by [[Evan Longoria]]. The right field party section is the \"[[Papa John's]] Bullpen Box\" and is available for groups of 50-85. When the right field corner was sponsored by the fast food chain [[Checkers (fast food)|Checkers]], tickets to the \"Checkers Bullpen Cafe\" included a free meal at the Checkers kiosk immediately adjacent to the section. As of 2008, both party sections feature [[All-you-can-eat seats (baseball)|all-you-can-eat]] [[buffet]]s.\n\nIn 2008, the Rays also set aside a section of the press boxes on the right field side, named \"Press Level Party Area\", as an all-you-can-eat buffet section with typical ballpark fare. It is usually available for group parties of at least 35, but it is available for individual ticketing on select dates.\n\nCurrently, the top \u2153 of the upper deck seating is tarped over, artificially reducing the stadium's capacity to 36,048 for the 2008 regular season. It was further reduced to 35,041 for the 2008 postseason since the tbt* Party Deck has been reserved by Major League Baseball as an auxiliary press area. On October 14, 2008, the Rays announced that the upper deck tarps would be removed for the remainder of the postseason, starting with a Game 6 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series]]. This increased the capacity of the stadium to nearly 41,000, depending on standing-room-only tickets sold.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2008_10_18_bosmlb_tbamlb_1&mode=wrap ALCS Game 6] had an announced attendance of 40,947, while [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2008_10_19_bosmlb_tbamlb_1&mode=wrap Game 7] had an announced attendance of 40,473.</ref>\n\nThe St. Anthony's Fan Care Clinic is located between Gates 3 and 4 on the 100 level, section 102 (behind home plate).

Also, the development in nearby Tampa of [[Amalie Arena]] (opened in 1996)  and the [[MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre]] (opened in 2004) into busy concert venues has further curtailed the concert slate at Tropicana Field.<ref  name=\"nomore\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gurbal Kritzer|first1=Ashley|title=Amalie Arena ranks among top venues across the globe for concert and event ticket sales|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2017/08/03/amalie-arena-ranks-among-top-venues-across-the.html|accessdate=9 April 2018|work=www.bizjournals.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Business Journal|date=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Rays Summer Concert Series====\nBeginning in 2007, the Rays organized a \"Summer Concert Series\" in which a mix of major and lesser-known performers of many different musical genres performed after select home games for no extra charge beyond the price of the game ticket. The concerts were usually scheduled after Friday or Saturday night games, with more kid-oriented acts performing after Sunday afternoon games. The usual procedure was for a portable stage to be rolled out onto centerfield immediately after the final out of the ballgame, with the music starting soon thereafter. For most shows, fans were allowed to come down onto the playing field to  watch the performance up close.\n\nThe first after-baseball concert featured nostalgia act [[Sha Na Na]] in June 2007. The event was so successful that the Rays booked a series of shows for the following season, usually increasing attendance for those games. Participating artists have included [[The Beach Boys]], [[Los Lobos]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Sister Hazel]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[The Jacksons]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Weezer]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Joan Jett]], and [[The Wiggles]] among many others, totaling over 80 shows in all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbnweekly.com/diversions/music/rays-announce-summer-concert-series/article_86718527-401b-5160-bbd0-ca4a14ec6072.html|title=Rays announce summer concert series|website=Tampa Bay Newspapers |author1= |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/things-to-do/music/rays-concert-series-brings-life-and-a-few-extra-fans-to-the-trop/2238141|title=Rays concert series brings life, and a few extra fans, to the Trop|author1=Cridlin, Jay  |date=21 July 2015|website=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Sister_Hazel_2015\">{{cite web |title=Rays Add Sister Hazel to 2015 Summer Concert Series |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/rays-add-sister-hazel-to-2015-summer-concert-series/c-133010250 |website=MLB News |date=26 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn some seasons, the number of post-game concerts was as high as a dozen. The number dwindled to two in 2017, and before the 2018 season, the Rays announced that they would discontinue the concert series due to \"stress on the artificial turf\".<ref name=\"nomore\">{{cite news|last1=Cridlin|first1=Jay|title=Rays: No postgame concerts at Tropicana Field in 2018|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/2018/03/28/rays-no-postgame-concerts-at-tropicana-field-in-2018/|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=tampabay.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|date=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Catwalks===\nAmong the most cited criticisms about the stadium are the four [[catwalk (theater)|catwalk]]s that hang from the ceiling. The catwalks are part of the dome's support structure. The stadium was built with [[cable-stayed]] technology similar to that of the defunct [[Georgia Dome]]. It also supports the lighting and speaker systems. Because the dome is tilted toward the outfield, the catwalks are lower in the outfield.\n\n[[Image:Tropicana Field Catwalks.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The catwalks at Tropicana Field]]\n[[File:Tropicanafieldceiling.jpg|thumb|200px|Close-up view of the A, B, and C rings]]\n\nThe catwalks are lettered, with the highest inner ring being the A Ring, out to the farthest and lowest, the D Ring. The A Ring is entirely in play, while the B, C, and D Rings have yellow posts bolted to them to delineate the relative position of the foul lines. Any ball touching the A Ring, or the in-play portion of the B Ring, can drop for a hit or be caught for an out. The C and D Rings are out of play; if they are struck between the foul poles, then the ball is ruled a [[home run]].\n\nOn August 5, 2010, [[Jason Kubel]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] hit a sky-high infield pop-up that would have ended the inning in a 6\u20136 game if caught, but the ball struck the A ring and fell safely onto the infield allowing the Twins to score the go-ahead run and extend the inning in a controversial 8\u20136 win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/dome-clanking-popup-leaves-rays-in-dumps/1113453|title=Dome-Clanking Popup Leaves Rays in Dumps|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> As a result, on October 4, 2010, Major League Baseball approved a change in the ground rules for the A and B rings, making it so that a batted ball striking either of the two rings was automatically ruled a dead ball, regardless of whether the ball strikes in fair or foul territory. The rules pertaining to the C and D rings remained the same.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/rays/content/catwalk-rules-changed-postseason|title=Catwalk Rules Changed for Postseason|first=Marc|last=Topkin|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=October 4, 2010}}</ref> This change lasted for just the [[2010 MLB season|2010 postseason]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110315&content_id=16956182|title=Ground rules changed at the Trop for 2011|first=Bill|last=Chastain|work=MLB.com|date=March 15, 2011|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, several potential hits have been lost as a result of the catwalks. For example, on May 12, 2006, [[2006 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Devil Rays]] outfielder [[Jonny Gomes]] hit a long fly ball against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] that seemed destined to be a home run before it hit the B ring, got stuck momentarily, and then rolled off and was caught by Toronto shortstop [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] as Gomes was headed for home plate. Although Rays [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Joe Maddon]] tried to argue that it should have been at least a [[ground rule double]] since it stayed in the B Ring for a while before coming loose, umpires eventually ruled against the Rays and called Gomes out.\n\nOn May 26, 2008, [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] hit a pop-fly to center field that likely would have been caught by [[2008 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] center fielder [[Josh Hamilton]]. The ball instead hit the B ring catwalk and did not come down. Pe\u00f1a was mistakenly given a home run, but after deliberation, the umpires awarded him a [[ground rule double]]. This was the second time this had happened, as [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]] hit a ball that stuck in the same catwalk on May 2, 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20080527/SPORTS/805270587/1011/|title=Ace Leads Tampa Bay to the Best Record in the Majors|newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|last=Maffezzoli|first=Dennis|date=May 27, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany players have hit the C and D rings for home runs. The first player ever to hit the rings for a home run was [[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]] of the [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] on May 29, 1998. Martinez's home run went off the D ring. Three players before him hit balls that went into the C ring. However, at the time, balls hitting the C ring were not ruled home runs. Two days prior to Martinez's home run, the ground rules were changed so that if a ball hit the C ring, it would be called a home run.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E6DC1138F93AA15756C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=|title=AMERICAN LEAGUE: ROUNDUP; Wind Blows The Indians' Direction|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 29, 1998|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> The first player to hit the rings for a home run in postseason play was [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Rays]] [[third baseman]] [[Evan Longoria]], who hit the C ring off [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]] of the [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] on October 2, 2008, in the 3rd inning of Game 1 of the [[2008 American League Division Series]].\n\nOn July 17, 2011, during a nationally televised game against the Red Sox, Rays batter [[Sean Rodriguez]] hit a high foul popup that shattered a lightbulb on a catwalk. Pieces of the broken bulb fell to the turf near the third base coach's box. After a quick cleaning delay in which the Tropicana Field PA system played the theme to [[The Natural (film)|''The Natural'']] (a 1984 film that prominently features a hit baseball striking and shattering a stadium light fixture), the game resumed.\n\nAnother ceiling-related incident came in June 2018, when New York Yankees outfielder [[Clint Frazier]]'s 9th-inning fly ball bounced off a speaker hanging from the B ring and was caught by Rays shortstop [[Adeiny Hechavarria]] for an out. Some suggest that the ball would have traveled far enough for a home run, which would have broken a 6\u20136 tie. The Rays won the game in extra innings with a walk-off home run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/rays/2018/06/24/rodney-pages-takeaways-from-sundays-rays-yankees-game/|title=Rodney Page\u2019s takeaways from Sunday\u2019s Rays-Yankees game|last=Page|first=Rodney|date=June 24, 2018|work=tampabay.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bullpens===\nThe bullpens are located along (and close to) the left and right field foul lines and there are no barriers that separate them from the field of play. In fact, fly balls hit into the bullpens are in play. The bullpen players and the pitching mounds are obstacles for fielders chasing fly balls into the pen. Teams have to station a [[batboy]] behind the catchers in the bullpens to prevent them from being hit by foul balls from behind. This style of bullpen used to be common in the Major Leagues, and is still in use in 2 other stadiums.\n\n===Interior===\nAnother criticism of the stadium is the drab interior environment, especially early in the (Devil) Rays' existence, when the stark concrete interior was compared to a large [[warehouse]]. However, since it was designed specifically for baseball, it is somewhat smaller and the sightlines are better than in most domed stadiums, which are often built to accommodate other sports as well.\n\nThe current Rays' Stuart Sternberg-led ownership group has invested several million dollars over the past decade to make the venue more fan friendly. New or improved features include a larger scoreboard, video wall, catwalk sleeves, an outfield touch-tank featuring [[cownose ray]]s, a walk-around that circles the entire field, two concession and gathering areas in the outfield, and many other additions and upgrades designed to improve the fan experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/09/Tampabay/No_stadium_in_on_deck.shtml|title=Tampabay: No stadium in on-deck circle|website=www.sptimes.com|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref><ref name=\"improvements2014\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/tampa-bay-rays-unveil-new-360-degree-walkway-around-tropicana-field/2172378 | title=Tampa Bay Rays unveil new 360-degree walkway around Tropicana Field | work=Tampa Bay Times | date=28 March 2014 | accessdate=9 June 2016 | author=Krueger, Curtis}}</ref>\n\n===Location===\nTropicana Field sits on {{convert|66|acre}} in the Midtown community of St. Petersburg, Florida. The land the stadium and its parking lots now occupy was occupied by the Gas Plant neighborhood from the late 1800s until 1986.\n\nIn the late 1800s St. Petersburg began a large recruitment initiative to attract people to help build the city's infrastructures and fill lower-income service jobs. African Americans began to move to St. Petersburg from across the south looking to fill these jobs. The influx of African Americans in the area brought the formation of many black communities including the Gas Plant district. The area housed nearly 800 people,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cltampa.com/home/article/20721576/build-a-stadium-raze-a-neighborhood|title=Build a Stadium, Raze a Neighborhood|work=Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en}}</ref> many African American-owned small businesses and three African American churches. The district's name came from the two fuel tanks that originally stood where Tropicana Field now stands.\n\nIn 1979 the St. Petersburg City Council voted to refurbish the neighborhood, as it had \"seen better days.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.usfsp.edu/jsokolov/mclin/harper.html|title=Around the dome, echoes of the past|last=Lavin|first=Rochelle Lewis|website=faculty.usfsp.edu|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> This plan promised to create new, modern, affordable housing and an industrial park that would bring many new jobs to the area. By 1982 developers offered no proposals for the refurbishment of the district to the city council, even after the council specifically requested the proposals. A group of Pinellas County business people offered a plan to the council that entailed building a baseball stadium, in hopes of attracting a major league baseball team to the area.  That year, the council voted unanimously to follow through with the baseball hopes and lease the land to the sports authority for $1 a year.\n\nMost African Americans that used to live and or work in the neighborhood felt betrayed by the city and bitter over the baseball development. The city had offered, and followed through with, many reparation programs for the residents and businesses of the Gas Plant district when the district was originally to be refurbished, including financial relocation help. But these programs were welcomed only on the basis that the area would be once again a functional community. When that stipulation changed residents were angered and new reparation plans were rumored but never came to fruition. As for the churches of the area, relocation offers extended to them from the City Council were \"generous\" according to one of the churches pastors. This is believed to be because of the political power that the churches held.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe destruction of the Gas Plant district and the city's shortcomings in securing economic and employment opportunities for the displaced African American community have left a jagged relationship between city officials and the aforementioned African American community. The destruction of the Gas Plant district financially crippled and killed many African American-owned small businesses and is often referred to as the main reason that only 10% of St. Petersburg's small businesses are African American-owned today.\n\nThe dome was built on the former site of a [[coal]] [[gasification]] plant and, in 1987, hazardous chemicals were found in the soil around the construction site.

The stadium is also used for [[college football]], and from December 2008 to December 2017 was the home of the [[St. Petersburg Bowl]], an annual postseason [[bowl game]]. It is currently the only non-retractable domed stadium in Major League Baseball, making it the only year-round indoor venue in MLB. Tropicana Field is the [[List of Major League Baseball stadiums|smallest MLB stadium by seating capacity]] when obstructed-view rows in the uppermost sections are covered with tarps as they are for most Rays games.\n\nTropicana Field opened in 1990 and was originally known as the '''Florida Suncoast Dome'''. In 1993, the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] moved to the facility and its name was changed to the '''ThunderDome'''<ref>{{cite web|last=Davey|first=Monica|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/324374156/?terms=ThunderDome|title=That rumbling's not so distant|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|date=July 31, 1993|page=1B|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref> until the team moved to [[Amalie Arena|their new home]] in downtown Tampa in 1996. In October 1996, [[Tropicana Products]], a fruit juice company then based in nearby [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], signed a 30-year naming rights deal.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Baseball in the Tampa Bay area|Sports in the Tampa Bay area}}\nAfter Tampa was awarded the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u201393)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] in the 1970s, St. Petersburg decided it wanted a share of the professional sports scene in [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]]. City officials decided early on that the city would attempt to attract [[Major League Baseball]]. Possible designs for a [[baseball park]] or [[multi-purpose stadium]] were proposed as early as 1983. One such design, in the same location where Tropicana Field would ultimately be built, called for an open-air stadium with a circus tent-like covering. It took several design cues from [[Kauffman Stadium]], including [[fountain]]s beyond the outfield wall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/ballpark/2008/05/the-original-tr.html|title=Rays stadium debate topic page {{!}} Tampa Bay Times|website=blogs.tampabay.com|access-date=2016-06-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730111639/http://blogs.tampabay.com/ballpark/2008/05/the-original-tr.html|archivedate=July 30, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, city officials decided that a stadium with a fixed permanent dome was necessary for a prospective major league team to be viable in the area, due to its hot, humid summers and frequent thunderstorms. Ballpark construction began in 1986 in the hope that it would lure a Major League Baseball team to the facility.\n\nThe stadium, built originally as the Florida Suncoast Dome, was first used in an attempt to entice the [[Chicago White Sox]] to relocate if a new ballpark was not built to replace the aging [[Comiskey Park]]. The governments of Chicago and [[Illinois]] eventually agreed to build a [[Guaranteed Rate Field|New Comiskey Park]] in 1989.\n\n===1990s===\nThe stadium was finished in 1990.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-02-25/sports/9002253309_1_building-the-dome-suncoast-dome-florida-suncoast|title=Florida Suncoast Dome: A Gem Without A Diamond St. Petersburg's $309 Million Arena To Open Saturday|last=White|first=Russ|date=February 25, 1990|work=|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=2016-11-13|via=}}</ref> It hosted the [[1990 Davis Cup|1990 Davis Cup Finals]] that autumn, as well as several rock concerts, but still had no tenants.

The completion of what is now [[Amalie Arena]] in downtown Tampa permitted \"The Trop\" to be vacated for preparation for its intended purpose, as the Lightning and Storm moved into that facility. A [[United States dollar|US$]]70&nbsp;million renovation then took place\u2014to upgrade a stadium that had cost $130&nbsp;million to complete only eight years earlier. [[Ebbets Field]] was the model for the renovations, which included a replica of the famous rotunda that greeted [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodger]] fans for many years. The first regular season baseball game took place at the park on March 31, 1998, when the [[1998 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Devil Rays]] faced the [[1998 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], losing 11&ndash;6.\n\nAlthough Tropicana was purchased by [[PepsiCo]] in 1998, PepsiCo did not elect to make any changes to Tropicana's naming rights, as the Tropicana brand is popular among the local fanbase (similar to [[Gillette Stadium]] which continued on with its current name after [[Gillette]] was acquired by [[Procter & Gamble]]).\n\n===2000s===\nThe park was initially built with an [[AstroTurf]] surface, but it was replaced in [[2000 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2000]] by softer [[FieldTurf]]. A new version of FieldTurf, FieldTurf Duo, was installed prior to the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2007]] season. It has always featured a traditional \"full dirt\" infield, instead of the \"sliding pits\" design that was common during the 1970s and 1980s, making it the first artificial turf field with a full dirt infield since [[Busch Stadium II]] in 1976. Since Tropicana Field does not need to convert between baseball and football, sliding pits, designed to save re-configuration time, were unnecessary. The only other artificial turf field in MLB, [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto, converted to the full dirt infield after the departure of the [[Toronto Argonauts]] to [[BMO Field]]. Tropicana has hosted football games, but never during baseball season. On August 6, 2007, the AstroTurf [[warning track]] was replaced by brown-colored stone filled FieldTurf Duo.\n\nTropicana Field underwent a further $25 million facelift prior to the [[2006 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2006]] season. Another $10&nbsp;million in improvements were added during the season. In 2006, the Devil Rays added a live [[Cownose ray]] tank to Tropicana Field. The tank is located just behind the center field wall, in clear view of the play on the field. People can go up to the tank to touch the creatures. Further improvements prior to the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2007]] offseason, in addition to the new FieldTurf, include additional family features in the right field area, the creation of a new premium club, and several new video boards including a new {{convert|35|x|64|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Daktronics]] LED main video board that is four times larger than the original video board. The 2007 renovation also added built-in [[high-definition television|HDTV]] capabilities to the ballpark, with [[Fox Sports Florida]] and [[WXPX]] airing at least a quarter of the schedule in HD in 2007 and accommodating the new video board's 16x9 aspect ratio.\n\n[[Image:TropicanaFieldEntrance.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Entrance rotunda fa\u00e7ade as it appeared in 2008]]\n\nOn September 3, 2008, in a game between the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Rays]] and the [[2008 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], Tropicana Field saw the first official use of [[instant replay]] in the history of [[Major League Baseball]].

The dome is supported by a [[tensegrity]] structure and is lit up with orange lights after the Rays win a home game. When the [[Minnesota Twins]] vacated the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] following the 2009 season and moved into [[Target Field]] in 2010, Tropicana Field became the only active Major League Baseball stadium with a fixed (i.e., not retractable) roof. The catwalks attached to the non-retractable roof have been rare but occasional obstructions in the way of batted balls.\n\nThe main rotunda, on the east end of the stadium, resembles the [[Ebbets Field]] rotunda on the interior. The walkway to the main entrance of the park features a {{convert|900|ft|m|abbr=on}} long [[ceramic]] [[tile]] mosaic, made of 1,849,091 one-inch-square tiles.

Behind the stadium's batter's eye is a center field common area, known as The Porch, which provides fans with open seating and standing room to watch games.

The left field party section is available for groups of 75-136 people and now named the \"Ducky's 162 Landing\". The section was named \"162 Landing\", in reference to [[Evan Longoria]]'s [[walk-off home run]] in the 162nd and final regular season game of the {{mlby|2011}} season that landed in that section, which clinched the [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] for the Rays. In 2017 the section was renamed after the Tampa sports bar, \"Ducky's\" that is featured in The Porch, and co-owned by [[Evan Longoria]]. The right field party section is the \"[[Papa John's]] Bullpen Box\" and is available for groups of 50-85. When the right field corner was sponsored by the fast food chain [[Checkers (fast food)|Checkers]], tickets to the \"Checkers Bullpen Cafe\" included a free meal at the Checkers kiosk immediately adjacent to the section. As of 2008, both party sections feature [[All-you-can-eat seats (baseball)|all-you-can-eat]] [[buffet]]s.\n\nIn 2008, the Rays also set aside a section of the press boxes on the right field side, named \"Press Level Party Area\", as an all-you-can-eat buffet section with typical ballpark fare. It is usually available for group parties of at least 35, but it is available for individual ticketing on select dates.\n\nCurrently, the top \u2153 of the upper deck seating is tarped over, artificially reducing the stadium's capacity to 36,048 for the 2008 regular season. It was further reduced to 35,041 for the 2008 postseason since the tbt* Party Deck has been reserved by Major League Baseball as an auxiliary press area. On October 14, 2008, the Rays announced that the upper deck tarps would be removed for the remainder of the postseason, starting with a Game 6 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series]].

Also, the development in nearby Tampa of [[Amalie Arena]] (opened in 1996)  and the [[MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre]] (opened in 2004) into busy concert venues has further curtailed the concert slate at Tropicana Field.<ref  name=\"nomore\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gurbal Kritzer|first1=Ashley|title=Amalie Arena ranks among top venues across the globe for concert and event ticket sales|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2017/08/03/amalie-arena-ranks-among-top-venues-across-the.html|accessdate=9 April 2018|work=www.bizjournals.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Business Journal|date=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Rays Summer Concert Series====\nBeginning in 2007, the Rays organized a \"Summer Concert Series\" in which a mix of major and lesser-known performers of many different musical genres performed after select home games for no extra charge beyond the price of the game ticket. The concerts were usually scheduled after Friday or Saturday night games, with more kid-oriented acts performing after Sunday afternoon games. The usual procedure was for a portable stage to be rolled out onto centerfield immediately after the final out of the ballgame, with the music starting soon thereafter. For most shows, fans were allowed to come down onto the playing field to  watch the performance up close.\n\nThe first after-baseball concert featured nostalgia act [[Sha Na Na]] in June 2007. The event was so successful that the Rays booked a series of shows for the following season, usually increasing attendance for those games. Participating artists have included [[The Beach Boys]], [[Los Lobos]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Sister Hazel]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[The Jacksons]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Weezer]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Joan Jett]], and [[The Wiggles]] among many others, totaling over 80 shows in all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbnweekly.com/diversions/music/rays-announce-summer-concert-series/article_86718527-401b-5160-bbd0-ca4a14ec6072.html|title=Rays announce summer concert series|website=Tampa Bay Newspapers |author1= |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/things-to-do/music/rays-concert-series-brings-life-and-a-few-extra-fans-to-the-trop/2238141|title=Rays concert series brings life, and a few extra fans, to the Trop|author1=Cridlin, Jay  |date=21 July 2015|website=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Sister_Hazel_2015\">{{cite web |title=Rays Add Sister Hazel to 2015 Summer Concert Series |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/rays-add-sister-hazel-to-2015-summer-concert-series/c-133010250 |website=MLB News |date=26 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn some seasons, the number of post-game concerts was as high as a dozen. The number dwindled to two in 2017, and before the 2018 season, the Rays announced that they would discontinue the concert series due to \"stress on the artificial turf\".<ref name=\"nomore\">{{cite news|last1=Cridlin|first1=Jay|title=Rays: No postgame concerts at Tropicana Field in 2018|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/2018/03/28/rays-no-postgame-concerts-at-tropicana-field-in-2018/|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=tampabay.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|date=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Catwalks===\nAmong the most cited criticisms about the stadium are the four [[catwalk (theater)|catwalk]]s that hang from the ceiling. The catwalks are part of the dome's support structure. The stadium was built with [[cable-stayed]] technology similar to that of the defunct [[Georgia Dome]]. It also supports the lighting and speaker systems. Because the dome is tilted toward the outfield, the catwalks are lower in the outfield.\n\n[[Image:Tropicana Field Catwalks.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The catwalks at Tropicana Field]]\n[[File:Tropicanafieldceiling.jpg|thumb|200px|Close-up view of the A, B, and C rings]]\n\nThe catwalks are lettered, with the highest inner ring being the A Ring, out to the farthest and lowest, the D Ring. The A Ring is entirely in play, while the B, C, and D Rings have yellow posts bolted to them to delineate the relative position of the foul lines. Any ball touching the A Ring, or the in-play portion of the B Ring, can drop for a hit or be caught for an out. The C and D Rings are out of play; if they are struck between the foul poles, then the ball is ruled a [[home run]].\n\nOn August 5, 2010, [[Jason Kubel]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] hit a sky-high infield pop-up that would have ended the inning in a 6\u20136 game if caught, but the ball struck the A ring and fell safely onto the infield allowing the Twins to score the go-ahead run and extend the inning in a controversial 8\u20136 win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/dome-clanking-popup-leaves-rays-in-dumps/1113453|title=Dome-Clanking Popup Leaves Rays in Dumps|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> As a result, on October 4, 2010, Major League Baseball approved a change in the ground rules for the A and B rings, making it so that a batted ball striking either of the two rings was automatically ruled a dead ball, regardless of whether the ball strikes in fair or foul territory. The rules pertaining to the C and D rings remained the same.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/rays/content/catwalk-rules-changed-postseason|title=Catwalk Rules Changed for Postseason|first=Marc|last=Topkin|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=October 4, 2010}}</ref> This change lasted for just the [[2010 MLB season|2010 postseason]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110315&content_id=16956182|title=Ground rules changed at the Trop for 2011|first=Bill|last=Chastain|work=MLB.com|date=March 15, 2011|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, several potential hits have been lost as a result of the catwalks. For example, on May 12, 2006, [[2006 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Devil Rays]] outfielder [[Jonny Gomes]] hit a long fly ball against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] that seemed destined to be a home run before it hit the B ring, got stuck momentarily, and then rolled off and was caught by Toronto shortstop [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] as Gomes was headed for home plate. Although Rays [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Joe Maddon]] tried to argue that it should have been at least a [[ground rule double]] since it stayed in the B Ring for a while before coming loose, umpires eventually ruled against the Rays and called Gomes out.\n\nOn May 26, 2008, [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] hit a pop-fly to center field that likely would have been caught by [[2008 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] center fielder [[Josh Hamilton]]. The ball instead hit the B ring catwalk and did not come down. Pe\u00f1a was mistakenly given a home run, but after deliberation, the umpires awarded him a [[ground rule double]]. This was the second time this had happened, as [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]] hit a ball that stuck in the same catwalk on May 2, 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20080527/SPORTS/805270587/1011/|title=Ace Leads Tampa Bay to the Best Record in the Majors|newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|last=Maffezzoli|first=Dennis|date=May 27, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany players have hit the C and D rings for home runs. The first player ever to hit the rings for a home run was [[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]] of the [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] on May 29, 1998. Martinez's home run went off the D ring. Three players before him hit balls that went into the C ring. However, at the time, balls hitting the C ring were not ruled home runs. Two days prior to Martinez's home run, the ground rules were changed so that if a ball hit the C ring, it would be called a home run.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E6DC1138F93AA15756C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=|title=AMERICAN LEAGUE: ROUNDUP; Wind Blows The Indians' Direction|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 29, 1998|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> The first player to hit the rings for a home run in postseason play was [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Rays]] [[third baseman]] [[Evan Longoria]], who hit the C ring off [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]] of the [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] on October 2, 2008, in the 3rd inning of Game 1 of the [[2008 American League Division Series]].\n\nOn July 17, 2011, during a nationally televised game against the Red Sox, Rays batter [[Sean Rodriguez]] hit a high foul popup that shattered a lightbulb on a catwalk. Pieces of the broken bulb fell to the turf near the third base coach's box. After a quick cleaning delay in which the Tropicana Field PA system played the theme to [[The Natural (film)|''The Natural'']] (a 1984 film that prominently features a hit baseball striking and shattering a stadium light fixture), the game resumed.\n\nAnother ceiling-related incident came in June 2018, when New York Yankees outfielder [[Clint Frazier]]'s 9th-inning fly ball bounced off a speaker hanging from the B ring and was caught by Rays shortstop [[Adeiny Hechavarria]] for an out. Some suggest that the ball would have traveled far enough for a home run, which would have broken a 6\u20136 tie. The Rays won the game in extra innings with a walk-off home run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/rays/2018/06/24/rodney-pages-takeaways-from-sundays-rays-yankees-game/|title=Rodney Page\u2019s takeaways from Sunday\u2019s Rays-Yankees game|last=Page|first=Rodney|date=June 24, 2018|work=tampabay.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bullpens===\nThe bullpens are located along (and close to) the left and right field foul lines and there are no barriers that separate them from the field of play. In fact, fly balls hit into the bullpens are in play. The bullpen players and the pitching mounds are obstacles for fielders chasing fly balls into the pen. Teams have to station a [[batboy]] behind the catchers in the bullpens to prevent them from being hit by foul balls from behind. This style of bullpen used to be common in the Major Leagues, and is still in use in 2 other stadiums.\n\n===Interior===\nAnother criticism of the stadium is the drab interior environment, especially early in the (Devil) Rays' existence, when the stark concrete interior was compared to a large [[warehouse]]. However, since it was designed specifically for baseball, it is somewhat smaller and the sightlines are better than in most domed stadiums, which are often built to accommodate other sports as well.\n\nThe current Rays' Stuart Sternberg-led ownership group has invested several million dollars over the past decade to make the venue more fan friendly. New or improved features include a larger scoreboard, video wall, catwalk sleeves, an outfield touch-tank featuring [[cownose ray]]s, a walk-around that circles the entire field, two concession and gathering areas in the outfield, and many other additions and upgrades designed to improve the fan experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/09/Tampabay/No_stadium_in_on_deck.shtml|title=Tampabay: No stadium in on-deck circle|website=www.sptimes.com|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref><ref name=\"improvements2014\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/tampa-bay-rays-unveil-new-360-degree-walkway-around-tropicana-field/2172378 | title=Tampa Bay Rays unveil new 360-degree walkway around Tropicana Field | work=Tampa Bay Times | date=28 March 2014 | accessdate=9 June 2016 | author=Krueger, Curtis}}</ref>\n\n===Location===\nTropicana Field sits on {{convert|66|acre}} in the Midtown community of St. Petersburg, Florida. The land the stadium and its parking lots now occupy was occupied by the Gas Plant neighborhood from the late 1800s until 1986.\n\nIn the late 1800s St. Petersburg began a large recruitment initiative to attract people to help build the city's infrastructures and fill lower-income service jobs. African Americans began to move to St. Petersburg from across the south looking to fill these jobs. The influx of African Americans in the area brought the formation of many black communities including the Gas Plant district. The area housed nearly 800 people,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cltampa.com/home/article/20721576/build-a-stadium-raze-a-neighborhood|title=Build a Stadium, Raze a Neighborhood|work=Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en}}</ref> many African American-owned small businesses and three African American churches. The district's name came from the two fuel tanks that originally stood where Tropicana Field now stands.\n\nIn 1979 the St. Petersburg City Council voted to refurbish the neighborhood, as it had \"seen better days.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.usfsp.edu/jsokolov/mclin/harper.html|title=Around the dome, echoes of the past|last=Lavin|first=Rochelle Lewis|website=faculty.usfsp.edu|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> This plan promised to create new, modern, affordable housing and an industrial park that would bring many new jobs to the area. By 1982 developers offered no proposals for the refurbishment of the district to the city council, even after the council specifically requested the proposals. A group of Pinellas County business people offered a plan to the council that entailed building a baseball stadium, in hopes of attracting a major league baseball team to the area.  That year, the council voted unanimously to follow through with the baseball hopes and lease the land to the sports authority for $1 a year.\n\nMost African Americans that used to live and or work in the neighborhood felt betrayed by the city and bitter over the baseball development. The city had offered, and followed through with, many reparation programs for the residents and businesses of the Gas Plant district when the district was originally to be refurbished, including financial relocation help. But these programs were welcomed only on the basis that the area would be once again a functional community. When that stipulation changed residents were angered and new reparation plans were rumored but never came to fruition. As for the churches of the area, relocation offers extended to them from the City Council were \"generous\" according to one of the churches pastors. This is believed to be because of the political power that the churches held.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe destruction of the Gas Plant district and the city's shortcomings in securing economic and employment opportunities for the displaced African American community have left a jagged relationship between city officials and the aforementioned African American community. The destruction of the Gas Plant district financially crippled and killed many African American-owned small businesses and is often referred to as the main reason that only 10% of St. Petersburg's small businesses are African American-owned today.\n\nThe dome was built on the former site of a [[coal]] [[gasification]] plant and, in 1987, hazardous chemicals were found in the soil around the construction site.

As The Snuggler, he rescued Tim from the woods after an attack by Chippy's mother, nursing him back to health with snuggles and rehabilitation.  Tairy stars in the ''Snuggler'' video game, in which players must snuggle and earn energy crystals, which can be traded in for a number of green shields.  He hosts the ''Tairy Greene Acting Seminar For Children''. As a graduate of [[James Sprunt Community College]] and having studied under the tutelage of Randy Tutelage, Greene often embellishes his acting credentials and abilities, usually to the dismay of the children. He is perceived as a little bit crazy; he attributes this to having once stuck his tongue in a burrito.  Greene directed the fictional Channel 5 movie ''Back To Squall'' and the fictional film ''Little Danson Man'' starring [[Ted Danson]] and [[David Cross]]. Cinco produces \"The Tairy Greene Machine,\" a video [[jukebox]] pre-loaded with every appearance Greene had ever made.

Tatum has a severe case of facial [[eczema]], which he treats with generous applications of [[Vaseline]]. During his performances, Casey is accompanied by his unnamed, sunglasses-wearing brother (Wareheim), with the duo billed as \"Casey and His Brother\". He either dances or otherwise acts out the song alongside him. In the season 2 premiere \"Vacation\", it was revealed that during the events of the season 1 episode \"Missing\", Tatum had died in a fiery car crash at the age of 17; subsequent episodes would feature \"classic\" Casey and His Brother performances.

He also co-starred in the fictional Channel 5 Tuesday Afternoon Movie ''Back to Squall'' as the headmaster of Admiral David Liebe Hart's Sailing Quallage.  He stars as himself alongside Bill Hader in ''The James Quall Story''.

Pierre frequently appears in videos purportedly intended for children but inevitably showcasing his fixations, such as a [[public service announcement]] informing children that \"all the food is poison\" and they should therefore eat something else, \"Doo Dah Doo Doo\" (a [[line dance]] that features increasingly suggestive directions, as well as lyrics expressing his desire to meet the participants' dads), and a [[meditation]] lesson for children (which turns into a ploy to get their dads' e-mail addresses). One sketch revealed that Pierre's ideal dreams include a \"beautiful boy\" and the boy's mustachioed dad inviting him to a barbecue dinner, where he is fed meat while looking at various websites on an extremely fast internet connection. While hosting the ''Channel 5 Dance Party'', Pierre commented that he once impregnated Casey's mother.\n*'''Chippy''' \u2014 an animated character whose origin dates back to ''Tom Goes to the Mayor'', Chippy is a wild creature often seen in very brief bits in which he is found hiding in a background.  Chippy resembles a [[hirsutism|hirsute]] baby, with a handlebar mustache and an abnormally large unibrow. Chippy is always in distress and a scene with Chippy almost always ends with it emitting a high-pitched screech.  In the episode \"Forest,\" Chippy's mother (Wareheim) viciously attacks Tim while on a nature hike.\n*'''Jan and Wayne Skylar''' (Heidecker and Wareheim) \u2014 a husband and wife who are television news anchors, billed as \"Channel 5's Only Married News Team\", and less than modest about displaying affection on air. These characters were carried over from ''Tom Goes to the Mayor.''<ref name=\"TOS1\"/>\n* '''Dr. Steve Brule''' ([[John C. Reilly]]) \u2014 an inept Channel 5 news reporter who often appears uncomfortable being on air, and seems uncontrollably attracted to his colleague Jan Skylar \u2014 whose husband Wayne disapproves of his advances toward her.<ref name=\"TS1\"/><ref name=\"TOS1\"/> Canadian comedian [[Ron Sparks (comedian)|Ron Sparks]] played Brule in a short video for the charity event ''Other People's Stuff''. in 2008. Brule also became the subject of a spin-off series, ''[[Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule]]''.\n*'''Steve Mahanahan''' (Wareheim) \u2014 the eccentric owner of a retailer that sells children dressed as clowns for the use of the buyer's amusement. In his commercials he is always shown with constant visual effects and video glitching. He also gave Casey Tatum a ride in the season 1 episode, 'Missing'. Steve Mahanahan also has a brother named Mike (played by Tim) who appeared in one episode and sells shoes for the aforementioned child clowns, and like his brother, is constantly featured in his commercials with video glitching. Often the two brothers profess their love for each other and their endorsement of their brother's store. In season 5, Steve Mahanahan was arrested for touching a child clown and Mike Mahanahan was shot in the face for no discernible reason. With these two gone, their father Donald Mahanahan (played by [[Will Ferrell]]) took over the business breeding child clowns.  Donald Mahanahan breeds the clowns using his own seed and women who possess \"real clown traits\".\n*'''Glen Tennis''' ([[A.D. Miles]]) \u2014 a film producer and actor, characterized by his short temper and a penchant against \"crappy acting\". He starred alongside Ron Stark in a low-budget sci-fi film, ''Crystal Shyps''. In \"Carol\", Tennis is seen selling ''Crystal Shyps'' merchandise on ''[[Shopping channel|Shopping Indoors]]'', but is interrupted by his brother David\u2014who calls in to \"harmlessly rib\" him, prompting Tennis to destroy the merchandise in anger. In \"Tennis\", Tennis is seen promoting his new film ''The Pillgrums'', with the film's badly rendered [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] co-star, Grum.\n* '''Spagett''' (Heidecker) \u2014 a hyperactive overweight middle-aged man with a black ponytail, visible hair plugs, and dried [[spaghetti sauce]] around his lips. He is the host of a [[hidden camera]] TV show, where he hides in various locations to \"spook\" people by yelling out his name. However, his hiding places are always in plain view and as a result, his victims are rarely frightened. In one episode Tim stars as Spagett in the [[Steven Spielberg]] (portrayed by look-alike Howie Slater) movie ''Spagett and the Quest for the Golden Treasure''. He also serves as a spokesman for Cigarette Juice.\n* '''The Beaver Boys''' (Heidecker and Wareheim) \u2014 a pair of party boys named '''Dilly''' and '''Krunk''' who often prowl the beach for women. They are seen as having a penchant for cocktail [[shrimp]] and [[white wine]], which is further emphasized in the lyrics to their show's accompanying theme song.\n*'''Carol and Mr. Henderson''' (Wareheim and Heidecker) \u2014 set in a typical office, Carol is an obese lady who has a sexual obsession with Mr. Henderson, her balding and bespectacled boss. Henderson often stops by Carol's cubicle to sexually harass/tease her. This always excites Carol, and just when she is most excited, Mr. Henderson throws his coffee in her face. Henderson secretly adores Carol, but won't show it. In ''The Tim and Eric Chrimbus Special'', Carol and Henderson are shown to have married. Henderson, while playing with his guillotine collection, is nearly beheaded by Carol. However, thanks to a speedy trip to the hospital, Henderson is rehabilitated by Gary, twin brother of office employee Larry. A deleted scene from the Chrimbus Special DVD reveals that Henderson's first name is Dick.\n*'''Ron Stark''' \u2014 a self-proclaimed actor, director, and producer, who often has various roles throughout every Tim and Eric season. In season 1, such roles included a user of \"Balls Insurance\". He also hosts a show called ''Stark On Stark'' in season 2, in which he interviews himself.\n*'''Will Grello''' ([[Will Forte]]) \u2014 host of several shows featuring activities such as fort building and quilting. Although his shows start out calmly and innocently, he inevitably unravels, as repressed thoughts surface about his abusive father who would punish him with a whipping belt and make him do disturbing things such as \"cook the dog\" and preserve his bowel movements in the toilet for his father's inspection. He frequently urinates involuntarily when he gets on his tangents about his father.\n\n==Recurring sketches==\n{{or section|date=January 2018}}\n* '''Cinco''': Carried over from ''Tom Goes to the Mayor,'' Cinco is a family-owned [[megacorporation]] with various subsidiaries, including the Cinco Chemicals and Toy Division, among others. Most sketches involving Cinco take the form of [[parody advertisement|commercials]] for its products and services\u2014often of questionable appeal or based on outdated technology\u2014such as the Cinco-Fone (a mobile phone that has a single button for \"easier\" operation, and multiple antennas, but cannot receive calls, only has enough battery life for one call, and is prone to overheating), insurance plans for groin injuries, \"MyEggs\" (a drug that causes \"feces-activated\" chicken embryos to become eggs that are \"[[Oviparity|laid]]\" in the toilet), as well as several body modifications \u2014 all of which promoted by the two [[middle-aged]] characters Rudy and Kent (Jay Mawhinney and Bob Ross) \u2014  that require the user's [[tooth extraction|teeth be removed]] for safety regardless of the product.\n* '''''Channel 5 Kid Break''''': A series of pseudo-educational [[Interstitial program|interstitial]] music videos, in which two \"children\" (Heidecker and Wareheim) [[Rapping|rap]] about personal hygiene and family situations such as sitting down on the toilet while urinating, wearing a father's dirty socks, incest (having a crush on one's sister), not wiping one's rear end, bloody nipples, and eating one's boogers.\n* '''''Brule's Rules''''': A Channel 5 interstitial where Steve Brule provides \"advice\" on various topics, \"for your health\". \n* '''''Uncle Muscle's Hour''''': A variety show on Channel 5 hosted by the titular Uncle Muscles ([[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]), almost always featuring performances by Casey and His Brother. One episode featured a [[talent show]] known as the \"Uncle Muscle's Grand Championship\"\u2014which was won by Michael Q. Schmidt and his nude \"Raise my Roof\" dance routine.\n*'''''Afternoon Review: The Daytime Show for Women''''': Purportedly a [[Daytime television|daytime]] talk show, it instead features surreal performances by various men with little elaboration. Season 5 featured a variation, '''''Morning Meditations''''', which follows a similar format.\n*'''''Child Showcase''''': A poorly-archived Channel 5 program on which \"children\" (an adult's head, including those of [[Rainn Wilson]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], superimposed over a child's body) perform musical numbers that are somewhat inappropriate in subject matter, much to the chagrin of the host.\n*'''Video Match: A Dating Service''': A series of dating service videos featuring undesirable men looking for love.  Such men, who are shown with compressed faces and prominent moustaches, include one with petite, feminine feet and another who is a gamer with only a \"tip\" for a penis ([[Rainn Wilson]]).\n*'''Song Legends Karaoke''': Karaoke videos featuring songs about subjects such as adultery, stalking, and living in an apartment with one's father. An elderly woman named Ruth Carr is featured prominently in two of the segments.\n\nOccasionally a sketch will end with a [[Freeze frame shot|freeze frame]]; the colors fade to black and white, and a voice announces, \"Great job!\" while these words are written over the frame.\n\n==Death of Richard Dunn==\nOn Friday June 4, 2010, character actor [[Richard Dunn (actor)|Richard Dunn]] died at age 73.<ref name=abcnews>{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Character Actor Richard Dunn Dies at 73\n|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10830952|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> Dunn's [[Talent agent|agent]] stated that Dunn had been at a Hollywood hospital, unconscious since the previous Sunday.<ref name=abcnews/>  Dunn was laid to rest at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]].<ref name=abcnews/> \n\nOn June 12, 2010, a special tribute [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bump]] for Dunn was aired on Adult Swim after the 12:30 a.m. showing of ''[[The Oblongs]]'', describing Dunn as an irreplaceable part of the Tim and Eric family and saying how much he'll be missed, not just as a great character actor, but as a great friend as well.{{cn|date=June 2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://timanderic.com Tim and Eric.com]\n* [http://www.adultswim.com/shows/timanderic/ Adult Swim page for ''TAEASGJ!'']\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0912343/ \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job\" at IMDb]\n*[http://www.flakmag.com/tv/awesomeshow.html Episode Review at FlakMag]\n*[http://www.kwur.com/blog/2007/11/tim-and-eric-awesome-show-great-job.html Review on ''KWUR 90.3 FM'' Blog]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040646/http://tomgreen.com/ondemand/player.php?video=194 Tim and Eric on ''Tom Green Live'']\n* [http://www.adultswim.co.uk/page/TimandEricAwesomeShow/0,,12341,00.html Tim and Eric on Adult Swim UK]\n\n{{Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!'' sketches and characters}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of comedy television characters|Tim and Eric]]\n[[Category:Lists of American television series characters|Tim and Eric]]\n[[Category:Tim & Eric]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe following is a list of recurring characters and featured sketches from ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]''.

He has also appeared on ''Tim & Eric Nite Live''. He is famous for his bad impersonations of celebrities such as [[Bill Cosby]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Jack Nicholson]], as well as American presidents [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. He usually incorporates the phrase \"[[Spaghetti with meatballs|spaghetti and meatballs]]\" into his work. Quall has been featured singing self-styled songs such as \"Beach Blast\" and \"The Car of the Future.\"  Quall himself was impersonated by comedian [[Bill Hader]] for the fictional ''James Quall Story'' feature film during Season 3. Quall has often teamed with fellow recurring character, [[David Liebe Hart]], in fictional movies such as ''Back to Squall'', an ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|Odd Couple]]''-themed film starring Quall, \"John A. Hill\" (actor [[Jonah Hill]]), and Hart, about the misadventures of two roommates at Admiral David Liebe Hart's Sailing Quallage, in Season 4, and ''Quall of Duty'', a [[Police procedural|police crime drama]] co-starring Hart, in Season 5.

As The Snuggler, he rescued Tim from the woods after an attack by Chippy's mother, nursing him back to health with snuggles and rehabilitation.  Tairy stars in the ''Snuggler'' video game, in which players must snuggle and earn energy crystals, which can be traded in for a number of green shields.  He hosts the ''Tairy Greene Acting Seminar For Children''. As a graduate of [[James Sprunt Community College]] and having studied under the tutelage of Randy Tutelage, Greene often embellishes his acting credentials and abilities, usually to the dismay of the children. He is perceived as a little bit crazy; he attributes this to having once stuck his tongue in a burrito.  Greene directed the fictional Channel 5 movie ''Back To Squall'' and the fictional film ''Little Danson Man'' starring [[Ted Danson]] and [[David Cross]]. Cinco produces \"The Tairy Greene Machine,\" a video [[jukebox]] pre-loaded with every appearance Greene had ever made. The device runs on \"Greene technology,\" as it only runs on tap water.\n* '''Casey Tatum''' (Heidecker) \u2014 A teenaged singer who is regularly featured on ''Uncle Muscle's Hour''. Tatum is portrayed as being uncomfortable and easily overcome by extreme, debilitating stage fright, and is often on the threshold of either crying and/or vomiting. Tatum has a severe case of facial [[eczema]], which he treats with generous applications of [[Vaseline]]. During his performances, Casey is accompanied by his unnamed, sunglasses-wearing brother (Wareheim), with the duo billed as \"Casey and His Brother\". He either dances or otherwise acts out the song alongside him. In the season 2 premiere \"Vacation\", it was revealed that during the events of the season 1 episode \"Missing\", Tatum had died in a fiery car crash at the age of 17; subsequent episodes would feature \"classic\" Casey and His Brother performances. In the season 5 episode \"Reanimated\", a young girl finds Casey's remains in the woods\u2014which his brother uses to reassemble and reanimate him. However, during his comeback performance, his body falls apart.<ref name=\"TOS1\"/>\n*'''[[Richard Dunn (actor)|Richard Dunn]]''' \u2014 [[senior citizen]] who appears in nearly every episode since the first, in which he portrayed a congratulatory version of Tim's Dad.<ref name=\"TS1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/487266|title=Twisted minds spawn an Awesome Show|last=Brown|first=Philip|date=August 12, 2008|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref>  He hosted multiple shows on the Public-access television Channel 5, including ''Dunngeon'' and ''Getting It Dunn''.  He also hosted and officiated the ''Tim & Eric Tennis Challenge'' in the Season 4 finale \"Tennis\".

He almost always has a [[Bluetooth]] [[Headset (telephone/computer)|headset]] in his right ear, and is often accompanied by [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] [[green screen]] effects.  He also co-starred in the fictional Channel 5 Tuesday Afternoon Movie ''Back to Squall'' as the Headmaster of Admiral David Liebe Hart's Sailing Quallage.  He stars as himself alongside Bill Hader in ''The James Quall Story''.  Hart often sings about [[Ufology|aliens]] and seems to have a particular affinity for the Korendian race; he had to apologize in a season four episode after an uncharacteristically sexual remark about Korendian women's \"spicy tacos.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/487266|title=Twisted minds spawn an Awesome Show|last=Brown|first=Philip|date=August 20, 2008|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2766/story/1389806.html |title='Awesome' goes on the road |last=Barnhart |first=Aaron |date=February 1, 2009 |publisher=[[News & Observer]] |accessdate=2009-08-15 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=\"TOS1\">{{cite journal|last=Heisler|first=Steve|date=April 24\u201330, 2008 |title=Great Job!, times two|journal=Time Out Chicago|issue=165|url=http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/comedy/28788/great-job-times-two|accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref>\n* '''Palmer Scott''' \u2014 a middle-aged, overweight, balding man wearing what appears to be outdated [[Jordache]] apparel from the late '80s or early '90s.

Pierre frequently appears in videos purportedly intended for children but inevitably showcasing his fixations, such as a [[public service announcement]] informing children that \"all the food is poison\" and they should therefore eat something else, \"Doo Dah Doo Doo\" (a [[line dance]] that features increasingly suggestive directions, as well as lyrics expressing his desire to meet the participants' dads), and a [[meditation]] lesson for children (which turns into a ploy to get their dads' e-mail addresses). One sketch revealed that Pierre's ideal dreams include a \"beautiful boy\" and the boy's mustachioed dad inviting him to a barbecue dinner, where he is fed meat while looking at various websites on an extremely fast internet connection. While hosting the ''Channel 5 Dance Party'', Pierre commented that he once impregnated Casey's mother.\n*'''Chippy''' \u2014 an animated character whose origin dates back to ''Tom Goes to the Mayor'', Chippy is a wild creature often seen in very brief bits in which he is found hiding in a background.  Chippy resembles a [[hirsutism|hirsute]] baby, with a handlebar mustache and an abnormally large unibrow. Chippy is always in distress and a scene with Chippy almost always ends with it emitting a high-pitched screech.  In the episode \"Forest,\" Chippy's mother (Wareheim) viciously attacks Tim while on a nature hike.\n*'''Jan and Wayne Skylar''' (Heidecker and Wareheim) \u2014 a husband and wife who are television news anchors, billed as \"Channel 5's Only Married News Team\", and less than modest about displaying affection on air. These characters were carried over from ''Tom Goes to the Mayor.''<ref name=\"TOS1\"/>\n* '''Dr. Steve Brule''' ([[John C. Reilly]]) \u2014 an inept Channel 5 news reporter who often appears uncomfortable being on air, and seems uncontrollably attracted to his colleague Jan Skylar \u2014 whose husband Wayne disapproves of his advances toward her.<ref name=\"TS1\"/><ref name=\"TOS1\"/> Canadian comedian [[Ron Sparks (comedian)|Ron Sparks]] played Brule in a short video for the charity event ''Other People's Stuff''. in 2008. Brule also became the subject of a spin-off series, ''[[Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule]]''.\n*'''Steve Mahanahan''' (Wareheim) \u2014 the eccentric owner of a retailer that sells children dressed as clowns for the use of the buyer's amusement. In his commercials he is always shown with constant visual effects and video glitching. He also gave Casey Tatum a ride in the season 1 episode, 'Missing'. Steve Mahanahan also has a brother named Mike (played by Tim) who appeared in one episode and sells shoes for the aforementioned child clowns, and like his brother, is constantly featured in his commercials with video glitching. Often the two brothers profess their love for each other and their endorsement of their brother's store. In season 5, Steve Mahanahan was arrested for touching a child clown and Mike Mahanahan was shot in the face for no discernible reason. With these two gone, their father Donald Mahanahan (played by [[Will Ferrell]]) took over the business breeding child clowns.  Donald Mahanahan breeds the clowns using his own seed and women who possess \"real clown traits\".\n*'''Glen Tennis''' ([[A.D. Miles]]) \u2014 a film producer and actor, characterized by his short temper and a penchant against \"crappy acting\". He starred alongside Ron Stark in a low-budget sci-fi film, ''Crystal Shyps''. In \"Carol\", Tennis is seen selling ''Crystal Shyps'' merchandise on ''[[Shopping channel|Shopping Indoors]]'', but is interrupted by his brother David\u2014who calls in to \"harmlessly rib\" him, prompting Tennis to destroy the merchandise in anger. In \"Tennis\", Tennis is seen promoting his new film ''The Pillgrums'', with the film's badly rendered [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] co-star, Grum.\n* '''Spagett''' (Heidecker) \u2014 a hyperactive overweight middle-aged man with a black ponytail, visible hair plugs, and dried [[spaghetti sauce]] around his lips. He is the host of a [[hidden camera]] TV show, where he hides in various locations to \"spook\" people by yelling out his name. However, his hiding places are always in plain view and as a result, his victims are rarely frightened. In one episode Tim stars as Spagett in the [[Steven Spielberg]] (portrayed by look-alike Howie Slater) movie ''Spagett and the Quest for the Golden Treasure''. He also serves as a spokesman for Cigarette Juice.\n* '''The Beaver Boys''' (Heidecker and Wareheim) \u2014 a pair of party boys named '''Dilly''' and '''Krunk''' who often prowl the beach for women. They are seen as having a penchant for cocktail [[shrimp]] and [[white wine]], which is further emphasized in the lyrics to their show's accompanying theme song.\n*'''Carol and Mr. Henderson''' (Wareheim and Heidecker) \u2014 set in a typical office, Carol is an obese lady who has a sexual obsession with Mr. Henderson, her balding and bespectacled boss. Henderson often stops by Carol's cubicle to sexually harass/tease her. This always excites Carol, and just when she is most excited, Mr. Henderson throws his coffee in her face. Henderson secretly adores Carol, but won't show it. In ''The Tim and Eric Chrimbus Special'', Carol and Henderson are shown to have married. Henderson, while playing with his guillotine collection, is nearly beheaded by Carol. However, thanks to a speedy trip to the hospital, Henderson is rehabilitated by Gary, twin brother of office employee Larry. A deleted scene from the Chrimbus Special DVD reveals that Henderson's first name is Dick.\n*'''Ron Stark''' \u2014 a self-proclaimed actor, director, and producer, who often has various roles throughout every Tim and Eric season. In season 1, such roles included a user of \"Balls Insurance\". He also hosts a show called ''Stark On Stark'' in season 2, in which he interviews himself.\n*'''Will Grello''' ([[Will Forte]]) \u2014 host of several shows featuring activities such as fort building and quilting. Although his shows start out calmly and innocently, he inevitably unravels, as repressed thoughts surface about his abusive father who would punish him with a whipping belt and make him do disturbing things such as \"cook the dog\" and preserve his bowel movements in the toilet for his father's inspection. He frequently urinates involuntarily when he gets on his tangents about his father.\n\n==Recurring sketches==\n{{or section|date=January 2018}}\n* '''Cinco''': Carried over from ''Tom Goes to the Mayor,'' Cinco is a family-owned [[megacorporation]] with various subsidiaries, including the Cinco Chemicals and Toy Division, among others. Most sketches involving Cinco take the form of [[parody advertisement|commercials]] for its products and services\u2014often of questionable appeal or based on outdated technology\u2014such as the Cinco-Fone (a mobile phone that has a single button for \"easier\" operation, and multiple antennas, but cannot receive calls, only has enough battery life for one call, and is prone to overheating), insurance plans for groin injuries, \"MyEggs\" (a drug that causes \"feces-activated\" chicken embryos to become eggs that are \"[[Oviparity|laid]]\" in the toilet), as well as several body modifications \u2014 all of which promoted by the two [[middle-aged]] characters Rudy and Kent (Jay Mawhinney and Bob Ross) \u2014  that require the user's [[tooth extraction|teeth be removed]] for safety regardless of the product.\n* '''''Channel 5 Kid Break''''': A series of pseudo-educational [[Interstitial program|interstitial]] music videos, in which two \"children\" (Heidecker and Wareheim) [[Rapping|rap]] about personal hygiene and family situations such as sitting down on the toilet while urinating, wearing a father's dirty socks, incest (having a crush on one's sister), not wiping one's rear end, bloody nipples, and eating one's boogers.\n* '''''Brule's Rules''''': A Channel 5 interstitial where Steve Brule provides \"advice\" on various topics, \"for your health\". \n* '''''Uncle Muscle's Hour''''': A variety show on Channel 5 hosted by the titular Uncle Muscles ([[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]), almost always featuring performances by Casey and His Brother. One episode featured a [[talent show]] known as the \"Uncle Muscle's Grand Championship\"\u2014which was won by Michael Q. Schmidt and his nude \"Raise my Roof\" dance routine.\n*'''''Afternoon Review: The Daytime Show for Women''''': Purportedly a [[Daytime television|daytime]] talk show, it instead features surreal performances by various men with little elaboration. Season 5 featured a variation, '''''Morning Meditations''''', which follows a similar format.\n*'''''Child Showcase''''': A poorly-archived Channel 5 program on which \"children\" (an adult's head, including those of [[Rainn Wilson]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], superimposed over a child's body) perform musical numbers that are somewhat inappropriate in subject matter, much to the chagrin of the host.\n*'''Video Match: A Dating Service''': A series of dating service videos featuring undesirable men looking for love.  Such men, who are shown with compressed faces and prominent moustaches, include one with petite, feminine feet and another who is a gamer with only a \"tip\" for a penis ([[Rainn Wilson]]).\n*'''Song Legends Karaoke''': Karaoke videos featuring songs about subjects such as adultery, stalking, and living in an apartment with one's father. An elderly woman named Ruth Carr is featured prominently in two of the segments.\n\nOccasionally a sketch will end with a [[Freeze frame shot|freeze frame]]; the colors fade to black and white, and a voice announces, \"Great job!\" while these words are written over the frame.\n\n==Death of Richard Dunn==\nOn Friday June 4, 2010, character actor [[Richard Dunn (actor)|Richard Dunn]] died at age 73.<ref name=abcnews>{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Character Actor Richard Dunn Dies at 73\n|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10830952|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> Dunn's [[Talent agent|agent]] stated that Dunn had been at a Hollywood hospital, unconscious since the previous Sunday.<ref name=abcnews/>  Dunn was laid to rest at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]].<ref name=abcnews/> \n\nOn June 12, 2010, a special tribute [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bump]] for Dunn was aired on Adult Swim after the 12:30 a.m. showing of ''[[The Oblongs]]'', describing Dunn as an irreplaceable part of the Tim and Eric family and saying how much he'll be missed, not just as a great character actor, but as a great friend as well.{{cn|date=June 2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://timanderic.com Tim and Eric.com]\n* [http://www.adultswim.com/shows/timanderic/ Adult Swim page for ''TAEASGJ!'']\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0912343/ \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job\" at IMDb]\n*[http://www.flakmag.com/tv/awesomeshow.html Episode Review at FlakMag]\n*[http://www.kwur.com/blog/2007/11/tim-and-eric-awesome-show-great-job.html Review on ''KWUR 90.3 FM'' Blog]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040646/http://tomgreen.com/ondemand/player.php?video=194 Tim and Eric on ''Tom Green Live'']\n* [http://www.adultswim.co.uk/page/TimandEricAwesomeShow/0,,12341,00.html Tim and Eric on Adult Swim UK]\n\n{{Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!'' sketches and characters}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of comedy television characters|Tim and Eric]]\n[[Category:Lists of American television series characters|Tim and Eric]]\n[[Category:Tim & Eric]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "cap, punct", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tim_and_Eric_Awesome_Show,_Great_Job!_sketches_and_characters"}
