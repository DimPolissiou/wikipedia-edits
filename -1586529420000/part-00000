A right-arm fast-medium bowler and lower order left-handed batsman, Old was a key feature of the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] side between 1969 and 1983, before finishing his career at [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in 1985. As a Test bowler for England he took 143 wickets, and scored useful runs in the famous [[1981 Ashes series]]' [[Headingley cricket ground|Headingley]] victory.\n\n==Early life==\nThe youngest of three brothers, Chris Old first made his mark in school cricket as a left handed batsman playing for Middlesbrough, [[Durham, England|Durham]] and England Schools. In 1962 he was recommended to Yorkshire, thus following in the footsteps of his older brothers [[Alan Old|Alan]] and Malcolm, who had already preceded him. He made his debut, aged 15, for Yorkshire 2nd XI against [[Lincolnshire County Cricket Club|Lincolnshire]] at Grimsby in August 1964 as a batsman, scoring 26 in the first innings and 8 not out in the second, but he was subsequently encouraged by resident coach Arthur Mitchell to develop his bowling. He was still predominantly a batsman when he made his debut for the Yorkshire first team as a 17-year-old against Hampshire in 1966, scoring 3 runs and conceding 8 runs from 3 overs without taking a wicket. That was the start of a [[first-class cricket]] career lasting 20 years from 1966 to 1986.\n\n==First-class career==\nHe was mentored by the resident Yorkshire opening bowlers, Fred Trueman and Tony Nicholson, who took over 2800 wickets between them for the county and following Fred Truemans retirement in 1968 he became Nicholsons opening new ball bowling partner. He won his [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] cap in 1969, and was named as the [[Young Cricketer of the Year|Cricket Writer's Club Young Cricketer of the Year]] in 1970. Old hit the 3rd fastest century of all time at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in 1977, with 100 runs from 72 balls in 37 minutes, with the second 50 taking just 9 minutes.<ref name=\"Cap\"/> This feat won him the [[Walter Lawrence Trophy]] for the fastest century of the year. He was also nominated as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of 1979.\n\n'Chilly' (so known because he appeared on the scorecard as \"C.Old\") subsequently took the Yorkshire captaincy in 1981, but it was not a happy period. The next season, suffering from personal problems, he was ousted from the role to allow the 50-year-old, [[Ray Illingworth]], to take charge on the field.<ref name=\"Cap\"/> He then moved on to [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] for three seasons (1983 - 1985) and he also appeared for [[Northern Transvaal cricket team|Northern Transvaal]] in [[South Africa]] between 1981 and 1983. His valedictory first-class cricket appearance was for a Brian Close XI against the touring New Zealand side at Scarborough in September 1986. In 379 first-class matches he took 1,070 first-class wickets at the average of 23.48 and scored 7,756 first-class runs with six centuries. He finished off his domestic cricket career with a season of minor counties cricket, playing 8 matches for [[Northumberland]] in 1987, with the highlight being 6 - 98 against [[Durham, England|Durham]] at [[Chester-le-Street]] in July.\n\n==Test cricketer==\n[[File:Chris_Old_batting_in_Wellington,_February_1978.jpg|thumb|Chris Old batting in Wellington vs NZ, February 1978]]\nHe made his Test debut in the Second Test against [[India]] at [[Calcutta]] in December 1972. His first victim was the great [[Sunil Gavaskar]] whom he caught off the bowling of [[Derek Underwood]] as the first Indian wicket to fall. He produced a notable all-round performance scoring 33 and 17 not out and taking 2 for 72 and 4 for 43 but still finished on the losing side as India won by 28 runs. Over the next 9 years he played in 46 Test matches taking 143 wickets and scoring 845 runs.\n\nOne of his most notable performances was taking four wickets in five balls on the opening day of the [[Test cricket|Test Match]] against [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in June 1978, the wicketless third ball being a [[no-ball]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149067.html |title=Cronje's violent end |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref> Bowling at pace from the City End, the second ball of his nineteenth over was top-edged by [[Wasim Raja]] to [[wicket-keeper]] [[Bob Taylor (cricketer)|Bob Taylor]] before his third ball nipped back through the gate to remove [[Wasim Bari]]'s off stump. Old's fourth ball, the no-ball, was edged by [[Iqbal Qasim]] into the ground but Qasim nicked a late outswinger to the keeper off the next legitimate delivery, before [[Sikander Bakht (cricketer)|Sikander Bakht]] found the safe hands of [[Graham Roope]] at second slip.  Old thus equalled the record of four wickets in five balls set by [[Maurice Allom]] on his Test debut at [[Lancaster Park]], [[Christchurch]] in 1929-30, a feat which has since been repeated by Pakistan's [[Wasim Akram]].\n\nWhen India under A. Wadekar toured England in 1974, England swept the series 3-0.  In the 2nd test, England batted first and made 629, India were then bowled out for 302 and followed on, and in the Indian second innings Chris Old took 5-21 and Arnold took 4-19 and together they bowled India out for 42, their lowest ever test score.\n\nHowever, he is probably best remembered for one of the key second innings batting partnerships with [[Ian Botham]] during the famous [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] [[The Ashes|Ashes]] game of 1981, where they put on 67 crucial runs for the 9th wicket. He followed this up by taking the key wicket of [[Allan Border]] who he clean bowled for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in the Australian second innings. He was the only England cricketer to play in both [[Centenary Test]] Matches against Australia in 1977 at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] and 1980 at [[Lord's]], alongside [[Greg Chappell]], [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Rod Marsh|Rodney Marsh]] for [[Australia]]. Old turned down an invitation from [[Tony Greig]] to play in [[Kerry Packer]]'s rebel [[World Series Cricket]], fearing the withdrawal of the traditional [[Benefit (sports)|benefit season]] offered by Yorkshire. He subsequently joined the rebel [[South African Breweries]] [[South African rebel tours#English XI.2C 1982|English touring side]] in [[South Africa]] during 1982 effectively ending his Test career with the resulting 3-year ban from international cricket.\n\nHe subsequently went to Australia to play in a veterans three-match series, Old Australia XI v Old England XI in 1988, and five years later made a final appearance for an England XI v an Australian XI in a 36 over per side game for [[Derek Randall]]\u2019s Testimonial at [[Trent Bridge]] in June 1993. None of these later matches had first-class status.\n\n==Injury problems==\nThere is little doubt that he would have played more Test cricket had he not been so prone to injuries. He already had surgery on both of his knees during 1970 and 1971 before making his England debut in 1972. He became a regular member of the England squad for almost a decade.

A right-arm fast-medium bowler and lower order left-handed batsman, Old was a key feature of the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] side between 1969 and 1983, before finishing his career at [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in 1985. As a Test bowler for England he took 143 wickets, and scored useful runs in the famous [[1981 Ashes series]]' [[Headingley cricket ground|Headingley]] victory.\n\n==Early life==\nThe youngest of three brothers, Chris Old first made his mark in school cricket as a left handed batsman playing for Middlesbrough, [[Durham, England|Durham]] and England Schools. In 1962 he was recommended to Yorkshire, thus following in the footsteps of his older brothers [[Alan Old|Alan]] and Malcolm, who had already preceded him. He made his debut, aged 15, for Yorkshire 2nd XI against [[Lincolnshire County Cricket Club|Lincolnshire]] at Grimsby in August 1964 as a batsman, scoring 26 in the first innings and 8 not out in the second, but he was subsequently encouraged by resident coach Arthur Mitchell to develop his bowling. He was still predominantly a batsman when he made his debut for the Yorkshire first team as a 17-year-old against Hampshire in 1966, scoring 3 runs and conceding 8 runs from 3 overs without taking a wicket. That was the start of a [[first-class cricket]] career lasting 20 years from 1966 to 1986.\n\n==First-class career==\nHe was mentored by the resident Yorkshire opening bowlers, Fred Trueman and Tony Nicholson, who took over 2800 wickets between them for the county and following Fred Truemans retirement in 1968 he became Nicholsons opening new ball bowling partner. He won his [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] cap in 1969, and was named as the [[Young Cricketer of the Year|Cricket Writer's Club Young Cricketer of the Year]] in 1970. Old hit the 3rd fastest century of all time at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in 1977, with 100 runs from 72 balls in 37 minutes, with the second 50 taking just 9 minutes.<ref name=\"Cap\"/> This feat won him the [[Walter Lawrence Trophy]] for the fastest century of the year. He was also nominated as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of 1979.\n\n'Chilly' (so known because he appeared on the scorecard as \"C.Old\") subsequently took the Yorkshire captaincy in 1981, but it was not a happy period. The next season, suffering from personal problems, he was ousted from the role to allow the 50-year-old, [[Ray Illingworth]], to take charge on the field.<ref name=\"Cap\"/> He then moved on to [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] for three seasons (1983 - 1985) and he also appeared for [[Northern Transvaal cricket team|Northern Transvaal]] in [[South Africa]] between 1981 and 1983. His valedictory first-class cricket appearance was for a Brian Close XI against the touring New Zealand side at Scarborough in September 1986. In 379 first-class matches he took 1,070 first-class wickets at the average of 23.48 and scored 7,756 first-class runs with six centuries. He finished off his domestic cricket career with a season of minor counties cricket, playing 8 matches for [[Northumberland]] in 1987, with the highlight being 6 - 98 against [[Durham, England|Durham]] at [[Chester-le-Street]] in July.\n\n==Test cricketer==\n[[File:Chris_Old_batting_in_Wellington,_February_1978.jpg|thumb|Chris Old batting in Wellington vs NZ, February 1978]]\nHe made his Test debut in the Second Test against [[India]] at [[Calcutta]] in December 1972. His first victim was the great [[Sunil Gavaskar]] whom he caught off the bowling of [[Derek Underwood]] as the first Indian wicket to fall. He produced a notable all-round performance scoring 33 and 17 not out and taking 2 for 72 and 4 for 43 but still finished on the losing side as India won by 28 runs. Over the next 9 years he played in 46 Test matches taking 143 wickets and scoring 845 runs.\n\nOne of his most notable performances was taking four wickets in five balls on the opening day of the [[Test cricket|Test Match]] against [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in June 1978, the wicketless third ball being a [[no-ball]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149067.html |title=Cronje's violent end |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref> Bowling at pace from the City End, the second ball of his nineteenth over was top-edged by [[Wasim Raja]] to [[wicket-keeper]] [[Bob Taylor (cricketer)|Bob Taylor]] before his third ball nipped back though the gate to remove [[Wasim Bari]]'s off stump. Old's fourth ball, the no-ball, was edged by [[Iqbal Qasim]] into the ground but Qasim nicked a late outswinger to the keeper off the next legitimate delivery, before [[Sikander Bakht (cricketer)|Sikander Bakht]] found the safe hands of [[Graham Roope]] at second slip.  Old thus equalled the record of four wickets in five balls set by [[Maurice Allom]] on his Test debut at [[Lancaster Park]], [[Christchurch]] in 1929-30, a feat which has since been repeated by Pakistan's [[Wasim Akram]].\n\nWhen India under A. Wadekar toured England in 1974, England swept the series 3-0.  In the 2nd test, England batted first and made 629, India were then bowled out for 302 and followed on, and in the Indian second innings Chris Old took 5-21 and Arnold took 4-19 and together they bowled India out for 42, their lowest ever test score.\n\nHowever, he is probably best remembered for one of the key second innings batting partnerships with [[Ian Botham]] during the famous [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] [[The Ashes|Ashes]] game of 1981, where they put on 67 crucial runs for the 9th wicket. He followed this up by taking the key wicket of [[Allan Border]] who he clean bowled for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in the Australian second innings. He was the only England cricketer to play in both [[Centenary Test]] Matches against Australia in 1977 at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] and 1980 at [[Lord's]], alongside [[Greg Chappell]], [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Rod Marsh|Rodney Marsh]] for [[Australia]]. Old turned down an invitation from [[Tony Greig]] to play in [[Kerry Packer]]'s rebel [[World Series Cricket]], fearing the withdrawal of the traditional [[Benefit (sports)|benefit season]] offered by Yorkshire. He subsequently joined the rebel [[South African Breweries]] [[South African rebel tours#English XI.2C 1982|English touring side]] in [[South Africa]] during 1982 effectively ending his Test career with the resulting 3-year ban from international cricket.\n\nHe subsequently went to Australia to play in a veterans three-match series, Old Australia XI v Old England XI in 1988, and five years later made a final appearance for an England XI v an Australian XI in a 36 over per side game for [[Derek Randall]]\u2019s Testimonial at [[Trent Bridge]] in June 1993. None of these later matches had first-class status.\n\n==Injury problems==\nThere is little doubt that he would have played more Test cricket had he not been so prone to injuries. He already had surgery on both of his knees during 1970 and 1971 before making his England debut in 1972. He became a regular member of the England squad for almost a decade. A skilful and accurate right arm swing bowler and powerful late order left-handed hitter, he was once described by his England captain [[Mike Brearley]] as a talent to rival [[Ian Botham]].  Despite being a fine natural athlete, and possessing a natural sideways on action, he was continually hampered by regular injury problems and had a tendency to fall prey to 'niggles' in his back and legs, to such an extent that the first [[bowling machine]] installed at [[Lord's]] was nicknamed Chris Old, due to a propensity for breaking down so often.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/280403.html|title=You're not going to believe this, but...|last=Williamson|first=Martin|date=February 2007|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=11 September 2009}}</ref> His departure from the field later in his career to the physiotherapist's table became part of cricket folklore.<ref name=\"Cap\"/> He never completed any of the ten series that he played abroad, and his only ever-present home series was against [[India cricket team|India]] and [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]] in 1974, when in six Tests he took twenty five wickets at twenty two apiece, just emphasising what might have been under different circumstances.<ref name=\"Cap\"/>\n\n==Post cricket==\nAfter struggling to cope with retirement for several years, Old acquired and managed his 'Clipper Fish Restaurant' in [[Praa Sands]], [[Cornwall]], with his second wife Letitia, in 2002.

''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.\n\nZipf's law was originally formulated in terms of [[quantitative linguistics]], stating that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the [[Brown Corpus]].<ref>{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gen\u00e7ay|pages=133\u2013153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

''f''(''k'';&nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.\n\nThe law may also be written:\n\n:<math>f(k;s,N)=\\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}</math>\n\nwhere ''H<sub>N,s</sub>'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].\n\nThe simplest case of Zipf's law is a \"{{sfrac|1|''f''}} function.\" Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur half as often as the first, the third most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|3}} as often as the first, and the ''n''th most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|''n''}} as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.\n\nIn human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.\n\nAs long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 then\n:<math>\\zeta (s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}<\\infty. \\!</math>\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].\n\n==Statistical explanation==\n\n[[File:Zipf 30wiki en labels.png|thumbnail|A plot of the rank versus frequency for the first 10 million words in 30 Wikipedias (dumps from October 2015) in a [[log-log]] scale.]]\n\nAlthough Zipf's Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO'S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF'S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102\u2013108 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref> the reason is still not well understood.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Brillouin]], ''La science et la th\u00e9orie de l'information'', 1959, r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9 en 1988, traduction anglaise r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9e en 2004</ref> However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts.

The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&nbsp; is the total number of the word's occurrences. Most popular words are \"the\", \"of\" and \"and\", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''<sup>0.5</sup>) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'')<sup>2.0</sup>) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]\n\n''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of \"rank data\", in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''<sup>''s''</sup>''\u03b6''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with \"zeta distribution\", since probability distributions are sometimes called \"laws\". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.\n\nA generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f(k;N,q,s)=\\frac{[\\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\\,</math>\n\nThe \"constant\" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].<ref name=Powers1998/>\n\nZipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.<ref name=\"Adamic2000\"/>\n\nThe Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N.

Hence, Zipf law for natural numbers: <math>\\Pr(x) \\approx 1/x</math> is equivalent with number <math>x</math> containing <math>\\log_2(x)</math> bits of information. To add information from a symbol of probability <math>p</math> into information already stored in a natural number <math>x</math>, we should go to <math>x'</math> such that <math>\\log_2(x') \\approx \\log_2(x) + \\log_2(1/p)</math>, or equivalently <math>x' \\approx x/p</math>. For instance, in standard binary system we would have <math>x' = 2x + s</math>, what is optimal for <math>\\Pr(s=0) = \\Pr(s=1) = 1/2</math> probability distribution. Using <math>x' \\approx x/p</math> rule for a general probability distribution is the base of [[Asymmetric Numeral Systems]] family of  [[entropy coding]] methods used in [[data compression]], which state distribution is also governed by Zipf law.\n\nZipf's law also has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |title=Parallel Document Identification using Zipf's Law |last1=Mohammadi |first1=Mehdi |date=2016 |book-title=Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora |pages=21\u201325 |location=Portoro\u017e, Slovenia |conference=LREC 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154706/https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-23 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Brevity law]]\n* [[Heaps' law]]\n* [[Menzerath's law]]\n* [[Bradford's law]]\n* [[Benford's law]]\n* [[Demographic gravitation]]\n* [[Frequency list]]\n* [[Gibrat's law]]\n* [[Hapax legomenon]]\n* [[Lorenz curve]]\n* [[Lotka's law]]\n* [[Pareto distribution]]\n* [[Pareto principle]], a.k.a. the \"80\u201320 rule\"\n* [[Principle of least effort]]\n* [[Price's law]]\n* [[Rank-size distribution]]\n* [[King effect]]\n* [[Stigler's law of eponymy]]\n* [[1% rule (Internet culture)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nPrimary:\n* [[George K.

''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.\n\nZipf's law was originally formulated in terms of [[quantitative linguistics]], stating that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the [[Brown Corpus]].<ref>{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gen\u00e7ay|pages=133\u2013153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

''f''(''k'';&nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.\n\nThe law may also be written:\n\n:<math>f(k;s,N)=\\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}</math>\n\nwhere ''H<sub>N,s</sub>'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].\n\nThe simplest case of Zipf's law is a \"{{sfrac|1|''f''}} function.\" Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur half as often as the first, the third most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|3}} as often as the first, and the ''n''th most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|''n''}} as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.\n\nIn human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.\n\nAs long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 then\n:<math>\\zeta (s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}<\\infty. \\!</math>\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].\n\n==Statistical explanation==\n\n[[File:Zipf 30wiki en labels.png|thumbnail|A plot of the rank versus frequency for the first 10 million words in 30 Wikipedias (dumps from October 2015) in a [[log-log]] scale.]]\n\nAlthough Zipf's Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO'S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF'S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102\u2013108 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref> the reason is still not well understood.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Brillouin]], ''La science et la th\u00e9orie de l'information'', 1959, r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9 en 1988, traduction anglaise r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9e en 2004</ref> However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts.

The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&nbsp; is the total number of the word's occurrences. Most popular words are \"the\", \"of\" and \"and\", as expected.

These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]\n\n''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of \"rank data,\" in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''<sup>''s''</sup>''\u03b6''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with \"zeta distribution,\" since probability distributions are sometimes called \"laws\". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.\n\nA generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f(k;N,q,s)=\\frac{[\\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\\,</math>\n\nThe \"constant\" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].<ref name=Powers1998/>\n\nZipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.<ref name=\"Adamic2000\"/>\n\nThe Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N.

To add information from a symbol of probability <math>p</math> into information already stored in a natural number <math>x</math>, we should go to <math>x'</math> such that <math>\\log_2(x') \\approx \\log_2(x) + \\log_2(1/p)</math>, or equivalently <math>x' \\approx x/p</math>.
