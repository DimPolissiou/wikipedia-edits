Mikan comments he is very good at the most \"pointless things\", like [[crane game|crane]] and festival games (e.g. hoops, catching fish, squirt guns). Along with the numerous useless little things Rito is good at, he is also an accomplished [[florist]], [[gardener]], and [[horticulturalist]].\n\n:Rito is extremely kind, selfless, caring, charismatic, and thoughtful, having a lot of respect for women, though mostly by intention, and not so much by success. Due to his shyness around girls, he is very clumsy around women and has great difficulty maintaining his composure around any sort of stimulating situation, which leads him to always molest or grope the many girls in the series (though mostly unintentionally). Due to the otherworldly circumstances around him, Rito is always put, along with many different girls, in any and each type of awkward, intimate, and embarrassing situations, such as when he and [[#Haruna|Haruna]] were once teleported naked together to the basement of [[#Ryouko|Ryouko]]'s medical clinic because of one of [[#Lala|Lala]]'s faulty inventions,<ref>{{nihongo|\"Those Warped into the Midst of Darkness\"|\u6697\u95c7\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u3046\u3064\u308b\u3082\u306e|\"Kurayami no Naka de Utsuru Mono\"}}</ref> or when Lala used the ''same'' invention to send them naked to the school.<ref>{{nihongo|\"Once More, From Here\"|\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u5ea6\u3053\u3053\u304b\u3089|\"M\u014d ichido koko kara\"}}</ref>\n\n:Even without interference from Lala's inventions, Oshizu's psychic powers, or Celine jumping into his face, Rito is somehow able to trip over absolutely nothing, and possesses an extraordinary skill in accidentally reaching his hands or face into the breasts or other private parts of any girl within reach when he is falling. In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', his clumsiness becomes even more frequent and violating as well as strangely inventive and surreal. He has shown to be able to accomplish difficult feats, such as reaching his hands or various objects into the clothing and undergarments of girls or partially strip off their clothing, and also grab several private parts of several girls all at once, all of which being purely by accident. Ryouko suspects that Rito's frequent godly indecency and unwitting perverted acts manifest because of the way Rito extremely restrained himself with the girls, causing his \"libido\" to accumulate and release in form of accidentally groping girls' bodies and all other perverted stuffs happening so far, calling it the \"Cataplectic Indecency Syndrome\". She also believes that the more he suppresses it, the more extreme and unbelievable the \"accidents\" will be.<ref>{{nihongo|\"Inspection|Inspection\uff5e\u691c\u8a3c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff5e|Inspection -Kensh\u014d shimashou-}}</ref>\n\n:It is only by accident that he encounters Lala, and despite his enduring feelings for Haruna, Rito shows signs of developing deeper affection towards Lala throughout the story but is unsure if what he feels is actually love. At the end of the series, he confesses to Lala, but tells her he also loves Haruna, yet she is happy on both parts. He is confused as polygamy is illegal in Japan where Lala replied that once he is king of the universe the laws of earth no longer apply. By the end of the ''Darkness'' manga, Rito earns Haruna's mutual feelings; in addition to Lala, Run, Yami, and Momo. The ending implies that his love troubles will continue on forever.\n\n====Riko Yusaki====\n;{{nihongo|Riko Yusaki|\u5915\u5d0e \u68a8\u5b50|Y\u016bsaki Riko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Akeno Watanabe]]}}\n:As Riko Yusaki, his female alter-ego, she is a beautiful girl (with a physical appearance resembling a tomboy) who gets much attention from men, such as Motemitsu, the perverted principal, and even [[#Saruyama|Saruyama]], Rito's best friend. Later, Saruyama falls in love with \"Riko-chan\" and asks Lala to invite her for a date; out of pity, she forcefully changes Rito into \"Riko\" so Saruyama can go on a date with Riko. After that Riko only appears for short number of times at rare occasions. Her last appearance was in Chapter 74 of ''Darkness'' manga, when Nemesis changed her gender through boy-girl change kun.\n\n===Lala Satalin Deviluke===\n[[File:Lala Satalin Deviluke.png|150px|thumb|Lala Satalin Deviluke.]]\n;{{nihongo|Lala Satalin Deviluke|\u30e9\u30e9\u30fb\u30b5\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Rara Satarin Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Haruka Tomatsu]]|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:Lala is the first princess of Deviluke, whose family rules the Galaxy. As such, her hand in marriage is sought from across the Galaxy as she is (presumably) the successor to the Galaxy's throne. A rather childish girl, she is somewhat na\u00efve regarding the culture and customs on Earth. Lala initially runs away from home, as she does not wish to marry any of her suitors, and due to an accident, ends up naked in [[#Rito|Rito]]'s bathtub. Upon arriving on Earth, Lala pretends to love Rito to keep herself from getting married, but really does fall in love with him after she misinterprets a statement that Rito shouts that was meant for Haruna.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 2: Great Escape of Love (\u611b\u306e\u5927\u8131\u51fa, Ai no dai dasshutsu)</ref> Although Lala appears to be somewhat airheaded, she is well known on Deviluke for her genius-level intellect and enjoys making all manners of inventions, often prompting some disastrous effect or another.\n\n:Throughout the series, she frequently tries to get Rito to love her, although her grand gestures generally end up putting Rito and company in embarrassing situations. Although Rito frequently chastises her for causing embarrassing and otherwise troublesome incidents, Lala rarely shows any form of negativity towards him and even states it is impossible for her to hate him (The only exception to this is when she gets a disease from another planet causing her to change moods, making her mood change to angry and upon the third day Rito is awakened by Lala in her room, with Lala first stating \"why are you startled by the sight of me?\" and then Lala simply stating, \"Just to let you know, I didn't watch you in your sleep.\" And then stating \"I made a boxed lunch for you, but don't get the wrong idea, I simply made an extra lunch.\" Though some people would look at Lala as a typical tsundere as her actions very resemble much of one.)<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 91: Honest Feelings (\u771f\u3063\u76f4\u3050\u306a\u30ad\u30e2\u30c1, Massugu na kimochi)</ref> Even after finding out that he was in love with [[#Haruna|Haruna]] as well, she instead cheered and stated that they could both marry him.\n\n:Eccentric, playful and intelligent, Lala isn't shy (due to being bathed and dressed by numerous servants while growing up,) to a point where it feels almost natural for her to be in the nude (the only exception of this occurs when Lala catches a personality changing fever from another planet, making her very shy),<ref>To Love Ru Chapter 30: Ladies, Be Modest</ref> although she will cover herself up in front of those she really dislikes such as Lepescu. Like all citizens from Deviluke, Lala's physical abilities vastly exceeds that of a human (in one instance, she manages to blow away a [[typhoon]] just by shouting) and has a distinctive tail with a shape of a spade on the end that can shoot a destructive beam. Oddly, her tail is very sensitive, causing her friends to nickname it her \"weakness\" (all female Devilukeans' tails are more sensitive than a male's) despite being able to throw [[#Ren and Run|Run]] and [[#Saki|Saki]] to a wall while they mess with it. Unfortunately, Lala is bad at cooking. The food she cooks is either inedible or extremely spicy. While the fact that Lala is an alien is initially a secret, it becomes common knowledge relatively soon after her arrival with no one making a big deal about it. According to [[#Ringo|Ringo]], Lala's measurements are B89, W57, H87.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 60: Troublesome, Isn't It? (\u5927\u5909\u3060\u306d\u30a7, Taihen da n\u0113)</ref>\n\n====Peke====\n;{{nihongo|Peke|\u30da\u30b1}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Satomi Arai]], [[Aki Toyosaki]] (''Motto To Love Ru'')|Holly Segarra}}\n:[[#Lala|Lala]]'s all costume robot, who acts as a module to form her clothing. Peke is exceptionally devoted to Lala and has the ability to shapeshift into any kind of clothing for her to wear, but this also drains her power supply. She can also scan the clothing of people around her and duplicate those clothes. As her batteries run out, the clothing Lala wears will slowly dissolve, until it completely disappears. To recharge, Peke simply needs to sleep. Using a dress-form program, Peke has the ability to take on a human form, with the appearance of a young girl.\n\n===Haruna Sairenji===\n[[File:Haruna.png|150px|thumb|Haruna Sairenji.]]\n;{{nihongo|Haruna Sairenji|\u897f\u9023\u5bfa \u6625\u83dc|Sairenji Haruna}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayuri Yahagi]]|[[Bryn Apprill]]}}\n:One of [[#Rito|Rito]]'s classmates and the girl of his affections; Haruna has similar feelings for him, having been attracted to his kind, gentle nature since junior high. Despite her growing love for Rito, which she believes to be unrequited, she usually suppresses her feelings and cannot confess to him because of her friendship with [[#Lala|Lala]], who also loves Rito. However, with some encouragement, she tells Lala of her ordeal, to which Lala accepts, claiming Haruna as her rival for Rito's heart, while remaining friends.\n\n:She lives with her older sister in an apartment and has a severe fear of ghosts and the supernatural, the exception being [[#Oshizu|Oshizu]], to an extent. When frightened, she has a habit of grabbing the nearest thing around her \u2013 typically Rito \u2013 and swinging wildly, in an attempt to get rid of whatever frightens her. There is also a running gag to where Rito is about to confess to her, only for something (or someone) to come between it. A highly responsible person, Haruna's personality can sway her classmates' hearts to vote for her as their class representative, even when she did not run to be a candidate. She is affiliated with the tennis club and a [[southpaw]]. According to [[#Risa and Mio|Mio]], Haruna's measurements are B78, W55, H80.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">To Love-Ru Episode 22: Shudder! The Culture Festival (\u6226\u6144!\u6587\u5316\u796d, Senritsu! Bunkasai)</ref>\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Haruna's role in the manga is reduced, due to her being based on series artist Kentaro Yabuki's ex-wife, who has awarded the rights to the character in their divorce; she still frequently appears, despite this. In ''Darkness'', Haruna seems to have grown into a covert pervert, as she is usually seen fantasizing about Rito in secret, such as him bathing her or wearing nothing but a apron to seduce him. It appears that Rito has yet to properly confess his feelings to Haruna, despite Lala pressuring him to do so and the fact he can have multiple wives if he became the King. This due to the fact he still has a [[monogamy]] viewpoint. When Rito and Haruna had been shrunk by Lala's inventions, they kiss each other (by accident). Overhearing Rito's denial of Nemesis' harem proclamation as student council president, Haruna defends him from the mob and, while hiding in a gym storage, she finally spoken her love to him, which he returns them; she is the third female character to confess her love to Rito. In the end, as Rito decides not to go forward on this, Haruna accepts and decides to wait for his answer.\n\n===Mikan Yuki===\n;{{nihongo|Mikan Yuki|\u7d50\u57ce \u7f8e\u67d1|Y\u016bki Mikan}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}\n:Rito's independent and reliable 12-year-old sister, Mikan takes care of the housework while their parents are away on business and watches after [[#Celine|Celine]]. In contrast to her brother, she is very mature and does not hesitate to tease him, going as far as stating they aren't blood-related, but quickly retracting the statement, playing it off as a lie. Mikan also seems to have a certain lack of respect for Rito because of this (she hardly ever addresses him by his honorific as an older brother), but does refer to him as \"Onii-chan\" as thanks for trying so hard to take care of her when she develops a fever<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 104: Siblings (\u5144\u59b9, Ky\u014ddai)</ref> and when he gives her a Christmas present.\n\n:Mikan may not show it, but she cares very deeply for Rito and misses his company, to the point one could suspect her of having a brother complex. This is more evident in the second OVA where she wonders if he would marry her if they were not blood related, and in the manga where she blushes every time another character mentions her brother, and also in the 5th OVA where after being hit by the pollen she tries to molest him while affectionately calling him \"Onii-chan\". Her brother complex may be the reason she rarely calls Rito \"Onii-chan\"; less a lack of respect and more a sign of her wish that their relationship was something other than that of a brother and sister. She also states how she and Rito used to play together before Lala entered their lives.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 73: Bad Mood? Good Mood? (\u4e0d\u6a5f\u5acc?\u3054\u6a5f\u5acc?, Fukigen? Gokigen?)</ref> It is later revealed that Mikan is terrified of thunder and lightning (and that Rito would always comfort her).\n\n:Mikan grows quite attached to [[#Golden Darkness|Golden Darkness]], perhaps due to Darkness seemingly being the same age as her. Mikan is very perceptive and seems to be able to read people's emotions, even their reactions, most of which is Rito's obvious anxiety around [[#Haruna|Haruna]] and [[#Yui|Yui]]'s subtle feelings for him. Mikan even calls him a \"playboy\" (as does [[#Nana|Nana]]) for attracting so many girls all of a sudden. Mikan, however, does respect Rito's relationship with [[#Lala|Lala]], even going so far as to tell [[#Momo|Momo]] not to get too close to Rito for Lala's sake, although it is fairly obvious that she could have done this out of jealousy from how close Momo was getting to Rito.\n\n===Golden Darkness===\n;{{nihongo|Golden Darkness|\u91d1\u8272\u306e\u95c7|Konjiki no Yami}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Misato Fukuen]]|Katelyn Barr}}\n:A dispassionate, withdrawn [[assassination|assassin]], Golden Darkness was hired by one of [[List of To Love Ru characters#Lala Satalin Deviluke|Lala Satalin Deviluke]]'s prospective suitors, [[List of To Love Ru characters#Lacospo|Lacospo]], to kill Lala's fianc\u00e9 [[List of To Love Ru characters#Rito Yuki|Rito Yuki]]. She breaks the contract after noting Rito's true nature. Golden Darkness came to Earth on the Lunatique, a very fast ship (it can travel 30 million light-years in 2 hours). Golden Darkness has decided to stay on Earth, where she roams the streets of {{nihongo|Sainan Town|\u5f69\u5357\u753a|Sainan machi}}, purportedly to continue her mission to assassinate Rito, although she has yet to accomplish this despite numerous opportunities, hinting that she says this as an excuse to stay on Earth, which is then confirmed.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 138: {{nihongo|\"Happening Weather\"|\u30cf\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u65e5\u548c|\"Hapuningu Biyori\"}}</ref> Commonly referred as \"'''Yami'''\", she spends much of her time reading books and magazines, while eating [[taiyaki]] (it is the only thing she eats since it is the first food offered to her by Rito).<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 76: {{nihongo|\"Sleepover party\"|\u304a\u6cca\u308a\u4f1a|Otomari kai}}</ref> By her planet's calculations, she is 24 years old, despite having the appearance of a 14-year-old (her Trans ability has slowed her aging process), although this is only mentioned in the anime.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> She has also a weakness to anything slimy.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 58: {{nihongo|\"An Unexpected End\"|\u610f\u5916\u306a\u7d50\u672b|Igai na ketsumatsu}}</ref>\n\n:Like Lala, Golden Darkness' physical abilities are exponentially stronger than a human's. She states she hates \"[[ecchi]]\" people, and does not hesitate to assault a person who looks at her in an obscene way. She does though hate when people are free of her as shown in the anime as she beats Rito up after being told by Rito that he's free of her. She's capable of spinning people away if she's caught by someone's with a strong grip. She has become close to Rito's younger sister [[List of To Love Ru characters#Mikan Yuki|Mikan Yuki]] and seems to keep an eye out for her, evident when she and Mikan switched bodies and the [[List of To Love Ru characters#Principal|Principal]] attempted to grope her, prompting Golden Darkness (in Mikan's body) to warn him not to touch Mikan and deliver a savage beating. Though she always says she will kill Rito one day, it is becoming increasingly doubtful that she will ever do it. In fact, she seems to have begun to develop feelings for Rito. Instead of beating him and saying \"I hate ecchi people\" like she normally does, she blushes when Rito sees her in a swimsuit and states \"Don't look at me with those ecchi eyes\". This is also proven further when Golden Darkness nearly tells Rito that he can \"embrace\" her.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 159: {{nihongo|\"Summer Memories\"|\u590f\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa|Natsu no Omoide}}</ref>\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', after some convincing from Mikan, she enrolls in the {{nihongo|Sainan High|\u5f69\u5357\u9ad8\u6821}} school and becomes a classmate of the main cast. Mikan is also giving her cooking lessons. Despite her normal stoic appearance, it is obvious that she does care for Rito, and is shown to be developing further feelings for him, although not enough to forgo the occasional beating when he becomes \"Ecchi\". Her new life may already be in jeopardy when [[List of To Love Ru characters#Mea Kurosaki|Mea Kurosaki]], a fellow classmate, is revealed to be her 'little sister', suggesting that she will have to return to space and fulfill her contract to kill Rito. It is revealed that Golden Darkness's creator is the Sainan High teacher [[List of To Love Ru characters#Tearju Lunatique|Tearju Lunatique]],<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 149: {{nihongo|\"The Smiling Cat\"|\u5fae\u7b11\u3080\u30cd\u30b3|Hohoemu Neko}}</ref> and that her given name is \"'''Eve'''\".<ref>''To Love-Ru Darkness'' Chapter 14: {{nihongo|\"Past\"|Past \uff5e \u660e\u65e5\u306b\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u8a18\u61b6 \uff5e|\"Past - Ashita ni tsunagaru kioku -\"}}</ref> When Golden Darkness' former rival [[List of To Love Ru characters#Azenda|Azenda]] hires the alien [[hitman]] [[List of To Love-Ru characters#Kuro|Kuro]] to kill Rito, she rescues him from Kuro before she confesses her love to him, making her the second female heroine to convey to Rito.\n\n:She is based on [[List of Black Cat characters#Eve|Eve]] from ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]'', as they both look the same and can turn any part of their bodies into a weapon; they are even voiced by the same actress Misato Fukuen in their respective animes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Misato Fukuen's Voice Works|url=http://www.usagi.org/doi/seiyuu/fukuen-misato/roles-anime.html}}</ref> Also, there's a chapter in ''To Love Ru'' in which Golden Darkness tries on a black dress similar to the one that Eve wears in the final chapters of ''Black Cat''.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 61: {{nihongo|Yami-yami Fashion|\u30e4\u30df\u30e4\u30df\u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|Yami-yami Fasshon}}</ref>\n\n:[[Kentaro Yabuki]] initially illustrated ''Black Cat'' between 2000-2004, then assisted Saki Hasemi with his manga project ''To Love Ru''. They agreed that a character featured in ''To Love Ru'' would be based on one of the protagonists in ''Black Cat'', which ended up being Eve. Her character was recognized for being extremely similar to Eve and is currently one of the most popular characters in the series. Fans also debate whether she could have her own series.<ref name=\"Yami Character Profile\">{{cite web|title=Yami Character Profile Official Site|url=http://www.j-toloveru.com/character/yami.html|publisher=Shueisha|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Motto-To Love-Ru\">{{cite web|title=Motto To Love-Ru|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/motto-to-love-ru-trouble/sub.dvd-complete-collection|publisher=animenewsnetwork|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Yui Kotegawa===\n;{{nihongo|Yui Kotegawa|\u53e4\u624b\u5ddd \u552f|Kotegawa Yui}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kaori Nazuka]]|[[Amber Lee Connors]]}}\n:An uptight, high-strung girl placed in [[#Rito|Rito]]'s class during the second year, Yui Kotegawa has little to no tolerance for anything she does not consider to be \"acceptable behavior\", and in the face of any kind of \"shameless\" act, Yui reacts by saying her trademark phrase: \"How shameless!\"; ironically, despite this, she secretly desire for Rito to do them to her, which is proved during one of Rito's \"accidents\", when she offered herself to him on the condition that he would only ever do it with her, and even stating: \"You're the only one who can do naughty things to me.\" Her haughty opinions, quick temper, and habit of speaking her mind often results in her vocally reprimanding classmates.\n\n:Yui quickly grows annoyed and disgusted by eccentricities and bizarre actions, particularly with regards to Rito and [[#Lala|Lala]]. Unfortunately, almost every encounter with Rito usually ends up with her embarrassed, naked or groped (or all three), and although her nature prevents her from easing her behavior, she does slowly warm up to his usual antics. After Rito saves Yui from a group of delinquents, she develops feelings for Rito, although her inexperience with boys leaves her unable to understand her feelings and is continually in self-denial about them. And when Rito usually asks what's wrong, she says the exact opposite of what she wants to say and then hurts him in some way (a typical [[tsundere]]). In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Yui seems to have adopted Rito's clumsiness, which makes her fall onto him, pull his pants down and plant her face right in his groin.\n\n:A common gag is that some characters cannot remember Kotegawa's family name (calling her \"Kokegawa\" for example), presumably due to the fact she is generally an unwilling participant in Lala's frequent schemes. After Celine takes on her human like form, she becomes very close to Yui, even being seen as a daughter like figure in Yui's daydreams of her and Rito being married together. Also, she really likes cats \u2013 owning cat based books, having a stuffed cat, decorating her room with cat shaped things,  shaping her chocolate into a cat's face, and even having a cat-themed floaty, something Rito seems to find cute about her. According to [[#Risa and Mio|Mio]], her measurements are B88, W59, H87.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Nana Astar Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo|Nana Astar Deviluke|\u30ca\u30ca\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30bf\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Nana Asuta Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kanae It\u014d]]}}\n:Nana and Momo are [[#Lala|Lala]]'s younger sisters and they are also twins.

They used to live with Zastin and his cohorts, but found it too cramped and uncomfortable. To get around this and to spend more time with their big sister, they created a pocket dimension in Rito's house (it is said to be bigger than Rito's house) to live in. Like her sisters, she has a cell phone capable of transporting objects. However, instead of gadgets, Nana summons animals.\n\n:Nana has long hair, a single visible sharp tooth and unlike her sisters, a flat chest, which is used as a recurring gag throughout the manga. She is quite jealous of [[#Momo|Momo]]'s chest. She understands and can talk to animals. At some point of the series To Love Ru OVA 5, Nana develops small feelings for [[#Rito|Rito]], after he saved her from Momo's plant friends. And she manages to get the courage to sleep with Rito in his bedroom while he is sleeping, but actually sees Lala and Momo sleeping with him.  Nana is so far the only character to question why so many girls fall in love with Rito, yet it is clear that she has growing feelings for him as well.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Nana becomes a Sainan High student at Momo's urging. Nana manages to get a new friend named [[#Mea|Mea]]. When she found out Mea was a weapon like Yami and that she wanted to stop \"playing\" friends, she became depressed and confused in the 3rd episode of ''To Love Ru Darkness 2nd''. After being encouraged by Rito, Nana met up with Mea again and made up when Nana said she doesn't care if Mea is a weapon or anything, she just wants to be with her and be friends. Shortly after Nana's feelings for Rito grew and tried to sneak into his bed a second time, but found out Momo was already there.\n\n===Momo Belia Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo|Momo Belia Deviluke|\u30e2\u30e2\u30fb\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Momo Beria Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Aki Toyosaki]]}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.j-toloveru.com/staff.html | title=ToLOVE\u308b \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5&\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 (ToLove-Ru Staff & Cast) | work=toloveru.com | accessdate=October 13, 2011 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015148/http://www.j-toloveru.com/staff.html | archive-date=July 11, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n:Momo has short hair and is generally sweeter than her twin, but develops a bad attitude whenever [[#Nana|Nana]] takes credit for what she does. What gadgets are to Lala and animals are to Nana, plants are to Momo; she has a special connection with them that allows her to manipulate plants at will.\n\n:She immediately falls in love with [[#Rito|Rito]] and has a strong attraction towards him (similar to [[#Lala|Lala]]'s, but with a more lustful desire), stating how his facial expressions are lovely, letting him touch her tail, and even becoming more aroused when Nana refers to him as a \"beast\". At times, she would even sneak into Rito's bed at night, but when asked why she does that, she simply replies that she is sometimes half asleep and unintentionally ends up in Rito's bed. At one time, she nearly stated how jealous she was of Lala that Rito's hand was stuck to her tail. Her tail is also able to shoot out lightning. As her attraction to Rito grows, so does her protectiveness of him, as she will physically threaten other characters (such as Mea) with violence if she attempts to harm Rito.<ref>to-LOVE ru chapter 160 page 13</ref> Like her sisters, she has a cell phone capable of transporting objects. However, instead of gadgets, Momo summons plants.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Momo takes over the role of the main female protagonist alongside Golden Darkness. Wanting Rito's love, but unwilling to cause conflict between her sister or Haruna, Momo realises if Rito becomes the next king of Deviluke, Earth laws will not apply to him, allowing him to create a harem where she can display her affections openly. Momo along with her sister become Sainan High's students, where Momo takes it upon herself to try to bring out the \"carnivore\" in Rito, which basically means his sex drive so he will take it upon himself to want to create a harem with all of the female cast. In the final chapter, Momo decides to be true to herself. She is the fourth and last heroine to confess her love to Rito.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n===Risa & Mio===\n;{{nihongo|Risa Momioka|\u7c7e\u5ca1 \u91cc\u7d17|Momioka Risa}} & {{nihongo|Mio Sawada|\u6ca2\u7530 \u672a\u592e|Sawada Mio}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ryoka Yuzuki]] (Risa) and [[Chiemi Chiba]] (Mio)|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actress)|Margaret McDonald]] (Risa) and [[Juliet Simmons]] (Mio)}}\n:The mischievous, yet cheerful, best friends of [[#Haruna|Haruna]], Risa and Mio are a pair of inseparable girls, spending as much time as they can with her and [[#Lala|Lala]], and whenever the latter inquires about Earth`s culture and habits, they divulge as much information as they can for (although it is often misleading and perverted). Risa and Mio are known for their playful habit of groping the breasts of other girls and whispering naughty things into their ears to tease them, with Haruna as their most recurring victim; they like to do this with her mainly in front of Rito, in addition to also teasing Haruna about her feelings for him. While Mio enjoys [[cosplay]] and works part-time at a [[maid caf\u00e9]] (to where Risa is always going to, as well), Risa is member of Sainan High's [[tennis]] club like Haruna, but she mostly skips it to do other things.\n\n===Run & Ren===\n;{{nihongo|Run & Ren Elise Jewelria|\u30eb\u30f3&\u30ec\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30eb\u30b7\u30fb\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2|Run & Ren Erishe Jueria}}\n:{{anime voices|Fuyuka \u014cura (both)|[[Greg Ayres]] (Ren) and [[Christina Kelly]] (Run)}}\n:A childhood friend of [[#Lala|Lala]], Ren is infamously known for wearing girls clothing during his play dates with Lala when he was a child. He arrives on Earth to win Lala by proving he is \"man enough\" for her, but becomes jealous of her relationship with [[#Rito|Rito]]. Due to his pursuit of her, he accidentally gives Rito his first kiss.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 23: Scramble For The Lips (\u5507\u4e89\u596a\u6226, Kuchibiru s\u014ddatsusen)</ref> While Ren is furious, it has an unexpected consequence towards his \"[[alter ego]]\". As Ren is from planet {{nihongo|Memorze|\u30e1\u30e2\u30eb\u30bc|Memoruze}}, he can change gender in mind and body upon triggering a specific stimulus. In his case, a sneeze. As a girl, '''{{nihongo|Run|\u30eb\u30f3|Run}}''' is in love with Rito, due to the kiss, and blames Lala for her misfortunes, while Ren is still in competition, albeit one-sided, with Rito for Lala's hand in marriage.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 42: Confession (\u544a\u767d, Kokuhaku)</ref>\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Run and Ren permanently separate into two different beings upon reaching adulthood, with Run confessing her love to Rito right after this happens. Currently, Run is a famous [[Japanese idol|idol]], having released several albums, some along with [[#Kyouko|Kyouko]], with whom she befriended after Run has played an antagonist on her show.\n\n:In the anime, while Ren appears a few times, Run is the dominant personality of the two, who is more serious about her feelings towards Rito to the point of stalking him, even taking a simple misunderstanding from him into her believing all men are never serious about her feelings. In the manga, Ren appears at first as the main personality. However, later on Run becomes the dominant personality (like in the anime) with Ren usually showing up for comedic effect, or when Ren does show up he inevitably changes into Run. In To Love Ru Troubles, it is revealed they are able to communicate with each other.\n\n===Saki Tenjouin===\n;{{nihongo|Saki Tenjouin|\u5929\u6761\u9662 \u6c99\u59eb|Tenj\u014din Saki}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]|[[Maggie Flecknoe]]}}\n:The self-proclaimed \"[[Queen bee (sociology)#Schools|queen bee]]\" of Sainan High, Saki is a pretty, popular, and rich girl who believes herself to be [[#Lala|Lala]]'s rival (who is totally oblivious to Saki's animosity towards her and, ironically, thinks of Saki as a good friend of hers). Due to Lala being considered prettier than her and, thus, getting more attention from the people, Saki, stating there can only be one \"queen\" in Sainan High, consistently tries to one-up her,  going through any possible means to prove that she is better than Lala, even though her plans usually backfire and she ends up embarrassing herself in many different ways; the most frequent result is she getting naked in front of a crowd.<ref>To Love-Ru Episode 5: The Queen's Challenge (\u304f\u3044\u30fc\u3093\u306e\u6311\u6226\u72b6, Ku\u012bn no Ch\u014dsenj\u014d)</ref>\n\n:Saki is one of the few female characters who doesn't feel any romantic feeling toward [[#Rito|Rito]] (the only exception being when she was infected by Celine's pollen and briefly fell in love with him), and it's very likely she will not end up as part of his harem, even though most of her appearances seem to only serve the purpose of being a victim to the perverted mishaps that surround him. In the anime, however, she occasionally tries to seduce Rito in order to make Lala jealous (despite not loving him). Instead of Rito, Saki has a crush on [[#Zastin|Zastin]], which left her horrified to discover that he, by chance, is the personal bodyguard of Lala, but this made her even more determined to win his heart at any cost.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 80: Master of Love (\u604b\u611b\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc, Ren'ai MASUT\u0100)</ref>\n\n===Ryouko Mikado===\n;{{nihongo|Ryouko Mikado|\u5fa1\u9580 \u6dbc\u5b50|Mikado Ry\u014dko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Masako Joh]] (2008\u201312), [[Harumi Sakurai]] (2012\u201317)|Marissa Lenti}}\n:The provocative school doctor at Sainan High, Ryouko helps out other extraterrestrials on Earth in various ways, usually dealing with medical care, although she does offer her human students a variety of her own concoctions as well. Formerly an operative for a shadowy, [[black market]] extraterrestrial organization bent on overthrowing Emperor [[#Gid|Gid]], she fled to Earth in hopes of hiding from her superiors. Evidence of her non-human origins are the [[elf|elf-like]] ears hidden by her short hair - her species has not yet been specified. Furthermore, she seems to be smitten with [[#Rito|Rito]], as shown when she asks him to rub oil on her.\n\n===Shizu Murasame===\n;{{nihongo|Shizu Murasame|\u6751\u96e8 \u9759|Murasame Shizu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mamiko Noto]]|Melissa Molano}}\n:The ghost of a girl who died 400 years ago,<ref>{{cite web|title=To Love-Ru 4koma, chapter 8: Ignorance is Bliss|url=http://imgur.com/mjFLavb|publisher=Jump Live|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> Shizu is sincere, kind, and very curious about the modern world, but has a severe [[Cynophobia|fear of dogs]], likened to [[#Haruna|Haruna]]'s level of fear to the supernatural. She is usually addressed as {{nihongo|\"Oshizu\"|\u304a\u9759}}; the {{nihongo|O|\u304a}} is [[Honorific speech in Japanese#Female names|an honorific used to refer to women]]. When frightened, she can emit blasts of mental stress, blowing apart various objects and surroundings, but is also capable of manipulating others through sheer willpower.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 113: Beach Girls\u2661 (\u30d3\u30fc\u30c1\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba\u2661, B\u012aCHI G\u01cdRUZU\u2661)</ref> A related gag is the blasts of stress frequently rip apart clothing, resulting in Rito being in an awkward situation with one of the female cast. Since her meeting with [[#Rito|Rito]] and the others, she begins exploring the world outside the old school building. Oshizu is aware of Haruna's crush on Rito by her ability to sense feelings while possessing another person and becomes very supportive towards cheering Haruna into confessing her feelings to him.\n\n:Oshizu \"returns\" to the living after [[#Ryouko|Ryouko]] creates a prosthetic body for her to inhabit, built with biological qualities (looking and feeling like an actual human body). However, she occasionally \"disconnects\" her spirit from the body during brief moments of excitement. She currently lives with Ryouko and works as a nurse at her clinic to pay her back for the body, and also to remain close for Ryouko to maintain her physical body. In the first anime, Oshizu is not given a new body and her presence is limited, while she has her prosthetic body as she does in the manga for the OVA releases and the new anime.\n\n===Mea Kurosaki===\n;{{nihongo|Mea Kurosaki|\u9ed2\u54b2 \u82bd\u4e9c(\u30e1\u30a2)|Kurosaki Mea}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yuka Iguchi]]}}\n:The first-year schoolgirl appears in 1st chapter of ''To Love Ru Darkness''. She is the classmate of [[#Nana and Momo|Nana and Momo]] when they two transfer to Sainan High. Nana becomes her friend after talking to Mea about Nana's ability to understand animals' language. At the end of the second chapter of ''Darkness'', Mea reveals to Yami that she is Yami's little sister, and possess similar powers. Mea desires for Yami to kill Rito and return to her life as an assassin instead of living a normal life on Earth. Her [[#Nemesis|master]] calls her '''{{nihongo||\u30e1\u30a2|Mea}}''' (''[[katakana]]'') instead of {{nihongo||\u82bd\u4e9c|Mea}} (''[[kanji]]''). After chapter 7, it appears she is starting to develop sexual feelings for Rito, and start seeing other people as friends. After Nana found out Mea was a weapon, she told her she was \"playing\" friends with her. However, Nana made up with her and became friends again. As Nemesis possesses Mea's body to witness Yami's ecchi-Darkness Mode, Mea managed to overcome her and break ties with Nemesis. From then on, Mea participates in Rito's harem though still cares for Nemesis.\n\n===Nemesis===\n;{{nihongo|Nemesis|\u30cd\u30e1\u30b7\u30b9|Nemeshisu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Rina Hidaka]]}}\n:The primary antagonist of ''To Love Ru Darkness'' and [[#Mea|Mea]]'s boss, who is behind the plan to make [[#Yami|Yami]] return to the assassins' world. She has long black hair, golden eyes, a small yet slender body, and dark skin. She has a similar appearance to Mikan and possesses the same transformation ability as Yami and Mea. It is shown that Nemesis has a bit of a sexual interest in Rito. [[#Momo|Momo]] has an antagonistic personality toward her. It is then noticed by Mea in the anime of ''To Love Ru Darkness'' that if Yami were to join Momo's harem this would force nemesis to join as well thus giving Momo an advantage.\n\n:She knows that Yami possesses a destructive weapon called \"Darkness\" which, according to Tearju, is supposedly a forbidden transformation of hers. In the major battle between Nemesis and a fully reformed Gid Lucion Deviluke, Nemesis is fatally injured which would literally make her vanish until Rito takes pity on her and allows her to inhabit his body for the time-being to recover, much to Momo's chagrin. After reaching full recovery, Nemesis comes to fully understand Rito's well-being and forces application for Sainan High's new student council president to improve Rito's harem.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Kenichi Saruyama===\n;{{nihongo|Kenichi Saruyama|\u733f\u5c71 \u5065\u4e00|Saruyama Ken'ichi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|Greg Cote}}\n:The perverted best friend of [[#Rito|Rito]], Kenichi has known him since junior high and is more open and obvious of his obsession with girls and is one of the few male characters Rito can talk to about his situations involving [[#Haruna|Haruna]] or [[#Lala|Lala]]. He is aware of Rito's feelings for Haruna and consistently advises he get together with her. Recently, Kenichi reveals his crush on a girl named [[#Riko|Riko]], but does not realize she is actually Rito, who is accidentally transformed into a girl by one of Lala's bizarre inventions.\n\n===Zastin===\n;{{nihongo|Zastin|\u30b6\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3|Zasutin}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Takehito Koyasu]]|Scott Gibbs}}\n:[[#Lala|Lala]]'s personal bodyguard and the best swordsman on Deviluke. Despite his skill with the sword, Zastin has a horrible sense of direction, resulting in him getting lost (one of the [[running gag]]s in ''To Love Ru''). He also seems to have extremely bad luck, where he keeps getting run over by trains and cars. Initially, Zastin disapproves of [[#Rito|Rito]], deeming him weak and subsequently seeks to test his strength. However, once Rito exclaims his opinion of marriage in self-defense, Zastin is swayed by his words (though not in the way Rito intends) and summarily approves of him, believing he truly understands Lala's feelings.\n\n:He is currently working as the assistant chief to [[#Saibai|Saibai]]; the funds he gets for his duties are handed to Lala for her use. Zastin has shown a keen interest in becoming a manga artist, professionally. He has two assistants that work under him, simply known as [[#Maul and Smutts|Maul and Smutts]]. Zastin's tail is thin and very scorpion-like in appearance.\n\n===Rin Kujou===\n;{{nihongo|Rin Kujou|\u4e5d\u6761 \u51db|Kuj\u014d Rin}}\n:{{anime voices|Mai Hashimoto|Chaney Moore}}\n:Being one of [[#Saki|Saki]]'s closest friends, Rin is hardly ever seen without accompanying her and/or [[#Ayako|Aya]]. Rin is skilled in the [[kendo]] arts and has been the bodyguard of Saki for years, as her family has always served the Tenjouin household in this position. She is also the only person who has been able to take down Lala in one strike by throwing a vibrating bracelet onto Lala's tail incapacitating her.\n\n:While Rin is usually calm and composed, and perhaps one of the most mature character in the series, she is also loyal, caring, and protective to Saki, being very dutiful to her job as bodyguard. These made her conflicted when Saki once ran away from home, and Rin was ordered to bring her back, even by force. But after Saki managed to settle things with her family, she and Rin were able to remain friends.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Rin's role in the manga is increased as she start to develop romantic feelings for Rito after he saves her from a cursed sword (with the help of Mea and Yami); Saki is completely supportive of her feelings for him, as she, frequently, sets up dates between Rin and Rito.\n\n===Ayako Fujisaki===\n;{{nihongo|Ayako Fujisaki|\u85e4\u5d0e \u7dbe|Fujisaki Ayako}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kaori Mizuhashi]]|Olivia Swasey}}\n:The bespectacled Ayako \"Aya\" Fujisaki is weak-willed and became associated with Saki after she and Rin protected her from bullies when they were kids. So far, Aya has served little purpose throughout the series besides following and supporting Saki, whom she idolizes. She is essentially something of an extra to their group, and has never been seen without accompanying Rin and Saki.\n\n:The most known aspect of Aya's personality is her adoration of Saki, whom she looks up to and cares for the most in her life. She is also one of the few girls who don't have any romantic feelings towards Rito; most, if not all, of her admiration goes to Saki, and she naturally hates Rito's perverted accidents, especially if it's towards her, Rin, and, most of all, Saki.\n\n===Celine===\n;{{nihongo|Celine|\u30bb\u30ea\u30fc\u30cc|''Ser\u012bnu''}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ryoka Yuzuki]]}}\n:[[#Lala|Lala]]'s gift for [[#Rito|Rito]]'s 16th birthday, Celine is initially a multi-story, [[carnivore|carnivorous]], sentient [[sunflower]] kept in the Yuki's residence backyard. Although seemingly monstrous, Rito cares for Celine deeply, referring to her as his family. The plant has traits in common with humans: perspiring when the climate is humid, wearing a scarf during a chilly weather and eating [[ramen]] when hungry (although Celine still needs the basic nutrients of water and sunlight as well). When Celine seemingly contracts a deadly disease, Kare Kare, Rito is fully dedicated to saving her and finding the only known antidote, the luckberry. With his friends they journey to the S-level-danger class planet of Misletoe to obtain the antidote, only to return and find Celine all dried up. In reality, she was [[germination|germinating]] and Celine burst out from her single [[seed]], taking the appearance of an infant girl, with a flower on her head. This event shocks even [[#Momo|Momo]], who is very knowledgeable about the galaxy's [[flora]], stating that even with all of her knowledge there is still much about Celine's biological makeup that is a complete mystery to her.\n\n:Referring to Rito as her \"mama\", the infant Celine gets drunk when she drinks [[cola]] at which time she sprays [[pollen]] from the flower on her head that temporarily causes anyone who inhales it to fall in love with Rito (a side-effect that originates from Celine's own affection for him from taking care of her every day). Celine has a tendency to jump onto someone out of nowhere or playfully tackle any passing girl and attempting to [[breast feed]]. In episode 5 of ''To Love Ru Darkness'' ova, Celine takes the form of a fully grown adult woman on a full moon and is able to talk instead of saying the usual \"mau\", but returns to normal in her infant form upon morning.  Comically mistaken as being Rito's daughter, Celine makes guest star appearances in the OVA adaptation (as a plant near the end of OVA 4 and as an infant in OVA 6 part 3) and becomes a regular character with her infant form in the new anime series.\n\n===Kyouko Kirisaki===\n;{{nihongo|Kyouko Kirisaki|\u9727\u5d0e \u606d\u5b50|Kirisaki Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Chiemi Chiba]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}\n:A half-alien girl, Ky\u014dko is a famous idol who has the ability to create and throw fire at will and becomes friends with [[#Ren and Run|Run]] when Run portrays an [[antagonist]] on her show. She is best known for her role as '''Magical Ky\u014dko''', a fictional [[magical girl]] character who stars in her own television series which [[#Lala|Lala]] loves watching, often forcing [[#Rito|Rito]] to watch it with her. She is present when Run asks Rito to be her date, and is able to tell they aren't dating though wishes Run luck on getting him. Ever since their first meeting on her show, Ky\u014dko and Run have done many projects together, including debuting many songs together.\n\n:When Rito and his friends are given invitations to an RPG world Lala had partially created, an image of Kyouko is programmed into the game. However, Ky\u014dko's programming within the game is modified by [[#Nana and Momo|Nana and Momo]], turning her into the \"Demon King\", tasked with seeking out Rito and offering him a way to send him and his friends home if he leaves Lala and promises to become her boyfriend. Adding to Rito's anxiety, Demon King Ky\u014dko threatens to destroy Rito and his friends if he does not state his feelings for Lala. In comedic fashion, the otherwise unbeatable Ky\u014dko is destroyed by a watering can that only Rito can use. Although she doesn't seem to be interested in Rito at first there do seem to be signs of her being fond of him after a few interesting situations arise. This becomes more evident after he saves her when she visited his school (to the extent of referring to Rito as a \"prince\" when he \"princess-carries\" her).\n\n:Kyouko is based upon the [[List of Black Cat characters#Kyoko Kirisaki|character of the same name]] from ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]''. Kyouko also appears in a television in \"Black Cat\".\n\n===Tearju Lunatique===\n;{{nihongo|Tearju Lunatique|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u30e6 \u30eb\u30ca\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af|Ti\u0101yu Runat\u012bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Misato Fukuen]]}}\n:The woman who created Golden Darkness using of her own DNA, therefore the two look almost identical although each has her own distinguishing features. She raised Yami as her own daughter and, after finding out the organization wanted to turn Yami into a weapon, was almost killed while rescuing Yami and then fleeing for life.\n\n:Well-endowed and beautiful, she quickly becomes the object of attention of the male students of the school who consider her clumsiness (on a par with Rito's, according to Oshizu) as rather cute. Unlike others, she calls Yami \"Eve\". She is also an old classmate of [[#Ryouko Mikado|Ryouko Mikado]], and was brought to Earth by her to reunited with Yami.\n\n:As with her creation, Tearju is based upon the [[List of Black Cat characters#Tearju Lunatique|character of the same name]] from ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]'', who has a similar role to that of Tearju in ''To Love Ru''.\n\n===Azenda===\n;{{nihongo|Azenda|\u30a2\u30bc\u30f3\u30c0|Azenda}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Risa Hayamizu]]}}\n:[[#Yami|Yami]]'s former opponent.

Saibai draws at amazing speeds and can be utterly serious before deadlines are met, but seems to have a bit of a goofy side, such as making a joke about Rito and [[#Lala|Lala]] \"sleeping\" together every night and punching Rito when he got drunk and mistook his son for a burglar. With the help of Lala he returns for the Christmas party, stating how much [[#Zastin|Zastin]] and his workers have grown since starting out. In the anime, he writes a (not-so-encouraging) letter to him at the end of the first season.\n\n===Ringo Yuki===\n;{{nihongo|Ringo Yuki|\u7d50\u57ce \u6797\u6a8e|Y\u016bki Ringo}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayaka Ohara]]}}\n:Rito's mother is a fashion designer and a scout for fashion models. Normally working overseas, she returns home to check up on the family. Despite initially appearing to be refined and chic, Ringo's personality is equally as odd as [[#Saibai|Saibai]]'s, where she has a tendency to start sizing women up with her hands, whenever she spots pretty girls. Ringo seems to take her work very seriously, having immediately entered \"work-mode\", when she meets [[#Lala|Lala]] and [[#Haruna|Haruna]] for the first time.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 60. Troublesome, Isn't It? (\u5927\u5909\u3060\u306d\u30a7, Taihen da n\u0113)</ref> Like her daughter, Ringo is also highly perceptive, able to read Haruna's feelings towards Rito. With the help of Lala, she returns for the Christmas party and mistakes Celine as her son's child.\n\n===Gid Lucion Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo||\u30ae\u30c9\u30fb\u30eb\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Gido Rushion Debir\u016bku}} \n:{{anime voices|[[Hidetoshi Nakamura]]|[[David Wald]]}}\n:The King of Deviluke and Emperor of the known universe, Gid is the father of [[#Lala|Lala]], [[#Nana|Nana]], and [[#Momo|Momo]]. Despite his near omnipotent power, he has the physical appearance of a young boy, looking slightly devilish, with shark-like teeth, spiky black hair, and the characteristic Devilukean tail. While his daughters' tails end in spades, his appears as a wicked looking [[trident]]. Gid's personality borders juvenile delinquency and (extreme) perversion, going as far as to use his child like appearance to get close to pretty girls, thus Lala claims the only reason he wants her to marry is so he can step down as king and be free to pursue his perverted hobbies. Lala states his current appearance is due to him using too much power during the \"Galaxy Unification Wars\", which desized his body, following his conquest. However, even in this form he is described to still be very powerful, stating he could destroy the Earth if he released it.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', he is revealed to be back to his adult form when he has to fight Nemesis when she engages him in combat trying to kill him, he wins the fight with little effort' giving nemesis the ultimatum of surrendering or be destroyed; when she refuses he tries to kill her, but Rito steps in and allows her to live inside his body stating he sees redemption in her and will look after her for the time being, despite Gid warning him that she might betray him and start more mischief.\n\n:In the manga, he seems more easygoing and is much more accepting of [[#Rito|Rito]] as his heir, where he simply wishes to relinquish the throne so he could pursue his perverted interests. However, in the anime, he is much more critical of Rito and even attacks him, saying that Rito is not suitable for Lala.\n\n===Sephie Michaela Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo|Sephie Michaela Deviluke|\u30bb\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30fb\u30df\u30ab\u30a8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Sefi Mikaera Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kikuko Inoue]]}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-01/kikuko-inoue-to-play-lala-mother-in-to-love-ru-trouble-darkness-ova/.98215|title=Kikuko Inoue to Play Lala's Mother in To Love-Ru -Trouble- Darkness OVA|date=1 February 2016|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n:First referenced in Chapter 2 and formally introduced in Chapter 49 of Darkness, Sephie is the Queen of Deviluke and the mother of Lala, Nana, and Momo. Unlike the rest of her family whose middle names refer to devils, her middle name is a reference to the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].\n\n:Sephie is the last descendant of the Charmian race and therefore possesses no tail. While her Charmian blood endows her with the most beautiful appearance and voice, it has also caused trouble for her in the past. She possesses Charm, an ability that seduces any male she comes across, causing them to lose their sanity and run wildly towards her. The first person not to be affected by her Charm ability is Gid. The second person is Rito. Gid helped Sephie restrain many males during his combat training and gained her trust. She later married Gid and had three children.\n\n:It is said that Nana's and Momo's trait to communicate with animal and plants respectively was inherited from Sephie's Charm ability.\n\n===Akiho Sairenji===\n;{{nihongo|Akiho Sairenji|\u897f\u9023\u5bfa \u79cb\u7a42|Sairenji Akiho}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mikako Takahashi]]}}\n:[[#Haruna|Haruna]]'s older sister, she shares her apartment with Haruna.

He also keeps a personal record of every girl in the school with him. A running gag involves Motemitsu immediately asking out (or, in one case, proposing to) any pretty girl he sees, causing his followers to comment \"As expected from Motemitsu-senpai, [whatever Motemitsu has just done]!\", only to be instantly rejected, to which his followers say \"As expected from Motemitsu-senpai, immediately rejected!\". He is not seen or mentioned in the later half of the manga for reasons never explained, most likely due to focus more on the growing main cast.\n\n===Principal===\n;{{nihongo|Principal|\u6821\u9577|K\u014dch\u014d}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]]|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The unnamed principal of Sainan High is well known throughout campus as a pervert. He will enroll any girls into the school body so as to ogle and grope them without hesitation (though, according to him, they have to be \"cute girls\"). This groping is not limited only to Sainan High, but in public, as well.\n\n:A common gag involves the Principal spontaneously shedding his clothes and chasing after a girl he becomes smitten with, which inevitably results in him beaing beaten to a pulp. Once, [[#Ren and Run|Run]] purposefully causes herself to change into Ren to get the principal to leave her be; upon seeing Ren, the principal thinks briefly, then continues to chase him (stating \"This is okay too\").\n\n:Throughout the series, the principal has survived many severe injuries and attacks. Some of these include burning, (by [[#Kyouko|Kyouko]]) beaten up, and on one occasion, almost eaten by a crocodile in the Amazon.\n\n:The unnamed Principal bears a strong resemblance to famed erotic photographer, [[Nobuyoshi Araki]], complete with trademarked, devil horn hair style.\n\n===Haruko Nitta===\n;{{nihongo|Haruko Nitta|\u65b0\u7530 \u6674\u5b50|Nitta Haruko}}\n:{{anime voices|Sakura Nakamura}}\n:[[#Mikan|Mikan]]'s homeroom teacher in Sainan First Elementary School (\u5f69\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c0f\u5b66\u6821 ''Sainan Daiichi Sh\u014dgakk\u014d'').

Mikan comments he is very good at the most \"pointless things\", like [[crane game|crane]] and festival games (e.g. hoops, catching fish, squirt guns). Along with the numerous useless little things Rito is good at, he is also an accomplished [[florist]], [[gardener]], and [[horticulturalist]].\n\n:Rito is extremely kind, selfless, caring, charismatic, and thoughtful, having a lot of respect for women, though mostly by intention, and not so much by success. Due to his shyness around girls, he is very clumsy around women and has great difficulty maintaining his composure around any sort of stimulating situation, which leads him to always molest or grope the many girls in the series (though mostly unintentionally). Due to the otherworldly circumstances around him, Rito is always put, along with many different girls, in any and each type of awkward, intimate, and embarrassing situations, such as when he and [[#Haruna|Haruna]] were once teleported naked together to the basement of [[#Ryouko|Ryouko]]'s medical clinic because of one of [[#Lala|Lala]]'s faulty inventions,<ref>{{nihongo|\"Those Warped into the Midst of Darkness\"|\u6697\u95c7\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u3046\u3064\u308b\u3082\u306e|\"Kurayami no Naka de Utsuru Mono\"}}</ref> or when Lala used the ''same'' invention to send them naked to the school.<ref>{{nihongo|\"Once More, From Here\"|\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u5ea6\u3053\u3053\u304b\u3089|\"M\u014d ichido koko kara\"}}</ref>\n\n:Even without interference from Lala's inventions, Oshizu's psychic powers, or Celine jumping into his face, Rito is somehow able to trip over absolutely nothing, and possesses an extraordinary skill in accidentally reaching his hands or face into the breasts or other private parts of any girl within reach when he is falling. In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', his clumsiness becomes even more frequent and violating as well as strangely inventive and surreal. He has shown to be able to accomplish difficult feats, such as reaching his hands or various objects into the clothing and undergarments of girls or partially strip off their clothing, and also grab several private parts of several girls all at once, all of which being purely by accident. Ryouko suspects that Rito's frequent godly indecency and unwitting perverted acts manifest because of the way Rito extremely restrained himself with the girls, causing his \"libido\" to accumulate and release in form of accidentally groping girls' bodies and all other perverted stuffs happening so far, calling it the \"Cataplectic Indecency Syndrome\". She also believes that the more he suppresses it, the more extreme and unbelievable the \"accidents\" will be.<ref>{{nihongo|\"Inspection|Inspection\uff5e\u691c\u8a3c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff5e|Inspection -Kensh\u014d shimashou-}}</ref>\n\n:It is only by accident that he encounters Lala, and despite his enduring feelings for Haruna, Rito shows signs of developing deeper affection towards Lala throughout the story but is unsure if what he feels is actually love. At the end of the series, he confesses to Lala, but tells her he also loves Haruna, yet she is happy on both parts. He is confused as polygamy is illegal in Japan where Lala replied that once he is king of the universe the laws of earth no longer apply. By the end of the ''Darkness'' manga, Rito earns Haruna's mutual feelings; in addition to Lala, Run, Yami, and Momo. The ending implies that his love troubles will continue on forever.\n\n====Riko Yusaki====\n;{{nihongo|Riko Yusaki|\u5915\u5d0e \u68a8\u5b50|Y\u016bsaki Riko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Akeno Watanabe]]}}\n:As Riko Yusaki, his female alter-ego, she is a beautiful girl (with a physical appearance resembling a tomboy) who gets much attention from men, such as Motemitsu, the perverted principal, and even [[#Saruyama|Saruyama]], Rito's best friend. Later, Saruyama falls in love with \"Riko-chan\" and asks Lala to invite her for a date; out of pity, she forcefully changes Rito into \"Riko\" so Saruyama can go on a date with Riko. After that Riko only appears for short number of times at rare occasions. Her last appearance was in Chapter 74 of ''Darkness'' manga, when Nemesis changed her gender through boy-girl change kun.\n\n===Lala Satalin Deviluke===\n[[File:Lala Satalin Deviluke.png|150px|thumb|Lala Satalin Deviluke.]]\n;{{nihongo|Lala Satalin Deviluke|\u30e9\u30e9\u30fb\u30b5\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Rara Satarin Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Haruka Tomatsu]]|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:Lala is the first princess of Deviluke, whose family rules the Galaxy. As such, her hand in marriage is sought from across the Galaxy as she is (presumably) the successor to the Galaxy's throne. A rather childish girl, she is somewhat na\u00efve regarding the culture and customs on Earth. Lala initially runs away from home, as she does not wish to get married to any of her suitors, and due to an accident, ends up naked in [[#Rito|Rito]]'s bathtub. Upon arriving on Earth, Lala pretends to love Rito to keep herself from getting married, but really does fall in love with him after she misinterprets a statement that Rito shouts that was meant for Haruna.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 2: Great Escape of Love (\u611b\u306e\u5927\u8131\u51fa, Ai no dai dasshutsu)</ref> Although Lala appears to be somewhat airheaded, she is well known on Deviluke for her genius-level intellect and enjoys making all manners of inventions, often prompting some disastrous effect or another.\n\n:Throughout the series, she frequently tries to get Rito to love her, although her grand gestures generally end up putting Rito and company in embarrassing situations. Although Rito frequently chastises her for causing embarrassing and otherwise troublesome incidents, Lala rarely shows any form of negativity towards him and even states it is impossible for her to hate him (The only exception to this is when she gets a disease from another planet causing her to change moods, making her mood change to angry and upon the third day Rito is awakened by Lala in her room, with Lala first stating \"why are you startled by the sight of me?\" and then Lala simply stating, \"Just to let you know, I didn't watch you in your sleep.\" And then stating \"I made a boxed lunch for you, but don't get the wrong idea, I simply made an extra lunch.\" Though some people would look at Lala as a typical tsundere as her actions very resemble much of one.)<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 91: Honest Feelings (\u771f\u3063\u76f4\u3050\u306a\u30ad\u30e2\u30c1, Massugu na kimochi)</ref> Even after finding out that he was in love with [[#Haruna|Haruna]] as well, she instead cheered and stated that they could both marry him.\n\n:Eccentric, playful and intelligent, Lala isn't shy (due to being bathed and dressed by numerous servants while growing up,) to a point where it feels almost natural for her to be in the nude (the only exception of this occurs when Lala catches a personality changing fever from another planet, making her very shy),<ref>To Love Ru Chapter 30: Ladies, Be Modest</ref> although she will cover herself up in front of those she really dislikes such as Lepescu. Like all citizens from Deviluke, Lala's physical abilities vastly exceeds that of a human (in one instance, she manages to blow away a [[typhoon]] just by shouting) and has a distinctive tail with a shape of a spade on the end that can shoot a destructive beam. Oddly, her tail is very sensitive, causing her friends to nickname it her \"weakness\" (all female Devilukeans' tails are more sensitive than a male's) despite being able to throw [[#Ren and Run|Run]] and [[#Saki|Saki]] to a wall while they mess with it. Unfortunately, Lala is bad at cooking. The food she cooks is either inedible or extremely spicy. While the fact that Lala is an alien is initially a secret, it becomes common knowledge relatively soon after her arrival with no one making a big deal about it. According to [[#Ringo|Ringo]], Lala's measurements are B89, W57, H87.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 60: Troublesome, Isn't It?

Peke is exceptionally devoted to Lala and has the ability to shapeshift into any kind of clothing for her to wear, but this also drains her power supply. She can also scan the clothing of people around her and duplicate those clothes. As her batteries run out, the clothing Lala wears will slowly dissolve, until it completely disappears. To recharge, Peke simply needs to sleep. Using a dress-form program, Peke has the ability to take on a human form, with the appearance of a young girl.\n\n===Haruna Sairenji===\n[[File:Haruna.png|150px|thumb|Haruna Sairenji.]]\n;{{nihongo|Haruna Sairenji|\u897f\u9023\u5bfa \u6625\u83dc|Sairenji Haruna}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayuri Yahagi]]|[[Bryn Apprill]]}}\n:One of [[#Rito|Rito]]'s classmates and the girl of his affections; Haruna has similar feelings for him, having been attracted to his kind, gentle nature since junior high. Despite her growing love for Rito, which she believes to be unrequited, she usually suppresses her feelings and cannot confess to him because of her friendship with [[#Lala|Lala]], who also loves Rito. However, with some encouragement, she tells Lala of her ordeal, to which Lala accepts, claiming Haruna as her rival for Rito's heart, while remaining friends.\n\n:She lives with her older sister in an apartment and has a severe fear of ghosts and the supernatural, the exception being [[#Oshizu|Oshizu]], to an extent. When frightened, she has a habit of grabbing the nearest thing around her \u2013 typically Rito \u2013 and swinging wildly, in an attempt to get rid of whatever frightens her. There is also a running gag to where Rito is about to confess to her, only for something (or someone) to come between it. A highly responsible person, Haruna's personality can sway her classmates' hearts to vote for her as their class representative, even when she did not run to be a candidate. She is affiliated with the tennis club and a [[southpaw]]. According to [[#Risa and Mio|Mio]], Haruna's measurements are B78, W55, H80.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">To Love-Ru Episode 22: Shudder! The Culture Festival (\u6226\u6144!\u6587\u5316\u796d, Senritsu! Bunkasai)</ref>\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Haruna's role in the manga is reduced, due to her being based on series artist Kentaro Yabuki's ex-wife, who has awarded the rights to the character in their divorce; she still frequently appears, despite this. In ''Darkness'', Haruna seems to have grown into a covert pervert, as she is usually seen fantasizing about Rito in secret, such as him bathing her or wearing nothing but a apron to seduce him. It appears that Rito has yet to properly confess his feelings to Haruna, despite Lala pressuring him to do so and the fact he can have multiple wives if he became the King. This due to the fact he still has a [[monogamy]] viewpoint. When Rito and Haruna had been shrunk by Lala's inventions, they kiss each other (by accident). Overhearing Rito's denial of Nemesis' harem proclamation as student council president, Haruna defends him from the mob and, while hiding in a gym storage, she finally spoken her love to him, which he returns them; she is the third female character to confess her love to Rito. In the end, as Rito decides not to go forward on this, Haruna accepts and decides to wait for his answer.\n\n===Mikan Yuki===\n;{{nihongo|Mikan Yuki|\u7d50\u57ce \u7f8e\u67d1|Y\u016bki Mikan}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}\n:Rito's independent and reliable 12-year-old sister, Mikan takes care of the housework while their parents are away on business and watches after [[#Celine|Celine]]. In contrast to her brother, she is very mature and does not hesitate to tease him, going as far as stating they aren't blood-related, but quickly retracting the statement, playing it off as a lie. Mikan also seems to have a certain lack of respect for Rito because of this (she hardly ever addresses him by his honorific as an older brother), but does refer to him as \"Onii-chan\" as thanks for trying so hard to take care of her when she develops a fever<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 104: Siblings (\u5144\u59b9, Ky\u014ddai)</ref> and when he gives her a Christmas present.\n\n:Mikan may not show it, but she cares very deeply for Rito and misses his company, to the point one could suspect her of having a brother complex. This is more evident in the second OVA where she wonders if he would marry her if they were not blood related, and in the manga where she blushes every time another character mentions her brother, and also in the 5th OVA where after being hit by the pollen she tries to molest him while affectionately calling him \"Onii-chan\". Her brother complex may be the reason she rarely calls Rito \"Onii-chan\"; less a lack of respect and more a sign of her wish that their relationship was something other than that of a brother and sister. She also states how she and Rito used to play together before Lala entered their lives.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 73: Bad Mood? Good Mood? (\u4e0d\u6a5f\u5acc?\u3054\u6a5f\u5acc?, Fukigen? Gokigen?)</ref> It is later revealed that Mikan is terrified of thunder and lightning (and that Rito would always comfort her).\n\n:Mikan grows quite attached to [[#Golden Darkness|Golden Darkness]], perhaps due to Darkness seemingly being the same age as her. Mikan is very perceptive and seems to be able to read people's emotions, even their reactions, most of which is Rito's obvious anxiety around [[#Haruna|Haruna]] and [[#Yui|Yui]]'s subtle feelings for him. Mikan even calls him a \"playboy\" (as does [[#Nana|Nana]]) for attracting so many girls all of a sudden. Mikan, however, does respect Rito's relationship with [[#Lala|Lala]], even going so far as to tell [[#Momo|Momo]] not to get too close to Rito for Lala's sake, although it is fairly obvious that she could have done this out of jealousy from how close Momo was getting to Rito.\n\n===Golden Darkness===\n;{{nihongo|Golden Darkness|\u91d1\u8272\u306e\u95c7|Konjiki no Yami}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Misato Fukuen]]|Katelyn Barr}}\n:A dispassionate, withdrawn [[assassination|assassin]], Golden Darkness was hired by one of [[List of To Love Ru characters#Lala Satalin Deviluke|Lala Satalin Deviluke]]'s prospective suitors, [[List of To Love Ru characters#Lacospo|Lacospo]], to kill Lala's fianc\u00e9 [[List of To Love Ru characters#Rito Yuki|Rito Yuki]]. She breaks the contract after noting Rito's true nature. Golden Darkness came to Earth on the Lunatique, a very fast ship (it can travel 30 million light-years in 2 hours). Golden Darkness has decided to stay on Earth, where she roams the streets of {{nihongo|Sainan Town|\u5f69\u5357\u753a|Sainan machi}}, purportedly to continue her mission to assassinate Rito, although she has yet to accomplish this despite numerous opportunities, hinting that she says this as an excuse to stay on Earth, which is then confirmed.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 138: {{nihongo|\"Happening Weather\"|\u30cf\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u65e5\u548c|\"Hapuningu Biyori\"}}</ref> Commonly referred as \"'''Yami'''\", she spends much of her time reading books and magazines, while eating [[taiyaki]] (it is the only thing she eats since it is the first food offered to her by Rito).<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 76: {{nihongo|\"Sleepover party\"|\u304a\u6cca\u308a\u4f1a|Otomari kai}}</ref> By her planet's calculations, she is 24 years old, despite having the appearance of a 14-year-old (her Trans ability has slowed her aging process), although this is only mentioned in the anime.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> She has also a weakness to anything slimy.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 58: {{nihongo|\"An Unexpected End\"|\u610f\u5916\u306a\u7d50\u672b|Igai na ketsumatsu}}</ref>\n\n:Like Lala, Golden Darkness' physical abilities are exponentially stronger than a human's. She states she hates \"[[ecchi]]\" people, and does not hesitate to assault a person who looks at her in an obscene way. She does though hate when people are free of her as shown in the anime as she beats Rito up after being told by Rito that he's free of her. She's capable of spinning people away if she's caught by someone's with a strong grip. She has become close to Rito's younger sister [[List of To Love Ru characters#Mikan Yuki|Mikan Yuki]] and seems to keep an eye out for her, evident when she and Mikan switched bodies and the [[List of To Love Ru characters#Principal|Principal]] attempted to grope her, prompting Golden Darkness (in Mikan's body) to warn him not to touch Mikan and deliver a savage beating. Though she always says she will kill Rito one day, it is becoming increasingly doubtful that she will ever do it. In fact, she seems to have begun to develop feelings for Rito. Instead of beating him and saying \"I hate ecchi people\" like she normally does, she blushes when Rito sees her in a swimsuit and states \"Don't look at me with those ecchi eyes\". This is also proven further when Golden Darkness nearly tells Rito that he can \"embrace\" her.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 159: {{nihongo|\"Summer Memories\"|\u590f\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa|Natsu no Omoide}}</ref>\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', after some convincing from Mikan, she enrolls in the {{nihongo|Sainan High|\u5f69\u5357\u9ad8\u6821}} school and becomes a classmate of the main cast. Mikan is also giving her cooking lessons. Despite her normal stoic appearance, it is obvious that she does care for Rito, and is shown to be developing further feelings for him, although not enough to forgo the occasional beating when he becomes \"Ecchi\". Her new life may already be in jeopardy when [[List of To Love Ru characters#Mea Kurosaki|Mea Kurosaki]], a fellow classmate, is revealed to be her 'little sister', suggesting that she will have to return to space and fulfill her contract to kill Rito. It is revealed that Golden Darkness's creator is the Sainan High teacher [[List of To Love Ru characters#Tearju Lunatique|Tearju Lunatique]],<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 149: {{nihongo|\"The Smiling Cat\"|\u5fae\u7b11\u3080\u30cd\u30b3|Hohoemu Neko}}</ref> and that her given name is \"'''Eve'''\".<ref>''To Love-Ru Darkness'' Chapter 14: {{nihongo|\"Past\"|Past \uff5e \u660e\u65e5\u306b\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u8a18\u61b6 \uff5e|\"Past - Ashita ni tsunagaru kioku -\"}}</ref> When Golden Darkness' former rival [[List of To Love Ru characters#Azenda|Azenda]] hires the alien [[hitman]] [[List of To Love-Ru characters#Kuro|Kuro]] to kill Rito, she rescues him from Kuro before she confesses her love to him, making her the second female heroine to convey to Rito.\n\n:She is based on [[List of Black Cat characters#Eve|Eve]] from ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]'', as they both look the same and can turn any part of their bodies into a weapon; they are even voiced by the same actress Misato Fukuen in their respective animes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Misato Fukuen's Voice Works|url=http://www.usagi.org/doi/seiyuu/fukuen-misato/roles-anime.html}}</ref> Also, there's a chapter in ''To Love Ru'' in which Golden Darkness tries on a black dress similar to the one that Eve wears in the final chapters of ''Black Cat''.<ref>''To Love-Ru'' Chapter 61: {{nihongo|Yami-yami Fashion|\u30e4\u30df\u30e4\u30df\u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|Yami-yami Fasshon}}</ref>\n\n:[[Kentaro Yabuki]] initially illustrated ''Black Cat'' between 2000-2004, then assisted Saki Hasemi with his manga project ''To Love Ru''. They agreed that a character featured in ''To Love Ru'' would be based on one of the protagonists in ''Black Cat'', which ended up being Eve. Her character was recognized for being extremely similar to Eve and is currently one of the most popular characters in the series. Fans also debate whether she could have her own series.<ref name=\"Yami Character Profile\">{{cite web|title=Yami Character Profile Official Site|url=http://www.j-toloveru.com/character/yami.html|publisher=Shueisha|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Motto-To Love-Ru\">{{cite web|title=Motto To Love-Ru|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/motto-to-love-ru-trouble/sub.dvd-complete-collection|publisher=animenewsnetwork|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Yui Kotegawa===\n;{{nihongo|Yui Kotegawa|\u53e4\u624b\u5ddd \u552f|Kotegawa Yui}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kaori Nazuka]]|[[Amber Lee Connors]]}}\n:An uptight, high-strung girl placed in [[#Rito|Rito]]'s class during the second year, Yui Kotegawa has little to no tolerance for anything she does not consider to be \"acceptable behavior\", and in the face of any kind of \"shameless\" act, Yui reacts by saying her trademark phrase: \"How shameless!\"; ironically, despite this, she secretly desire for Rito to do them to her, which is proved during one of Rito's \"accidents\", when she offered herself to him on the condition that he would only ever do it with her, and even stating: \"You're the only one who can do naughty things to me.\" Her haughty opinions, quick temper, and habit of speaking her mind often results in her vocally reprimanding classmates.\n\n:Yui quickly grows annoyed and disgusted by eccentricities and bizarre actions, particularly with regards to Rito and [[#Lala|Lala]]. Unfortunately, almost every encounter with Rito usually ends up with her embarrassed, naked or groped (or all three), and although her nature prevents her from easing her behavior, she does slowly warm up to his usual antics. After Rito saves Yui from a group of delinquents, she develops feelings for Rito, although her inexperience with boys leaves her unable to understand her feelings and is continually in self-denial about them. And when Rito usually asks what's wrong, she says the exact opposite of what she wants to say and then hurts him in some way (a typical [[tsundere]]). In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Yui seems to have adopted Rito's clumsiness, which makes her fall onto him, pull his pants down and plant her face right in his groin.\n\n:A common gag is that some characters cannot remember Kotegawa's family name (calling her \"Kokegawa\" for example), presumably due to the fact she is generally an unwilling participant in Lala's frequent schemes. After Celine takes on her human like form, she becomes very close to Yui, even being seen as a daughter like figure in Yui's daydreams of her and Rito being married together. Also, she really likes cats \u2013 owning cat based books, having a stuffed cat, decorating her room with cat shaped things,  shaping her chocolate into a cat's face, and even having a cat-themed floaty, something Rito seems to find cute about her. According to [[#Risa and Mio|Mio]], her measurements are B88, W59, H87.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Nana Astar Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo|Nana Astar Deviluke|\u30ca\u30ca\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30bf\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Nana Asuta Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kanae It\u014d]]}}\n:Nana and Momo are [[#Lala|Lala]]'s younger sisters and they are also twins. They were first introduced when they have most of the characters in a virtual game world created by Lala that they subsequently modify. They claim they did this to determine the nature of their sister's friends and to test [[#Rito|Rito]]'s affection for Lala.\n\n:Both Nana and Momo are currently on Earth, running away from their studies.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 97: Trouble Quest 5 (\u3068\u3089\u3076\u308b\u304f\u3048\u3059\u30685, TORABURU KUESUTO go)</ref> During this time, Lala has taken it upon herself to look after them and discipline them when they do something mischievous; ironically she has done those herself. They used to live with Zastin and his cohorts, but found it too cramped and uncomfortable. To get around this and to spend more time with their big sister, they created a pocket dimension in Rito's house (it is said to be bigger than Rito's house) to live in. Like her sisters, she has a cell phone capable of transporting objects. However, instead of gadgets, Nana summons animals.\n\n:Nana has long hair, a single visible sharp tooth and unlike her sisters, a flat chest, which is used as a recurring gag throughout the manga. She is quite jealous of [[#Momo|Momo]]'s chest. She understands and can talk to animals. At some point of the series To Love Ru OVA 5, Nana develops small feelings for [[#Rito|Rito]], after he saved her from Momo's plant friends. And she manages to get the courage to sleep with Rito in his bedroom while he is sleeping, but actually sees Lala and Momo sleeping with him.  Nana is so far the only character to question why so many girls fall in love with Rito, yet it is clear that she has growing feelings for him as well.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Nana becomes a Sainan High student at Momo's urging. Nana manages to get a new friend named [[#Mea|Mea]]. When she found out Mea was a weapon like Yami and that she wanted to stop \"playing\" friends, she became depressed and confused in the 3rd episode of ''To Love Ru Darkness 2nd''. After being encouraged by Rito, Nana met up with Mea again and made up when Nana said she doesn't care if Mea is a weapon or anything, she just wants to be with her and be friends. Shortly after Nana's feelings for Rito grew and tried to sneak into his bed a second time, but found out Momo was already there.\n\n===Momo Belia Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo|Momo Belia Deviluke|\u30e2\u30e2\u30fb\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Momo Beria Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Aki Toyosaki]]}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.j-toloveru.com/staff.html | title=ToLOVE\u308b \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5&\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 (ToLove-Ru Staff & Cast) | work=toloveru.com | accessdate=October 13, 2011 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015148/http://www.j-toloveru.com/staff.html | archive-date=July 11, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n:Momo has short hair and is generally sweeter than her twin, but develops a bad attitude whenever [[#Nana|Nana]] takes credit for what she does. What gadgets are to Lala and animals are to Nana, plants are to Momo; she has a special connection with them that allows her to manipulate plants at will.\n\n:She immediately falls in love with [[#Rito|Rito]] and has a strong attraction towards him (similar to [[#Lala|Lala]]'s, but with a more lustful desire), stating how his facial expressions are lovely, letting him touch her tail, and even becoming more aroused when Nana refers to him as a \"beast\". At times, she would even sneak into Rito's bed at night, but when asked why she does that, she simply replies that she is sometimes half asleep and unintentionally ends up in Rito's bed. At one time, she nearly stated how jealous she was of Lala that Rito's hand was stuck to her tail. Her tail is also able to shoot out lightning. As her attraction to Rito grows, so does her protectiveness of him, as she will physically threaten other characters (such as Mea) with violence if she attempts to harm Rito.<ref>to-LOVE ru chapter 160 page 13</ref> Like her sisters, she has a cell phone capable of transporting objects. However, instead of gadgets, Momo summons plants.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Momo takes over the role of the main female protagonist alongside Golden Darkness. Wanting Rito's love, but unwilling to cause conflict between her sister or Haruna, Momo realises if Rito becomes the next king of Deviluke, Earth laws will not apply to him, allowing him to create a harem where she can display her affections openly. Momo along with her sister become Sainan High's students, where Momo takes it upon herself to try to bring out the \"carnivore\" in Rito, which basically means his sex drive so he will take it upon himself to want to create a harem with all of the female cast. In the final chapter, Momo decides to be true to herself. She is the fourth and last heroine to confess her love to Rito.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n===Risa & Mio===\n;{{nihongo|Risa Momioka|\u7c7e\u5ca1 \u91cc\u7d17|Momioka Risa}} & {{nihongo|Mio Sawada|\u6ca2\u7530 \u672a\u592e|Sawada Mio}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ryoka Yuzuki]] (Risa) and [[Chiemi Chiba]] (Mio)|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actress)|Margaret McDonald]] (Risa) and [[Juliet Simmons]] (Mio)}}\n:The mischievous, yet cheerful, best friends of [[#Haruna|Haruna]], Risa and Mio are a pair of inseparable girls, spending as much time as they can with her and [[#Lala|Lala]], and whenever the latter inquires about Earth`s culture and habits, they divulge as much information as they can for (although it is often misleading and perverted). Risa and Mio are known for their playful habit of groping the breasts of other girls and whispering naughty things into their ears to tease them, with Haruna as their most recurring victim; they like to do this with her mainly in front of Rito, in addition to also teasing Haruna about her feelings for him. While Mio enjoys [[cosplay]] and works part-time at a [[maid caf\u00e9]] (to where Risa is always going to, as well), Risa is member of Sainan High's [[tennis]] club like Haruna, but she mostly skips it to do other things.\n\n===Run & Ren===\n;{{nihongo|Run & Ren Elise Jewelria|\u30eb\u30f3&\u30ec\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30eb\u30b7\u30fb\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2|Run & Ren Erishe Jueria}}\n:{{anime voices|Fuyuka \u014cura (both)|[[Greg Ayres]] (Ren) and [[Christina Kelly]] (Run)}}\n:A childhood friend of [[#Lala|Lala]], Ren is infamously known for wearing girls clothing during his play dates with Lala when he was a child. He arrives on Earth to win Lala by proving he is \"man enough\" for her, but becomes jealous of her relationship with [[#Rito|Rito]]. Due to his pursuit of her, he accidentally gives Rito his first kiss.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 23: Scramble For The Lips (\u5507\u4e89\u596a\u6226, Kuchibiru s\u014ddatsusen)</ref> While Ren is furious, it has an unexpected consequence towards his \"[[alter ego]]\". As Ren is from planet {{nihongo|Memorze|\u30e1\u30e2\u30eb\u30bc|Memoruze}}, he can change gender in mind and body upon triggering a specific stimulus. In his case, a sneeze. As a girl, '''{{nihongo|Run|\u30eb\u30f3|Run}}''' is in love with Rito, due to the kiss, and blames Lala for her misfortunes, while Ren is still in competition, albeit one-sided, with Rito for Lala's hand in marriage.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 42: Confession (\u544a\u767d, Kokuhaku)</ref>\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Run and Ren permanently separate into two different beings upon reaching adulthood, with Run confessing her love to Rito right after this happens. Currently, Run is a famous [[Japanese idol|idol]], having released several albums, some along with [[#Kyouko|Kyouko]], with whom she befriended after Run has played an antagonist on her show.\n\n:In the anime, while Ren appears a few times, Run is the dominant personality of the two, who is more serious about her feelings towards Rito to the point of stalking him, even taking a simple misunderstanding from him into her believing all men are never serious about her feelings. In the manga, Ren appears at first as the main personality. However, later on Run becomes the dominant personality (like in the anime) with Ren usually showing up for comedic effect, or when Ren does show up he inevitably changes into Run. In To Love Ru Troubles, it is revealed they are able to communicate with each other.\n\n===Saki Tenjouin===\n;{{nihongo|Saki Tenjouin|\u5929\u6761\u9662 \u6c99\u59eb|Tenj\u014din Saki}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]|[[Maggie Flecknoe]]}}\n:The self-proclaimed \"[[Queen bee (sociology)#Schools|queen bee]]\" of Sainan High, Saki is a pretty, popular, and rich girl who believes herself to be [[#Lala|Lala]]'s rival (who is totally oblivious to Saki's animosity towards her and, ironically, thinks of Saki as a good friend of hers). Due to Lala being considered prettier than her and, thus, getting more attention from the people, Saki, stating there can only be one \"queen\" in Sainan High, consistently tries to one-up her,  going through any possible means to prove that she is better than Lala, even though her plans usually backfire and she ends up embarrassing herself in many different ways; the most frequent result is she getting naked in front of a crowd.<ref>To Love-Ru Episode 5: The Queen's Challenge (\u304f\u3044\u30fc\u3093\u306e\u6311\u6226\u72b6, Ku\u012bn no Ch\u014dsenj\u014d)</ref>\n\n:Saki is one of the few female characters who doesn't feel any romantic feeling toward [[#Rito|Rito]] (the only exception being when she was infected by Celine's pollen and briefly fell in love with him), and it's very likely she will not end up as part of his harem, even though most of her appearances seem to only serve the purpose of being a victim to the perverted mishaps that surround him. In the anime, however, she occasionally tries to seduce Rito in order to make Lala jealous (despite not loving him). Instead of Rito, Saki has a crush on [[#Zastin|Zastin]], which left her horrified to discover that he, by chance, is the personal bodyguard of Lala, but this made her even more determined to win his heart at any cost.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 80: Master of Love (\u604b\u611b\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc, Ren'ai MASUT\u0100)</ref>\n\n===Ryouko Mikado===\n;{{nihongo|Ryouko Mikado|\u5fa1\u9580 \u6dbc\u5b50|Mikado Ry\u014dko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Masako Joh]] (2008\u201312), [[Harumi Sakurai]] (2012\u201317)|Marissa Lenti}}\n:The provocative school doctor at Sainan High, Ryouko helps out other extraterrestrials on Earth in various ways, usually dealing with medical care, although she does offer her human students a variety of her own concoctions as well. Formerly an operative for a shadowy, [[black market]] extraterrestrial organization bent on overthrowing Emperor [[#Gid|Gid]], she fled to Earth in hopes of hiding from her superiors. Evidence of her non-human origins are the [[elf|elf-like]] ears hidden by her short hair - her species has not yet been specified. Furthermore, she seems to be smitten with [[#Rito|Rito]], as shown when she asks him to rub oil on her.\n\n===Shizu Murasame===\n;{{nihongo|Shizu Murasame|\u6751\u96e8 \u9759|Murasame Shizu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mamiko Noto]]|Melissa Molano}}\n:The ghost of a girl who died 400 years ago,<ref>{{cite web|title=To Love-Ru 4koma, chapter 8: Ignorance is Bliss|url=http://imgur.com/mjFLavb|publisher=Jump Live|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> Shizu is sincere, kind, and very curious about the modern world, but has a severe [[Cynophobia|fear of dogs]], likened to [[#Haruna|Haruna]]'s level of fear to the supernatural. She is usually addressed as {{nihongo|\"Oshizu\"|\u304a\u9759}}; the {{nihongo|O|\u304a}} is [[Honorific speech in Japanese#Female names|an honorific used to refer to women]]. When frightened, she can emit blasts of mental stress, blowing apart various objects and surroundings, but is also capable of manipulating others through sheer willpower.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 113: Beach Girls\u2661 (\u30d3\u30fc\u30c1\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba\u2661, B\u012aCHI G\u01cdRUZU\u2661)</ref> A related gag is the blasts of stress frequently rip apart clothing, resulting in Rito being in an awkward situation with one of the female cast. Since her meeting with [[#Rito|Rito]] and the others, she begins exploring the world outside the old school building. Oshizu is aware of Haruna's crush on Rito by her ability to sense feelings while possessing another person and becomes very supportive towards cheering Haruna into confessing her feelings to him.\n\n:Oshizu \"returns\" to the living after [[#Ryouko|Ryouko]] creates a prosthetic body for her to inhabit, built with biological qualities (looking and feeling like an actual human body). However, she occasionally \"disconnects\" her spirit from the body during brief moments of excitement. She currently lives with Ryouko and works as a nurse at her clinic to pay her back for the body, and also to remain close for Ryouko to maintain her physical body. In the first anime, Oshizu is not given a new body and her presence is limited, while she has her prosthetic body as she does in the manga for the OVA releases and the new anime.\n\n===Mea Kurosaki===\n;{{nihongo|Mea Kurosaki|\u9ed2\u54b2 \u82bd\u4e9c(\u30e1\u30a2)|Kurosaki Mea}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yuka Iguchi]]}}\n:The first-year schoolgirl appears in 1st chapter of ''To Love Ru Darkness''. She is the classmate of [[#Nana and Momo|Nana and Momo]] when they two transfer to Sainan High. Nana becomes her friend after talking to Mea about Nana's ability to understand animals' language. At the end of the second chapter of ''Darkness'', Mea reveals to Yami that she is Yami's little sister, and possess similar powers. Mea desires for Yami to kill Rito and return to her life as an assassin instead of living a normal life on Earth. Her [[#Nemesis|master]] calls her '''{{nihongo||\u30e1\u30a2|Mea}}''' (''[[katakana]]'') instead of {{nihongo||\u82bd\u4e9c|Mea}} (''[[kanji]]''). After chapter 7, it appears she is starting to develop sexual feelings for Rito, and start seeing other people as friends. After Nana found out Mea was a weapon, she told her she was \"playing\" friends with her. However, Nana made up with her and became friends again. As Nemesis possesses Mea's body to witness Yami's ecchi-Darkness Mode, Mea managed to overcome her and break ties with Nemesis. From then on, Mea participates in Rito's harem though still cares for Nemesis.\n\n===Nemesis===\n;{{nihongo|Nemesis|\u30cd\u30e1\u30b7\u30b9|Nemeshisu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Rina Hidaka]]}}\n:The primary antagonist of ''To Love Ru Darkness'' and [[#Mea|Mea]]'s boss, who is behind the plan to make [[#Yami|Yami]] return to the assassins' world. She has long black hair, golden eyes, a small yet slender body, and dark skin. She has a similar appearance to Mikan and possesses the same transformation ability as Yami and Mea. It is shown that Nemesis has a bit of a sexual interest in Rito. [[#Momo|Momo]] has an antagonistic personality toward her. It is then noticed by Mea in the anime of ''To Love Ru Darkness'' that if Yami were to join Momo's harem this would force nemesis to join as well thus giving Momo an advantage.\n\n:She knows that Yami possesses a destructive weapon called \"Darkness\" which, according to Tearju, is supposedly a forbidden transformation of hers. In the major battle between Nemesis and a fully reformed Gid Lucion Deviluke, Nemesis is fatally injured which would literally make her vanish until Rito takes pity on her and allows her to inhabit his body for the time-being to recover, much to Momo's chagrin. After reaching full recovery, Nemesis comes to fully understand Rito's well-being and forces application for Sainan High's new student council president to improve Rito's harem.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Kenichi Saruyama===\n;{{nihongo|Kenichi Saruyama|\u733f\u5c71 \u5065\u4e00|Saruyama Ken'ichi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|Greg Cote}}\n:The perverted best friend of [[#Rito|Rito]], Kenichi has known him since junior high and is more open and obvious of his obsession with girls and is one of the few male characters Rito can talk to about his situations involving [[#Haruna|Haruna]] or [[#Lala|Lala]]. He is aware of Rito's feelings for Haruna and consistently advises he get together with her. Recently, Kenichi reveals his crush on a girl named [[#Riko|Riko]], but does not realize she is actually Rito, who is accidentally transformed into a girl by one of Lala's bizarre inventions.\n\n===Zastin===\n;{{nihongo|Zastin|\u30b6\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3|Zasutin}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Takehito Koyasu]]|Scott Gibbs}}\n:[[#Lala|Lala]]'s personal bodyguard and the best swordsman on Deviluke. Despite his skill with the sword, Zastin has a horrible sense of direction, resulting in him getting lost (one of the [[running gag]]s in ''To Love Ru''). He also seems to have extremely bad luck, where he keeps getting run over by trains and cars. Initially, Zastin disapproves of [[#Rito|Rito]], deeming him weak and subsequently seeks to test his strength. However, once Rito exclaims his opinion of marriage in self-defense, Zastin is swayed by his words (though not in the way Rito intends) and summarily approves of him, believing he truly understands Lala's feelings.\n\n:He is currently working as the assistant chief to [[#Saibai|Saibai]]; the funds he gets for his duties are handed to Lala for her use. Zastin has shown a keen interest in becoming a manga artist, professionally. He has two assistants that work under him, simply known as [[#Maul and Smutts|Maul and Smutts]]. Zastin's tail is thin and very scorpion-like in appearance.\n\n===Rin Kujou===\n;{{nihongo|Rin Kujou|\u4e5d\u6761 \u51db|Kuj\u014d Rin}}\n:{{anime voices|Mai Hashimoto|Chaney Moore}}\n:Being one of [[#Saki|Saki]]'s closest friends, Rin is hardly ever seen without accompanying her and/or [[#Ayako|Aya]]. Rin is skilled in the [[kendo]] arts and has been the bodyguard of Saki for years, as her family has always served the Tenjouin household in this position. She is also the only person who has been able to take down Lala in one strike by throwing a vibrating bracelet onto Lala's tail incapacitating her.\n\n:While Rin is usually calm and composed, and perhaps one of the most mature character in the series, she is also loyal, caring, and protective to Saki, being very dutiful to her job as bodyguard. These made her conflicted when Saki once ran away from home, and Rin was ordered to bring her back, even by force. But after Saki managed to settle things with her family, she and Rin were able to remain friends.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', Rin's role in the manga is increased as she start to develop romantic feelings for Rito after he saves her from a cursed sword (with the help of Mea and Yami); Saki is completely supportive of her feelings for him, as she, frequently, sets up dates between Rin and Rito.\n\n===Ayako Fujisaki===\n;{{nihongo|Ayako Fujisaki|\u85e4\u5d0e \u7dbe|Fujisaki Ayako}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kaori Mizuhashi]]|Olivia Swasey}}\n:The bespectacled Ayako \"Aya\" Fujisaki is weak-willed and became associated with Saki after she and Rin protected her from bullies when they were kids. So far, Aya has served little purpose throughout the series besides following and supporting Saki, whom she idolizes. She is essentially something of an extra to their group, and has never been seen without accompanying Rin and Saki.\n\n:The most known aspect of Aya's personality is her adoration of Saki, whom she looks up to and cares for the most in her life. She is also one of the few girls who don't have any romantic feelings towards Rito; most, if not all, of her admiration goes to Saki, and she naturally hates Rito's perverted accidents, especially if it's towards her, Rin, and, most of all, Saki.\n\n===Celine===\n;{{nihongo|Celine|\u30bb\u30ea\u30fc\u30cc|''Ser\u012bnu''}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ryoka Yuzuki]]}}\n:[[#Lala|Lala]]'s gift for [[#Rito|Rito]]'s 16th birthday, Celine is initially a multi-story, [[carnivore|carnivorous]], sentient [[sunflower]] kept in the Yuki's residence backyard. Although seemingly monstrous, Rito cares for Celine deeply, referring to her as his family. The plant has traits in common with humans: perspiring when the climate is humid, wearing a scarf during a chilly weather and eating [[ramen]] when hungry (although Celine still needs the basic nutrients of water and sunlight as well). When Celine seemingly contracts a deadly disease, Kare Kare, Rito is fully dedicated to saving her and finding the only known antidote, the luckberry. With his friends they journey to the S-level-danger class planet of Misletoe to obtain the antidote, only to return and find Celine all dried up. In reality, she was [[germination|germinating]] and Celine burst out from her single [[seed]], taking the appearance of an infant girl, with a flower on her head. This event shocks even [[#Momo|Momo]], who is very knowledgeable about the galaxy's [[flora]], stating that even with all of her knowledge there is still much about Celine's biological makeup that is a complete mystery to her.\n\n:Referring to Rito as her \"mama\", the infant Celine gets drunk when she drinks [[cola]] at which time she sprays [[pollen]] from the flower on her head that temporarily causes anyone who inhales it to fall in love with Rito (a side-effect that originates from Celine's own affection for him from taking care of her every day). Celine has a tendency to jump onto someone out of nowhere or playfully tackle any passing girl and attempting to [[breast feed]]. In episode 5 of ''To Love Ru Darkness'' ova, Celine takes the form of a fully grown adult woman on a full moon and is able to talk instead of saying the usual \"mau\", but returns to normal in her infant form upon morning.  Comically mistaken as being Rito's daughter, Celine makes guest star appearances in the OVA adaptation (as a plant near the end of OVA 4 and as an infant in OVA 6 part 3) and becomes a regular character with her infant form in the new anime series.\n\n===Kyouko Kirisaki===\n;{{nihongo|Kyouko Kirisaki|\u9727\u5d0e \u606d\u5b50|Kirisaki Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Chiemi Chiba]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}\n:A half-alien girl, Ky\u014dko is a famous idol who has the ability to create and throw fire at will and becomes friends with [[#Ren and Run|Run]] when Run portrays an [[antagonist]] on her show. She is best known for her role as '''Magical Ky\u014dko''', a fictional [[magical girl]] character who stars in her own television series which [[#Lala|Lala]] loves watching, often forcing [[#Rito|Rito]] to watch it with her. She is present when Run asks Rito to be her date, and is able to tell they aren't dating though wishes Run luck on getting him. Ever since their first meeting on her show, Ky\u014dko and Run have done many projects together, including debuting many songs together.\n\n:When Rito and his friends are given invitations to an RPG world Lala had partially created, an image of Kyouko is programmed into the game. However, Ky\u014dko's programming within the game is modified by [[#Nana and Momo|Nana and Momo]], turning her into the \"Demon King\", tasked with seeking out Rito and offering him a way to send him and his friends home if he leaves Lala and promises to become her boyfriend. Adding to Rito's anxiety, Demon King Ky\u014dko threatens to destroy Rito and his friends if he does not state his feelings for Lala. In comedic fashion, the otherwise unbeatable Ky\u014dko is destroyed by a watering can that only Rito can use. Although she doesn't seem to be interested in Rito at first there do seem to be signs of her being fond of him after a few interesting situations arise. This becomes more evident after he saves her when she visited his school (to the extent of referring to Rito as a \"prince\" when he \"princess-carries\" her).\n\n:Kyouko is based upon the [[List of Black Cat characters#Kyoko Kirisaki|character of the same name]] from ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]''. Kyouko also appears in a television in \"Black Cat\".\n\n===Tearju Lunatique===\n;{{nihongo|Tearju Lunatique|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u30e6 \u30eb\u30ca\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af|Ti\u0101yu Runat\u012bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Misato Fukuen]]}}\n:The woman who created Golden Darkness using of her own DNA, therefore the two look almost identical although each has her own distinguishing features. She raised Yami as her own daughter and, after finding out the organization wanted to turn Yami into a weapon, was almost killed while rescuing Yami and then fleeing for life.\n\n:Well-endowed and beautiful, she quickly becomes the object of attention of the male students of the school who consider her clumsiness (on a par with Rito's, according to Oshizu) as rather cute. Unlike others, she calls Yami \"Eve\". She is also an old classmate of [[#Ryouko Mikado|Ryouko Mikado]], and was brought to Earth by her to reunited with Yami.\n\n:As with her creation, Tearju is based upon the [[List of Black Cat characters#Tearju Lunatique|character of the same name]] from ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]'', who has a similar role to that of Tearju in ''To Love Ru''.\n\n===Azenda===\n;{{nihongo|Azenda|\u30a2\u30bc\u30f3\u30c0|Azenda}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Risa Hayamizu]]}}\n:[[#Yami|Yami]]'s former opponent. She arrives to Earth under Nemesis's request to fight Yami.\n\n==Other characters==\n===Saibai Yuki===\n;{{nihongo|Saibai Yuki|\u7d50\u57ce \u624d\u57f9|Y\u016bki Saibai}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]}}\n:Rito's father is a manga artist and is very different compared to Rito in terms of both looks and personality. Saibai draws at amazing speeds and can be utterly serious before deadlines are met, but seems to have a bit of a goofy side, such as making a joke about Rito and [[#Lala|Lala]] \"sleeping\" together every night and punching Rito when he got drunk and mistook his son for a burglar. With the help of Lala he returns for the Christmas party, stating how much [[#Zastin|Zastin]] and his workers have grown since starting out. In the anime, he writes a (not-so-encouraging) letter to him at the end of the first season.\n\n===Ringo Yuki===\n;{{nihongo|Ringo Yuki|\u7d50\u57ce \u6797\u6a8e|Y\u016bki Ringo}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayaka Ohara]]}}\n:Rito's mother is a fashion designer and a scout for fashion models. Normally working overseas, she returns home to check up on the family. Despite initially appearing to be refined and chic, Ringo's personality is equally as odd as [[#Saibai|Saibai]]'s, where she has a tendency to start sizing women up with her hands, whenever she spots pretty girls. Ringo seems to take her work very seriously, having immediately entered \"work-mode\", when she meets [[#Lala|Lala]] and [[#Haruna|Haruna]] for the first time.<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 60. Troublesome, Isn't It? (\u5927\u5909\u3060\u306d\u30a7, Taihen da n\u0113)</ref> Like her daughter, Ringo is also highly perceptive, able to read Haruna's feelings towards Rito. With the help of Lala, she returns for the Christmas party and mistakes Celine as her son's child.\n\n===Gid Lucion Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo||\u30ae\u30c9\u30fb\u30eb\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Gido Rushion Debir\u016bku}} \n:{{anime voices|[[Hidetoshi Nakamura]]|[[David Wald]]}}\n:The King of Deviluke and Emperor of the known universe, Gid is the father of [[#Lala|Lala]], [[#Nana|Nana]], and [[#Momo|Momo]]. Despite his near omnipotent power, he has the physical appearance of a young boy, looking slightly devilish, with shark-like teeth, spiky black hair, and the characteristic Devilukean tail. While his daughters' tails end in spades, his appears as a wicked looking [[trident]]. Gid's personality borders juvenile delinquency and (extreme) perversion, going as far as to use his child like appearance to get close to pretty girls, thus Lala claims the only reason he wants her to get married is so he can step down as king and be free to pursue his perverted hobbies. Lala states his current appearance is due to him using too much power during the \"Galaxy Unification Wars\", which desized his body, following his conquest. However, even in this form he is described to still be very powerful, stating he could destroy the Earth if he released it.\n\n:In ''To Love Ru Darkness'', he is revealed to be back to his adult form when he has to fight Nemesis when she engages him in combat trying to kill him, he wins the fight with little effort' giving nemesis the ultimatum of surrendering or be destroyed; when she refuses he tries to kill her, but Rito steps in and allows her to live inside his body stating he sees redemption in her and will look after her for the time being, despite Gid warning him that she might betray him and start more mischief.\n\n:In the manga, he seems more easygoing and is much more accepting of [[#Rito|Rito]] as his heir, where he simply wishes to relinquish the throne so he could pursue his perverted interests. However, in the anime, he is much more critical of Rito and even attacks him, saying that Rito is not suitable for Lala.\n\n===Sephie Michaela Deviluke===\n;{{nihongo|Sephie Michaela Deviluke|\u30bb\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30fb\u30df\u30ab\u30a8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af|Sefi Mikaera Debir\u016bku}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kikuko Inoue]]}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-01/kikuko-inoue-to-play-lala-mother-in-to-love-ru-trouble-darkness-ova/.98215|title=Kikuko Inoue to Play Lala's Mother in To Love-Ru -Trouble- Darkness OVA|date=1 February 2016|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n:First referenced in Chapter 2 and formally introduced in Chapter 49 of Darkness, Sephie is the Queen of Deviluke and the mother of Lala, Nana, and Momo. Unlike the rest of her family whose middle names refer to devils, her middle name is a reference to the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].\n\n:Sephie is the last descendant of the Charmian race and therefore possesses no tail. While her Charmian blood endows her with the most beautiful appearance and voice, it has also caused trouble for her in the past. She possesses Charm, an ability that seduces any male she comes across, causing them to lose their sanity and run wildly towards her. The first person not to be affected by her Charm ability is Gid. The second person is Rito. Gid helped Sephie restrain many males during his combat training and gained her trust. She later married Gid and had three children.\n\n:It is said that Nana's and Momo's trait to communicate with animal and plants respectively was inherited from Sephie's Charm ability.\n\n===Akiho Sairenji===\n;{{nihongo|Akiho Sairenji|\u897f\u9023\u5bfa \u79cb\u7a42|Sairenji Akiho}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mikako Takahashi]]}}\n:[[#Haruna|Haruna]]'s older sister, she shares her apartment with Haruna. Extremely popular with the guys (having received confessions from two men at the same time), Akiho continuously turns them down, as her sister states she is not looking for love at the moment. However, she has been dating [[#Yuu|Yuu Kotegawa]].<ref>To Love-Ru Chapter 117</ref>\n\n===Yuu Kotegawa===\n:{{anime voices|[[Atsushi Abe]]}}\n:[[#Yui|Yui]]'s 19-year-old brother, {{nihongo|Yuu Kotegawa|\u53e4\u624b\u5ddd \u904a|Kotegawa Y\u016b}} is a ladies' man, something Yui dislikes.

He also keeps a personal record of every girl in the school with him. A running gag involves Motemitsu immediately asking out (or, in one case, proposing to) any pretty girl he sees, causing his followers to comment \"As expected from Motemitsu-senpai, [whatever Motemitsu has just done]!\", only to be instantly rejected, to which his followers say \"As expected from Motemitsu-senpai, immediately rejected!\". He is not seen or mentioned in the later half of the manga for reasons never explained, most likely due to focus more on the growing main cast.\n\n===Principal===\n;{{nihongo|Principal|\u6821\u9577|K\u014dch\u014d}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]]|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The unnamed principal of Sainan High is well known throughout campus as a pervert. He will enroll any girls into the school body so as to ogle and grope them without hesitation (though, according to him, they have to be \"cute girls\"). This groping is not limited only to Sainan High, but in public, as well.\n\n:A common gag involves the Principal spontaneously shedding his clothes and chasing after a girl he becomes smitten with, which inevitably results in him beaing beaten to a pulp. Once, [[#Ren and Run|Run]] purposefully causes herself to change into Ren to get the principal to leave her be; upon seeing Ren, the principal thinks briefly, then continues to chase him (stating \"This is okay too\").\n\n:Throughout the series, the principal has survived many severe injuries and attacks. Some of these include burning, (by [[#Kyouko|Kyouko]]) beaten up, and on one occasion, almost eaten by a crocodile in the Amazon.\n\n:The unnamed Principal bears a strong resemblance to famed erotic photographer, [[Nobuyoshi Araki]], complete with trademarked, devil horn hair style.\n\n===Haruko Nitta===\n;{{nihongo|Haruko Nitta|\u65b0\u7530 \u6674\u5b50|Nitta Haruko}}\n:{{anime voices|Sakura Nakamura}}\n:[[#Mikan|Mikan]]'s homeroom teacher in Sainan First Elementary School (\u5f69\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c0f\u5b66\u6821 ''Sainan Daiichi Sh\u014dgakk\u014d'').

{"title_page": "Systems Improved Numerical Differential Analyzer", "text_new": "The '''Systems Improved Numerical Differential Analyzer''' (acronym SINDA) is a commercially available software system developed by C&R Technologies that solves resistor-capacitor (R-C) network representations of physical problems governed by [[diffusion|diffusion]] equations. The software was originally designed as a general thermal analyzer for the modeling needs of the spacecraft and launch vehicle thermal community and is currently an integral part of the Thermal Desktop plugin for [[AutoCAD|AutoCAD]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cullimore |first1=B.A. |last2=Ring |first2=S.G. |last3=Johnson |first3=D.A. |title=SINDA/FLUINT User's Manual |date=May 2013 |publisher=C&R Technologies}}</ref>\n\nThe FLUINT (Fluid Integrator) capability was first added to SINDA in 1986. It is a one dimensional thermal/hydraulic code that solves arbitrary fluid flow networks without presuming the application. The networks may contain single-phase vapor or liquid as the working fluid, or combinations of liquid and/or vapor at various locations in the network, mixtures of working fluids and even chemical reactions.

Originally formed in the [[Royal Engineers]] (RE), it was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) at the start of [[World War II]]. It fought with distinction in the defence of [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Calais]] during the [[Battle of France]], in which it was virtually destroyed. Reformed, it helped to protect the cities of [[South Wales]] from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during [[The Blitz]], and later defended the South Coast of England against [[Fighter bomber]] and [[V-1 flying bomb]] attacks. It went to [[Western_Front_(World_War_II)#1944.E2.80.9345:_The_Second_Front|North West Europe]] to defend [[Antwerp]] during the final stages of the war, and served in the [[Gibraltar]] garrison postwar.\n\n==Royal Engineer origins==\n[[File:RE Badge (GVIR).jpg|thumb|Cap badge of the Royal Engineers (cipher of King George VI)]]\nThe [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) had developed an extensive anti-aircraft (AA) searchlight (S/L) organisation during [[World War I]],<ref name=Brigstock>{{Cite web |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/images/images-microsites/RA/RASearchlights-Text-Final.doc |title=Brigstock. |access-date=2017-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518121548/http://www.army.mod.uk/images/images-microsites/RA/RASearchlights-Text-Final.doc |archive-date=2014-05-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Short ''et al''.</ref><ref>Anon, ''RE History'', Vol V, pp. 55\u201368.</ref> but this was quickly reduced after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]].

Although destined to become the largest Regular unit of the RE during the inter-war years, its initial strength was three non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and four [[Sapper|sappers]] under the command of a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Field Artillery]]. It was another year before it got its first RE commanding officer (CO), Lt-Col G.C.E. Elliott, and nearly two years before it received substantial reinforcements, including troops who had operated lorry-mounted searchlights during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. It formed two companies, A and B.

Lt-Col Goldney was appointed AA Defence Commander for the town. The 1st Bn [[Queen Victoria's Rifles]] (QVR), the lead unit of [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Infantry Brigade]], arrived by sea on 22 May, just before advanced German troops began probing the defences.<ref name = Farn57>Farndale, p. 57.</ref><ref name = Rout119>Routledge, p. 119.</ref><ref name = Ellis>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-10.html Ellis, Chapter 10.]</ref><ref>Neave, pp. 29 & 35.</ref> \n\nOn the night of 22/23 May the AA units engaged ''Luftwaffe'' raiders that bombed Calais, starting fires.

His THQ, including a number of stragglers from other units, came under attack by German tanks and aircraft in the evening and he fell back to a small farm in a nearby wood. The following morning, Dothie led an attack on the tanks in their camp, engaging them with Boys and Bren fire. Although the tanks withdrew, Dothie guessed that they would bring up reinforcements and he ordered his men to withdraw, covering their crossing of some open ground with a Bren gun. However, he and the QVR Bren gunner found themselves cut off on the wrong side of the open ground and could not get back to the rendezvous until after dark, by which time the rest of the party had made their way to Calais.<ref name = Dothie>[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7376359 Dothie's detailed citation at TNA file WO 373/60/319.]</ref><ref name = Escapers>[http://www.conscript-heroes.com/Art25-EarlyEscapers.html 'Early Escapers' at WWII Escape and Evasion.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-L05174,_Calais,_kriegsgefangene_britische_Soldaten.jpg|thumb|right|British prisoners being marched away after the fall of Calais, 26 May 1940]]\nIn the town, Goldney formed the S/L and AA troops into a reserve for 30th Brigade, which was manning the outer fortifications. On 24 May 30th Brigade's infantry and the S/L gunners were involved in close-quarter fighting and were forced back to the citadel and the harbour. Many wounded and 'non-fighting' personnel were evacuated on the ''City of Canterbury'' and the ''Kohistan'' and a [[Flotilla]] of [[Destroyers]]. Goldney allowed about 200 AA troops to leave, but ordered the remainder to stay and fight. Hundreds of 'non-fighting' men, including Neave's party, were left at the port and later in the dunes hoping for evacuation. The garrison held out in the citadel and port until 16.00 on 26 May. The survivors, including Goldney and Neave (by now wounded) became [[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of war]] (PoWs). During the final stages and during the night of 26/27 May some of the defenders escaped or were picked up by boats.<ref name = Ellis/><ref>Neave, pp. 65, 96.</ref><ref name = Rout120>Routledge, p. 120.</ref> Reaching the shore, 2nd Lt Dothie volunteered to swim out to a destroyer to arrange evacuation, but could not reach it and had to return to the beach. Wearing nothing more than a blanket at first, he then went on the run for several days before being taken prisoner. Later, he escaped from a PoW column being marched towards Germany, returned to the coast and stole a boat in which he reached [[Alderney]]. Finding that the [[Channel Islands]] were already in enemy hands, he returned to [[Cherbourg]] before making a second successful attempt to reach England by boat. He was awarded a [[Military Cross]] for his exploits.<ref name = Dothie/><ref name =Escapers/> \n\nCalais fell on 26 May, but its three-day defence, holding up [[Heinz Guderian]]'s ''XIX Panzerkorps'', had provided some respite for the Dunkirk evacuation.<ref name = Ellis/><ref name = Latimer/><ref name = Rout120/><ref>Farndale, p. 57.</ref><ref>Neave, p. 208.</ref>\n\n===Dunkirk===\n3rd and 4th Searchlight Btys were withdrawn from the La Bass\u00e9e\u2013B\u00e9thune Canal on 19 and 20 May and sent to provide AA cover at [[Hazebrouck]] and Cassel, which were heavily bombed. 4th S/L Bty sent some S/L lorries to [[Lille]], but these never rejoined. On 22 May a German mechanised column forced a passage over the [[Canal de Neufoss\u00e9]] at [[Blaringhem]] despite the defensive efforts of P Troop, 4th S/L Bty, while N Troop, 4th S/L Bty, was also forced to withdraw. The two troops reached [[Veurne|Furnes]] the following day and dug in along the [[Canal de Furnes|Furnes\u2013Dunkirk Canal]], where they were joined by O Troop and J Troop of 3rd S/L Bty, which had withdrawn from Hazebrouck to [[Spycker]]. All the units were being regularly bombed. On 27 May, 4th S/L Bty was ordered to destroy its S/L equipment and vehicles and move into Dunkirk for evacuation, which occurred in the early hours of 28 May. Finally on 28 May 3rd S/L Bty was also ordered to destroy its equipment and march to Dunkirk docks for evacuation. Both batteries were regularly bombed and machine gunned during the evacuation, suffering several casualties.<ref name = 3BtyWD39/><ref name = 4BtyWD39/>\n\nIt is claimed that only one officer and 57 men of 1st Searchlight Regiment's 52 officers and 1600 men got back to England,<ref name = Brigstock/><ref>Neave, p. 44.</ref> but that must apply only to the two batteries at Calais, the bulk of the other two batteries having been evacuated from Dunkirk. William Dothie got back on 2 August, and Airey Neave later made the first successful British escape from [[Colditz Castle]], reaching England in April 1942. \n\n===Blitz===\nOn return to the UK, 3rd S/L Bty was quickly re-equipped with a reduced number of S/Ls and sent to [[Gibraltar]] in July to bolster the AA defences of the naval base against raids by [[Vichy French Air Force|Vichy French]] and [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian]] bombers.<ref>Routledge, p. 201.</ref> 4th Searchlight Bty joined 2nd S/L Rgt defending airfields in [[South West England]]<ref name = Rout396>Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.</ref><ref>Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.</ref> and later served in [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]].<ref>Routledge, Table XXIX, p. 175.</ref>\n\n1st Searchlight Regiment was reformed at the AA Command Practice Camp at [[Codsall]], near [[Wolverhampton]], on 24 July 1940. The reconstituted unit consisted of 1st, 2nd, 7th and 8th S/L Btys (7th and 8th had served in France with 2nd S/L Rgt), and the replacement personnel were drawn from 477th, 479th and 480th S/L Btys, all of which were newly-raised. For example, 477th S/L Bty had been formed at 217th Searchlight Training Regiment at Bradbury Lines, [[Hereford]], with a cadre of experienced men from  the Territorial [[59th (Warwickshire) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|59th (Warwickshire) S/L Rgt]]. It was intended to join a newly-formed [[76th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|76 S/L Rgt]], but these plans were immediately changed: 477th S/L Bty was disbanded in July and the men posted to 1st S/L Rgt.<ref name = Frederick858/><ref name = FarnM/><ref>War Office letters of 2 & 3 May and 25 July 1940 in 76 S/L Rgt War Diary, 1940\u201341, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]] file WO 166/3096.</ref>\n\nAt the end of September the regiment joined [[45th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|45th AA Brigade]] of [[5th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|5th AA Division]] ([[9th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)|9th AA Division]] from November) to complete the 'Illuminated Area' in [[South Wales]]. At the time, the towns of South Wales, including important coal and oil port facilities, refineries, steelworks and ordnance factories, were under almost nightly air attack (the [[Cardiff Blitz]] and [[Swansea Blitz]]). The regiment's searchlights were deployed under both 45th and [[61st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|61st AA Brigade]], assisting the AA guns of the Cardiff and Swansea Gun Defence Areas, while the S/L detachments occasionally engaged the raiders directly with their LMGs.<ref name = RA39/><ref name = Rout396/><ref>45 AA Bde War Diary 1940, TNA file WO 166/2285.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp 391, 385.</ref><ref>Farndale, Annex D, pp. 258\u20139.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150210182233/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page56.html 9 AA Div at RA 39\u201345.]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/9-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1940-.pdf |title=9 AA Div at British Military History. |access-date=2017-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221209/http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/webeasycms/hold/uploads/bmh_document_pdf/9-Anti-Aircraft-Division-1940-.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe regiment supplied a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of experienced officers and men to 230th S/L Training Rgt at [[Blandford Camp]] where it provided the basis for a new 545 S/L Bty formed on 16 January 1941.

The AA Divisions were disbanded on 30 September and replaced by AA Groups that more closely matched the organisation of [[RAF Fighter Command]]. 27th AA Brigade took responsibility for all S/L units under [[2nd Anti-Aircraft Group (United Kingdom)|2 AA Group]] covering South East England, though 8th S/L Bty was often operationally attached to [[71st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|71 AA Brigade]] in 2 AA Group.<ref>Routledge, pp. 400\u20134.</ref><ref>Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.</ref><ref>Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, TNA file WO 212/84.</ref>\n\nBecause of the continuing hit-and-run raids by ''Luftwaffe'' [[Fighter-bomber]]s, the defensive armament of S/L positions was enhanced, the allocation of LMGs being increased from one to four and then six per S/L site. Later the LMGs in 27th AA Brigade were supplemented with twin [[Vickers K machine gun]] mountings and eventually twin 0.5-inch [[M2 Browning|Browning machine guns]] on power mountings.

However, by March 1944, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for service overseas, including the planned invasion of Normandy ([[Operation Overlord]]). Each of 27th AA Brigade's S/L regiments lost one of its four batteries.

Reformed, it helped to protect the cities of [[South Wales]] from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during [[The Blitz]], and later defended the South Coast of England against [[Fighter bomber]] and [[V-1 flying bomb]] attacks. It went to [[Western_Front_(World_War_II)#1944.E2.80.9345:_The_Second_Front|North West Europe]] to defend [[Antwerp]] during the final stages of the war, and served in the [[Gibraltar]] garrison postwar.\n\n==Royal Engineer origins==\n[[File:RE Badge (GVIR).jpg|thumb|Cap badge of the Royal Engineers (cipher of King George VI)]]\nThe [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) had developed an extensive anti-aircraft (AA) searchlight (S/L) organisation during [[World War I]],<ref name=Brigstock>{{Cite web |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/images/images-microsites/RA/RASearchlights-Text-Final.doc |title=Brigstock. |access-date=2017-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518121548/http://www.army.mod.uk/images/images-microsites/RA/RASearchlights-Text-Final.doc |archive-date=2014-05-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Short ''et al''.</ref><ref>Anon, ''RE History'', Vol V, pp. 55\u201368.</ref> but this was quickly reduced after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]]. The last remnants of Nos 3 and 17 AA Companies moved to [[Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut|Blackdown Camp]] at the end of 1920 to form the nucleus of '''1st AA Battalion, RE''', as part of the newly created [[1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Air Defence Brigade]]. Although destined to become the largest Regular unit of the RE during the inter-war years, its initial strength was three non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and four [[Sapper|sappers]] under the command of a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Field Artillery]]. It was another year before it got its first RE commanding officer (CO), Lt-Col G.C.E. Elliott, and nearly two years before it received substantial reinforcements, including troops who had operated lorry-mounted searchlights during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. It formed two companies, A and B. From early 1925 the battalion also had a detachment at [[Belfast]], but this disappeared in late 1926.<ref name = AnonRE>Anon, ''RE History'', Vol VII, pp. 203\u20134.</ref><ref name = MAL>''Monthly Army List'' (various dates)</ref><ref name = Frederick858>Frederick, pp. 858\u201363.</ref><ref name = W&R>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 107.</ref> \n\nThe main responsibility for AA defence of the United Kingdom was entrusted to the part-time [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], which developed a large-scale organisation under [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] before the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The Regulars of 1st Air Defence Brigade (later 1st AA Brigade) were to provide AA cover for field forces, initially for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) that would go overseas on the outbreak of war. In 1938 it was decided that all coastal and AA searchlights, which operated alongside the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA), would become the responsibility of that corps; however, the transfers had not been completed when war was declared in September 1939. A 2nd AA Battalion, RE, was organised at Blackdown in 1936, but this was disbanded in September 1938 and replaced by [[2nd Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|2nd Searchlight Regiment, RA]].<ref name = Brigstock/><ref name = AnonRE/><ref name = MAL/><ref> Pakenham-Walsh, ''RE History'', Vol VIII, pp. 5, 161.</ref><ref>[https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/04/Anti-Aircraft-Corps-History-Personnel.pdf Robert Palmer, ''A Concise History of Anti-Aircraft Command (History and Personnel)'' at British Military History.]</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Koning_Soldaat.,_item_60.jpg|thumb|right|RA cap badge.]]\n\n===Mobilisation===\n1st AA Battalion, RE, under the command of Lt-Col R.M.

Lt-Col Goldney was appointed AA Defence Commander for the town. The 1st Bn [[Queen Victoria's Rifles]] (QVR), the lead unit of [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Infantry Brigade]], arrived by sea on 22 May, just before advanced German troops began probing the defences.<ref name = Farn57>Farndale, p. 57.</ref><ref name = Rout119>Routledge, p. 119.</ref><ref name = Ellis>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-10.html Ellis, Chapter 10.]</ref><ref>Neave, pp. 29 & 35.</ref> \n\nOn the night of 22/23 May the AA units engaged ''Luftwaffe'' raiders that bombed Calais, starting fires.

The following morning, Dothie led an attack on the tanks in their camp, engaging them with Boys and Bren fire. Although the tanks withdrew, Dothie guessed that they would bring up reinforcements and he ordered his men to withdraw, covering their crossing of some open ground with a Bren gun. However, he and the QVR Bren gunner found themselves cut off on the wrong side of the open ground and could not get back to the rendezvous until after dark, by which time the rest of the party had made their way to Calais.<ref name = Dothie>[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7376359 Dothie's detailed citation at TNA file WO 373/60/319.]</ref><ref name = Escapers>[http://www.conscript-heroes.com/Art25-EarlyEscapers.html 'Early Escapers' at WWII Escape and Evasion.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-L05174,_Calais,_kriegsgefangene_britische_Soldaten.jpg|thumb|right|British prisoners being marched away after the fall of Calais, 26 May 1940]]\nIn the town, Goldney formed the S/L and AA troops into a reserve for 30th Brigade, which was manning the outer fortifications. On 24 May 30th Brigade's infantry and the S/L gunners were involved in close-quarter fighting and were forced back to the citadel and the harbour. Many wounded and 'non-fighting' personnel were evacuated on the ''City of Canterbury'' and the ''Kohistan'' and a [[Flotilla]] of [[Destroyers]]. Goldney allowed about 200 AA troops to leave, but ordered the remainder to stay and fight. Hundreds of 'non-fighting' men, including Neave's party, were left at the port and later in the dunes hoping for evacuation. The garrison held out in the citadel and port until 16.00 on 26 May. The survivors, including Goldney and Neave (by now wounded) became [[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of war]] (PoWs). During the final stages and during the night of 26/27 May some of the defenders escaped or were picked up by boats.<ref name = Ellis/><ref>Neave, pp. 65, 96.</ref><ref name = Rout120>Routledge, p. 120.</ref> Reaching the shore, 2nd Lt Dothie volunteered to swim out to a destroyer to arrange evacuation, but could not reach it and had to return to the beach. Wearing nothing more than a blanket at first, he then went on the run for several days before being taken prisoner. Later, he escaped from a PoW column being marched towards Germany, returned to the coast and stole a boat in which he reached [[Alderney]]. Finding that the [[Channel Islands]] were already in enemy hands, he returned to [[Cherbourg]] before making a second successful attempt to reach England by boat. He was awarded a [[Military Cross]] for his exploits.<ref name = Dothie/><ref name =Escapers/> \n\nCalais fell on 26 May, but its three-day defence, holding up [[Heinz Guderian]]'s ''XIX Panzerkorps'', had provided some respite for the Dunkirk evacuation.<ref name = Ellis/><ref name = Latimer/><ref name = Rout120/><ref>Farndale, p. 57.</ref><ref>Neave, p. 208.</ref>\n\n===Dunkirk===\n3rd and 4th Searchlight Btys were withdrawn from the La Bass\u00e9e\u2013B\u00e9thune Canal on 19 and 20 May and sent to provide AA cover at [[Hazebrouck]] and Cassel, which were heavily bombed. 4th S/L Bty sent some S/L lorries to [[Lille]], but these never rejoined. On 22 May a German mechanised column forced a passage over the [[Canal de Neufoss\u00e9]] at [[Blaringhem]] despite the defensive efforts of P Troop, 4th S/L Bty, while N Troop, 4th S/L Bty, was also forced to withdraw. The two troops reached [[Veurne|Furnes]] the following day and dug in along the [[Canal de Furnes|Furnes\u2013Dunkirk Canal]], where they were joined by O Troop and J Troop of 3rd S/L Bty, which had withdrawn from Hazebrouck to [[Spycker]]. All the units were being regularly bombed. On 27 May, 4th S/L Bty was ordered to destroy its S/L equipment and vehicles and move into Dunkirk for evacuation, which occurred in the early hours of 28 May. Finally on 28 May 3rd S/L Bty was also ordered to destroy its equipment and march to Dunkirk docks for evacuation. Both batteries were regularly bombed and machine gunned during the evacuation, suffering several casualties.<ref name = 3BtyWD39/><ref name = 4BtyWD39/>\n\nIt is claimed that only one officer and 57 men of 1st Searchlight Regiment's 52 officers and 1600 men got back to England,<ref name = Brigstock/><ref>Neave, p. 44.</ref> but that must apply only to the two batteries at Calais, the bulk of the other two batteries having been evacuated from Dunkirk.
