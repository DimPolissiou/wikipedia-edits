Bernardi earned a Bachelor of Arts in Radio-TV (1984) and a Masters of Arts in Media Arts (1988) from the [[University of Arizona]]. He went on to earn a PhD in Film and [[Television Studies]] from [[UCLA]] (1994). He completed a University of California [[postdoctoral research]] fellowship in 1997.\n\nHis main academic interests are [[media studies]], [[narrative theory]], [[critical race theory]], and rumors as narrative IEDS.  His work in media, which is perhaps most well known, emphasizes [[whiteness studies|whiteness]] as a historical formation of meanings. Borrowing from Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation, he argues that whiteness is a historically powerful set of meanings that serves to either implicitly or explicitly dominate the shifting and reforming meaning of race in U.S. media.\n\nBernardi is also a documentary filmmaker<ref>[http://www.eldoradofilms.net/filmmakers/daniel-l-bernardi/ El Dorado Films]</ref>. His current body of work focuses on telling the veteran story. One of his more recent films, [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8075286/ The American War] (2018), tells the story of the Vietnam War from the perspective of the Vietcong. Another used discovered archival footage to tell the story of first World War, and is titled [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9441390/?ref_=rvi_tt The War to End all Wars]. Both films are distributed by [https://www.journeyman.tv/about/about-us Journeyman Pictures].\n\n==Career==\nBernardi has taught film, television and [[new media]] at [[UC Riverside]] (1997\u20131998), [[UCLA]] (1999-2000), Arizona State University (1999-2011), and [[San Francisco State University|SFSU]] (2011\u2013Present). He was awarded a [[Ford Foundation]] Dissertation Fellowship (1994), a UC President's Post-Doctoral Fellowship (1995\u20131997), and a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] (2009).  His deployment to Iraq prevented his acceptance of the Fulbright Fellowship.  From 1998 to 2000, he worked for the [[Sci-Fi Channel]] as a consultant, writer and producer/host of the web feature ''Future Now'' (since deleted).\n\nDaniel Bernardi has earned a reputation of notoriety among the more avid Star Trek fans due to his writings about the role of race in the films.<ref>Los Angeles Times, [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-03-15-mn-42986-story.html Trekking Through College]</ref>\n\nBernardi is also an officer in the [[United States Navy Reserve]]s.  He has served at sea on the {{USS|Coronado|AGF-11|6}}, the {{USS|John C. Stennis|CVN-74}}, the {{USS|Blue Ridge|LCC-19}}, and the {{USS|Cleveland|LPD-7}}, as well as at shore in Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and at the Pentagon with the Chief of Navy Information.  From May 2009 to February 2010 he was recalled to Active Duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for ten months.  In Iraq, Bernardi served with US Special Forces as the Public Affairs Officer for [[Iraqi Special Operations Forces|Special Operations Task Force-Central]], where he trained [[Iraqi Special Operations Forces]] (ISOF) and Emergency Response Brigade (ERB) Soldiers on combat camera and media operations.  He also managed US media embeds, including CNN, NBC and AP, and US Army and US Navy journalists and photographers.  In 2011 he returned to Active Duty for nine months and served as the Mission Public Affairs Officer for [[Pacific Partnership|Pacific Partnership 2011]], an annual humanitarian assistance initiative sponsored by the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]].  Bernardi managed a team of military (U.S., Australian and New Zealand) and NGO (Project Hope) photographers, videographers and writers assigned to document and report on the mission.\n\nFollowing his tour in Iraq and the South Pacific, Bernardi, working with a larger research team including [[H. L. (Bud) Goodall Jr.]], received a $1.6 million renewable grant from the Office of Naval Research to catalogue and study the impact rumors have on counterinsurgency operations. As an example, when multinational forces began a cattle vaccination program in 2005, a rumor spread among the Iraqis that U.S. forcers were poisoning their livestock. Though they had intended on using modern medicine to protect their food supplies, the rumor completely disarmed their efforts. In order to combat such debilitating narratives, Bernardi and his team worked to create a comprehensive database of known Islamist narratives and reveal how these narratives are used to influence populations in the Middle East and North Africa. The hope is that expeditionary forces would have access to these narratives and, through the team's analysis' on hand, work against them.\n\nIn 2012, Bernardi launched the Veteran Documentary Corps <ref>[https://lca.sfsu.edu/centers/vdc College of liberal and Creative  Arts]</ref> (VDC) project. Founded by donations and grants, the VA and National Cemetery Administration including, VDC produces and exhibits short documentaries on the struggles and successes of veterans from across the world.  To-date, VDC has produced and distributed fifty short documentaries <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?companies=co0022187 El Dorado Films IMDB]</ref> on veterans dealing with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), the fall-out of the former \"[[don't ask, don't tell]]\" policy, and a range of other topics.  The films are made by professional filmmakers.  Bernardi acts as executive producer.  He has also directed two of the films, one on [http://www.aspiriant.com/tim-kochis/ Tim Koches] (Vietnam War) and one on Michael Blackwell (Iraq War).  Blackwell was a [[Combat Camera]] photographer that served with Bernardi in the U.S. Iraq War. Bernardi directed many of the films, including the award-winning Noble Sissle\u2019s Syncopated Regime (2019).  Many of the films in the series are directed by professional filmmakers, including [[Jesse Moss (filmmaker)|Jesse Moss]], Andr\u00e9s Gallegos, Sylvia Turchin, Eliciana Nascimento, among others <ref>[http://www.eldoradofilms.net/filmmakers/ El Dorado Films Filmmakers]</ref>.\n\nThe Veteran Documentary Corps was met with wide acclaim, and was received positively from veterans and the public alike. Created in 2018 by Bernardi, El Dorado Films brought superior talent and organization to the Veteran Documentary Corps' mission of creating 100 'shorts' by 2020.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===As author===\n* [https://www.ucpress.edu/blog/29639/off-the-page-screenwriting-in-the-era-of-media-convergence-available-now-for-courses/ Off the Page:  Screenwriting in the Era of Media Convergence (co-author)].  2017.  University of California Press.\n\nExamines the business and craft of screenwriting in the era of media convergence. Daniel Bernardi and Julian Hoxter use the recent history of screenwriting labor coupled with close analysis of scripts in the context of the screenwriting paraindustry\u2014from \u201chow to write a winning script\u201d books to screenwriting software\u2014to explore the state of screenwriting today. They address the conglomerate studios making tentpole movies, expanded television, Indiewood, independent animation, microbudget scripting, the video games industry, and online content creation. Designed for students, producers, and writers who want to understand what studios want and why they want it, this book also examines how scripting is developing in the convergent media, beneath and beyond the Hollywood tentpole. By addressing specific genres across a wide range of media, this essential volume sets the standard for anyone in the expanded screenwriting industry and the scholars that study it.<ref>[https://www.ucpress.edu/blog/29639/off-the-page-screenwriting-in-the-era-of-media-convergence-available-now-for-courses/ University of California Press Blog]</ref>\n\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Landmines-Extremism-Directions-International/dp/0813552516/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1504021833&sr=1-1&keywords=narrative+landmines''Narrative Landmines: Rumors, Islamist Extremism, and the Struggle for Strategic Influence Rumors''] (co-authored).  2012. Rutgers University Press.\n\nBernardi and his co-authors characterize rumors as bits and pieces of prevailing narrative systems and local cultural artifacts, and that their anonymous origin and dubious truth claims afford them a type of concealment until their effects are known and the damage is done.  Focusing on the impact of rumors on counterinsurgency operations (Iraq), counter terrorism whisper campaigns (Indonesia), and civil disobedience online (Singapore), they argue that rumors are ''[[narrative IEDs]]'', or Improvised Explosive Device, in that they\u2019re constructed of locally available materials and hidden in the landscape until detonation.  Bernardi and his co-authors see rumors as similarly ''ad hoc'', constructed of bits and pieces of narrative systems, and lying unseen to the military information operator, diplomat, civic outreach coordinator, or business strategist until exploding and disrupting expensive and highly wrought communication campaigns<ref>[https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/narrative-landmines/9780813552514 Rutgers University Press]</ref>.\n\n*''[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/star-trek-and-history-daniel-leonard-bernardi/1111883392 Star Trek and History:  Race-ing Toward a White Future\". 1998. Rutgers University Press]. {{ISBN|0-8135-2466-0}}\n\nBernardi traces the shifting and reforming meaning of race articulated throughout the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series, feature films, and fan community, investigating and, in his word, \"politicizing\" the presentation of race in ''Star Trek'' in the original series of the 1960s, the feature films and television spin-offs of the 1980s and 1990s, and the current fan community on the Internet. Through both critical and historical analysis, he proposes a method of studying the framing of race in popular film and television that integrates [[sociology]], [[critical theory]] and [[cultural studies]]. Bernardi goes on to examine the representational and narrative functions of [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] in ''Star Trek'' and explores how the meaning of \"race\" in the science fiction series has been facilitated or constrained by creative and network decision-making, by genre, by [[intertextuality]], and by fans. He interprets how the changing social and political movements of the times have influenced the production and meaning of \"Trek\" texts and the ways in which the ongoing series negotiated and reflected these turbulent histories.  Unpopular with many [[Trekker (Star Trek)|Trekker]]s, ''Star Trek and History'' went into a second printing after a year of its original publication.  Other readers feel Bernardi apologies for Star Trek's racial vision.<ref>[https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/star-trek-and-history/9780813524665 Rutgers University Press]</ref>\n\n===As editor===\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Race-American-Film-volumes-Visions/dp/0313398399 Race in American Film: Voices and Visions That Shaped a Nation, Volumes I, II and III].

Rutgers University Press.  {{ISBN|0-8135-2276-5}}\n\nIn these books, Bernardi relies on a range of scholars to show how race in general and whiteness in particular formed unique representational, narrational, and institutional patterns across U.S. film history.  The introductions to each book set out a broad theory of whiteness in American film that, in brief, positions whiteness as a performance about who passes and who doesn't pass as white \u2014 and what it means in specific films and periods of film history to either pass or not pass as white.  The last book in the series, ''Filming Difference'', includes essays and interviews by filmmakers who address critically and creatively how they go about representing race, gender and sexuality in their work.  <!-- Comment moved to Discussion page -->.\n\n===As filmmaker===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLywVcCl5U2n_7XRlxqZZmcewE4iu_LRLx VALOR Film Series]: Stories that honor our country's heroes and their accomplishments.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLywVcCl5U2n-j4vU0dIVoN43CITKWbIsh Legacy Films] (Made in partnership with the National Cemetery Administration): A series of short films on veterans buried in San Francisco and Golden Gate National Cemeteries\u2013 from stories of service in Civil War to Buffalo Soldier, from WWI to Vietnam to Iraq. \n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9377262/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Noble Sissle's Syncopated Ragtime]: In this Academy Awards eligible documentary, Noble Sissle's incredible life spans \"The Harlem Hellfighters\" of World War I, Broadway Theatre, the Civil Rights movement, and decades of Black cultural production in this short, award-winning documentary.\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8777138/?ref_=nm_knf_t1 Guy Hircefeld, A Guy with a Camera]: In this Academy Awards eligible documentary, Guy Hircefeld, a veteran that served in the Israeli military at the start of its occupation of Palestine in the 1980s, now fights against Israeli occupation, ethnic cleansing, and environmental warfare.

Bernardi earned a Bachelor of Arts in Radio-TV (1984) and a Masters of Arts in Media Arts (1988) from the [[University of Arizona]]. He went on to earn a PhD in Film and [[Television Studies]] from [[UCLA]] (1994). He completed a University of California [[postdoctoral research]] fellowship in 1997.\n\nHis main academic interests are [[media studies]], [[narrative theory]], [[critical race theory]], and rumors as narrative IEDS.  His work in media, which is perhaps most well known, emphasizes [[whiteness studies|whiteness]] as a historical formation of meanings. Borrowing from Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation, he argues that whiteness is a historically powerful set of meanings that serves to either implicitly or explicitly dominate the shifting and reforming meaning of race in U.S. media.\n\nBernardi is also a documentary filmmaker<ref>[http://www.eldoradofilms.net/filmmakers/daniel-l-bernardi/ El Dorado Films]</ref>. His current body of work focuses on telling the veteran story. One of his more recent films, [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8075286/ The American War] (2018), tells the story of the Vietnam War from the perspective of the Vietcong. Another used discovered archival footage to tell the story of first World War, and is titled [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9441390/?ref_=rvi_tt The War to End all Wars]. Both films are distributed by [https://www.journeyman.tv/about/about-us Journeyman Pictures].\n\n==Career==\nBernardi has taught film, television and [[new media]] at [[UC Riverside]] (1997\u20131998), [[UCLA]] (1999-2000), Arizona State University (1999-2011), and [[San Francisco State University|SFSU]] (2011\u2013Present). He was awarded a [[Ford Foundation]] Dissertation Fellowship (1994), a UC President's Post-Doctoral Fellowship (1995\u20131997), and a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] (2009).  His deployment to Iraq prevented his acceptance of the Fulbright Fellowship.  From 1998 to 2000, he worked for the [[Sci-Fi Channel]] as a consultant, writer and producer/host of the web feature ''Future Now'' (since deleted).\n\nDaniel Bernardi has earned a reputation of notoriety among the more avid Star Trek fans due to his writings about the role of race in the films.<ref>Los Angeles Times, [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-03-15-mn-42986-story.html Trekking Through College]</ref>\n\nBernardi is also an officer in the [[United States Navy Reserve]]s.  He has served at sea on the {{USS|Coronado|AGF-11|6}}, the {{USS|John C. Stennis|CVN-74}}, the {{USS|Blue Ridge|LCC-19}}, and the {{USS|Cleveland|LPD-7}}, as well as at shore in Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and at the Pentagon with the Chief of Navy Information.  From May 2009 to February 2010 he was recalled to Active Duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for ten months.  In Iraq, Bernardi served with US Special Forces as the Public Affairs Officer for [[Iraqi Special Operations Forces|Special Operations Task Force-Central]], where he trained [[Iraqi Special Operations Forces]] (ISOF) and Emergency Response Brigade (ERB) Soldiers on combat camera and media operations.  He also managed US media embeds, including CNN, NBC and AP, and US Army and US Navy journalists and photographers.  In 2011 he returned to Active Duty for nine months and served as the Mission Public Affairs Officer for [[Pacific Partnership|Pacific Partnership 2011]], an annual humanitarian assistance initiative sponsored by the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]].  Bernardi managed a team of military (U.S., Australian and New Zealand) and NGO (Project Hope) photographers, videographers and writers assigned to document and report on the mission.\n\nFollowing his tour in Iraq and the South Pacific, Bernardi, working with a larger research team including [[H. L. (Bud) Goodall Jr.]], received a $1.6 million renewable grant from the Office of Naval Research to catalogue and study the impact rumors have on counterinsurgency operations. As an example, when multinational forces began a cattle vaccination program in 2005, a rumor spread among the Iraqis that U.S. forcers were poisoning their livestock. Though they had intended on using modern medicine to protect their food supplies, the rumor completely disarmed their efforts. In order to combat such debilitating narratives, Bernardi and his team worked to create a comprehensive database of known Islamist narratives and reveal how these narratives are used to influence populations in the Middle East and North Africa. The hope is that expeditionary forces would have access to these narratives and, through the team's analysis' on hand, work against them.\n\nIn 2012, Bernardi launched the Veteran Documentary Corps <ref>[https://lca.sfsu.edu/centers/vdc College of liberal and Creative  Arts]</ref> (VDC) project. Founded by donations and grants, the VA and National Cemetery Administration including, VDC produces and exhibits short documentaries on the struggles and successes of veterans from across the world.  To-date, VDC has produced and distributed fifty short documentaries <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?companies=co0022187 El Dorado Films IMDB]</ref> on veterans dealing with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), the fall-out of the former \"[[don't ask, don't tell]]\" policy, and a range of other topics.  The films are made by professional filmmakers.  Bernardi acts as executive producer.  He has also directed two of the films, one on [http://www.aspiriant.com/tim-kochis/ Tim Koches] (Vietnam War) and one on Michael Blackwell (Iraq War).  Blackwell was a [[Combat Camera]] photographer that served with Bernardi in the U.S. Iraq War. Bernardi directed many of the films, including the award-winning Noble Sissle\u2019s Syncopated Regime (2019).  Many of the films in the series are directed by professional filmmakers, including [[Jesse Moss]], Andr\u00e9s Gallegos, Sylvia Turchin, Eliciana Nascimento, among others <ref>[http://www.eldoradofilms.net/filmmakers/ El Dorado Films Filmmakers]</ref>.\n\nThe Veteran Documentary Corps was met with wide acclaim, and was received positively from veterans and the public alike. Created in 2018 by Bernardi, El Dorado Films brought superior talent and organization to the Veteran Documentary Corps' mission of creating 100 'shorts' by 2020.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===As author===\n* [https://www.ucpress.edu/blog/29639/off-the-page-screenwriting-in-the-era-of-media-convergence-available-now-for-courses/ Off the Page:  Screenwriting in the Era of Media Convergence (co-author)].  2017.  University of California Press.\n\nExamines the business and craft of screenwriting in the era of media convergence. Daniel Bernardi and Julian Hoxter use the recent history of screenwriting labor coupled with close analysis of scripts in the context of the screenwriting paraindustry\u2014from \u201chow to write a winning script\u201d books to screenwriting software\u2014to explore the state of screenwriting today. They address the conglomerate studios making tentpole movies, expanded television, Indiewood, independent animation, microbudget scripting, the video games industry, and online content creation. Designed for students, producers, and writers who want to understand what studios want and why they want it, this book also examines how scripting is developing in the convergent media, beneath and beyond the Hollywood tentpole. By addressing specific genres across a wide range of media, this essential volume sets the standard for anyone in the expanded screenwriting industry and the scholars that study it.<ref>[https://www.ucpress.edu/blog/29639/off-the-page-screenwriting-in-the-era-of-media-convergence-available-now-for-courses/ University of California Press Blog]</ref>\n\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Landmines-Extremism-Directions-International/dp/0813552516/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1504021833&sr=1-1&keywords=narrative+landmines''Narrative Landmines: Rumors, Islamist Extremism, and the Struggle for Strategic Influence Rumors''] (co-authored).  2012. Rutgers University Press.\n\nBernardi and his co-authors characterize rumors as bits and pieces of prevailing narrative systems and local cultural artifacts, and that their anonymous origin and dubious truth claims afford them a type of concealment until their effects are known and the damage is done.  Focusing on the impact of rumors on counterinsurgency operations (Iraq), counter terrorism whisper campaigns (Indonesia), and civil disobedience online (Singapore), they argue that rumors are ''[[narrative IEDs]]'', or Improvised Explosive Device, in that they\u2019re constructed of locally available materials and hidden in the landscape until detonation.  Bernardi and his co-authors see rumors as similarly ''ad hoc'', constructed of bits and pieces of narrative systems, and lying unseen to the military information operator, diplomat, civic outreach coordinator, or business strategist until exploding and disrupting expensive and highly wrought communication campaigns<ref>[https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/narrative-landmines/9780813552514 Rutgers University Press]</ref>.\n\n*''[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/star-trek-and-history-daniel-leonard-bernardi/1111883392 Star Trek and History:  Race-ing Toward a White Future\". 1998. Rutgers University Press]. {{ISBN|0-8135-2466-0}}\n\nBernardi traces the shifting and reforming meaning of race articulated throughout the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series, feature films, and fan community, investigating and, in his word, \"politicizing\" the presentation of race in ''Star Trek'' in the original series of the 1960s, the feature films and television spin-offs of the 1980s and 1990s, and the current fan community on the Internet. Through both critical and historical analysis, he proposes a method of studying the framing of race in popular film and television that integrates [[sociology]], [[critical theory]] and [[cultural studies]]. Bernardi goes on to examine the representational and narrative functions of [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] in ''Star Trek'' and explores how the meaning of \"race\" in the science fiction series has been facilitated or constrained by creative and network decision-making, by genre, by [[intertextuality]], and by fans. He interprets how the changing social and political movements of the times have influenced the production and meaning of \"Trek\" texts and the ways in which the ongoing series negotiated and reflected these turbulent histories.  Unpopular with many [[Trekker (Star Trek)|Trekker]]s, ''Star Trek and History'' went into a second printing after a year of its original publication.  Other readers feel Bernardi apologies for Star Trek's racial vision.<ref>[https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/star-trek-and-history/9780813524665 Rutgers University Press]</ref>\n\n===As editor===\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Race-American-Film-volumes-Visions/dp/0313398399 Race in American Film: Voices and Visions That Shaped a Nation, Volumes I, II and III].

The introductions to each book set out a broad theory of whiteness in American film that, in brief, positions whiteness as a performance about who passes and who doesn't pass as white \u2014 and what it means in specific films and periods of film history to either pass or not pass as white.  The last book in the series, ''Filming Difference'', includes essays and interviews by filmmakers who address critically and creatively how they go about representing race, gender and sexuality in their work.  <!-- Comment moved to Discussion page -->.\n\n===As filmmaker===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLywVcCl5U2n_7XRlxqZZmcewE4iu_LRLx VALOR Film Series]: Stories that honor our country's heroes and their accomplishments.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLywVcCl5U2n-j4vU0dIVoN43CITKWbIsh Legacy Films] (Made in partnership with the National Cemetery Administration): A series of short films on veterans buried in San Francisco and Golden Gate National Cemeteries\u2013 from stories of service in Civil War to Buffalo Soldier, from WWI to Vietnam to Iraq. \n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9377262/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Noble Sissle's Syncopated Ragtime]: In this Academy Awards eligible documentary, Noble Sissle's incredible life spans \"The Harlem Hellfighters\" of World War I, Broadway Theatre, the Civil Rights movement, and decades of Black cultural production in this short, award-winning documentary.\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8777138/?ref_=nm_knf_t1 Guy Hircefeld, A Guy with a Camera]: In this Academy Awards eligible documentary, Guy Hircefeld, a veteran that served in the Israeli military at the start of its occupation of Palestine in the 1980s, now fights against Israeli occupation, ethnic cleansing, and environmental warfare.

(Museo Naval, Madrid)]]\n\n'''Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra''' (22 May 1743 \u2013 26 March 1794) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] naval officer born in [[Lima, Peru]]. Assigned to the Pacific coast [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval Department]] base at [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], in the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (present day [[Mexico]]), this [[navigator]] explored the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] of [[North America]] as far north as present day [[Alaska]].\n\nJuan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra joined the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval]] Academy in [[C\u00e1diz]] at 19, and four years later, in 1767 was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the rank Frigate Ensign (''alf\u00e9rez de fragata''). In 1773 he was promoted to Ship Ensign (''alf\u00e9rez de nav\u00edo''), and in 1774 to Ship Lieutenant (''teniente de nav\u00edo'').\n\n==Parentage==\nBodega y Quadra was born in Lima, Peru, to Tom\u00e1s de la Bodega y de las Llanas of [[Biscay]], [[Spain]] and Francisca de Mollinedo y Losada of [[Lima, Peru]] (her parents were from [[Bilbao]] in Spain).  His family was of Basque origin.<ref name=majors>{{Cite book| last1 = Mozi\u00f1o | first1 = Jos\u00e9 Mariano | last2 = Engstrand | first2 = Iris Wilson | title = Noticias De Nutka: An Account of Nootka Sound in 1792 | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | page = xliii | isbn = 9780295971032}}</ref> He studied at [[National University of San Marcos]] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].\n\n==Pacific expeditions==\n\n===1775 expedition===\nIn 1775 under the command of Lieutenant [[Bruno de Heceta]], the Spanish explored the [[Pacific Northwest]]. This followed the first Spanish expedition by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] in 1774, who had failed to reach and claim the upper northwest coast for Spain. The expedition consisted of two ships: the ''Santiago'' (alias ''Nueva Galicia''<ref name=sala/>), commanded by Hezeta himself, and the schooner ''Sonora'' (alias ''Felicidad'',<ref name=sala>{{cite book |last= Rodr\u00edguez Sala |first= Mar\u00eda Luisa |title= De San Blas Hasta la Alta California: Los Viajes y Diarios de Juan Joseph P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez |publisher= Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-970-32-3474-5 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zcjBYIPI9J8C |language= Spanish |page= 35}}</ref> also known as ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe''), commanded by his second in command, Lieutenant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra. Bodega y Quadra was given the lesser position of [[second mate|second officer]] on the ''Sonora'' despite the fact that he outranked the others. Bodega y Quadra had all the training and qualifications necessary to be considered for a senior officer position, but as a [[Peninsulars|non-Spaniard]] he was subject to the class prejudice common to Spain and the colonial Americas during that time. So he was passed over for promotions.\n\nThe Spaniards were given orders to explore the coast and to go ashore so that the newly discovered territories would be recognized as Spanish lands. Most important for the expedition was the identification of [[Russian America|colonial Russian]] settlements. The ships left [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], New Spain, on 16 March 1775. Illnesses ([[scurvy]]), storms, poor sailing capacities of the ''Sonora'', and other incidents slowed their progress.\n\nOn 13 July 1775, they reached the vicinity of [[Point Grenville]] and [[Destruction Island]] in the present day U.S. state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. While searching for a safe place for the ships to anchor, which was one of the duties of the ''Sonora'', Bodega y Quadra sailed over what is now called [[Sonora Reef]]. He immediately realized his mistake and signaled the ''Santiago'' to not follow. The wind direction and changing tide trapped the ''Sonora'' between Sonora Reef and Point Grenville. The ''Santiago'' anchored a few miles to the south, in Grenville Bay. The ''Sonora'' attracted the attention of a nearby [[Quinault (tribe)|Quinault]] village. Many Quinault visited the schooner, trading with the crew and giving gifts of food. Early the next day an armed party from the ''Santiago'' went ashore and quickly conducted a possession ceremony, which was observed by some Quinaults. Later that morning, Bodega y Quadra decided to send six sailors ashore to collect water and wood. A large number of Quinaults appeared, attacked, and killed the shore party. Bodega y Quadra was unable to help as the party had taken the schooner's only boat. At noon he weighed anchor, hoping to escape the shoals at high tide. Progress was slow as the wind was low and the crew significantly reduced. Nine large canoes carrying about 30 Quinaults carrying bows and shields followed and came alongside the ''Sonora''. They made signs of friendship which Bodega y Quadra rejected. The Quinaults in one of the canoes approached in an attempt to board the ''Sonora'', but once the canoe was in range of the schooner's two swivel guns and three muskets it was fired upon, killing \"the greater number of them\", according to Bodega's journal.\n\nBodega wanted to avenge his lost sailors, but, was overruled by Heceta, who pointed out the expedition had orders to use force only in self-defense. Quinault ethnologists have come up with theories about the sudden attack, one being that the land-claiming ceremony was understood for what it was. Of particular note was the placement of a large cross on the beach. The Quinault would have understood that the erecting of a tall pole with a crossbar during an obviously religious ritual was a symbolically powerful act.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=25\u201329}}\n\nShaken by this disaster, and with most of his crew suffering from scurvy, Hezeta decided to return to New Spain, but Bodega y Quadra refused to follow him without having completed the essential mission, which was to locate the Russians. He continued northward on the ''Sonora'' and got as far as what is now close to [[Sitka, Alaska]], reaching 59\u00b0 north latitude on August 15, 1775.<ref name=Sanchez>{{cite journal\n | last = Sanchez\n | first = Antonio\n | title = Spanish Exploration: Hezeta (Heceta) and Bodega y Quadra Expedition of 1775 to Formally Claim the Pacific Northwest for Spain\n | journal = \n | volume = \n | issue = Essay 5688\n | pages = \n | publisher = [[HistoryLink.org]]\n | location = \n | date = 14 April 2004\n | url = http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=5688\n | issn = \n | doi = \n | id = \n | accessdate = 14 September 2009}}</ref> Failing to find any Russians, he returned southward. When returning he made sure that he landed once to claim the coast for Spain. This expedition made it clear to the Spanish that the [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian colonization]] did not have a large presence in the Pacific Northwest. Bodega y Quadra was able to draw for the first time a reasonably accurate map of the west coast of North America.<ref>Derek Hayes,'Historical Atlas of the North Pacific Ocean', page 91</ref>\n\n===1779 expedition===\nOn February 11, 1779 the [[corvettes]] ''[[La Princesa (1778)|Princesa]]'' and ''Favorita'', under the command of Lieutenant [[Ignacio de Arteaga]] and his second in command, Lieutenant Bodega y Quadra, left San Blas again.  Their mission was to explore the northwest coast, and not to intervene with the assumed English navigators there. They charted every bay and inlet in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], going north to 58\u00b030\u2032 before turning back from Alaska due to bad weather. They completed the complex process begun earlier of claiming the Pacific Northwest for Spain.\n\nThe expedition anchored in [[Port Etches]], near [[Prince William Sound]]. The harbor was given the name \"Puerto de Santiago\" on July 23, 1779. The name commemorated [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], the [[patron saint]] of Spain, whose [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] falls on July 25.<ref>{{GNIS|1424573|Port Etches}}</ref> While the Spaniards were anchored in Port Etches they performed a formal possession ceremony. All the officers and chaplains went ashore in procession, raised a large cross while cannons and muskets fired salutes. The ''Te Deum'' was sung, followed by a litany and prayers. After a sermon was preached a formal deed of possession was drawn up and signed by the officers and chaplains. The title to Puerto de Santiago was important for years afterward, as it formed the basis of Spain's claim to sovereignty in the North Pacific up to 61\u00b017\u2032N.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=94\u201395}}\n\nIn 1780 Bodega y Quadra was promoted to ''capit\u00e1n de fragata'' ([[Frigate Captain]]), in recognition of his achievements during the 1779 voyage.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|page=111}}\n\n==Peru==\nIn 1780 Bodega was ordered to sail to the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] in order to acquire quicksilver ([[Mercury (element)|mercury]]), which was required by the Mexican silver mining industry. The supply of quicksilver had fallen sharply because the ships that would normally have delivered it had been diverted elsewhere due to the war with Britain. After many delays, Bodega sailed the old frigate ''Santiago'' from San Blas on 5 June 1781. The voyage was plagued by difficulties, such as continually contrary winds and bad weather. The ''Santiago'' took on so much water it needed to be [[Careening|careened]], but there was no opportunity to do so until in Peru. Bodega finally reached [[Callao]], [[Peru]], on 18 July 1782, thirteen months after sailing from San Blas. He soon discovered that there was no surplus quicksilver to be had. The [[List of Viceroys of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]], [[Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui]], had heard of Bodega's mission before Bodega arrived and decided to expedite matters by sending all the quicksilver he could spare to [[Acapulco]] on the merchant ship ''San Pablo''. Wishing not to return without any cargo, Bodega arranged to carry military supplies. The ''Santiago'' was careened and many rotten planks were replaced. Bodega sailed from Callao at the end of March 1783, carrying the cargo of military supplies and a number of passengers. The voyage north went smoothly, and Bodega anchored the ''Santiago'' at San Blas on 20 June 1783.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=115-120}}\n\n==Spain==\nShortly after Bodega's return to San Blas he received orders to go to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. There, in 1784, he requested and received permission to travel to Spain, which he did in 1785. He spent four mostly discouraging and frustrating years in Spain. However, there were at least two positive events. First, the king approved Bodega's promotion to ''capit\u00e1n de nav\u00edo'' (Ship Captain) on 15 November 1786, the highest naval rank below [[flag officer]] ranks. Second, he was knighted by the King of Spain as a full-fledged knight of the [[Order of Santiago]]&mdash;the most prestigious of Spain's four orders of chivalry. It was very difficult to earn a commission in the Order of Santiago. Bodega had begun the process in 1775. He was finally knighted by the king on 8 April 1788.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=122-128}}\n\n==Commandant of San Blas==\nAt the end of his stay in Spain, Bodega was appointed commandant of the Naval Department of San Blas. Instructed to select six junior officers to serve under him at San Blas, Bodega y Quadra chose [[Manuel Quimper]], Ram\u00f3n Saavedra Guir\u00e1ldez y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, [[Francisco de Eliza]], [[Salvador Fidalgo]], [[Jacinto Caama\u00f1o]], and Salvador Men\u00e9ndez Vald\u00e9s. Bodega and these six officers sailed to America on the same ship that was carrying the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain|Viceroy of New Spain]], [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Conde de Revillagigedo]]. The viceroy and Bodega arrived to find themselves in the immediate aftermath of the [[Nootka Crisis]]. They had two pressing issues to deal with right away. First they had to arrange for the release of the British ships, officers, and sailors taken prisoner by Mart\u00ednez in 1789. Second, they had to respond to the Royal Order of April 14, 1789, which required that the Spanish establishment at [[Nootka Sound]] be maintained. At first neither Revillagigedo nor Bodega knew that Mart\u00ednez had abandoned Nootka Sound. The Royal Order thus meant that a new expedition be immediately organized for the purpose of reoccupying, permanently, Nootka Sound. The reoccupation expedition was organized very quickly.\n\nThe three ships, ''Concepci\u00f3n'', ''San Carlos'', and ''Princesa Real'' sailed from San Blas and arrived at Nootka Sound in early April 1790. Francisco de Eliza was appointed commandant. Quimper, Fidalgo, and other officers were part of the expedition. The First Company of the [[Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia]], under [[Pedro de Alberni]], sailed with Eliza to garrison the Nootka establishment. The expedition had to be well supplied, not only with cannons and munitions but also with warm clothes, new equipment for the soldiers under Alberni, materials for constructing buildings and [[Fort San Miguel]], thousands of sheets of copper for trading or giving to the indigenous peoples, and numerous other goods. That Bodega y Quadra was able to organize the complicated logistical issues, especially given San Blas's chronically undersupplied and underfunded status, such that the ships sailed within months of Bodega's arrival, was a remarkable achievement.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=124-125, 134-136, 143-150}}\n\n===Nootka Sound Commandant===\nQuadra was called as an expert witness in the aftermath of the [[Nootka Crisis]] at [[Nootka Sound]].<ref name=naish>{{cite book\n|author=Naish, John\n|title=The Interwoven Lives of George Vancouver, Archibald Menzies, Joseph Whidbey and Peter Puget: The Vancouver Voyage of 1791-1795 \n|publisher=The Edward Mellen Press, Ltd.\n|year=1996|isbn=0-7734-8857-X}}</ref> In 1789, as the Commandant based at [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], he sent out several new expeditions of exploration.  In 1791 he was appointed Spanish commissioner to negotiate and administer the implementation of the [[Nootka Convention]]s at Nootka Sound.\n\nAs commandant of the Spanish establishment at Nootka, Bodega made a point of hosting and entertaining every visitor, indigenous and European. He held feasts for the officers of every ship that arrived at Nootka Sound, including the French fur-trading ship ''La Flavie'', the \"Portuguese\" ship ''Feliz Aventureira'' (actually a British ship masquerading as Portuguese), the American ships ''[[Columbia Rediviva|Columbia]]'', under [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]], and {{ship||Hope|1764 ship|2}}, under [[Joseph Ingraham]], Vancouver's ships {{HMS|Discovery|1789|6}} and {{HMS|Chatham|1788|2}}, and a number of others. The journals of many people who visited Nootka Sound during the summer of 1792 record amazement at the grandeur of Bodega's dinners, especially at such a remote part of the world, at which over fifty people would be served many courses on Bodega's personal collection of about 300 pieces of silver dinner ware. Bodega also provided ship repair services to any vessel needing them. A number of ships, including the ''Chatham'', were [[Careening|careened]] and repaired by Spanish workers.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=225-229}}\n\n===Island of Quadra and Vancouver===\nIn August 1792, Bodega welcomed English Captain [[George Vancouver]].<ref name=puget>{{cite book\n|author1=Wing, Robert  |author2=Newell, Gordon\n|title=Peter Puget: Lieutenant on the Vancouver Expedition, fighting British naval officer, the man for whom Puget Sound was named \n|publisher=Gray Beard Publishing\n|year=1979|isbn=0-933686-00-5}}</ref> The two commanders swiftly established friendly relations, including joint explorations and the sharing of supplies and information. Vancouver provided the services of his surgeon, [[Archibald Menzies]], to help Quadra with increasingly serious headaches. During their meetings Bodega y Quadra asked Vancouver to name \"some port or Island after us both\" (however, Bodega wrote in his journal that it was Vancouver who made the suggestion). Since Vancouver had determined that the land upon which Nootka stood was a great island, he proposed that they name it ''Quadra's and Vancouver's Island'': \"would name some port or island after us both in commemoration of our meeting and friendly intercourse that on that occasion had taken place (Vancouver had previously feted Quadra on his ship);....and conceiving no place more eligible than the place of our meeting, I have therefore named this land...'''The Island of Quadra and Vancouver'''.\" It was thus entered upon the explorer's charts, but this name was later shortened to [[Vancouver Island]].\n\nHowever, the two commanders were unable to reconcile the conflicts in the instructions from their respective governments. At issue was whether the Spanish were to hand over only the small plot of land actually built upon by the adventurer [[John Meares]], or the entire West Coast, or something in between. It is scarcely contested that Meares had exaggerated the extent of his discoveries. However, Bodega y Quadra was handicapped by uncertainties as to how far his superiors' wished to maintain Spanish sovereignty in a part of the world that had limited strategic value. He improvised and by chance pressed for exactly the condition that both the king and viceroy later communicated to him. Vancouver was likewise handicapped by a lack of instructions. He stuck by a strictly literal interpretation of Article I of the [[Nootka Convention]]. Having reached an impasse, the two agreed to refer the points at issue back to their respective governments in [[Madrid]] and [[London]]; Quadra arranged passage for Vancouver's envoy, [[William Robert Broughton]], through Mexico. Viceroy Revillagigedo chastised Bodega for allowing Broughton passage through New Spain. Eventually, Spain and [[Great Britain]] signed an agreement on January 11, 1794,<ref>{{cite conference| title =The Evacuation of Nootka| booktitle =Canadian Military Heritage| publisher =Government of Canada| url =http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_346.asp?flash=1| accessdate =14 September 2009| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070223121910/http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_346.asp?flash=1| archivedate =23 February 2007}}</ref> in which they agreed to abandon the region (the third [[Nootka Convention]]).\n\n==Death==\nAfter suffering from chronic headaches for several years, in April 1793 Bodega y Quadra requested a leave from his duties to restore his health. It was granted and he left San Blas for [[Guadalajara]] and [[Mexico City]]. He suffered a strong ''fluxo de sangre'' (blood loss or haemorrhage) in Guadalajara. He had a seizure in [[Mexico City]] and died there on March 26, 1794, at the age of 50. The internist Dr. John Naish has conjectured that Bodega y Quadra's death was the result of either a [[brain tumor]] or the severest form of [[hypertension]]. Given the lack of details and the imprecision contemporary diagnosis and description, [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Viceroy Revillagigedo's]] official statement that Bodega died \"of natural causes\" is indisputable.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=327-330}}\n\nWhen George Vancouver, at Nootka Sound again in September 1794, learned of Bodega's death, he wrote in his journal (grammar and misspellings from the original):\n\n{{quote |text=\"The death of our highly valuable and much esteemed friend Senr Quadra, who in the month of March had died at St. Blas, universally lamaneted.

(Museo Naval, Madrid)]]\n\n'''Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra''' (22 May 1743 \u2013 26 March 1794) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] naval officer born in [[Lima, Peru]]. Assigned to the Pacific coast [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval Department]] base at [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], in the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (present day [[Mexico]]), this [[navigator]] explored the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] of [[North America]] as far north as present day [[Alaska]].\n\nJuan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra joined the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval]] Academy in [[C\u00e1diz]] at 19, and four years later, in 1767 was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the rank Frigate Ensign (''alf\u00e9rez de fragata''). In 1773 he was promoted to Ship Ensign (''alf\u00e9rez de nav\u00edo''), and in 1774 to Ship Lieutenant (''teniente de nav\u00edo'').\n\n==Parentage==\nBodega y Quadra was born in Lima, Peru, to Tom\u00e1s de la Bodega y de las Llanas of [[Biscay]], [[Spain]] and Francisca de Mollinedo y Losada of [[Lima, Peru]] (her parents were from [[Bilbao]] in Spain).  His family was of Basque origin.<ref name=majors>{{Cite book| last1 = Mozi\u00f1o | first1 = Jos\u00e9 Mariano | last2 = Engstrand | first2 = Iris Wilson | title = Noticias De Nutka: An Account of Nootka Sound in 1792 | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | page = xliii | isbn = 9780295971032}}</ref> He studied at [[National University of San Marcos]] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].\n\n==Pacific expeditions==\n\n===1775 expedition===\nIn 1775 under the command of Lieutenant [[Bruno de Heceta]], the Spanish explored the [[Pacific Northwest]]. This followed the first Spanish expedition by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] in 1774, who had failed to reach and claim the upper northwest coast for Spain. The expedition consisted of two ships: the ''Santiago'' (alias ''Nueva Galicia''<ref name=sala/>), commanded by Hezeta himself, and the schooner ''Sonora'' (alias ''Felicidad'',<ref name=sala>{{cite book |last= Rodr\u00edguez Sala |first= Mar\u00eda Luisa |title= De San Blas Hasta la Alta California: Los Viajes y Diarios de Juan Joseph P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez |publisher= Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-970-32-3474-5 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zcjBYIPI9J8C |language= Spanish |page= 35}}</ref> also known as ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe''), commanded by his second in command, Lieutenant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra. Bodega y Quadra was given the lesser position of [[second mate|second officer]] on the ''Sonora'' despite the fact that he outranked the others. Bodega y Quadra had all the training and qualifications necessary to be considered for a senior officer position, but as a [[Peninsulars|non-Spaniard]] he was subject to the class prejudice common to Spain and the colonial Americas during that time. So he was passed over for promotions.\n\nThe Spaniards were given orders to explore the coast and to go ashore so that the newly discovered territories would be recognized as Spanish lands. Most important for the expedition was the identification of [[Russian America|colonial Russian]] settlements. The ships left [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], New Spain, on 16 March 1775. Illnesses ([[scurvy]]), storms, poor sailing capacities of the ''Sonora'', and other incidents slowed their progress.\n\nOn 13 July 1775, they reached the vicinity of [[Point Grenville]] and [[Destruction Island]] in the present day U.S. state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. While searching for a safe place for the ships to anchor, which was one of the duties of the ''Sonora'', Bodega y Quadra sailed over what is now called [[Sonora Reef]]. He immediately realized his mistake and signaled the ''Santiago'' to not follow. The wind direction and changing tide trapped the ''Sonora'' between Sonora Reef and Point Grenville. The ''Santiago'' anchored a few miles to the south, in Grenville Bay. The ''Sonora'' attracted the attention of a nearby [[Quinault (tribe)|Quinault]] village. Many Quinault visited the schooner, trading with the crew and giving gifts of food. Early the next day an armed party from the ''Santiago'' went ashore and quickly conducted a possession ceremony, which was observed by some Quinaults. Later that morning, Bodega y Quadra decided to send six sailors ashore to collect water and wood. A large number of Quinaults appeared, attacked, and killed the shore party. Bodega y Quadra was unable to help as the party had taken the schooner's only boat. At noon he weighed anchor, hoping to escape the shoals at high tide. Progress was slow as the wind was low and the crew significantly reduced. Nine large canoes carrying about 30 Quinaults carrying bows and shields followed and came alongside the ''Sonora''. They made signs of friendship which Bodega y Quadra rejected. The Quinaults in one of the canoes approached in an attempt to board the ''Sonora'', but once the canoe was in range of the schooner's two swivel guns and three muskets it was fired upon, killing \"the greater number of them\", according to Bodega's journal.\n\nBodega wanted to avenge his lost sailors, but, was overruled by Heceta, who pointed out the expedition had orders to use force only in self-defense. Quinault ethnologists have come up with theories about the sudden attack, one being that the land-claiming ceremony was understood for what it was. Of particular note was the placement of a large cross on the beach. The Quinault would have understood that the erecting of a tall pole with a crossbar during an obviously religious ritual was a symbolically powerful act.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=25\u201329}}\n\nShaken by this disaster, and with most of his crew suffering from scurvy, Hezeta decided to return to New Spain, but Bodega y Quadra refused to follow him without having completed the essential mission, which was to locate the Russians. He continued northward on the ''Sonora'' and got as far as what is now close to [[Sitka, Alaska]], reaching 59\u00b0 north latitude on August 15, 1775.<ref name=Sanchez>{{cite journal\n | last = Sanchez\n | first = Antonio\n | title = Spanish Exploration: Hezeta (Heceta) and Bodega y Quadra Expedition of 1775 to Formally Claim the Pacific Northwest for Spain\n | journal = \n | volume = \n | issue = Essay 5688\n | pages = \n | publisher = [[HistoryLink.org]]\n | location = \n | date = 14 April 2004\n | url = http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=5688\n | issn = \n | doi = \n | id = \n | accessdate = 14 September 2009}}</ref> Failing to find any Russians, he returned southward. When returning he made sure that he landed once to claim the coast for Spain. This expedition made it clear to the Spanish that the [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian colonization]] did not have a large presence in the Pacific Northwest. Bodega y Quadra was able to draw for the first time a reasonably accurate map of the west coast of North America.<ref>Derek Hayes,'Historical Atlas of the North Pacific Ocean', page 91</ref>\n\n===1779 expedition===\nOn February 11, 1779 the [[corvettes]] ''[[La Princesa (1778)|Princesa]]'' and ''Favorita'', under the command of Lieutenant [[Ignacio de Arteaga]] and his second in command, Lieutenant Bodega y Quadra, left San Blas again.  Their mission was to explore the northwest coast, and not to intervene with the assumed English navigators there. They charted every bay and inlet in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], going north to 58\u00b030\u2032 before turning back from Alaska due to bad weather. They completed the complex process begun earlier of claiming the Pacific Northwest for Spain.\n\nThe expedition anchored in [[Port Etches]], near [[Prince William Sound]]. The harbor was given the name \"Puerto de Santiago\" on July 23, 1779. The name commemorated [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], the [[patron saint]] of Spain, whose [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] falls on July 25.<ref>{{GNIS|1424573|Port Etches}}</ref> While the Spaniards were anchored in Port Etches they performed a formal possession ceremony. All the officers and chaplains went ashore in procession, raised a large cross while cannons and muskets fired salutes. The ''Te Deum'' was sung, followed by a litany and prayers. After a sermon was preached a formal deed of possession was drawn up and signed by the officers and chaplains. The title to Puerto de Santiago was important for years afterward, as it formed the basis of Spain's claim to sovereignty in the North Pacific up to 61\u00b017\u2032N.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=94\u201395}}\n\nIn 1780 Bodega y Quadra was promoted to ''capit\u00e1n de fragata'' ([[Frigate Captain]]), in recognition of his achievements during the 1779 voyage.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|page=111}}\n\n==Peru==\nIn 1780 Bodega was ordered to sail to the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] in order to acquire quicksilver ([[Mercury (element)|mercury]]), which was required by the Mexican silver mining industry. The supply of quicksilver had fallen sharply because the ships that would normally have delivered it had been diverted elsewhere due to the war with Britain. After many delays, Bodega sailed the old frigate ''Santiago'' from San Blas on 5 June 1781. The voyage was plagued by difficulties, such as continually contrary winds and bad weather. The ''Santiago'' took on so much water it needed to be [[Careening|careened]], but there was no opportunity to do so until in Peru. Bodega finally reached [[Callao]], [[Peru]], on 18 July 1782, thirteen months after sailing from San Blas. He soon discovered that there was no surplus quicksilver to be had. The [[List of Viceroys of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]], [[Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui]], had heard of Bodega's mission before Bodega arrived and decided to expedite matters by sending all the quicksilver he could spare to [[Acapulco]] on the merchant ship ''San Pablo''. Wishing not to return without any cargo, Bodega arranged to carry military supplies. The ''Santiago'' was careened and many rotten planks were replaced. Bodega sailed from Callao at the end of March 1783, carrying the cargo of military supplies and a number of passengers. The voyage north went smoothly, and Bodega anchored the ''Santiago'' at San Blas on 20 June 1783.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=115-120}}\n\n==Spain==\nShortly after Bodega's return to San Blas he received orders to go to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. There, in 1784, he requested and received permission to travel to Spain, which he did in 1785. He spent four mostly discouraging and frustrating years in Spain. However, there were at least two positive events. First, the king approved Bodega's promotion to ''capit\u00e1n de nav\u00edo'' (Ship Captain) on 15 November 1786, the highest naval rank below [[flag officer]] ranks. Second, he was knighted by the King of Spain as a full-fledged knight of the [[Order of Santiago]]&mdash;the most prestigious of Spain's four orders of chivalry. It was very difficult to earn a commission in the Order of Santiago. Bodega had begun the process in 1775. He was finally knighted by the king on 8 April 1788.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=122-128}}\n\n==Commandant of San Blas==\nAt the end of his stay in Spain, Bodega was appointed commandant of the Naval Department of San Blas. Instructed to select six junior officers to serve under him at San Blas, Bodega y Quadra chose [[Manuel Quimper]], Ram\u00f3n Saavedra Guir\u00e1ldez y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, [[Francisco de Eliza]], [[Salvador Fidalgo]], [[Jacinto Caama\u00f1o]], and Salvador Men\u00e9ndez Vald\u00e9s. Bodega and these six officers sailed to America on the same ship that was carrying the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain|Viceroy of New Spain]], [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Conde de Revillagigedo]]. The viceroy and Bodega arrived to find themselves in the immediate aftermath of the [[Nootka Crisis]]. They had two pressing issues to deal with right away. First they had to arrange for the release of the British ships, officers, and sailors taken prisoner by Mart\u00ednez in 1789. Second, they had to respond to the Royal Order of April 14, 1789, which required that the Spanish establishment at [[Nootka Sound]] be maintained. At first neither Revillagigedo nor Bodega knew that Mart\u00ednez had abandoned Nootka Sound. The Royal Order thus meant that a new expedition be immediately organized for the purpose of reoccupying, permanently, Nootka Sound. The reoccupation expedition was organized very quickly.\n\nThe three ships, ''Concepci\u00f3n'', ''San Carlos'', and ''Princesa Real'' sailed from San Blas and arrived at Nootka Sound in early April 1790. Francisco de Eliza was appointed commandant. Quimper, Fidalgo, and other officers were part of the expedition. The First Company of the [[Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia]], under [[Pedro de Alberni]], sailed with Eliza to garrison the Nootka establishment. The expedition had to be well supplied, not only with cannons and munitions but also with warm clothes, new equipment for the soldiers under Alberni, materials for constructing buildings and [[Fort San Miguel]], thousands of sheets of copper for trading or giving to the indigenous peoples, and numerous other goods. That Bodega y Quadra was able to organize the complicated logistical issues, especially given San Blas's chronically undersupplied and underfunded status, such that the ships sailed within months of Bodega's arrival, was a remarkable achievement.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=124-125, 134-136, 143-150}}\n\n===Nootka Sound Commandant===\nQuadra was called as an expert witness in the aftermath of the [[Nootka Crisis]] at [[Nootka Sound]].<ref name=naish>{{cite book\n|author=Naish, John\n|title=The Interwoven Lives of George Vancouver, Archibald Menzies, Joseph Whidbey and Peter Puget: The Vancouver Voyage of 1791-1795 \n|publisher=The Edward Mellen Press, Ltd.\n|year=1996|isbn=0-7734-8857-X}}</ref> In 1789, as the Commandant based at [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], he sent out several new expeditions of exploration.  In 1791 he was appointed Spanish commissioner to negotiate and administer the implementation of the [[Nootka Convention]]s at Nootka Sound.\n\nAs commandant of the Spanish establishment at Nootka, Bodega made a point of hosting and entertaining every visitor, indigenous and European. He held feasts for the officers of every ship that arrived at Nootka Sound, including the French fur-trading ship ''La Flavie'', the \"Portuguese\" ship ''Feliz Aventureira'' (actually a British ship masquerading as Portuguese), the American ships ''[[Columbia Rediviva|Columbia]]'', under [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]], and {{ship||Hope|1764 ship|2}}, under [[Joseph Ingraham]], Vancouver's ships {{HMS|Discovery|1789|6}} and {{HMS|Chatham|1788|2}}, and a number of others. The journals of many people who visited Nootka Sound during the summer of 1792 record amazement at the grandeur of Bodega's dinners, especially at such a remote part of the world, at which over fifty people would be served many courses on Bodega's personal collection of about 300 pieces of silver dinner ware. Bodega also provided ship repair services to any vessel needing them. A number of ships, including the ''Chatham'', were [[Careening|careened]] and repaired by Spanish workers.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=225-229}}\n\n===Island of Quadra and Vancouver===\nIn August 1792, Bodega welcomed English Captain [[George Vancouver]].<ref name=puget>{{cite book\n|author1=Wing, Robert  |author2=Newell, Gordon\n|title=Peter Puget: Lieutenant on the Vancouver Expedition, fighting British naval officer, the man for whom Puget Sound was named \n|publisher=Gray Beard Publishing\n|year=1979|isbn=0-933686-00-5}}</ref> The two commanders swiftly established friendly relations, including joint explorations and the sharing of supplies and information. Vancouver provided the services of his surgeon, [[Archibald Menzies]], to help Quadra with increasingly serious headaches. During their meetings Bodega y Quadra asked Vancouver to name \"some port or Island after us both\" (however, Bodega wrote in his journal that it was Vancouver who made the suggestion). Since Vancouver had determined that the land upon which Nootka stood was a great island, he proposed that they name it ''Quadra's and Vancouver's Island'': \"would name some port or island after us both in commemoration of our meeting and friendly intercourse that on that occasion had taken place (Vancouver had previously feted Quadra on his ship);....and conceiving no place more eligible than the place of our meeting, I have therefore named this land...'''The Island of Quadra and Vancouver'''.\" It was thus entered upon the explorer's charts, but this name was later shortened to [[Vancouver Island]].\n\nHowever, the two commanders were unable to reconcile the conflicts in the instructions from their respective governments. At issue was whether the Spanish were to hand over only the small plot of land actually built upon by the adventurer [[John Meares]], or the entire West Coast, or something in between. It is scarcely contested that Meares had exaggerated the extent of his discoveries. However, Bodega y Quadra was handicapped by uncertainties as to how far his superiors' wished to maintain Spanish sovereignty in a part of the world that had limited strategic value. He improvised and by chance pressed for exactly the condition that both the king and viceroy later communicated to him. Vancouver was likewise handicapped by a lack of instructions. He stuck by a strictly literal interpretation of Article I of the [[Nootka Convention]]. Having reached an impasse, the two agreed to refer the points at issue back to their respective governments in [[Madrid]] and [[London]]; Quadra arranged passage for Vancouver's envoy, [[William Robert Broughton]], through Mexico. Viceroy Revillagigedo chastised Bodega for allowing Broughton passage through New Spain. Eventually, Spain and [[Great Britain]] signed an agreement on January 11, 1794,<ref>{{cite conference| title =The Evacuation of Nootka| booktitle =Canadian Military Heritage| publisher =Government of Canada| url =http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_346.asp?flash=1| accessdate =14 September 2009| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070223121910/http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_346.asp?flash=1| archivedate =23 February 2007}}</ref> in which they agreed to abandon the region (the third [[Nootka Convention]]).\n\n==Death==\nAfter suffering from chronic headaches for several years, in April 1793 Bodega y Quadra requested a leave from his duties to restore his health. It was granted and he left San Blas for [[Guadalajara]] and [[Mexico City]]. He suffered a strong ''fluxo de sangre'' (blood loss or haemorrhage) in Guadalajara. He had a seizure in [[Mexico City]] and died there on March 26, 1794, at the age of 50. The internist Dr. John Naish has conjectured that Bodega y Quadra's death was the result of either a [[brain tumor]] or the severest form of [[hypertension]]. Given the lack of details and the imprecision contemporary diagnosis and description, [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Viceroy Revillagigedo's]] official statement that Bodega died \"of natural causes\" is indisputable.{{sfnp|Tovell|2008|pages=327-330}}\n\nWhen George Vancouver, at Nootka Sound again in September 1794, learned of Bodega's death, he wrote in his journal (grammar and misspellings from the original):\n\n{{quote |text=\"The death of our highly valuable and much esteemed friend Senr Quadra, who in the month of March had died at St. Blas, universally lamaneted.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], and stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Kate Winslet]] as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated [[maiden voyage]].\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with [[shipwreck]]s; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|''Titanic'' wreck]]. The modern scenes on the research vessel'' ''were shot on board the ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh]]'', which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. [[Scale model]]s, [[computer-generated imagery]], and a reconstruction of the ''Titanic'' built at [[Baja Studios]] were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]]; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time, with a production budget of $200&nbsp;million.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, ''Titanic'' achieved significant critical and commercial success. Nominated for 14 [[Academy Awards]], it tied ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950)<!-- NOTE: La La Land (film) does not belong in the lead (introduction) of this article. If it is added to the lead, it will be removed. --> for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], tying ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959)<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD RETURN OF THE KING; YOU CANNOT TIE WITH SOMETHING WHICH WAS RELEASED LATER.--> for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, ''Titanic'' was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark, and became [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film ever at the time]],<!-- Although the film was released in 1997, it became the highest-grossing in 1998. DO NOT CHANGE THIS.--> until Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' surpassed it in 2010. A [[3D film|3D]] version of ''Titanic,'' released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after ''Avatar''). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add significant detail to this section; there is a 700-word standard specified in WP:FILMPLOT. This hidden note, the refn note and two references are not a part of the word count.-->\n\nIn 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team board the research vessel ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh]]'' to search the wreck of RMS ''Titanic'' for a necklace with a rare diamond, the [[Heart of the Ocean]]. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.{{refn|Although the ''Titanic'' hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.|group = Note}} Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard ''Keldysh'' and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard ''Titanic''.\n\nIn 1912 [[Southampton]], 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fianc\u00e9 Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious ''Titanic''. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and allow them to retain their upper-class status. Distraught over the engagement, Rose climbs over the stern and contemplates suicide; Jack Dawson, a poor artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. Cal becomes indifferent, and it is suggested to him that Jack be rewarded; he invites Jack to dine with them in first-class. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal, his valet Spicer Lovejoy, and Ruth, being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third-class.\n\nAware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but later realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean. They evade Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing its seriousness.\n\nCal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Cal retaliates by having Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket, accusing him of theft. Jack is arrested and restrained in the [[master-at-arms]]' office. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.\n\nWith the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat. While intending only to save himself, Cal claims he can ensure he and Jack get off safely. As her lifeboat lowers, Rose realizes she cannot leave Jack, and jumps back on board. Cal takes Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, he relents. Cal realizes he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose. He later boards a lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\n\nAfter braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, dropping the stern into the water. Jack and Rose climb onto the back of it, and ride it into the ocean. He helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed.

Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He later reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about ''Titanic'' for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* [[Suzy Amis]] as Lizzy Calvert: Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns her grandmother's true identity and romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* [[Danny Nucci]] as Fabrizio: Jack's Italian best friend, who boards the RMS ''Titanic'' with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio does not board a lifeboat when the ''Titanic'' sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him to death.\n* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Spicer Lovejoy: An ex-[[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] constable, Lovejoy is Cal's English valet and bodyguard, who keeps an eye on Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack's rescue of her. He dies when the ''Titanic'' splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries ''[[S.O.S.

Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n===Historical characters===\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,<ref name=five/> the film includes portrayals of several historical figures:\n[[File:Molly brown rescue award titanic.jpg|thumb|The real Margaret Brown (right) giving Captain [[Arthur Rostron|Arthur Henry Rostron]] an award for his service in the rescue of ''Titanic''{{'}}s surviving passengers.]]\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as [[Margaret Brown|Margaret \"Molly\" Brown]]: Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"[[new money]]\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a tuxedo (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered [[Titanic Lifeboat No. 6|Lifeboat 6]] from Quartermaster [[Robert Hichens (RMS Titanic)|Robert Hichens]].<ref name=\"SLB\">{{cite book|first=Stephanie L.|last=Barczewski|title=Titanic: A Night Remembered|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2004|accessdate=March 31, 2009|page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yYX4s1_6IlEC&pg=PA30 | isbn=978-1-85285-434-8}}</ref> Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film.\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Thomas Andrews]]: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a very kind and pleasant man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the ''Titanic'', this story, which was published in a 1912 book (''Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder'') and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton & Bill Wormstedt. Amberley Books, March 2012. pp 321\u2013323</ref> There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.<ref name=\"seaofglass\" /> It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.<ref name=\"seaofglass\" /> Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to use as floating devices. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship at the last moment.\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Edward John Smith]]: Smith planned to make the ''Titanic'' his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the [[Pilothouse|wheelhouse]] on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] as the ship sinks, dying when the windows implode from the water whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".<ref>Ballard, pp. 40\u201341</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Hyde]] as [[J. Bruce Ismay]]: Ismay is portrayed as a rich, ignorant upper-class man. In the film, he uses his position as [[White Star Line]] managing director to influence Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this action appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beesley |first=Lawrence |title=The Loss of the S.S. Titanic |publisher=Heinemann |location=London |year=1912 |page=56}}</ref><ref>Howells (1999: 31).</ref> After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as [[John Jacob Astor IV]]: A first-class passenger whom Rose (correctly) calls the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine]] ([[Charlotte Chatton]]) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack neatly deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]] Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as [[Archibald Gracie IV|Colonel Archibald Gracie IV]]: The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. Fox had portrayed [[Frederick Fleet]] in the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]''.\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as [[Benjamin Guggenheim]]: A mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as [[Wallace Hartley]]: The ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of ''[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]'', to the tune of Bethany,<ref>{{cite news | title=Further, my god, from thee | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/further-my-god-from-thee-1122417.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Jack | date=September 26, 1999 | accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Bevil\">{{cite news | first=Bevil, J | last=Marshall | title=And the Band Played On | url=http://home.earthlink.net/~llywarch/tnc02.html.htm | work= Southwest Regional Chapter of the American Musicological Society, Rice University | location=Houston | date=October 1999 | accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref> and dies in the sinking.\n* [[Mark Lindsay Chapman]] as [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Chief Officer Henry Wilde]]: The ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* [[Ewan Stewart]] as [[William McMaster Murdoch|First Officer William Murdoch]]: The officer who is put in charge of the bridge on the night the ship struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan as well as another passenger in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.<ref>{{cite news | title = Nephew angered by tarnishing of Titanic hero | work = BBC News | date = January 24, 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/50203.stm |accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to [[Dalbeattie|Dalbeattie, Scotland]], where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a \u00a35000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.<ref>{{cite news | title = Titanic makers say sorry | work = BBC News | date=April 15, 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/78839.stm | accessdate=February 22, 2007}}</ref> Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the [[Women and children first|\"women and children first\" policy]].<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Audio Commentary |medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year= 2005}}</ref> According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"<ref>James Cameron's Titanic, p.&nbsp;129.</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Phillips (actor)|Jonathan Phillips]] as [[Charles Lightoller|Second Officer Charles Lightoller]]. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water and following the collision suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* [[Simon Crane]] as [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]]: The officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Harold Lowe|Fifth Officer Harold Lowe]]: The ship's only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as [[James Paul Moody|Sixth Officer James Moody]]: The ship's only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following [[William McMaster Murdoch|Mr. Murdoch's]] orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as [[Thomas Byles|Father Thomas Byles]]: Second-class passenger Father Byles, a Catholic priest from England, is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and [[Elsa Raven]] as [[Isidor Straus]] and [[Ida Straus]]: Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, his wife Ida is offered a place in a lifeboat, but refuses, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] as [[Cosmo Duff-Gordon|Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon]]: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in [[RMS Titanic Lifeboat No. 1|Lifeboat 1]]. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat, and there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster]] accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.<ref>''British Wreck Commissioner's Enquiry: Report.'' \"Account of the Saving and Rescue of those who Survived: Conduct of Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and Mr Ismay\".

A [[horizon tank]] of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the [[superstructure]] and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was just steel plating.

The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.]]\n\nAn enclosed {{convert|5000000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, {{convert|90000|usgal|L}} of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The {{convert|744|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} exterior of the RMS ''Titanic'' had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a [[shock absorber]] against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's [[remotely operated vehicle|ROV]] traversing the wreck in the present.<ref name=\"heart\" /> The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a {{convert|350000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank,<ref name=\"water\">Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 161\u2013168</ref> where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.<ref name=\"blueprint\" />\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous ''Titanic'' films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" /> When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThere was one \"crucial historical fact\" Cameron chose to omit from the film \u2013 the [[SS Californian|SS ''Californian'']] was close to the ''Titanic'' the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's [[SOS]] calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. \"Yes, the [SS] ''Californian.'' That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the ''Californian'' was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If ''Titanic'' is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"<ref name=\"www.industrycentral.net\" />\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the ''Titanic''{{'s}} sinking.<ref>{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Alternate Ending Commentary | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, stating that \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ...you didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bill-paxton-on-the-alternate-ending-of-titanic-audiences-didnt-see-in-1997-150538039.html | title=Bill Paxton on the Alternate Ending of 'Titanic' That Audiences Didn't See in 1997 | first=Will | last=Lerner | date=February 27, 2017 | publisher=Yahoo!

Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.<ref name=\"Deleted scene commentaries\" />\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Main|Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture|Back to Titanic}}\n{{listen|filename=|title=Excerpt from \"''Hymn to the Sea''\"|description=Featuring the vocals of [[Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8]], this is a recurring somber theme that is associated with the tragic elements of ''Titanic''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nCameron wrote ''Titanic'' while listening to the work of Irish new-age musician [[Enya]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jan-15-ca-8361-story.html|title=Soundtrack to 'Titanic' Rises to No. 1|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> He offered Enya the chance to compose for the film, but she declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/irelands-enya-on-how-life-by-the-sea-influenced-her-music-1458056146|title=Ireland\u2019s Enya on How Life by the Sea Influenced Her Music|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> Cameron instead chose [[James Horner]] to compose the film's score.

Asprey & Garrard produced and designed the necklaces: the result was three different and unique designs. Two of their designs were used in the film while the other went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace, and the Asprey necklace. The three necklaces are all very similar but have distinguishable differences.\n\t \nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, [[Asprey & Garrard]] were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, {{convert|171|carat|g|adj=on}} heart-shaped Ceylon [[sapphire]] surrounded by 103 diamonds.<ref name=\"oocities\" />  This design featured a much larger inverted pear shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to [[Sotheby's]] auction house in [[Beverly Hills]] for an auction benefiting the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]] and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client<ref>{{cite news|title=Heart Of The Matter|last=Van Der Voort|first=Jane|date=February 11, 2001|work=The Toronto Sun|page=}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> for $1.4 million, under the agreement that [[Celine Dion]] would wear it two nights later at the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Academy Awards]] ceremony.

He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) ''Titanic'' an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"''Titanic'' has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], and stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Kate Winslet]] as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated [[maiden voyage]].\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with [[shipwreck]]s; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|''Titanic'' wreck]]. The modern scenes on the research vessel'' ''were shot on board the ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh]]'', which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. [[Scale model]]s, [[computer-generated imagery]], and a reconstruction of the ''Titanic'' built at [[Baja Studios]] were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]]; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time, with a production budget of $200&nbsp;million.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, ''Titanic'' achieved significant critical and commercial success. Nominated for 14 [[Academy Awards]], it tied ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950)<!-- NOTE: La La Land (film) does not belong in the lead (introduction) of this article. If it is added to the lead, it will be removed. --> for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], tying ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959)<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD RETURN OF THE KING; YOU CANNOT TIE WITH SOMETHING WHICH WAS RELEASED LATER.--> for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, ''Titanic'' was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark, and became [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film ever at the time]],<!-- Although the film was released in 1997, it became the highest-grossing in 1998. DO NOT CHANGE THIS.--> until Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' surpassed it in 2010. A [[3D film|3D]] version of ''Titanic,'' released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after ''Avatar''). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add significant detail to this section; there is a 700-word standard specified in WP:FILMPLOT.

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.{{refn|Although the ''Titanic'' hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.|group = Note}} Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard ''Keldysh'' and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard ''Titanic''.\n\nIn 1912 [[Southampton]], 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fianc\u00e9 Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious ''Titanic''. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and allow them to retain their upper-class status. Distraught over the engagement, Rose climbs over the stern and contemplates suicide; Jack Dawson, a poor artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. Cal becomes indifferent, and it is suggested to him that Jack be rewarded; he invites Jack to dine with them in first-class. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal, his valet Spicer Lovejoy, and Ruth, being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third-class.\n\nAware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but later realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean. They evade Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing its seriousness.\n\nCal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Cal retaliates by having Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket, accusing him of theft. Jack is arrested and restrained in the [[master-at-arms]]' office. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.\n\nWith the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat. While intending only to save himself, Cal claims he can ensure he and Jack get off safely. As her lifeboat lowers, Rose realizes she cannot leave Jack, and jumps back on board. Cal takes Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, he relents. Cal realizes he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose. He later boards a lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\n\nAfter braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, dropping the stern into the water. Jack and Rose climb onto the back of it, and ride it into the ocean. He helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed.

Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He later reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about ''Titanic'' for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* [[Suzy Amis]] as Lizzy Calvert: Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns her grandmother's true identity and romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* [[Danny Nucci]] as Fabrizio: Jack's Italian best friend, who boards the RMS ''Titanic'' with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio does not board a lifeboat when the ''Titanic'' sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him to death.\n* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Spicer Lovejoy: An ex-[[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] constable, Lovejoy is Cal's English valet and bodyguard, who keeps an eye on Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack's rescue of her. He dies when the ''Titanic'' splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries ''[[S.O.S.

Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n===Historical characters===\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,<ref name=five/> the film includes portrayals of several historical figures:\n[[File:Molly brown rescue award titanic.jpg|thumb|The real Margaret Brown (right) giving Captain [[Arthur Rostron|Arthur Henry Rostron]] an award for his service in the rescue of ''Titanic''{{'}}s surviving passengers.]]\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as [[Margaret Brown|Margaret \"Molly\" Brown]]: Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"[[new money]]\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a tuxedo (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered [[Titanic Lifeboat No. 6|Lifeboat 6]] from Quartermaster [[Robert Hichens (RMS Titanic)|Robert Hichens]].<ref name=\"SLB\">{{cite book|first=Stephanie L.|last=Barczewski|title=Titanic: A Night Remembered|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2004|accessdate=March 31, 2009|page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yYX4s1_6IlEC&pg=PA30 | isbn=978-1-85285-434-8}}</ref> Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film.\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Thomas Andrews]]: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a very kind and pleasant man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the ''Titanic'', this story, which was published in a 1912 book (''Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder'') and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton & Bill Wormstedt. Amberley Books, March 2012. pp 321\u2013323</ref> There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.<ref name=\"seaofglass\" /> It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.<ref name=\"seaofglass\" /> Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to use as floating devices. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship at the last moment.\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Edward John Smith]]: Smith planned to make the ''Titanic'' his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the [[Pilothouse|wheelhouse]] on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] as the ship sinks, dying when the windows implode from the water whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".<ref>Ballard, pp. 40\u201341</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Hyde]] as [[J. Bruce Ismay]]: Ismay is portrayed as a rich, ignorant upper-class man. In the film, he uses his position as [[White Star Line]] managing director to influence Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this action appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beesley |first=Lawrence |title=The Loss of the S.S. Titanic |publisher=Heinemann |location=London |year=1912 |page=56}}</ref><ref>Howells (1999: 31).</ref> After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as [[John Jacob Astor IV]]: A first-class passenger whom Rose (correctly) calls the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine]] ([[Charlotte Chatton]]) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack neatly deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]] Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as [[Archibald Gracie IV|Colonel Archibald Gracie IV]]: The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. Fox had portrayed [[Frederick Fleet]] in the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]''.\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as [[Benjamin Guggenheim]]: A mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as [[Wallace Hartley]]: The ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of ''[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]'', to the tune of Bethany,<ref>{{cite news | title=Further, my god, from thee | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/further-my-god-from-thee-1122417.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Jack | date=September 26, 1999 | accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Bevil\">{{cite news | first=Bevil, J | last=Marshall | title=And the Band Played On | url=http://home.earthlink.net/~llywarch/tnc02.html.htm | work= Southwest Regional Chapter of the American Musicological Society, Rice University | location=Houston | date=October 1999 | accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref> and dies in the sinking.\n* [[Mark Lindsay Chapman]] as [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Chief Officer Henry Wilde]]: The ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* [[Ewan Stewart]] as [[William McMaster Murdoch|First Officer William Murdoch]]: The officer who is put in charge of the bridge on the night the ship struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan as well as another passenger in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.<ref>{{cite news | title = Nephew angered by tarnishing of Titanic hero | work = BBC News | date = January 24, 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/50203.stm |accessdate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to [[Dalbeattie|Dalbeattie, Scotland]], where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a \u00a35000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.<ref>{{cite news | title = Titanic makers say sorry | work = BBC News | date=April 15, 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/78839.stm | accessdate=February 22, 2007}}</ref> Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the [[Women and children first|\"women and children first\" policy]].<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Audio Commentary |medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year= 2005}}</ref> According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"<ref>James Cameron's Titanic, p.&nbsp;129.</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Phillips (actor)|Jonathan Phillips]] as [[Charles Lightoller|Second Officer Charles Lightoller]]. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water and following the collision suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* [[Simon Crane]] as [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]]: The officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Harold Lowe|Fifth Officer Harold Lowe]]: The ship's only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as [[James Paul Moody|Sixth Officer James Moody]]: The ship's only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following [[William McMaster Murdoch|Mr. Murdoch's]] orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as [[Thomas Byles|Father Thomas Byles]]: Second-class passenger Father Byles, a Catholic priest from England, is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and [[Elsa Raven]] as [[Isidor Straus]] and [[Ida Straus]]: Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, his wife Ida is offered a place in a lifeboat, but refuses, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] as [[Cosmo Duff-Gordon|Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon]]: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in [[RMS Titanic Lifeboat No. 1|Lifeboat 1]]. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat, and there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster]] accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.<ref>''British Wreck Commissioner's Enquiry: Report.'' \"Account of the Saving and Rescue of those who Survived: Conduct of Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and Mr Ismay\".

A [[horizon tank]] of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the [[superstructure]] and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was just steel plating.

The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.]]\n\nAn enclosed {{convert|5000000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, {{convert|90000|usgal|L}} of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The {{convert|744|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} exterior of the RMS ''Titanic'' had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a [[shock absorber]] against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's [[remotely operated vehicle|ROV]] traversing the wreck in the present.<ref name=\"heart\" /> The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a {{convert|350000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank,<ref name=\"water\">Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 161\u2013168</ref> where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.<ref name=\"blueprint\" />\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous ''Titanic'' films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" /> When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThere was one \"crucial historical fact\" Cameron chose to omit from the film \u2013 the [[SS Californian|SS ''Californian'']] was close to the ''Titanic'' the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's [[SOS]] calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. \"Yes, the [SS] ''Californian.'' That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the ''Californian'' was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If ''Titanic'' is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"<ref name=\"www.industrycentral.net\" />\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the ''Titanic''{{'s}} sinking.<ref>{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Alternate Ending Commentary | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, stating that \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ...you didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bill-paxton-on-the-alternate-ending-of-titanic-audiences-didnt-see-in-1997-150538039.html | title=Bill Paxton on the Alternate Ending of 'Titanic' That Audiences Didn't See in 1997 | first=Will | last=Lerner | date=February 27, 2017 | publisher=Yahoo!

Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.<ref name=\"Deleted scene commentaries\" />\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Main|Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture|Back to Titanic}}\n{{listen|filename=|title=Excerpt from \"''Hymn to the Sea''\"|description=Featuring the vocals of [[Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8]], this is a recurring somber theme that is associated with the tragic elements of ''Titanic''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nCameron wrote ''Titanic'' while listening to the work of Irish new-age musician [[Enya]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jan-15-ca-8361-story.html|title=Soundtrack to 'Titanic' Rises to No. 1|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> He offered Enya the chance to compose for the film, but she declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/irelands-enya-on-how-life-by-the-sea-influenced-her-music-1458056146|title=Ireland\u2019s Enya on How Life by the Sea Influenced Her Music|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> Cameron instead chose [[James Horner]] to compose the film's score.

Asprey & Garrard produced and designed the necklaces: the result was three different and unique designs. Two of their designs were used in the film while the other went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace, and the Asprey necklace. The three necklaces are all very similar but have distinguishable differences.\n\t \nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, [[Asprey & Garrard]] were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, {{convert|171|carat|g|adj=on}} heart-shaped Ceylon [[sapphire]] surrounded by 103 diamonds.<ref name=\"oocities\" />  This design featured a much larger inverted pear shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to [[Sotheby's]] auction house in [[Beverly Hills]] for an auction benefiting the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]] and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client<ref>{{cite news|title=Heart Of The Matter|last=Van Der Voort|first=Jane|date=February 11, 2001|work=The Toronto Sun|page=}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> for $1.4 million, under the agreement that [[Celine Dion]] would wear it two nights later at the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Academy Awards]] ceremony.

He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) ''Titanic'' an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"''Titanic'' has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe.
