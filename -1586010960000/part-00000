He is the [[lead guitar]]ist and [[keyboardist]] of the alternative rock band [[Radiohead]], and has written a number of [[film score]]s.\n\nAlong with his elder brother, Radiohead bassist [[Colin Greenwood|Colin]], Greenwood attended [[Abingdon School]] in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] near [[Oxford]], England, where he met the future band members. The youngest of the group, Greenwood was the last to join, first playing keyboards and harmonica but soon becoming lead guitarist. He abandoned a degree in music when the band signed to [[Parlophone]]; their debut single \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\" was distinguished by Greenwood's aggressive guitar work. Radiohead have since achieved critical acclaim and sold over 30 million albums. Along with the other members of Radiohead, Greenwood was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2019.\n\nGreenwood has been named one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications including ''[[Rolling Stone]].''<ref name=\"NME.COM\"/><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=Spin/> A [[multi-instrumentalist]], Greenwood has also played instruments including bass guitar, piano, viola, and drums. He is a prominent player of the [[ondes Martenot]], an early electronic instrument. He uses electronic techniques such as [[Programming (music)|programming]], [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Loop (music)|looping]], and writes music software used by Radiohead. He described his role in the band as an [[Arrangement|arranger]], helping to transform [[Thom Yorke|Thom Yorke's]] demos into finished songs.\n\nRadiohead albums feature Greenwood's string and brass arrangements, and he has composed for orchestras including the [[London Contemporary Orchestra]] and the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]]. His first solo work, the soundtrack for the film ''[[Bodysong]],'' was released in 2003. In 2007, he scored ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', directed by [[Paul Thomas Anderson]],{{efn-ua|Some of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s [[Work of art|oeuvre]] was the inspiration for Greenwood's release of an album, which thereafter appeared in the score of this film.<ref name=\"Levenson\">{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/world/krzysztof-penderecki-composer-death-trnd/index.html |title=Krzysztof Penderecki, composer of works in 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining,' dies at 86 |first1=Eric |last1=Levenson |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>}} and has composed the soundtrack for every Anderson film since; in 2018, he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award]] for his score for Anderson's ''[[Phantom Thread]]''.

He is the [[lead guitar]]ist and [[keyboardist]] of the alternative rock band [[Radiohead]], and has written a number of [[film score]]s.\n\nAlong with his elder brother, Radiohead bassist [[Colin Greenwood|Colin]], Greenwood attended [[Abingdon School]] in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] near [[Oxford]], England, where he met the future band members. The youngest of the group, Greenwood was the last to join, first playing keyboards and harmonica but soon becoming lead guitarist. He abandoned a degree in music when the band signed to [[Parlophone]]; their debut single \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\" was distinguished by Greenwood's aggressive guitar work. Radiohead have since achieved critical acclaim and sold over 30 million albums. Along with the other members of Radiohead, Greenwood was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2019.\n\nGreenwood has been named one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications including ''[[Rolling Stone]].''<ref name=\"NME.COM\"/><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=Spin/> A [[multi-instrumentalist]], Greenwood has also played instruments including bass guitar, piano, viola, and drums. He is a prominent player of the [[ondes Martenot]], an early electronic instrument. He uses electronic techniques such as [[Programming (music)|programming]], [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Loop (music)|looping]], and writes music software used by Radiohead. He described his role in the band as an [[Arrangement|arranger]], helping to transform [[Thom Yorke|Thom Yorke's]] demos into finished songs.\n\nRadiohead albums feature Greenwood's string and brass arrangements, and he has composed for orchestras including the [[London Contemporary Orchestra]] and the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]]. His first solo work, the soundtrack for the film ''[[Bodysong]],'' was released in 2003. In 2007, he scored ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', directed by [[Paul Thomas Anderson]],{{efn-ua|Some of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s [[oeuvre]] was the inspiration for Greenwood's release of an album, which thereafter appeared in the score of this film.<ref name=\"Levenson\">{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/world/krzysztof-penderecki-composer-death-trnd/index.html |title=Krzysztof Penderecki, composer of works in 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining,' dies at 86 |first1=Eric |last1=Levenson |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>}} and has composed the soundtrack for every Anderson film since; in 2018, he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award]] for his score for Anderson's ''[[Phantom Thread]]''.

He longed to give these \"toughs\" some of the summer fresh air and fun he had experienced as a child on the family farm.\n\nIn the summer of 1890, he took 22 children to Freeville with funds received from the New York Tribune, the sponsors of The Fresh Air Fund charity.  Each summer from then until 1895 the number of children increased.  Over these early years, he slowly developed his idea of \"nothing without labor\" and of a Junior Republic with laws made by young \"citizens\" and an economic system controlled by youngsters.\n\nIn 1895, George and five volunteers stayed through the winter in Freeville and thus a permanent colony was founded.\n\nThere were Woman's Aid societies in New York City, Ithaca, Syracuse, Buffalo, Boston and elsewhere, to promote the work of the Republic. A republic for younger boys, begun at Freeville, was established in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]]; and a National Junior Republic near [[Annapolis Junction, Maryland]], and a Carter Junior Republic at Readington, near [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], are modelled on the George Junior Republic. In 1908&ndash;1910 new states were established at [[Chino, California]], [[Grove City, Pennsylvania]], and [[Flemington Junction, New Jersey]]. In February 1908 the National Association of Junior Republics was formed with Mr. George (its founder) as its director, its aims being to establish at least one republic in each state of the Union, and in other countries similar institutions for youth and miniature governments modelled on that of the country in which each state is established, and to establish colonies for younger children, to be sent at the age of fifteen to the Junior Republic.\n\n[[File:Buildings in the George Junior Republic retouched.jpg|thumb|Two buildings (the \"Girls' Hotel\" and the \"Jail\") in the George Junior Republic, ca. 1903-04.]]\n\nOver the years of William George's leadership, he was supported and the Junior Republic was visited by many prominent people who were interested in learning from George's experiment.  These included Lord Baden Powell, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Mott Osborne, Alexander Forbes, Monsignor John Patrick Carroll-Abbing, and Jacob Riis to name a few.\n\nMany of the early citizens of the Junior Republic went on to important careers and accomplishments.  A supreme court justice, a Pulitzer Prize winner, an Academy Award recipient, a California state legislator, a French Croix de Guerre honoree, a missionary to China, and many who gave their lives in World War I and World War II.\n\n==Current activity==\nIn 2005 the George Junior Republic changed its name to The William George Agency for Children\u2019s Services, Inc.\n\nToday\u2019s residential programs preserve the Junior Republic\u2019s ideals of general fitness, social development and well-roundedness, in which responsibility is treated more as an opportunity than a burden \u2013 while providing more focused clinical oversight and treatment, and a strong educational emphasis.\n\nAlthough the agency has seen many programmatic changes over the years as the needs of children have evolved, one thing has never changed, namely the enduring efforts of caring adults working to improve the lives of disadvantaged, troubled youth.  Expansion in the service of providing additional treatment opportunities to children in need has been an agency priority since the early 1990s.  The agency's Board of Directors in concert with the senior leadership team have, for the last 20 years, made a concerted effort to serve high risk, high need populations who have historically been underserved in New York State.  This expansion has taken the form of nine newly constructed, state of the art, residential homes, and many new and innovative programs.\n\nIn August, 1996 when Barber Cottage opened, the George Junior Republic became the first private residential treatment center in New York State to be licensed to provide sex offender specific treatment to adolescent males who have engaged in sexually abusive behavior.  There are currently 20 such beds and the agency is recognized as a leader in the field of adolescent S.O. treatment.\n\nIn July 2000, the Republic became one of only three private residential agencies in the state to open an OASAS licensed outpatient chemical dependency treatment clinic serving the needs of the residential population.  It has been long recognized that the rate of diagnosable alcohol and/or substance abuse among adolescents entering residential treatment is at least 60%, and for many youngsters, it represents a primary treatment issue.  The OASAS clinic currently serves up to 100 residents at any given time, and has consistently received superior performance reviews during OASAS program audits.\n\nThe fall of 2005 marked the opening of a dually diagnosed program for youngsters with both intellectual disabilities and serious emotional, psychiatric disturbance.  Previously, many of these youngsters were mixed in with youngsters with normal cognitive functioning, and were often exploited or isolated.  The dually diagnosed program offers many specialized services and supports designed to improve their adaptive daily living skills, as well as their capacity to function independently.  Currently there are 27 dually diagnosed beds.\n\nIn November, 2011 and May, 2014 Seidell & Ed George Cottages opened as Integrated Residential Substance Abuse Programs for adolescents who are dually diagnosed with alcohol and/or substance dependence and a co-occurring mental health disorder.  Most of the young men and women served in these programs have a history of failed inpatient treatment experiences in short-term rehabilitation programs as a result of their pattern of acting out behavior.  The structure of the residential program is designed to offer these youngsters a safe, stable, and predictable living environment which will support and encourage their investment in treatment while an OASAS licensed clinic provides intensive chemical dependency services.  Since the program\u2019s inception on November 1, 2011 through the present date, the utilization rate for this program has been 94%.\n\nFinally, in December, 2011, the girl\u2019s program opened at Lodge Cottage.  The agency had not served adolescent females in almost twenty years.  In response to overwhelming and persistent consumer demand, the agency made the decision to serve girls with a history of trauma and abuse.  In the nearly three years of operation, the program has been highly utilized and continues to be in great demand.\n\nDuring the twenty-year period between 1994 and 2014, the agency has grown fourfold from approximately 45 beds to the present licensed capacity of 189 beds as part of their on-going commitment to serve at-risk youth in New York State.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Jack M.

In February 1908 the National Association of Junior Republics was formed with Mr. George (its founder) as its director, its aims being to establish at least one republic in each state of the Union, and in other countries similar institutions for youth and miniature governments modelled on that of the country in which each state is established, and to establish colonies for younger children, to be sent at the age of fifteen to the Junior Republic.\n\n[[File:Buildings in the George Junior Republic retouched.jpg|thumb|Two buildings (the \"Girls' Hotel\" and the \"Jail\") in the George Junior Republic, ca. 1903-04.]]\n\nOver the years of William George's leadership, he was supported and the Junior Republic was visited by many prominent people who were interested in learning from George's experiment.  These included Lord Baden Powell, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Mott Osborne, Alexander Forbes, Monsignor John Patrick Carroll-Abbing, and Jacob Riis to name a few.\n\nMany of the early citizens of the Junior Republic went on to important careers and accomplishments.  A supreme court justice, a Pulitzer Prize winner, an Academy Award recipient, a California state legislator, a French Croix de Guerre honoree, a missionary to China, and many who gave their lives in World War I and World War II.\n\n==Current activity==\nIn 2005 the George Junior Republic changed its name to The William George Agency for Children\u2019s Services, Inc.\n\nToday\u2019s residential programs preserve the Junior Republic\u2019s ideals of general fitness, social development and well-roundedness, in which responsibility is treated more as an opportunity than a burden \u2013 while providing more focused clinical oversight and treatment, and a strong educational emphasis.\n\nAlthough the agency has seen many programmatic changes over the years as the needs of children have evolved, one thing has never changed, namely the enduring efforts of caring adults working to improve the lives of disadvantaged, troubled youth.  Expansion in the service of providing additional treatment opportunities to children in need has been an agency priority since the early 1990s.  The agency's Board of Directors in concert with the senior leadership team have, for the last 20 years, made a concerted effort to serve high risk, high need populations who have historically been underserved in New York State.  This expansion has taken the form of nine newly constructed, state of the art, residential homes, and many new and innovative programs.\n\nIn August, 1996 when Barber Cottage opened, the George Junior Republic became the first private residential treatment center in New York State to be licensed to provide sex offender specific treatment to adolescent males who have engaged in sexually abusive behavior.  There are currently 20 such beds and the agency is recognized as a leader in the field of adolescent S.O. treatment.\n\nIn July 2000, the Republic became one of only three private residential agencies in the state to open an OASAS licensed outpatient chemical dependency treatment clinic serving the needs of the residential population.  It has been long recognized that the rate of diagnosable alcohol and/or substance abuse among adolescents entering residential treatment is at least 60%, and for many youngsters, it represents a primary treatment issue.  The OASAS clinic currently serves up to 100 residents at any given time, and has consistently received superior performance reviews during OASAS program audits.\n\nThe fall of 2005 marked the opening of a dually diagnosed program for youngsters with both intellectual disabilities and serious emotional, psychiatric disturbance.  Previously, many of these youngsters were mixed in with youngsters with normal cognitive functioning, and were often exploited or isolated.  The dually diagnosed program offers many specialized services and supports designed to improve their adaptive daily living skills, as well as their capacity to function independently.  Currently there are 27 dually diagnosed beds.\n\nIn November, 2011 and May, 2014 Seidell & Ed George Cottages opened as Integrated Residential Substance Abuse Programs for adolescents who are dually diagnosed with alcohol and/or substance dependence and a co-occurring mental health disorder.  Most of the young men and women served in these programs have a history of failed inpatient treatment experiences in short-term rehabilitation programs as a result of their pattern of acting out behavior.  The structure of the residential program is designed to offer these youngsters a safe, stable, and predictable living environment which will support and encourage their investment in treatment while an OASAS licensed clinic provides intensive chemical dependency services.  Since the program\u2019s inception on November 1, 2011 through the present date, the utilization rate for this program has been 94%.\n\nFinally, in December, 2011, the girl\u2019s program opened at Lodge Cottage.  The agency had not served adolescent females in almost twenty years.  In response to overwhelming and persistent consumer demand, the agency made the decision to serve girls with a history of trauma and abuse.  In the nearly three years of operation, the program has been highly utilized and continues to be in great demand.\n\nIn point of fact, during the twenty-year period between 1994 and 2014, the agency has grown fourfold from approximately 45 beds to the present licensed capacity of 189 beds as part of their on-going commitment to serve at-risk youth in New York State.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Jack M.

She was a faculty member of [[Columbia University]]\u2019s [[Columbia University School of Journalism|school of journalism]] as well as [[Barnard College]], and was a winner of the [[Front Page Award]] for her journalistic achievement in writing about the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Blacklist]].<ref name=\"Bosworth\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/patricia-bosworth-dead-hollywood-actress-turned-chronicler-dies-coronavirus-complications-at-86-1288456|title=Patricia Bosworth, Hollywood Actress-Turned-Chronicler, Dies From Coronavirus Complications at 86|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=Apr 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBorn '''Patricia Crum''' in Oakland, California, Bosworth was the daughter of prominent [[Bartley Crum|attorney Bartley Crum]] and novelist Anna Gertrude Bosworth. She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]] campaign, and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Palestine]] that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained notoriety for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=\":0\">Bosworth, Patricia. Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story (1998)</ref>\n\nIn California, Bosworth had been educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]] and then the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harper\u2019s Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2002. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nPatricia died on April 2, 2020 from the [[COVID-19]] virus. \u00a0She was 86.\n\n==Acting career==\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>Garfield, David (1980). \"Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980\". A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. p. 277. {{ISBN|0-02-542650-8}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day|Jazz on a Summer\u2019s Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun\u2019s Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Journalist==\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's|McCall\u2019s]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harper\u2019s Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>The X-Rated Emperor, Vanity Fair, February 2005</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for the ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen\u2019s Club of New York.\n\n==Author==\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor\u2019s introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift\u2019s lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift\u2019s family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift\u2019s close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth\u2019s biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus\u2019s 1971 suicide.<ref>Bosworth, Patricia. Diane Arbus: A Biography. New York: Alfred Knopf, 1984</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have\u2026 more than enough material for several art legends\u2026 Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography\u2026 as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n== Death ==\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to pneumonia and complications from the novel [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>Garfield, David (1980). \"Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980\". A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. p. 277. {{ISBN|0-02-542650-8}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day|Jazz on a Summer\u2019s Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun\u2019s Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Journalist==\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's|McCall\u2019s]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harper\u2019s Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>The X-Rated Emperor, Vanity Fair, February 2005</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for the ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen\u2019s Club of New York.\n\n==Author==\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor\u2019s introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift\u2019s lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift\u2019s family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift\u2019s close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth\u2019s biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus\u2019s 1971 suicide.<ref>Bosworth, Patricia. Diane Arbus: A Biography. New York: Alfred Knopf, 1984</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have\u2026 more than enough material for several art legends\u2026 Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography\u2026 as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n== Death ==\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to pneumonia and complications from the novel [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.
