The traditional S\u00e1mi lifestyle, dominated by hunting, fishing and trading, was preserved until the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the modern structures of the [[Nordic countries]] were established.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi have lived in relative co-existence with their neighbors for centuries, but for the last two hundred years, especially during the second half of the 20th century, there have been many dramatic changes in S\u00e1mi culture, politics, economics and their relations with their neighboring societies. During the late 20th century, modern conflicts broke out over the construction of a hydroelectric dam, the reaction to which created a reawakening and defense of S\u00e1mi culture in recent years.  Of the eleven different historically attested [[S\u00e1mi languages]] (traditionally known as \"dialects\"), nine have survived to the present day but with most in danger of disappearing too.\n\nIt is possible that the S\u00e1mi people's existence was documented by such writers as the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]. They have on uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the ''[[Fenni]]''. However, the first Nordic sources date from the introductions of [[runes]] and include specifically the [[Account of the Viking Othere]] to [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] of England.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:LocationSapmi.png|right|350px|thumb|The area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people.]]\n\nThe area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people is known in [[Northern S\u00e1mi]] as [[S\u00e1pmi]], and typically includes the northern parts of [[Fennoscandia]]. Previously, the S\u00e1mi have probably inhabited areas further south in Fennoscandia.<ref>''Samenes Historie fram til 1750''. Lars Ivar Hansen and Bjornar Olsen. Cappelen Akademiske Forlag. 2004</ref> A few [[Neolithic|Stone Age]] cultures in the area had been speculated, especially in the 18th and early 19th centuries, to be associated with the ancestors of the S\u00e1mi, though this has been dismissed by modern scholars and extensive DNA testing. \n\n===Origin and Genetic History <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/genetic.htm|title=Origin and Genetic Background of the S\u00e1mi|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>===\nThe genetic origin of S\u00e1mi people is unclear and complex. Despite having a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]], it's not believed that they are [[Uralic]] in origin is widely believed that their genetic history is linked to the Finns, considering they share similar features, culture, and language. However, until 1999 the S\u00e1mi had not been placed on any gene map of Europe. It's now well believed that [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] having been living in what is now [[Scandinavia]] since the last [[Last ice age|ice age]] supported by recent studies of  Y chromosomal polymorphisms. It was well believed for centuries that  [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] people were of Asian origin however recent genetic studies dispute this claim, instead showing overwhelming evidence of that S\u00e1mi are descendants of the original peoples of Europe and their genetic and cultural diffusion is from subsequent isolation from other Europeans.\n\n===Ice age===\nFollowing the last [[ice age]], parts of the Norwegian coast line became free of ice in about 11,000 BC, which coincides with the formation of the [[Salpausselk\u00e4]] I ridge system in Finland.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120918061329/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VF0-44N9NHC-S&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9dcee9acd661ed2d930c8b06a53b1d69 Deglaciation chronology of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet from the Lake Onega Basin to the Salpausselk\u00e4 End Moraines]</ref> But it was not until around 7000 BC that all of Fennoscandia was free of ice. The land mass had been pressed downwards by the weight of the ice and was still partially under water.\n\n===Stone Age===\n{{See also|Nordic Stone Age}}\n\nThe commonly held view today is that the earliest settlement of the Norwegian coast belongs to one cultural continuum comprising the [[Fosna-Hensbacka culture|Fosna culture]] in southern and central Norway and what used to be called the [[Komsa culture]] in the north. The cultural complex derived from the final Palaeolithic [[Ahrensburg culture]] of northwestern Europe, spreading first to southern Norway and then very rapidly following the Norwegian coastline when receding [[glaciation]] at the end of the last [[ice age]] opened up new areas for settlement. The rapidity of this expansion is underlined by the fact that some of the earliest radiocarbon dates are actually from the north.\n\nThe term \"Fosna\" is an umbrella term for the oldest settlements along the Norwegian coast, from [[Hordaland]] to [[Nordland]]. The distinction made with the \"Komsa\" type of stone-tool culture north of the Arctic Circle was rendered obsolete in the 1970s. \"Komsa\" itself originally referred to the whole North Norwegian Mesolithic, but the term has since been abandoned by Norwegian archaeologists who now divide the northern Mesolithic into three parts, referred to simply as phases 1, 2, and 3.<ref name=BritNorway>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-214112/Norway \"Norway\"] Britannica online</ref><ref>Olsen, B. 1994.

Finds from the Sujala site, on the shores of Lake Vetsij\u00e4rvi, in [[Utsjoki]], [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], include symmetrically shaped tanged points on blades, with symmetrical ventral retouch at the tip. Points of this precise type are very characteristic of the so-called \"Post-[[Swiderian culture|Swiderian]] cultures\" of Central and Northwestern Russia and the East Baltic \u2013 but are absent in Ahrensburgian contexts. The finds also include very fine prismatic blades produced by the punch and pressure techniques, which at this time were also typical of eastern blade cultures. The finds are dated to 8,300\u20138,200 years [[Before Present#Radiocarbon calibration|BP]] \u2013 slightly later than the earliest Komsa Phase 1 finds \u2013 and indicate that the first pioneers of the inland area of northern Lapland came from the south-east. There are indications that the two populations came in contact, but which, if either of them, survived into later times remains an open question.<ref>Survey and excavation at Lake Vetsij\u00e4rvi, Lapland \u2013 Tuija Rankama & Jarmo Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4, in: PEOPLE, MATERIAL CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT IN THE NORTH, Proceedings of the 22nd Nordic Archaeological Conference, University of Oulu, 18\u201323 August 2004, Edited by Vesa-Pekka Herva [http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514281411/isbn9514281411.pdf]</ref><ref>Rankama, Tuija & Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4, Jarmo 2008, \u201cEastern arrivals in post-glacial Lapland: the Sujala site 10 000 cal BP.\u201d Antiquity Vol. 82 No. 318.</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\n{{See also|Genetic studies on Sami}}\nThe genetic origin of the S\u00e1mi is still unknown, though recent genetic research may be providing some clues.  Nevertheless, it appears that the S\u00e1mi are still primarily a blend of two populations known as European Hunter Gatherers and the Ancient North Eurasians.<ref>[https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|Distribution map of autosomal DNA in Europe]</ref> A similar blended population is called [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]] on the mainland and was called [[Scandinavian Hunter Gatherer]] when the first ancient remains in Scandinavia were sequenced. Contemporary S\u00e1mi population also shows some blending with the Indo-Europeans through an admixture of genetics similar but not identical to Near Eastern early farmers, called Caucasus Hunter Gatherers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nArcheological evidence suggests that people along the southern shores of [[Lake Onega]] and around [[Lake Ladoga]] reached the River [[Utsjoki]] in Northern Finnish Lapland before 8100 BC.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Uncovering+the+secrets+of+the+S%C3%A1mi/1135218761063 Uncovering the secrets of the S\u00e1mi], a February 2006 ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' article</ref> However, it is not likely that Sami languages are so old.

In favour of Nielsen's view, it is pointed out that no S\u00e1mi settlement to the south of Lierne in medieval times has left any traces in written sources. This argument is countered by pointing out that the S\u00e1mi culture was nomadic and non-literary, and as such would not be expected to leave written sources.<ref name=\"Gjerde\">{{cite journal |author= Hege Skalleberg Gjerde|year=2009 |title=Samiske tufter i Hallingdal? |trans-title=Sami foundations in Hallingdal? |journal=Viking |volume=72 |issue=2009 |pages=197\u2013210 |publisher= Norwegian Archaeological Society |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian }}</ref> In recent years, the number of archaeological finds that are interpreted as indicating a S\u00e1mi presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages has increased.

Around 1500, due to excessive hunting, again provoked by the fact that the S\u00e1mi had to pay taxes to Norway, Sweden and Russia, the number of reindeer started to decrease. Most S\u00e1mi then settled along the [[fjord]]s, on the coast and along the inland waterways to pursue a combination of cattle raising, trapping and fishing. A small minority of the S\u00e1mi then started to tame the reindeer, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, who, although often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypical Sami lifestyle, only represent around 10% of the Sami people.\n\nIt is believed that since the [[Viking Age]], the S\u00e1mi culture has been driven further and further north, perhaps mostly by assimilation since no findings yet support battles. However, there are some folklore called ''stalo'' or tales, about non-trading relations with a cruel warrior people, interpreted by [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius|L\u00e6stadius]] to be histories of [[Vikings]] interactions. Besides these considerations, there were also foreign trading relations. Animal hides and furs were the most common commodities and exchanged with salt, metal blades and different kinds of coins. (The latter were used as ornaments).\n\nAlong the Northern Norwegian coast, the S\u00e1mi culture came under pressure during the Iron Age by expanding Norse settlements and taxation from powerful Norse chieftains. The nature of the Norse-Sami relationship along the North-Norwegian coast in the Iron Age is still hotly debated, but possibly the S\u00e1mi were quite happy to ally themselves with the Norse chieftains, as they could provide protection against Finno-Ugric enemies from the area around the White Sea.\n\nHowever, in the early Middle Ages, this is partly reversed, as the power of the chieftains are broken by the centralized Norwegian state. Another wave of Norse settlement along the coast of [[Finnmark]] province is triggered by the fish trade in the 14th century. However, these highly specialized fishing communities made little impact on the S\u00e1mi lifestyle, and in the late Middle Ages, the two communities could exist alongside each other with little contact except occasional trading.\n\n==S\u00e1mi art==\n[[Image:Southern Sami braid design Sydsamiskt fl\u00e4tm\u00f6nster Lullis\u00e1me duodji \u00c5arjelsaemien baerkieldidh.gif|200px|right|thumb|Southern S\u00e1mi braid design]]\nTraditionally, S\u00e1mi art has been distinguished by its combination of functional appropriateness and vibrant, decorative beauty.  Both qualities grew out of a deep respect for nature, embodied in the S\u00e1mi's animism.  Their religion found its most complete expression in [[Shamanism]], evident in their worship of the ''seite'', an unusually shaped rock or tree stump that was assumed to be the home of a deity. Pictorial and sculptural art in the Western sense is a 20th-century innovation in S\u00e1mi culture used to preserve and develop key aspects of a pantheistic culture, dependent on the rhythms of the seasons.<ref>''Grove Dictionary of Art'', {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}</ref>\n\n== An economic shift ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nFrom the 15th century on, the S\u00e1mi came under increased pressure. The surrounding states, Denmark-Norway, Sweden and Russia showed increased interest in the S\u00e1mi areas. Sweden, at the time blocked from the North Sea by [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian territory]], was interested in a port at the Atlantic coast, and Russian expansion also reached the coasts of the Barents Sea. All claimed the right to tax the S\u00e1mi people, and Finnish-speaking tax collectors from the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] reached the northern coasts, their Russian colleagues collected taxes as far west as the [[Harstad]] area of Norway and the Norwegian tax collectors collected riches from the inland of the [[Kola peninsula]].\n\nHence the hunting intensified, and the number of wild reindeer declined. The S\u00e1mi were forced to do something else. Reindeer husbandry started in a limited way.  These tamed reindeer were trained to divert wild reindeer over a cliff or into hunting ditches.  Reindeer husbandry intensified.\n\nThe majority of S\u00e1mi settled along the inland rivers, fjords or coast.  They started augmenting their diet and income by fishing, either sea or freshwater, hunting other game and keeping cows, sheep and goats.\n\n[[Reindeer]] and other animals play a central part in Sami culture, though today [[Animal husbandry|reindeer husbandry]] is of dwindling economic relevance for the S\u00e1mi people. There is currently (2004) no clear indication when reindeer-raising started, perhaps about 500 AD, but tax tributes were raised in the 16th century. Since the 16th century, Samis have always paid taxes in monetary currency, and some historians have proposed that large scale husbandry is not older than from this period.\n\n''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]'' (1673), written by the [[rhetoric]]ian [[Johannes Schefferus]], is the oldest source of detailed information on S\u00e1mi culture. It was written due to \"ill-natured\" foreign propaganda (in particular from Germany) claiming that Sweden had won victories on the battlefield by means of S\u00e1mi [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In attempts to correct the picture of S\u00e1mi culture amongst the Europeans, [[Magnus de la Gardie]] started an early '[[ethnological]]' research project to document S\u00e1mi groups, conducted by Schefferus. The book was published in late 1673 and quickly translated to [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], English, and other languages (though not to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] until 1956). However, an adapted and abridged version was quickly published in the Netherlands and Germany, where chapters on their difficult living conditions, topography, and the environment had been replaced by made-up stories of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[drum]]s and [[Paganism|heathenry]]. But there was also criticism against the ethnography, claiming S\u00e1mi to be more warlike in character, rather than the image Schefferus presented.\n\n==Swedish advances into S\u00e1pmi==\n\n{{see also|Lappmarken}}\n\nSince the 15th century, the S\u00e1mi people have traditionally been subjects of Sweden, Norway, Russia and for some time Denmark. In the 16th century [[Gustav I of Sweden]] officially claimed that all S\u00e1mi should be under Swedish realm. However, the area was shared between the countries (i.e. only Sweden and Norway\u2014at that time the Baltic-Finnic tribes of the region that is now Finland were also subjects of Sweden) and the border was set up to be the water flux line in [[Fennoscandia]]. After this \"unification\", the society, a structure with a few ruling and wealthy citizens called [[birkarl]]s, ceased to exist, especially with the new king [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]] who swore by his crown to be the \"... Lappers j Nordlanden, the Caijaners\" king 1607.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040705050558/http://www.geocities.com/eurprin/sweden.html Titles of European hereditary rulers - Sweden] Konung Christoffers Landslag. Edictum Regis Caroli IX eius iussu edito textui praescriptum</ref> [[Yoik]]ing, drumming and sacrifices were now abandoned and seen as (juridical terms) \"magic\" or \"sorcery\", something that was probably aimed at removing opposition against the crown. The hard custody of S\u00e1mi peoples resulted in a great loss of S\u00e1mi culture.\n\nIn the 1630s Swedish authorities imposed a [[corv\u00e9e|corve\u00e9 system]] on [[sami people|sami]] communities near [[Nasa silver mine]].<ref name=Hansson2015-17>Hansson 2015, p. 17.</ref><ref name=Hansson2015-18>Hansson 2015, p. 18.</ref> Mining at Nasa siulver mine proved unprofitable and ended in 1659 it nevertheless caused many sami to move to [[Torne lappmark]] in the 1640s and 1650s to avoid forced labour.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/> There are reports of sami who served in the mining activities becoming extremely empoverished turning into beggars as concequence.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/>  \n\nThe boundary agreement (like a \"Codex Lapponia\") between Sweden and Norway had an attachment; frequently called ''Lappkodicillen'' or \"Samic [[Magna Carta]]\". It has the same meaning for S\u00e1mi even today (or at least till 2005), but is only a [[Treaty|convention]] between Sweden and Norway and does not include Finland and Russia. It regulates how the land is shared by S\u00e1mi peoples between the border of Sweden and Norway.\n\nAfter the 17th century, many S\u00e1mi families lost the right to use Swedish land since they were poor and could not pay tribute for it like other subjects. The state also took the S\u00e1mi area in tighter control with specific [[Lappmarken|Lappmark Regulations]], enforcing non-S\u00e1mi settlements on the area. This fostered opposition among S\u00e1mi groups that wanted hunting, fishing, and pastoralistic areas back. Instead other groups often took over to put more use to the land. It was also at this time the county of [[Laponia (historical province)|Lappland]] was established in Sweden.\n\n==Russian interest==\nIn the 16th century, as part of a general expansion period for the Russian empire, missionaries were sent to the far reaches of the empire, and several [[Russian Orthodox]] chapels were built on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. The westernmost advance was St. George's chapel in [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]]/Njavdam near [[Kirkenes]] in the Norwegian/Russian borderlands. \n\n==Dano-Norwegian policies in the North==\nOn the Norwegian side, the S\u00e1mi were converted to the Lutheran faith around 1720. Thomas von Westen was the leading man of the missionary effort, and his methods included the burning of shamanic drums. However, economically the S\u00e1mi were not that badly off, compared to the Norwegian population. They were free to trade with whom they wanted, and entertained trade links with Norwegians and Russians alike. However, the crumbling economy of the Norwegian communities along the outer coast led to increased pressure on the land and conflicts between the two communities.\n\n==19th century: Increased pressure==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Carl B\u00f8gh - En rensdyrhjord drives til malkepladsen.

In 1826, the [[Norway\u2013Russia border|Norwegian/Russian border]] treaty finally drew the border between Norway and Finland-Russia, where large tracts of land had previously been more or less governing themselves under very light joint control from Russia, Sweden and Denmark-Norway. This meant that reindeer herders who until now had stayed in Finland in Winter and on the Norwegian coast in Summer, could no longer cross the borders. The Norwegian/Swedish border, however, could still be crossed by reindeer herders until 1940.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi crossed the borders freely until 1826, when the Norwegian/Finnish/Russian border was closed. S\u00e1mi were still free to cross the border between Sweden and Norway according to inherited rights laid down in the [[Lapp Codicil of 1751]] until 1940, when the border was closed due to Germany's occupation of Norway. After World War II, they were not allowed to return. Their summer pasturages are today used by S\u00e1mi originating in Kautokeino.\n\nFor long periods of time, the S\u00e1mi lifestyle reigned supreme in the north because of its unique adaptation to the [[Arctic]] environment, enabling S\u00e1mi culture to resist cultural influences from the South. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the S\u00e1mi cultural element was strengthened, since the S\u00e1mi were independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\n===Economical marginalization===\nIn all countries, the 19th century was a period of economic growth. In Norway, cities were founded and fish exports increased. The S\u00e1mi way of life became increasingly outdated, and the S\u00e1mi were marginalized and left out of the general expansion.\n\n===Christianization and the Laestadius Movement===\nIn the 1840s, the Swedish S\u00e1mi minister, [[Lars Levi Laestadius]], preached a particularly strict version of the Lutheran teachings. This led to a religious awakening among the S\u00e1mi across every border, often with much animosity towards the authorities and the established church. In 1852, this led to riots in the municipality of [[Kautokeino]], where the minister was badly beaten and the local tradesman slain by fanatic \"crusaders\".  The leaders of the riots were later executed or condemned to long imprisonment. After this initial violent outbreak, the Laestadius movement continued to gain ground in Sweden, Norway and Finland. However, the leaders now insisted on a more cooperative attitude with the authorities.\n\n===Cultural pressure===\nIn Norway, the use of S\u00e1mi in teaching and preaching had initially been encouraged. However, with the rise in nationalism in Norway from the 1860s onward, the Norwegian authorities changed their policies in a more nationalistic direction. From around 1900 this was intensified, and no S\u00e1mi could be used in public school or in the official church.\n\n== The Early 20th Century through World War II ==\n[[File:Lappeleir (27873424552).jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi camp in Norway, c. 1900, painted by [[Wilhelm Peters (painter)|Wilhelm Peters]]]] \n[[File:Older postcard with Sami.jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi people in Norway]]\nIn the 20th century, Norwegian authorities put the S\u00e1mi culture under pressure in order to make the Norwegian language and culture universal. A strong economical development of the north also took place, giving Norwegian culture and language status. On the Swedish and Finnish side, the authorities were much less militant in their efforts; however, strong economic development in the north led to a weakening of status and economy for the S\u00e1mi.\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out S\u00e1mi culture. Notably, anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]], had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language. This also ultimately caused the [[Dislocation of S\u00e1mi people|dislocation]] in the 1920s, that increased the gap between local S\u00e1mi groups, something still present today, and sometimes bears the character of an internal S\u00e1mi ethnic conflict. \n\nJust as every portion of the European continent, the circumpolar lands of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union were not spared the wrath of World War II. For the Saami, who had no concept of national sovereignty, the concept of nations fighting over land was alien. Never less, the Saami would become entrapped in the conflict from all sides. Another factor was the heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944\u201345, destroying all existing houses and visible traces of S\u00e1mi culture. After World War II the pressure was relaxed somewhat.\n\n===Prewar hardliners in Norway===\n{{See also|Norwegianization}}\n\nThe 20th century started with yet increased pressure on the Norwegian side of the border. In the name of progress, Norwegian language and culture was promoted, and S\u00e1mi language and culture were dismissed as backward, uncultured, downright ridiculous and even the product of an inferior race. Land that previously belonged to no one, and was used according to age-old principles, was considered state property. Settlers had to prove they could speak Norwegian well before they could claim new land for agriculture.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, the policies were at first markedly less militant. Teachers followed S\u00e1mi reindeer herders to provide education for the children, but S\u00e1mi areas were increasingly exploited by the then new mines in [[Kiruna]] and [[G\u00e4llivare]] and the construction of the Lule\u00e5-Narvik railway.\n\nLater, with the founding of the [[Statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi|Swedish Race Biology Institute]], S\u00e1mi graves were plundered to provide research material.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book|title=Museum of Dalarna \"The dark legacy\" exhibition in Sweden |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2007 |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage 31 May 2010\">{{Cite news|title=University in quest to return Sami bones |last=Savage |first=James |authorlink= |date=31 May 2010 |publisher=The Local: Sweden's News in English |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.thelocal.se/26954/20100531/ }}</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn Russia, the age-old ways of life of the S\u00e1mi were brutally interrupted by the collectivization of the reindeer husbandry and agriculture in general. Most S\u00e1mi were organized in a single [[kolkhoz]], located in the central part of the Peninsula, at Lovozero (S\u00e1mi: ''Lojavri''). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the S\u00e1mi people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including [[Nenets people|Nenets]] and other Arctic peoples.\n\n=== [[Winter War|Winter War (1939-1940):]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nThe first fighting Saami became entangled in was between Finland and the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939 when the Soviet Union invaded Finland after the Soviets were denied the ability to construct military bases there. [[Red Army|The Red Army]], believing that they could easily march across Finland to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], made the mistake of invading Finland during an unusually cold winter and suffered 27,000 casualties compared to the Finnish mere 2,700. However, as the weather warmed in March 1940, the Finnish line was breached and facing the far larger Soviet forces, was forced to sue for peace on March 12. \n\n=== German invasion and occupation of Norway: <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nOn April 9<sup>th</sup>, 1940 Hitler began [[Norwegian campaign order of battle|Operation Weser]] and invaded Norway. With assistance from Norwegian Defense Minister and Nazi sympathizer [[Vidkun Quisling]], the Germans were quickly able to gain a foothold. The Nazi's viewed ethnic \u201cNordic Norwegians\u201d who are Germanic and oftentimes blonde haired and blue eyed to be Aryans just like Germans. Quisling shared their view and proposed the complete eradication of the Saami people who he viewed as ethnically inferior. Despite the urging of Winston Churchill, British support for the Norwegians was appalling slow, an action that is responsible for making him Prime Minister. As a result, the Nazis easily capture the Northern port of [[Narvik]]. Despite a blockade by the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Nav]]<nowiki/>y, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] were able to hide in the mountains by forcing local Saami to serve as guides.\n\nOn April 20<sup>th</sup> 1940, [[King Haakon]] and the Norwegian government fled to London along with most of the allied troops stationed there and formed a government in exile, however Norwegians continued fighting the Nazis through underground resistance. These resistance fighters included many S\u00e1ami who had formerly served as part of the Norwegian Ski Brigade and were instrumental in destroying a secret German Nuclear base in [[Telemark]] in 1944. However, many other Norwegian S\u00e1ami were forced into labor for the SS in mining to mine iron ore and build a railway from Narvik to Finland through [[Finnmark]]. Forced sterilization and deportations were also not uncommon \n\n=== [[Continuation War|Continuation War:]] ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler offered Finland assistance in recapturing the lost territory to the Soviets. Finnish Saami were especially receptive to the idea because the much Kola peninsula which Russia had seized was their homeland. However, Finland never formerly joined the Axis powers, remained a democracy, and no Finnish Jews were ever deported during the Holocaust. The Finns with assistance from the SS Nord invaded South Kola on June 1<sup>st</sup>, 1941. Most Finnish Saami served as part of the \u201cLong Distance Patrol\u201d because of their abilities on skis and familiarity with the terrain.\n\nUnfortunately, Finnish Saami, being supplied by forced labor of Norwegian Saami, were forced to fight Russian Saami during this phase of the war. Many Saami fighting for the Soviets attempted to defect to the Finnish side. With Finnish assistance, many Saami villages in the Soviet territory were evacuated to Sweden for the remainder of the war. However, other Saami were not so lucky and along with many other Soviet soldiers and civilians were placed in prison and even concentration camps. This angered the Finnish government who also refused to assist the Wehrmacht in seizing Leningrad. Eventually the tide turned in favor of the Red Army and Soviet troops marched back into Finland and on June 9<sup>th</sup>, 1944, the Red Army got within striking distance of Helsinki. The Finns sued for peace and lost much territory including a large part of Saami.\n\n===[[Lapland War|Lapland War (1944-45)]] ===\nAs a result of Finland's peace deal with the Soviets, German troops were required to leave the country. The withdrawal of the German Wehrmacht from Northern Finland and far north of Norway meant that all houses, roads and infrastructure were destroyed. This meant forced evacuation, destruction, an economic setback and the loss of all visible history. The Germans committed many atrocities against the Norwegians and Norwegian Sa\u00e1mi at this time including raping hundreds of women, many of whom committed suicide because of the trauma. The [[Finnmark]] province, the north-eastern municipalities of [[Troms]] province and all of the northern areas of Finland were but smoking ruins. Eventually Soviet Troops fulling invaded Sampi with the assistance of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|Norwegian Army in Exile]] liberated Finnmark. On April 26th 1945 [[Liberation of Finnmark|Finnmark was finally liberated.]] \n\n==Renewed interest==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nNews in S\u00e1mi on national radio in Norway started in 1946. At about the same time, experiments were being done with bilingual teachings of the alphabet in the first and second grade, to ease the learning process. However, the presence of a S\u00e1mi minority in Norway was largely ignored. Education, communication, industrialization, all contributed to integrating S\u00e1mi communities into Norwegian society at the point of losing identity.\n\nThe conflicts between S\u00e1mi and the Nordic governments continued into the mid 20th century. The proposed construction of the hydro power dam in the 1960s and 1970s contained [[Alta controversy|controversial]] propositions such as putting a village ([[M\u00e1ze]]) and a cemetery under water.\n\nOnly a minor part is today working with reindeer husbandry. There are also minor groups working as fishermen, producing S\u00e1mi arts and serving tourism. Besides having a voting length in the [[S\u00e1mi parliaments]] (with differing levels of authority and autonomy in various countries) or influence in any [[S\u00e1mi language]], the rest are ordinary citizens, adhering to the Scandinavian culture. In Sweden, major parts of [[Norrland]] (and not only [[S\u00e1mi villages]]) are also experiencing major emigration to larger towns.\n\nWith the creation of the [[Republic of Finland]] in the first half of the 20th century, the S\u00e1mi inhabiting this area were no longer under the rule of the Russian Empire, but instead citizens of the newly created state of Finland.  The [[S\u00e1mi Parliament of Finland]] was created in 1973.  One recent issue concerning S\u00e1mi rights in Finland is the foresting of traditional S\u00e1mi land by state-owned Finnish companies.\n\nSince 1992, the S\u00e1mi have had their own national day; the February 6.\n\nIn 1898 and 1907/08 some S\u00e1mi emigrated to [[Alaska]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], respectively, due to requests from the American government. Their mission was to teach reindeer herding to Native Americans.

The traditional S\u00e1mi lifestyle, dominated by hunting, fishing and trading, was preserved until the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the modern structures of the [[Nordic countries]] were established.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi have lived in relative co-existence with their neighbors for centuries, but for the last two hundred years, especially during the second half of the 20th century, there have been many dramatic changes in S\u00e1mi culture, politics, economics and their relations with their neighboring societies. During the late 20th century, modern conflicts broke out over the construction of a hydroelectric dam, the reaction to which created a reawakening and defense of S\u00e1mi culture in recent years.  Of the eleven different historically attested [[S\u00e1mi languages]] (traditionally known as \"dialects\"), nine have survived to the present day but with most in danger of disappearing too.\n\nIt is possible that the S\u00e1mi people's existence was documented by such writers as the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]. They have on uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the ''[[Fenni]]''. However, the first Nordic sources date from the introductions of [[runes]] and include specifically the [[Account of the Viking Othere]] to [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] of England.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:LocationSapmi.png|right|350px|thumb|The area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people.]]\n\nThe area traditionally inhabited by the S\u00e1mi people is known in [[Northern S\u00e1mi]] as [[S\u00e1pmi]], and typically includes the northern parts of [[Fennoscandia]]. Previously, the S\u00e1mi have probably inhabited areas further south in Fennoscandia.<ref>''Samenes Historie fram til 1750''. Lars Ivar Hansen and Bjornar Olsen. Cappelen Akademiske Forlag. 2004</ref> A few [[Neolithic|Stone Age]] cultures in the area had been speculated, especially in the 18th and early 19th centuries, to be associated with the ancestors of the S\u00e1mi, though this has been dismissed by modern scholars and extensive DNA testing. \n\n===Origin and Genetic History <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/genetic.htm|title=Origin and Genetic Background of the S\u00e1mi|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>===\nThe genetic origin of S\u00e1mi people is unclear and complex. Despite having a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]], it's not believed that they are [[Uralic]] in origin is widely believed that their genetic history is linked to the Finns, considering they share similar features, culture, and language. However, until 1999 the S\u00e1mi had not been placed on any gene map of Europe. It's now well believed that [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] having been living in what is now [[Scandinavia]] since the last [[Last ice age|ice age]] supported by recent studies of  Y chromosomal polymorphisms. It was well believed for centuries that  [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-S\u00e1mic]] people were of Asian origin however recent genetic studies dispute this claim, instead showing overwhelming evidence of that S\u00e1mi are descendants of the original peoples of Europe and their genetic and cultural diffusion is from subsequent isolation from other Europeans.\n\n===Ice age===\nFollowing the last [[ice age]], parts of the Norwegian coast line became free of ice in about 11,000 BC, which coincides with the formation of the [[Salpausselk\u00e4]] I ridge system in Finland.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120918061329/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VF0-44N9NHC-S&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9dcee9acd661ed2d930c8b06a53b1d69 Deglaciation chronology of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet from the Lake Onega Basin to the Salpausselk\u00e4 End Moraines]</ref> But it was not until around 7000 BC that all of Fennoscandia was free of ice. The land mass had been pressed downwards by the weight of the ice and was still partially under water.\n\n===Stone Age===\n{{See also|Nordic Stone Age}}\n\nThe commonly held view today is that the earliest settlement of the Norwegian coast belongs to one cultural continuum comprising the [[Fosna-Hensbacka culture|Fosna culture]] in southern and central Norway and what used to be called the [[Komsa culture]] in the north. The cultural complex derived from the final Palaeolithic [[Ahrensburg culture]] of northwestern Europe, spreading first to southern Norway and then very rapidly following the Norwegian coastline when receding [[glaciation]] at the end of the last [[ice age]] opened up new areas for settlement. The rapidity of this expansion is underlined by the fact that some of the earliest radiocarbon dates are actually from the north.\n\nThe term \"Fosna\" is an umbrella term for the oldest settlements along the Norwegian coast, from [[Hordaland]] to [[Nordland]]. The distinction made with the \"Komsa\" type of stone-tool culture north of the Arctic Circle was rendered obsolete in the 1970s. \"Komsa\" itself originally referred to the whole North Norwegian Mesolithic, but the term has since been abandoned by Norwegian archaeologists who now divide the northern Mesolithic into three parts, referred to simply as phases 1, 2, and 3.<ref name=BritNorway>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-214112/Norway \"Norway\"] Britannica online</ref><ref>Olsen, B. 1994.

Finds from the Sujala site, on the shores of Lake Vetsij\u00e4rvi, in [[Utsjoki]], [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], include symmetrically shaped tanged points on blades, with symmetrical ventral retouch at the tip. Points of this precise type are very characteristic of the so-called \"Post-[[Swiderian culture|Swiderian]] cultures\" of Central and Northwestern Russia and the East Baltic \u2013 but are absent in Ahrensburgian contexts. The finds also include very fine prismatic blades produced by the punch and pressure techniques, which at this time were also typical of eastern blade cultures. The finds are dated to 8,300\u20138,200 years [[Before Present#Radiocarbon calibration|BP]] \u2013 slightly later than the earliest Komsa Phase 1 finds \u2013 and indicate that the first pioneers of the inland area of northern Lapland came from the south-east. There are indications that the two populations came in contact, but which, if either of them, survived into later times remains an open question.<ref>Survey and excavation at Lake Vetsij\u00e4rvi, Lapland \u2013 Tuija Rankama & Jarmo Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4, in: PEOPLE, MATERIAL CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT IN THE NORTH, Proceedings of the 22nd Nordic Archaeological Conference, University of Oulu, 18\u201323 August 2004, Edited by Vesa-Pekka Herva [http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514281411/isbn9514281411.pdf]</ref><ref>Rankama, Tuija & Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4, Jarmo 2008, \u201cEastern arrivals in post-glacial Lapland: the Sujala site 10 000 cal BP.\u201d Antiquity Vol. 82 No. 318.</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\n{{See also|Genetic studies on Sami}}\nThe genetic origin of the S\u00e1mi is still unknown, though recent genetic research may be providing some clues.

Contemporary S\u00e1mi population also shows some blending with the Indo-Europeans through an admixture of genetics similar but not identical to Near Eastern early farmers, called Caucasus Hunter Gatherers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nArcheological evidence suggests that people along the southern shores of [[Lake Onega]] and around [[Lake Ladoga]] reached the River [[Utsjoki]] in Northern Finnish Lapland before 8100 BC.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Uncovering+the+secrets+of+the+S%C3%A1mi/1135218761063 Uncovering the secrets of the S\u00e1mi], a February 2006 ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' article</ref> However, it is not likely that Sami languages are so old.

The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen was commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle the contemporary question of S\u00e1mi land rights. He concluded that the S\u00e1mi had lived no further south than [[Lierne]] in [[Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county until around 1500, when they had started moving south, reaching the area around Lake [[Femunden]] in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Yngvar Nielsen|authorlink= Yngvar Nielsen|year=1891 |title=Lappernes fremrykning mod syd i Trondhjems stift og Hedemarkens amt |trans-title=The incursion of Lapps southwards in the see of Trondhjem and county of Hedemarken |journal=Det Norske Geografiske Selskabs \u00e5rbog |volume=1 |issue=1889\u20131890 |pages=18\u201352 |location=Kristiania |language=Norwegian }}</ref> This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In favour of Nielsen's view, it is pointed out that no S\u00e1mi settlement to the south of Lierne in medieval times has left any traces in written sources. This argument is countered by pointing out that the S\u00e1mi culture was nomadic and non-literary, and as such would not be expected to leave written sources.<ref name=\"Gjerde\">{{cite journal |author= Hege Skalleberg Gjerde|year=2009 |title=Samiske tufter i Hallingdal? |trans-title=Sami foundations in Hallingdal? |journal=Viking |volume=72 |issue=2009 |pages=197\u2013210 |publisher= Norwegian Archaeological Society |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian }}</ref> In recent years, the number of archaeological finds that are interpreted as indicating a S\u00e1mi presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages has increased. These include foundations in [[Lesja]], in [[Vang, Oppland|Vang]] in [[Valdres]] and in [[Hol]] and [[\u00c5l]] in [[Hallingdal]].<ref name=\"Gjerde\" /> Proponents of the S\u00e1mi interpretations of these finds assume a mixed population of Norse and S\u00e1mi people in the mountainous areas of Southern Norway in the Middle Ages.<ref>{{rp|208}}</ref>\n\nUp to around 1500 the S\u00e1mi were mainly fishermen and trappers, usually in a combination, leading a nomadic lifestyle decided by the migrations of the [[reindeer]]. Around 1500, due to excessive hunting, again provoked by the fact that the S\u00e1mi had to pay taxes to Norway, Sweden and Russia, the number of reindeer started to decrease. Most S\u00e1mi then settled along the [[fjord]]s, on the coast and along the inland waterways to pursue a combination of cattle raising, trapping and fishing. A small minority of the S\u00e1mi then started to tame the reindeer, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, who, although often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypical Sami lifestyle, only represent around 10% of the Sami people.\n\nIt is believed that since the [[Viking Age]], the S\u00e1mi culture has been driven further and further north, perhaps mostly by assimilation since no findings yet support battles. However, there are some folklore called ''stalo'' or tales, about non-trading relations with a cruel warrior people, interpreted by [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius|L\u00e6stadius]] to be histories of [[Vikings]] interactions. Besides these considerations, there were also foreign trading relations. Animal hides and furs were the most common commodities and exchanged with salt, metal blades and different kinds of coins. (The latter were used as ornaments).\n\nAlong the Northern Norwegian coast, the S\u00e1mi culture came under pressure during the Iron Age by expanding Norse settlements and taxation from powerful Norse chieftains. The nature of the Norse-Sami relationship along the North-Norwegian coast in the Iron Age is still hotly debated, but possibly the S\u00e1mi were quite happy to ally themselves with the Norse chieftains, as they could provide protection against Finno-Ugric enemies from the area around the White Sea.\n\nHowever, in the early Middle Ages, this is partly reversed, as the power of the chieftains are broken by the centralized Norwegian state. Another wave of Norse settlement along the coast of [[Finnmark]] province is triggered by the fish trade in the 14th century. However, these highly specialized fishing communities made little impact on the S\u00e1mi lifestyle, and in the late Middle Ages, the two communities could exist alongside each other with little contact except occasional trading.\n\n==S\u00e1mi art==\n[[Image:Southern Sami braid design Sydsamiskt fl\u00e4tm\u00f6nster Lullis\u00e1me duodji \u00c5arjelsaemien baerkieldidh.gif|200px|right|thumb|Southern S\u00e1mi braid design]]\nTraditionally, S\u00e1mi art has been distinguished by its combination of functional appropriateness and vibrant, decorative beauty.  Both qualities grew out of a deep respect for nature, embodied in the S\u00e1mi's animism.  Their religion found its most complete expression in [[Shamanism]], evident in their worship of the ''seite'', an unusually shaped rock or tree stump that was assumed to be the home of a deity. Pictorial and sculptural art in the Western sense is a 20th-century innovation in S\u00e1mi culture used to preserve and develop key aspects of a pantheistic culture, dependent on the rhythms of the seasons.<ref>''Grove Dictionary of Art'', {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}</ref>\n\n== An economic shift ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nFrom the 15th century on, the S\u00e1mi came under increased pressure. The surrounding states, Denmark-Norway, Sweden and Russia showed increased interest in the S\u00e1mi areas. Sweden, at the time blocked from the North Sea by [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian territory]], was interested in a port at the Atlantic coast, and Russian expansion also reached the coasts of the Barents Sea. All claimed the right to tax the S\u00e1mi people, and Finnish-speaking tax collectors from the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] reached the northern coasts, their Russian colleagues collected taxes as far west as the [[Harstad]] area of Norway and the Norwegian tax collectors collected riches from the inland of the [[Kola peninsula]].\n\nHence the hunting intensified, and the number of wild reindeer declined. The S\u00e1mi were forced to do something else. Reindeer husbandry started in a limited way.  These tamed reindeer were trained to divert wild reindeer over a cliff or into hunting ditches.  Reindeer husbandry intensified.\n\nThe majority of S\u00e1mi settled along the inland rivers, fjords or coast.  They started augmenting their diet and income by fishing, either sea or freshwater, hunting other game and keeping cows, sheep and goats.\n\n[[Reindeer]] and other animals play a central part in Sami culture, though today [[Animal husbandry|reindeer husbandry]] is of dwindling economic relevance for the S\u00e1mi people. There is currently (2004) no clear indication when reindeer-raising started, perhaps about 500 AD, but tax tributes were raised in the 16th century. Since the 16th century, Samis have always paid taxes in monetary currency, and some historians have proposed that large scale husbandry is not older than from this period.\n\n''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]'' (1673), written by the [[rhetoric]]ian [[Johannes Schefferus]], is the oldest source of detailed information on S\u00e1mi culture. It was written due to \"ill-natured\" foreign propaganda (in particular from Germany) claiming that Sweden had won victories on the battlefield by means of S\u00e1mi [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In attempts to correct the picture of S\u00e1mi culture amongst the Europeans, [[Magnus de la Gardie]] started an early '[[ethnological]]' research project to document S\u00e1mi groups, conducted by Schefferus. The book was published in late 1673 and quickly translated to [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], English, and other languages (though not to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] until 1956). However, an adapted and abridged version was quickly published in the Netherlands and Germany, where chapters on their difficult living conditions, topography, and the environment had been replaced by made-up stories of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[drum]]s and [[Paganism|heathenry]]. But there was also criticism against the ethnography, claiming S\u00e1mi to be more warlike in character, rather than the image Schefferus presented.\n\n==Swedish advances into S\u00e1pmi==\n\n{{see also|Lappmarken}}\n\nSince the 15th century, the S\u00e1mi people have traditionally been subjects of Sweden, Norway, Russia and for some time Denmark. In the 16th century [[Gustav I of Sweden]] officially claimed that all S\u00e1mi should be under Swedish realm. However, the area was shared between the countries (i.e. only Sweden and Norway\u2014at that time the Baltic-Finnic tribes of the region that is now Finland were also subjects of Sweden) and the border was set up to be the water flux line in [[Fennoscandia]]. After this \"unification\", the society, a structure with a few ruling and wealthy citizens called [[birkarl]]s, ceased to exist, especially with the new king [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]] who swore by his crown to be the \"... Lappers j Nordlanden, the Caijaners\" king 1607.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040705050558/http://www.geocities.com/eurprin/sweden.html Titles of European hereditary rulers - Sweden] Konung Christoffers Landslag.

The hard custody of S\u00e1mi peoples resulted in a great loss of S\u00e1mi culture.\n\nIn the 1630s Swedish authorities imposed a [[corv\u00e9e|corve\u00e9 system]] on [[sami people|sami]] communities near [[Nasa silver mine]].<ref name=Hansson2015-17>Hansson 2015, p. 17.</ref><ref name=Hansson2015-18>Hansson 2015, p. 18.</ref> Mining at Nasa siulver mine proved unprofitable and ended in 1659 it nevertheless caused many sami to move to [[Torne lappmark]] in the 1640s and 1650s to avoid forced labour.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/> There are reports of sami who served in the mining activities becoming extremely empoverished turning into beggars as concequence.<ref name=Hansson2015-18/>  \n\nThe boundary agreement (like a \"Codex Lapponia\") between Sweden and Norway had an attachment; frequently called ''Lappkodicillen'' or \"Samic [[Magna Carta]]\". It has the same meaning for S\u00e1mi even today (or at least till 2005), but is only a [[Treaty|convention]] between Sweden and Norway and does not include Finland and Russia. It regulates how the land is shared by S\u00e1mi peoples between the border of Sweden and Norway.\n\nAfter the 17th century, many S\u00e1mi families lost the right to use Swedish land since they were poor and could not pay tribute for it like other subjects. The state also took the S\u00e1mi area in tighter control with specific [[Lappmarken|Lappmark Regulations]], enforcing non-S\u00e1mi settlements on the area. This fostered opposition among S\u00e1mi groups that wanted hunting, fishing, and pastoralistic areas back. Instead other groups often took over to put more use to the land. It was also at this time the county of [[Laponia (historical province)|Lappland]] was established in Sweden.\n\n==Russian interest==\nIn the 16th century, as part of a general expansion period for the Russian empire, missionaries were sent to the far reaches of the empire, and several [[Russian Orthodox]] chapels were built on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. The westernmost advance was St. George's chapel in [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]]/Njavdam near [[Kirkenes]] in the Norwegian/Russian borderlands. \n\n==Dano-Norwegian policies in the North==\nOn the Norwegian side, the S\u00e1mi were converted to the Lutheran faith around 1720. Thomas von Westen was the leading man of the missionary effort, and his methods included the burning of shamanic drums. However, economically the S\u00e1mi were not that badly off, compared to the Norwegian population. They were free to trade with whom they wanted, and entertained trade links with Norwegians and Russians alike. However, the crumbling economy of the Norwegian communities along the outer coast led to increased pressure on the land and conflicts between the two communities.\n\n==19th century: Increased pressure==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Carl B\u00f8gh - En rensdyrhjord drives til malkepladsen. Motivet fra h\u00f8jfjeldene nord for R\u00f8ros - KMS1079 - Statens Museum for Kunst.jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi people, c. 1875]]\n[[File:Three S\u00e1mi Lapp women, c1890s.jpg|thumb|Three S\u00e1mi women circa 1890s]]\nThe 19th century led to increased interest in the far north.\n\n===New borders in an old land===\nIn 1809, Finland was seized by Russia, creating a new border right through the S\u00e1mi area. In 1826, the [[Norway\u2013Russia border|Norwegian/Russian border]] treaty finally drew the border between Norway and Finland-Russia, where large tracts of land had previously been more or less governing themselves under very light joint control from Russia, Sweden and Denmark-Norway. This meant that reindeer herders who until now had stayed in Finland in Winter and on the Norwegian coast in Summer, could no longer cross the borders. The Norwegian/Swedish border, however, could still be crossed by reindeer herders until 1940.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi crossed the borders freely until 1826, when the Norwegian/Finnish/Russian border was closed. S\u00e1mi were still free to cross the border between Sweden and Norway according to inherited rights laid down in the [[Lapp Codicil of 1751]] until 1940, when the border was closed due to Germany's occupation of Norway. After World War II, they were not allowed to return. Their summer pasturages are today used by S\u00e1mi originating in Kautokeino.\n\nFor long periods of time, the S\u00e1mi lifestyle reigned supreme in the north because of its unique adaptation to the [[Arctic]] environment, enabling S\u00e1mi culture to resist cultural influences from the South. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the S\u00e1mi cultural element was strengthened, since the S\u00e1mi were independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\n===Economical marginalization===\nIn all countries, the 19th century was a period of economic growth. In Norway, cities were founded and fish exports increased. The S\u00e1mi way of life became increasingly outdated, and the S\u00e1mi were marginalized and left out of the general expansion.\n\n===Christianization and the Laestadius Movement===\nIn the 1840s, the Swedish S\u00e1mi minister, [[Lars Levi Laestadius]], preached a particularly strict version of the Lutheran teachings. This led to a religious awakening among the S\u00e1mi across every border, often with much animosity towards the authorities and the established church. In 1852, this led to riots in the municipality of [[Kautokeino]], where the minister was badly beaten and the local tradesman slain by fanatic \"crusaders\".  The leaders of the riots were later executed or condemned to long imprisonment. After this initial violent outbreak, the Laestadius movement continued to gain ground in Sweden, Norway and Finland. However, the leaders now insisted on a more cooperative attitude with the authorities.\n\n===Cultural pressure===\nIn Norway, the use of S\u00e1mi in teaching and preaching had initially been encouraged. However, with the rise in nationalism in Norway from the 1860s onward, the Norwegian authorities changed their policies in a more nationalistic direction. From around 1900 this was intensified, and no S\u00e1mi could be used in public school or in the official church.\n\n== The Early 20th Century through World War II ==\n[[File:Lappeleir (27873424552).jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi camp in Norway, c. 1900, painted by [[Wilhelm Peters (painter)|Wilhelm Peters]]]] \n[[File:Older postcard with Sami.jpg|thumb|S\u00e1mi people in Norway]]\nIn the 20th century, Norwegian authorities put the S\u00e1mi culture under pressure in order to make the Norwegian language and culture universal. A strong economical development of the north also took place, giving Norwegian culture and language status. On the Swedish and Finnish side, the authorities were much less militant in their efforts; however, strong economic development in the north led to a weakening of status and economy for the S\u00e1mi.\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out S\u00e1mi culture. Notably, anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]], had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language. This also ultimately caused the [[Dislocation of S\u00e1mi people|dislocation]] in the 1920s, that increased the gap between local S\u00e1mi groups, something still present today, and sometimes bears the character of an internal S\u00e1mi ethnic conflict. \n\nJust as every portion of the European continent, the circumpolar lands of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union were not spared the wrath of World War II. For the Saami, who had no concept of national sovereignty, the concept of nations fighting over land was alien. Never less, the Saami would become entrapped in the conflict from all sides. Another factor was the heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944\u201345, destroying all existing houses and visible traces of S\u00e1mi culture. After World War II the pressure was relaxed somewhat.\n\n===Prewar hardliners in Norway===\n{{See also|Norwegianization}}\n\nThe 20th century started with yet increased pressure on the Norwegian side of the border. In the name of progress, Norwegian language and culture was promoted, and S\u00e1mi language and culture were dismissed as backward, uncultured, downright ridiculous and even the product of an inferior race. Land that previously belonged to no one, and was used according to age-old principles, was considered state property. Settlers had to prove they could speak Norwegian well before they could claim new land for agriculture.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, the policies were at first markedly less militant. Teachers followed S\u00e1mi reindeer herders to provide education for the children, but S\u00e1mi areas were increasingly exploited by the then new mines in [[Kiruna]] and [[G\u00e4llivare]] and the construction of the Lule\u00e5-Narvik railway.\n\nLater, with the founding of the [[Statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi|Swedish Race Biology Institute]], S\u00e1mi graves were plundered to provide research material.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book|title=Museum of Dalarna \"The dark legacy\" exhibition in Sweden |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2007 |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage 31 May 2010\">{{Cite news|title=University in quest to return Sami bones |last=Savage |first=James |authorlink= |date=31 May 2010 |publisher=The Local: Sweden's News in English |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=|url=http://www.thelocal.se/26954/20100531/ }}</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn Russia, the age-old ways of life of the S\u00e1mi were brutally interrupted by the collectivization of the reindeer husbandry and agriculture in general. Most S\u00e1mi were organized in a single [[kolkhoz]], located in the central part of the Peninsula, at Lovozero (S\u00e1mi: ''Lojavri''). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the S\u00e1mi people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including [[Nenets people|Nenets]] and other Arctic peoples.\n\n=== [[Winter War|Winter War (1939-1940):]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nThe first fighting Saami became entangled in was between Finland and the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939 when the Soviet Union invaded Finland after the Soviets were denied the ability to construct military bases there. [[Red Army|The Red Army]], believing that they could easily march across Finland to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], made the mistake of invading Finland during an unusually cold winter and suffered 27,000 casualties compared to the Finnish mere 2,700. However, as the weather warmed in March 1940, the Finnish line was breached and facing the far larger Soviet forces, was forced to sue for peace on March 12. \n\n=== German invasion and occupation of Norway: <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> ===\nOn April 9<sup>th</sup>, 1940 Hitler began [[Norwegian campaign order of battle|Operation Weser]] and invaded Norway. With assistance from Norwegian Defense Minister and Nazi sympathizer [[Vidkun Quisling]], the Germans were quickly able to gain a foothold. The Nazi's viewed ethnic \u201cNordic Norwegians\u201d who are Germanic and oftentimes blonde haired and blue eyed to be Aryans just like Germans. Quisling shared their view and proposed the complete eradication of the Saami people who he viewed as ethnically inferior. Despite the urging of Winston Churchill, British support for the Norwegians was appalling slow, an action that is responsible for making him Prime Minister. As a result, the Nazis easily capture the Northern port of [[Narvik]]. Despite a blockade by the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Nav]]<nowiki/>y, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] were able to hide in the mountains by forcing local Saami to serve as guides.\n\nOn April 20<sup>th</sup> 1940, [[King Haakon]] and the Norwegian government fled to London along with most of the allied troops stationed there and formed a government in exile, however Norwegians continued fighting the Nazis through underground resistance. These resistance fighters included many S\u00e1ami who had formerly served as part of the Norwegian Ski Brigade and were instrumental in destroying a secret German Nuclear base in [[Telemark]] in 1944. However, many other Norwegian S\u00e1ami were forced into labor for the SS in mining to mine iron ore and build a railway from Narvik to Finland through [[Finnmark]]. Forced sterilization and deportations were also not uncommon \n\n=== [[Continuation War|Continuation War:]] ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/wwii.htm|title=The Sami and World War II|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler offered Finland assistance in recapturing the lost territory to the Soviets. Finnish Saami were especially receptive to the idea because the much Kola peninsula which Russia had seized was their homeland. However, Finland never formerly joined the Axis powers, remained a democracy, and no Finnish Jews were ever deported during the Holocaust. The Finns with assistance from the SS Nord invaded South Kola on June 1<sup>st</sup>, 1941. Most Finnish Saami served as part of the \u201cLong Distance Patrol\u201d because of their abilities on skis and familiarity with the terrain.\n\nUnfortunately, Finnish Saami, being supplied by forced labor of Norwegian Saami, were forced to fight Russian Saami during this phase of the war. Many Saami fighting for the Soviets attempted to defect to the Finnish side. With Finnish assistance, many Saami villages in the Soviet territory were evacuated to Sweden for the remainder of the war. However, other Saami were not so lucky and along with many other Soviet soldiers and civilians were placed in prison and even concentration camps. This angered the Finnish government who also refused to assist the Wehrmacht in seizing Leningrad. Eventually the tide turned in favor of the Red Army and Soviet troops marched back into Finland and on June 9<sup>th</sup>, 1944, the Red Army got within striking distance of Helsinki. The Finns sued for peace and lost much territory including a large part of Saami.\n\n===[[Lapland War|Lapland War (1944-45)]] ===\nAs a result of Finland's peace deal with the Soviets, German troops were required to leave the country. The withdrawal of the German Wehrmacht from Northern Finland and far north of Norway meant that all houses, roads and infrastructure were destroyed. This meant forced evacuation, destruction, an economic setback and the loss of all visible history. The Germans committed many atrocities against the Norwegians and Norwegian Sa\u00e1mi at this time including raping hundreds of women, many of whom committed suicide because of the trauma. The [[Finnmark]] province, the north-eastern municipalities of [[Troms]] province and all of the northern areas of Finland were but smoking ruins. Eventually Soviet Troops fulling invaded Sampi with the assistance of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|Norweigian Army in Exile]] liberated Finnmark. On April 26th 1945 [[Liberation of Finnmark|Finnmark was finally liberated.]] \n\n==Renewed interest==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nNews in S\u00e1mi on national radio in Norway started in 1946. At about the same time, experiments were being done with bilingual teachings of the alphabet in the first and second grade, to ease the learning process. However, the presence of a S\u00e1mi minority in Norway was largely ignored. Education, communication, industrialization, all contributed to integrating S\u00e1mi communities into Norwegian society at the point of losing identity.\n\nThe conflicts between S\u00e1mi and the Nordic governments continued into the mid 20th century. The proposed construction of the hydro power dam in the 1960s and 1970s contained [[Alta controversy|controversial]] propositions such as putting a village ([[M\u00e1ze]]) and a cemetery under water.\n\nOnly a minor part is today working with reindeer husbandry. There are also minor groups working as fishermen, producing S\u00e1mi arts and serving tourism. Besides having a voting length in the [[S\u00e1mi parliaments]] (with differing levels of authority and autonomy in various countries) or influence in any [[S\u00e1mi language]], the rest are ordinary citizens, adhering to the Scandinavian culture. In Sweden, major parts of [[Norrland]] (and not only [[S\u00e1mi villages]]) are also experiencing major emigration to larger towns.\n\nWith the creation of the [[Republic of Finland]] in the first half of the 20th century, the S\u00e1mi inhabiting this area were no longer under the rule of the Russian Empire, but instead citizens of the newly created state of Finland.  The [[S\u00e1mi Parliament of Finland]] was created in 1973.  One recent issue concerning S\u00e1mi rights in Finland is the foresting of traditional S\u00e1mi land by state-owned Finnish companies.\n\nSince 1992, the S\u00e1mi have had their own national day; the February 6.\n\nIn 1898 and 1907/08 some S\u00e1mi emigrated to [[Alaska]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], respectively, due to requests from the American government. Their mission was to teach reindeer herding to Native Americans.

Kainuu S\u00e1mi belonged to the Eastern S\u00e1mi language group. It died out when the Kainuu S\u00e1mi assimilated and was replaced by [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nThe original inhabitants of Kainuu were S\u00e1mi hunter-fisherers. In the 17th century, the [[Governor General of Finland]] [[Per Brahe the Younger|Per Brahe]] fostered the population growth of Kainuu by giving a ten-year [[tax exemption]] to settlers. It was necessary to populate Kainuu with Finnish farmers because the area was threatened from the east by the Russians.\n\nThere are only 14,600 S\u00e1mi living in Sweden today.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SE | publisher = Ethnologue | title = Languages of Sweden}}.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Already the ancient Romans knew about the Phinnoi, the people that hunted with arrowheads made from bone.

Early in the 17th century the raja [[Bali Narayan]] invoked the aid of the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]] of [[Upper Assam]] against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] invaders; after his defeat and death in 1637 the Ahoms dominated the whole district. About 1785 the Darrang rajas took advantage of the decay of the Ahom kingdom to try and re-establish their independence, but they were defeated by a British expedition in 1792, and in 1826 Darrang, with the rest of Assam, passed under British control.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Darrang |volume=7 |page=837}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 [[Sonitpur district]] was formed from part of Darrang.<ref name='Statoids'>{{cite web | url = http://www.statoids.com/yin.html | title = Districts of India | accessdate = 2011-10-11 | last = Law | first = Gwillim | date = 2011-09-25 | work = Statoids}}</ref> This was repeated on 14 June 2004 with the creation of [[Udalguri district]].<ref name='Statoids'/>\n\n==Geography==\nDarrang district occupies an area of {{convert|1585|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=\"Reference Annual\">{{cite book|title=India 2010: A Reference Annual|last1=Srivastava, Dayawanti et al.

Early in the 17th century the raja [[Bali Narayan]] invoked the aid of the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]] of [[Upper Assam]] against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] invaders; after his defeat and death in 1637 the Ahoms dominated the whole district. About 1785 the Darrang rajas took advantage of the decay of the Ahom kingdom to try and re-establish their independence, but they were defeated by a British expedition in 1792, and in 1826 Darrang, with the rest of Assam, passed under British control.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Darrang |volume=7 |page=837}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 [[Sonitpur district]] was formed from part of Darrang.<ref name='Statoids'>{{cite web | url = http://www.statoids.com/yin.html | title = Districts of India | accessdate = 2011-10-11 | last = Law | first = Gwillim | date = 2011-09-25 | work = Statoids}}</ref> This was repeated on 14 June 2004 with the creation of [[Udalguri district]].<ref name='Statoids'/>\n\n==Geography==\nDarrang district occupies an area of {{convert|1585|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=\"Reference Annual\">{{cite book|title=India 2010: A Reference Annual|last1=Srivastava, Dayawanti et al.

Pachnoi river, Belsiri river and [[Dhansiri River]] border the park and join the Brahmaputra river. During the monsoon season, the park becomes a veritable flood plain with the many streams overlapping each other. These flood plains constitute twelve wetlands in the park, apart from the 26 man made water bodies.<ref name =Ahmed/>\n\nThe park is thus formed of [[alluvial]] [[flood plains]] of the many rivers and is an integral part of the [[Indo-Burma]] [[biodiversity]] hotspot.

It has a fairly flat terrain tending north to south with a gentle slope. The elevation in the park varies from {{Convert|45|m|ft}} to {{Convert|70|m|ft}}. It is bounded on its south and east by islands and spill channels of the river. But the flat alluvial land is seen distinctly as two terraces; the lower terrace is of recent origin on the bank of the Brahmaputra river and the other is the upper terrace to the north, separated by a high bank running through the park. The whole park is encircled by inhabited villages thus subjecting it to biotic pressure. It has fox holes built by the villagers on its west.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate in the park comprises three seasons namely, summer, monsoon, and winter.

The threats were identified as due to [[poaching]], inadequate manpower for patrolling and security, wide river channels, inadequate infrastructure facilities and hardly any community awareness and participation in conservation. Poaching for wild animals became very serious, particularly of the great Indian rhinoceros whose population reduced to 48 vis-\u00e0-vis 97 rhinoceros in 1991. By undertaking anti poaching measures, its number had increased to 68 in 2006-07 but poaching and killing of rhinos are still reported. To check this continued poaching, a \"Coordination Committee\" with top officials of Darrang, Sonitpur and the [[Marigaon district]]s, including officials of the Forest Department of Assam has been set up. Under an initiative by the [[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (WAZA), the Orang National Park was identified for conservation to evolve policies and programmes to protect the Indian rhinos and to assist in the development of the park. [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] [[India]], the Government of Assam and the [[International Rhino Foundation]] (IRF), with support from [[Zoo Basel]], ([[Switzerland]]) and the IRV 2020, have undertaken this operation.<ref name=rhino/><ref name=Oran>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhinos-irf.org/en/art/749/|title=Poachers posing threat to Orang National Park|accessdate=2009-11-09|publisher=International Rhino Foundation|date=2009-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219203656/http://rhinos-irf.org/en/art/749/|archive-date=19 December 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=icri>{{Cite web|url=http://ne.icrindia.org/2009/04/08/rhinos-make-healthy-comeback-at-orang-national-park/ |title=Rhinos make healthy comeback at Orang National Park |accessdate=2009-11-09 |publisher=Northeast Watch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823021525/http://ne.icrindia.org/2009/04/08/rhinos-make-healthy-comeback-at-orang-national-park/ |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}</ref><ref name=conserve>{{Cite web|url=http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/indian-rhino-vision-2020|title=Indian Rhino Vision 2020||accessdate=2016-07-26|publisher=The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA)}}</ref> WWF and [[Government of India]], under the project titled \"Rhino Vision India (RVI)\", have also plans to enhance the number of rhinoceros in the park to 300 by 2020, in addition to increasing the number of tigers.<ref name=Oran/>\n\nSince royal Bengal tigers are also under serious threat in the park, a conservation programme sponsored by WAZA ([[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]) institutions and [[Busch Gardens]] has been launched.

These flood plains constitute twelve wetlands in the park, apart from the 26 man made water bodies.<ref name =Ahmed/>\n\nThe park is thus formed of [[alluvial]] [[flood plains]] of the many rivers and is an integral part of the [[Indo-Burma]] [[biodiversity]] hotspot. The total area of the park has been categorized into: [[Eastern Himalaya]]n Moist [[Deciduous Forest]]-{{Convert|15.85|km2|mi2}}; Eastern [[Seasonal]] [[Swamp]] [[Forest]] - {{Convert|3.28|km2|mi2}}, Eastern Wet [[Alluvial]] [[Grassland]]- {{Convert|8.33|km2|mi2}}, [[Savannah]] [[Grassland]]- {{Convert|18.17|km2|mi2}}, Degraded [[Grassland]]- {{Convert|10.36|km2|mi2}}, [[Water]] body- {{Convert|6.13|km2|mi2}}, Moist Sandy area-{{Convert|2.66|km2|mi2}} and Dry Sandy area -{{Convert|4.02|km2|mi2}}. It has a fairly flat terrain tending north to south with a gentle slope. The elevation in the park varies from {{Convert|45|m|ft}} to {{Convert|70|m|ft}}. It is bounded on its south and east by islands and spill channels of the river. But the flat alluvial land is seen distinctly as two terraces; the lower terrace is of recent origin on the bank of the Brahmaputra river and the other is the upper terrace to the north, separated by a high bank running through the park. The whole park is encircled by inhabited villages thus subjecting it to biotic pressure. It has fox holes built by the villagers on its west.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate in the park comprises three seasons namely, summer, monsoon, and winter. The park is subject to [[subtropical]] [[monsoon]] climate with [[rainfall]] [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurring mostly during the period from May to September. The average annual rainfall is {{Convert|3000|mm}}.<ref name=\"Orang\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturesafariindia.com/wildlife_parks_sanctuary/orang_national_park.html|title=Orang National Park|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125133023/http://www.naturesafariindia.com/wildlife_parks_sanctuary/orang_national_park.html|archivedate=2010-01-25|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref>\n\n[[Temperature]] records indicate that: During [[winter]] months of October to March it varies from {{Convert|5|-|15|C|F}} in the mornings to {{Convert|20|-|25|C|F}} in the afternoons, in April it varies from {{Convert|12|-|25|C|F}} in the morning Celsius to {{Convert|25|-|30|C|F}} in the afternoon; and in [[summer]] months of May and June, the variation is {{Convert|20|-|28|C|F}}in the morning to {{Convert|30|-|32|C|F}} in the afternoon.<ref name=Orang/>\n\nHumidity in the park varies from 66% to 95%.<ref name =Ahmed/>\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Thiere in Indien (Dietrisch, de Bry).jpg|right|thumb|A sketch of [[elephant]], [[rhinoceros]] and [[pygmy hog]] (''Porcula salvania'') (an endangered species of small [[Sus (genus)|wild pig]])]]\n\nOrang park contains significant breeding populations of several mammalian species.

The threats were identified as due to [[poaching]], inadequate manpower for patrolling and security, wide river channels, inadequate infrastructure facilities and hardly any community awareness and participation in conservation. Poaching for wild animals became very serious, particularly of the great Indian rhinoceros whose population reduced to 48 vis-\u00e0-vis 97 rhinoceros in 1991. By undertaking anti poaching measures, its number had increased to 68 in 2006-07 but poaching and killing of rhinos are still reported. To check this continued poaching, a \"Coordination Committee\" with top officials of Darrang, Sonitpur and the [[Marigaon district]]s, including officials of the Forest Department of Assam has been set up. Under an initiative by the [[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (WAZA), the Orang National Park was identified for conservation to evolve policies and programmes to protect the Indian rhinos and to assist in the development of the park. [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] [[India]], the Government of Assam and the [[International Rhino Foundation]] (IRF), with support from [[Zoo Basel]], ([[Switzerland]]) and the IRV 2020, have undertaken this operation.<ref name=rhino/><ref name=Oran>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhinos-irf.org/en/art/749/|title=Poachers posing threat to Orang National Park|accessdate=2009-11-09|publisher=International Rhino Foundation|date=2009-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219203656/http://rhinos-irf.org/en/art/749/|archive-date=19 December 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=icri>{{Cite web|url=http://ne.icrindia.org/2009/04/08/rhinos-make-healthy-comeback-at-orang-national-park/ |title=Rhinos make healthy comeback at Orang National Park |accessdate=2009-11-09 |publisher=Northeast Watch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823021525/http://ne.icrindia.org/2009/04/08/rhinos-make-healthy-comeback-at-orang-national-park/ |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}</ref><ref name=conserve>{{Cite web|url=http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/indian-rhino-vision-2020|title=Indian Rhino Vision 2020||accessdate=2016-07-26|publisher=The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA)}}</ref> WWF and [[Government of India]], under the project titled \"Rhino Vision India (RVI)\", have also plans to enhance the number of rhinoceros in the park to 300 by 2020, in addition to increasing the number of tigers.<ref name=Oran/>\n\nSince royal Bengal tigers are also under serious threat in the park, a conservation programme sponsored by WAZA ([[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]) institutions and [[Busch Gardens]] has been launched.

Under this programme, the project titled \"Ecological Monitoring of Wild Tigers in Orang National Park, Assam, India\" has been launched, in association with AARANYAK, a [[non-governmental organization]] in India. With this funding, [[camera trap]]s and geo-spatial technology are used by local researchers to monitor tiger density in the park.
