He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylanl when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllan also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthose many nigths and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy want me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was at the exclusive care of her mother during a strong and confusing emotional crisis Farrow suggested the child that she had been abused, which ended up leading to Dylan sincerely believed it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

Moses explains that on the afternoon of August 4 he was at home: \"As the \u201cman of the house\u201d that day, I had promised to keep an eye out for any trouble, and I was doing just that. I remember where Woody sat in the TV room, and I can picture where Dylan and Satchel were. Not that everybody stayed glued to the same spot, but I deliberately made sure to note everyone's coming and going. I do remember that Woody would leave the room on occasion, but never with Dylan. He would wander into another room to make a phone call, read the paper, use the bathroom, or step outside to get some air and walk around the large pond on the property.\"<ref name=\"MosesFarrowMay2018\" /> Moses also indicates that the memory that his sister keeps from having suffered abuse while focusing her attention on an electric train set is not possible: \"It\u2019s a precise and compelling narrative, but there\u2019s a major problem: there ''was'' no electric train set in that attic. There was, in fact, no way for kids to play up there, even if we had wanted to. It was an unfinished crawl space, under a steeply-angled gabled roof, with exposed nails and floorboards, billows of fiberglass insulation, filled with mousetraps and droppings and stinking of mothballs, and crammed with trunks full of hand-me-down clothes and my mother\u2019s old wardrobes.

He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylanl when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllan also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthose many nigths and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy want me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was at the exclusive care of her mother during a strong and confusing emotional crisis Farrow suggested the child that she had been abused, which ended up leading to Dylan sincerely believed it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

Many radicals spontaneously [[dimer (chemistry)|dimerize]].  Most organic radicals have short lifetimes.\n\nA notable example of a radical is the [[hydroxyl radical]] (HO\u2022), a molecule that has one unpaired electron on the oxygen atom. Two other examples are [[triplet oxygen]] and [[methylene radical|triplet carbene]] (''':'''{{chem|CH|2}}) which have two unpaired electrons.\n\nRadicals may be generated in a number of ways, but typical methods involve [[redox reaction]]s. [[Ionizing radiation]], heat, electrical discharges, and [[electrolysis]] are known to produce radicals. Radicals are intermediates in many chemical reactions, more so than is apparent from the balanced equations.\n\nRadicals are important in [[combustion]], [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[polymerization]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] chemistry, [[biochemistry]], and many other chemical processes. A large fraction of natural products is generated by radical-generating enzymes.  In living organisms, the radicals [[superoxide]] and [[nitric oxide]] and their reaction products regulate many processes, such as control of vascular tone and thus blood pressure. They also play a key role in the intermediary metabolism of various biological compounds. Such radicals can even be messengers in a process dubbed [[redox signaling]].  A radical may be trapped within a [[Cage effect (chemistry)|solvent cage]] or be otherwise bound.\n\n== Stability and formation==\n<!--[[Single-electron transfer]] and [[Single electron transfer]] redirect here-->\n\n===Stability of organic radicals===\n[[File:VitE.gif|frame|right|The radical derived from ''[[tocopherol|\u03b1-tocopherol]]'']]\nAlthough organic radicals are generally transient, some are quite long-lived. Generally organic radicals are stabilized by any or all of these factors: presence of electron-donating groups, delocalization, and steric protection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar50097a003|title=Persistent carbon-centered radicals|year=1976|last1=Griller|first1=David|first2=Keith U.|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=9|pages=13\u201319|last2=Ingold}}</ref>  The compound [[TEMPO|2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl]] illustrates the combination of all three factors.  It is a commercially available solid that, aside from being magnetic, behaves like a normal organic compound.\n\n====Facile H-atom donors====\nThe stability of many (or most) organic radicals is not indicated by their isolability but is manifested in their ability to function as donors of H<sup>.</sup>.  This property reflects a weakened bond to hydrogen, usually O-H but sometimes N-H or C-H.  This behavior is important because these H<sup>.</sup> donors serve as antioxidants in biology and in commerce.  Illustrative is [[tocopherol|\u03b1-tocopherol]] ([[vitamin E]]). The tocopherol radical itself is insufficiently stable for isolation, but the parent molecule is a highly effective H-atom donor. The C-H bond is weakened in triphenylmethyl (trityl) derivatives.  \n[[image:2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl.svg|thumb|right 220 px|2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl is an example of a robust organic radical.]]\n\n===Stability of inorganic radicals===\nThe inorganic compound [[nitric oxide]] (NO) is a stable radical.  [[Fremy's salt]] (Potassium nitrosodisulfonate, (KSO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO) is a related example.

The homolytic [[Bond dissociation energy|bond dissociation energies]], usually abbreviated as \"\u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0\" are a measure of bond strength. Splitting H<sub>2</sub> into 2H\u2022, for example, requires a \u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0 of +435 k[[Joule per mole|J'''\u00b7'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}]], while splitting Cl<sub>2</sub> into two Cl\u2022 requires a \u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0 of +243 kJ'''\u00b7'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}.  For weak bonds, homolysis can be induced thermally.  Strong bonds require high energy photons or even flames to induce homolysis.\n\n===Diradicals===\n[[Diradical]]s are molecules containing two radical centers. [[Dioxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is the premier example of a stable diradical. [[Singlet oxygen]], the lowest-energy non-radical state of dioxygen, is less stable than the diradical due to [[Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity]]. The relative stability of the oxygen diradical is primarily due to the [[Quantum chemistry|spin-forbidden]] nature of the triplet-singlet transition required for it to grab electrons, i.e., \"'''oxidize\".''' The diradical state of oxygen also results in its paramagnetic character, which is demonstrated by its attraction to an external magnet.<ref>However, [[paramagnetism]] does not necessarily imply radical character.</ref> Diradicals can also occur in [[Transition metal oxo complex|metal-oxo complexes]], lending themselves for studies of [[spin forbidden reactions]] in [[transition metal]] chemistry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Linde|first1=C.|last2=\u00c5kermark|first2=B.|last3=Norrby|first3=P.-O.|last4=Svensson|first4=M.|date=1999|title=Timing is Critical: Effect of Spin Changes on the Diastereoselectivity in Mn(Salen)-Catalyzed Epoxidation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=21|pages=5083\u201384|doi=10.1021/ja9809915}}</ref> [[Carbene]]s in their triplet state can be viewed as diradicals centred on the same atom, while these are usually highly reactive [[persistent carbene]]s are known, with N-heterocyclic carbenes being the most common example.\n\nTriplet [[carbene]]s and [[nitrene]]s are diradicals.  Their chemical properties are distinct from the properties of their singlet analogues.\n\n==Occurrence of radicals==\n===Combustion===\n[[File:Spectrum of blue flame.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of the blue flame from a [[butane]] torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and [[Swan bands]]]]\n{{main|Combustion#Reaction mechanism}}\nA familiar radical reaction is [[combustion]]. The [[oxygen]] molecule is a stable [[diradical]], best represented by \u00b7O-O\u00b7. Because [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the electrons are parallel, this molecule is stable.  While the [[ground state]] of oxygen is this unreactive spin-unpaired ([[Triplet oxygen|triplet]]) diradical, an extremely reactive spin-paired ([[Singlet oxygen|singlet]]) state is available. For combustion to occur, the [[energy barrier]] between these must be overcome. This barrier can be overcome by heat, requiring high temperatures.  The triplet-singlet transition is also \"[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]\".  This presents an additional barrier to the reaction.  It also means molecular oxygen is relatively unreactive at room temperature except in the presence of a catalytic heavy atom such as iron or copper.\n\nCombustion consists of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The [[flammability]] of a given material strongly depends on the concentration of radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to [[combustion]] of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out.  As indicated,  promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability.  For example, because lead itself deactivates radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, [[tetraethyl lead]] was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues ([[engine knocking]]) or premature ignition ([[preignition]]).\n\nWhen a hydrocarbon is burned, a large number of different oxygen radicals are involved. Initially, [[hydroperoxyl|hydroperoxyl radical]] (HOO\u00b7) are formed. These then react further to give [[organic hydroperoxide]]s that break up into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO\u00b7).\n\n===Polymerization===\nMany [[polymerization]] reactions are initiated by radicals. Polymerization involves an initial radical adding to non-radical (usually an alkene) to give new radicals.  This process is the basis of the [[radical chain reaction]]. The art of polymerization entails the method by which the initiating radical is introduced.  For example, [[methyl methacrylate]] (MMA) can be polymerized to produce [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (PMMA - Plexiglas or Perspex) via a repeating series of [[Free-radical addition|radical addition]] steps:  \n:[[image:PMMA-Wachstum.svg|800px|center|thumb|Radical intermediates in the formation of polymethacrylate (plexiglas or perspex).]]\n\nNewer radical polymerization methods are known as [[living polymerization|living radical polymerization]].  Variants include reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]]) and atom transfer radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]]).\n\nBeing a prevalent radical, O<sub>2</sub> reacts with many organic compounds to generate radicals together with the [[hydroperoxide]] radical. [[Drying oil]]s and alkyd paints harden due to radical crosslinking initiated by oxygen from the atmosphere.\n\n===Atmospheric radicals===\n{{See also|Oxygen cycle|Ozone-oxygen cycle}}\nThe most common radical in the lower atmosphere is molecular dioxygen. [[Photodissociation]] of source molecules produces other radicals. In the lower atmosphere, important radical are produced by the photodissociation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] to an oxygen atom and [[nitric oxide]] (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 1}} below), which plays a key role in [[Photochemical smog|smog]] formation\u2014and the photodissociation of ozone to give the excited oxygen atom O(1D) (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 2}} below). The net and return reactions are also shown ({{EquationNote|eq. 1. 3}} and {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 4}}, respectively).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + O2 -> O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 + O2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO + O3 -> NO2 + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 4}}}}\nIn the upper atmosphere, the photodissociation of normally unreactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) by solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] is an important source of radicals (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give the [[chlorine]] radical, Cl\u2022, which catalyzes the conversion of [[ozone]] to O<sub>2</sub>, thus facilitating [[ozone depletion]] ({{EquationNote|eq. 2. 2}}\u2013{{EquationNote|eq. 2. 4}} below).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>CFCS ->[h \\nu] Cl.</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>Cl. + O3 -> ClO. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O3 ->[h \\nu] O + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + ClO. -> Cl. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 4}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>2O3 ->[h \\nu] 3O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 5}}}}\nSuch reactions cause the depletion of the [[ozone layer]], especially since the chlorine radical is free to engage in another reaction chain; consequently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons as [[refrigerant]]s has been restricted.\n\n===In biology===\n{{See also|Dioxygen in biological reactions}}\n[[File:DeoxyadenosylRadical.png|thumb|Structure of the [[deoxyadenosyl radical]], a common biosynthetic intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Broderick, J.B.; Duffus, B.R.; Duschene, K.S.; Shepard, E.M. |title=Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2014|volume=114|issue=8|pages=4229\u2013317|doi= 10.1021/cr4004709|pmid=24476342|pmc=4002137}}</ref>]]\n[[Image:Lignin structure.svg|thumb|400px|An approximate structure of lignin, which constitutes about 30% of plant matter.

Similarly, the process of mito[[hormesis]] suggests that repeated exposure to radicals may extend life span.\n\nBecause radicals are necessary for life, the body has a number of mechanisms to minimize radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the [[enzyme]]s [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione reductase]].

The qualifier \"free\" was then needed to specify the unbound case.  Following recent nomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a [[functional group]] or [[substituent]], and \"radical\" now implies \"free\".  However, the old nomenclature may still appear in some books.\n\nThe term radical was already in use when the now obsolete [[radical theory]] was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase \"radical\" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word \"radix\" meaning \"root\"). Historically, the term ''radical'' in [[radical theory]] was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called [[functional group]]s. For example, [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] was described as consisting of a methyl \"radical\" and a hydroxyl \"radical\". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in [[mass spectrometry]] when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.\n\nIn a modern context the first [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon\u2013containing) radical identified was [[triphenylmethyl radical]], (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C\u2022.  This species was discovered by [[Moses Gomberg]] in 1900. In 1933 [[Morris S. Kharasch]] and [[Frank R. Mayo|Frank Mayo]] proposed that free radicals were responsible for [[anti-Markovnikov addition]] of [[hydrogen bromide]] to [[allyl bromide]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01333a041 | volume=55 | title=The Peroxide Effect in the Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds.

However, in fields including [[spectroscopy]], [[chemical reaction]], and [[astrochemistry]], the definition is slightly different. [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who won the Nobel prize for his research into the electron structure and geometry of radicals, suggested a looser definition of free radicals: \"any transient (chemically unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion)\".<ref>G. Herzberg (1971), \"The spectra and structures of simple free radicals\", {{ISBN|0-486-65821-X}}.</ref> The main point of his suggestion is that there are many chemically unstable molecules that have zero spin, such as C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub> and so on. This definition is more convenient for discussions of transient chemical processes and astrochemistry; therefore researchers in these fields prefer to use this loose definition.<ref>[http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html 28th International Symposium on Free Radicals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014949/http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html |date=2007-07-16 }}.</ref>\n\n==Diagnostics==\nRadicals typically exhibit [[paramagnetism]].

Often these traps are themselves radicals, such as [[TEMPO]].\n\n==Depiction in chemical reactions==\n<!-- \"Mass spectrum analysis\" links here --> \nIn chemical equations, radicals are frequently denoted by a dot placed immediately to the right of the atomic symbol or molecular formula as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Cl}_2 \\; \\xrightarrow{UV} \\; 2 {\\mathrm{Cl} \\cdot} </math>\n\nRadical [[reaction mechanism]]s use single-headed arrows to depict the movement of single electrons:\n\n[[File:Radical.svg|centre|300px]]\n\nThe [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the breaking bond is drawn with a 'fish-hook' arrow to distinguish from the usual movement of two electrons depicted by a standard curly arrow.

[[Chain reaction#Chemical chain reactions|Chain reactions]] involving radicals can usually be divided into three distinct processes.  These are ''initiation'', ''propagation'', and ''termination''.\n*''Initiation'' reactions are those that result in a net increase in the number of radicals. They may involve the formation of radicals from stable species as in Reaction 1 above or they may involve reactions of radicals with stable species to form more radicals.\n*''Propagation'' reactions are those reactions involving radicals in which the total number of radicals remains the same.\n*''Termination'' reactions are those reactions resulting in a net decrease in the number of radicals.

In living organisms, the radicals [[superoxide]] and [[nitric oxide]] and their reaction products regulate many processes, such as control of vascular tone and thus blood pressure. They also play a key role in the intermediary metabolism of various biological compounds. Such radicals can even be messengers in a process dubbed [[redox signaling]].

This property reflects a weakened bond to hydrogen, usually O-H but sometimes N-H or C-H.  This behavior is important because these H<sup>.</sup> donors serve as antioxidants in biology and in commerce.  Illustrative is [[tocopherol|\u03b1-tocopherol]] ([[vitamin E]]).

For weak bonds, homolysis can be induced thermally.  Strong bonds require high energy photons or even flames to induce homolysis.\n\n===Diradicals===\n[[Diradical]]s are molecules containing two radical centers. [[Dioxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is the premier example of a stable diradical. [[Singlet oxygen]], the lowest-energy non-radical state of dioxygen, is less stable than the diradical due to [[Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity]]. The relative stability of the oxygen diradical is primarily due to the [[Quantum chemistry|spin-forbidden]] nature of the triplet-singlet transition required for it to grab electrons, i.e., \"'''oxidize\".''' The diradical state of oxygen also results in its paramagnetic character, which is demonstrated by its attraction to an external magnet.<ref>However, [[paramagnetism]] does not necessarily imply radical character.</ref> Diradicals can also occur in [[Transition metal oxo complex|metal-oxo complexes]], lending themselves for studies of [[spin forbidden reactions]] in [[transition metal]] chemistry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Linde|first1=C.|last2=\u00c5kermark|first2=B.|last3=Norrby|first3=P.-O.|last4=Svensson|first4=M.|date=1999|title=Timing is Critical: Effect of Spin Changes on the Diastereoselectivity in Mn(Salen)-Catalyzed Epoxidation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=21|pages=5083\u201384|doi=10.1021/ja9809915}}</ref> [[Carbene]]s in their triplet state can be viewed as diradicals centred on the same atom, while these are usually highly reactive [[persistent carbene]]s are known, with N-heterocyclic carbenes being the most common example.\n\nTriplet [[carbene]]s and [[nitrene]]s are diradicals.  Their chemical properties are distinct from the properties of their singlet analogues.\n\n==Occurrence of radicals==\n===Combustion===\n[[File:Spectrum of blue flame.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of the blue flame from a [[butane]] torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and [[Swan bands]]]]\n{{main|Combustion#Reaction mechanism}}\nA familiar radical reaction is [[combustion]]. The [[oxygen]] molecule is a stable [[diradical]], best represented by \u00b7O-O\u00b7. Because [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the electrons are parallel, this molecule is stable.  While the [[ground state]] of oxygen is this unreactive spin-unpaired ([[Triplet oxygen|triplet]]) diradical, an extremely reactive spin-paired ([[Singlet oxygen|singlet]]) state is available. For combustion to occur, the [[energy barrier]] between these must be overcome. This barrier can be overcome by heat, requiring high temperatures.  The triplet-singlet transition is also \"[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]\".  This presents an additional barrier to the reaction.  It also means molecular oxygen is relatively unreactive at room temperature except in the presence of a catalytic heavy atom such as iron or copper.\n\nCombustion consists of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The [[flammability]] of a given material strongly depends on the concentration of radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to [[combustion]] of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out.  As indicated,  promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability.  For example, because lead itself deactivates radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, [[tetraethyl lead]] was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues ([[engine knocking]]) or premature ignition ([[preignition]]).\n\nWhen a hydrocarbon is burned, a large number of different oxygen radicals are involved. Initially, [[hydroperoxyl|hydroperoxyl radical]] (HOO\u00b7) are formed. These then react further to give [[organic hydroperoxide]]s that break up into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO\u00b7).\n\n===Polymerization===\nMany [[polymerization]] reactions are initiated by radicals. Polymerization involves an initial radical adding to non-radical (usually an alkene) to give new radicals.  This process is the basis of the [[radical chain reaction]]. The art of polymerization entails the method by which the initiating radical is introduced.  For example, [[methyl methacrylate]] (MMA) can be polymerized to produce [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (PMMA - Plexiglas or Perspex) via a repeating series of [[Free-radical addition|radical addition]] steps:  \n:[[image:PMMA-Wachstum.svg|800px|center|thumb|Radical intermediates in the formation of polymethacrylate (plexiglas or perspex).]]\n\nNewer radical polymerization methods are known as [[living polymerization|living radical polymerization]].  Variants include reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]]) and atom transfer radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]]).  \n\nBeing a prevalent radical, O<sub>2</sub> reacts with many organic compounds to generate radicals together with the [[hydroperoxide]] radical. [[Drying oil]]s and alkyd paints harden due to radical crosslinking initiated by oxygen from the atmosphere.\n\n===Atmospheric radicals===\n{{See also|Oxygen cycle|Ozone-oxygen cycle}}\nThe most common radical in the lower atmosphere is molecular dioxygen. [[Photodissociation]] of source molecules produces other radicals. In the lower atmosphere, important radical are produced by the photodissociation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] to an oxygen atom and [[nitric oxide]] (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 1}} below), which plays a key role in [[Photochemical smog|smog]] formation\u2014and the photodissociation of ozone to give the excited oxygen atom O(1D) (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 2}} below). The net and return reactions are also shown ({{EquationNote|eq. 1. 3}} and {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 4}}, respectively).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + O2 -> O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 + O2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO + O3 -> NO2 + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 4}}}}\nIn the upper atmosphere, the photodissociation of normally unreactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) by solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] is an important source of radicals (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give the [[chlorine]] radical, Cl\u2022, which catalyzes the conversion of [[ozone]] to O<sub>2</sub>, thus facilitating [[ozone depletion]] ({{EquationNote|eq. 2. 2}}\u2013{{EquationNote|eq. 2. 4}} below).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>CFCS ->[h \\nu] Cl.</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>Cl. + O3 -> ClO. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O3 ->[h \\nu] O + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + ClO. -> Cl. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 4}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>2O3 ->[h \\nu] 3O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 5}}}}\nSuch reactions cause the depletion of the [[ozone layer]], especially since the chlorine radical is free to engage in another reaction chain; consequently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons as [[refrigerant]]s has been restricted.\n\n===In biology===\n{{See also|Dioxygen in biological reactions}}\n[[File:DeoxyadenosylRadical.png|thumb|Structure of the [[deoxyadenosyl radical]], a common biosynthetic intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Broderick, J.B.; Duffus, B.R.; Duschene, K.S.; Shepard, E.M. |title=Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2014|volume=114|issue=8|pages=4229\u2013317|doi= 10.1021/cr4004709|pmid=24476342|pmc=4002137}}</ref>]]\n[[Image:Lignin structure.svg|thumb|400px|An approximate structure of lignin, which constitutes about 30% of plant matter.

Similarly, the process of mito[[hormesis]] suggests that repeated exposure to radicals may extend life span.\n\nBecause radicals are necessary for life, the body has a number of mechanisms to minimize radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the [[enzyme]]s [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione reductase]]. In addition, [[antioxidant]]s play a key role in these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] and [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that [[bilirubin]] and [[uric acid]] can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain radicals. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of [[purine]]s. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to [[jaundice]], which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes [[gout]].<ref>An overview of the role of radicals in biology and of the use of electron spin resonance in their detection may be found in {{cite book|author=Rhodes C.J.|title=Toxicology of the Human Environment \u2013 the critical role of free radicals|publisher=Taylor and Francis|place= London|year= 2000|isbn= 978-0-7484-0916-7}}</ref>\n\n===Reactive oxygen species===\n[[Reactive oxygen species]] or ROS are species such as [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hydroxyl radical]], commonly associated with cell damage.

The qualifier \"free\" was then needed to specify the unbound case.  Following recent nomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a [[functional group]] or [[substituent]], and \"radical\" now implies \"free\".  However, the old nomenclature may still appear in some books.\n\nThe term radical was already in use when the now obsolete [[radical theory]] was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase \"radical\" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word \"radix\" meaning \"root\"). Historically, the term ''radical'' in [[radical theory]] was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called [[functional group]]s. For example, [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] was described as consisting of a methyl \"radical\" and a hydroxyl \"radical\". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in [[mass spectrometry]] when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.\n\nIn a modern context the first [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon\u2013containing) radical identified was [[triphenylmethyl radical]], (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C\u2022.  This species was discovered by [[Moses Gomberg]] in 1900. In 1933 [[Morris S. Kharasch]] and [[Frank R. Mayo|Frank Mayo]] proposed that free radicals were responsible for [[anti-Markovnikov addition]] of [[hydrogen bromide]] to [[allyl bromide]].<ref>''The Peroxide Effect in the Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds.

However, in fields including [[spectroscopy]], [[chemical reaction]], and [[astrochemistry]], the definition is slightly different. [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who won the Nobel prize for his research into the electron structure and geometry of radicals, suggested a looser definition of free radicals: \"any transient (chemically unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion)\".<ref>G. Herzberg (1971), \"The spectra and structures of simple free radicals\", {{ISBN|0-486-65821-X}}.</ref> The main point of his suggestion is that there are many chemically unstable molecules that have zero spin, such as C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub> and so on. This definition is more convenient for discussions of transient chemical processes and astrochemistry; therefore researchers in these fields prefer to use this loose definition.<ref>[http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html 28th International Symposium on Free Radicals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014949/http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html |date=2007-07-16 }}.</ref>\n\n==Diagnostics==\nRadicals typically exhibit [[paramagnetism]].

Often these traps are themselves radicals, such as [[TEMPO]].\n\n==Depiction in chemical reactions==\n<!-- \"Mass spectrum analysis\" links here --> \nIn chemical equations, radicals are frequently denoted by a dot placed immediately to the right of the atomic symbol or molecular formula as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Cl}_2 \\; \\xrightarrow{UV} \\; 2 {\\mathrm{Cl} \\cdot} </math>\n\nRadical [[reaction mechanism]]s use single-headed arrows to depict the movement of single electrons:\n\n[[File:Radical.svg|centre|300px]]\n\nThe [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the breaking bond is drawn with a 'fish-hook' arrow to distinguish from the usual movement of two electrons depicted by a standard curly arrow. The second electron of the breaking bond also moves to pair up with the attacking radical electron; this is not explicitly indicated in this case.\n\nRadicals also take part in [[radical addition]] and [[radical substitution]] as [[reactive intermediate]]s. [[Chain reaction#Chemical chain reactions|Chain reactions]] involving radicals can usually be divided into three distinct processes.  These are ''initiation'', ''propagation'', and ''termination''.\n*''Initiation'' reactions are those that result in a net increase in the number of radicals. They may involve the formation of radicals from stable species as in Reaction 1 above or they may involve reactions of radicals with stable species to form more radicals.\n*''Propagation'' reactions are those reactions involving radicals in which the total number of radicals remains the same.\n*''Termination'' reactions are those reactions resulting in a net decrease in the number of radicals. Typically two radicals combine to form a more stable species, for example: 2Cl'''\u00b7'''\u2192 Cl<sub>2</sub>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electron pair]]\n* [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]]\n* [[Hofmann\u2013L\u00f6ffler reaction]]\n;Free radical research\n* [[Free Radical Centre|ARC Centre of Excellence for Free Radical Chemistry and Biotechnology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Free radicals| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Biological processes]]\n[[Category:Biomolecules]]\n[[Category:Chemical bonding]]\n[[Category:Environmental chemistry]]\n[[Category:Senescence]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}

Since debuting in 2008, the podcast is consistently ranked in the Top 10 on [[iTunes]] and is one of the most popular podcasts in the world, being downloaded millions of times each month.<ref name=\"replacing\"/>\n\nThe podcast, released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, educates listeners on a wide variety of topics, often using popular culture as a reference giving the podcast comedic value.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> The podcast is available for free on the [[iTunes Store]]<ref name=\"itunes\"/> and consistently appears in the platform's Top 10.<ref name=\"stars\"/> On January 19, 2013, a television show based on the series aired on Science Channel and ran for one season. On April 1, 2017, replays of podcasts specially selected by the hosts, known as SYSK Selects, began running on Saturdays.\n\n==Josh & Chuck==\nJosh and chuck are the ultimate kings of the universe and own the iluminati.\nClark was a host of the show since the beginning, and before Bryant took over the co-hosting duties Clark was joined by several other editors.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"duo\"/> The chemistry between the two was immediately apparent, and Bryant became a permanent co-host.  Despite his actual knowledge on subject matter, which is researched beforehand, some speculate that Bryant's assertive albeit incorrect statements are meant to be a humorous device. This has not been confirmed by either Clark or Bryant.<ref name=\"featured\"/><ref name=\"way\"/> Bryant started working at HowStuffWorks about a month after Clark.<ref name=\"grows\"/> They had desks catty-corner across from each other and would often pop up to share their research.<ref name=\"liveshow\"/> They became good friends within a week.<ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\n===Josh Clark===\nJosh is the greatest american in history.\n\nIn 2010 Clark lived with his then-girlfriend Umi<!---Note: The correct spelling is Umi, not Yumi.---> (who is six months younger than him<ref name=\"ticks\"/>) in midtown Atlanta;<ref name=\"duo\"/> he proposed on August 13, 2011<ref name=\"team2\"/><ref name=\"propose\"/> and the couple has since married.<ref name=\"josh\"/> \n\nHe is a former smoker,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> drinks a lot of coffee,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> and is an amateur mixologist.<ref name=\"stg\" /> His hero is [[Muhammad Yunus]].<ref name=\"quiz\"/>  His favorite books include ''1491'' and ''1493'' by [[Charles C. Mann]] which he frequently quotes and/or references in the SYSK podcast. Josh is also a fan of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', [[Dollywood]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nHe attended [[Sprayberry High School]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> and studied history and anthropology at the [[University of Georgia]].<ref name=\"josh\"/><ref name=\"clark\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/><ref name=\"bites\"/> As a youth interested in the [[paranormal]], he wanted to study [[parapsychology]] at [[Duke University]].<ref name=\"Nostradamus\"/> Also as a child, he was an avid reader of [[Uncle John's Bathroom Reader]], as mentioned in many podcasts, and he jokingly cites Uncle John's Bathroom Reader as the source of the majority of his knowledge. This admiration was eventually reciprocated when UJBR mentioned SYSK on their website and had one of their employees feature as a guest on SYSK's Barbie doll podcast.<ref name=\"bath\"/>\n\nAfter college he pursued a career in journalism,<ref name=\"featured\"/> working as \"a cub reporter\" in [[Henry County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"planning\"/> and was the founding editor of The Washboard Weekly, an \"edgy tabloid\" in Johnson City, Tennessee.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> It went out of business due to a lack of advertising.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\nBefore joining HowStuffWorks in 2007<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"sugar\"/> he was a self described [[wikt:factotum#Noun|factotum]] who held many jobs.<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> He had a paper route, washed dogs, and held \"jobs that involved shovels.\"<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> Before recording his first episode in 2008, Clark had never listened to a podcast,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and didn't know what one was.<ref name=\"popular\"/>\n\n===Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant===\nCharles Wayne<ref name=\"quiz\"/><ref name=\"norris\"/> Bryant is always introduced on the show as Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant, but fans often refer to him as \"Chuckers.\"<ref name=\"team\"/> Born March 15,<ref name=\"birthday\"/><ref name=\"blood\"/> 1971,<ref name=\"Christmas\"/> Bryant was raised Baptist<ref name=\"haunted\"/> and played church league sports,<ref name=\"dog\"/> although his \"constant struggle with [his] religious upbringing\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/> has been \"well documented over the years.\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/>\n\nBryant grew up in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]] but his family lived in \"rural Mississippi since the dawn of time.\"<ref name=\"march\"/> He attended an elementary school where his father was the principal<ref name=\"hinkley\"/> and graduated from [[Redan High School]].<ref name=\"duo\"/> His mother, Diane,<ref name=\"flu\"/> was also a teacher.<ref name=\"teach\"/> He has a brother named Scott<ref name=\"reverse\"/> who is three years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a sister who is six years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a brother-in-law who is a Marine Corps General.<ref name=\"citizen\"/><ref name=\"things\"/> His uncle, [[Ed Bryant]], is a former Republican member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from Tennessee. Bryant once appeared on the cover of ''[[Guideposts]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"satan\"/>\n\nBryant attended the [[University of Georgia]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> where he studied English.<ref name=\"bites\"/> After college, he took classes in screenwriting at New York University's film school and then moved to Los Angeles for four years.<ref name=\"duo\" /> He has also lived in New Jersey.<ref name=\"stonehenge\"/>\n\nBryant is married to Emilie Sennebogen,<ref name=\"stg\"/> and in 2015 the couple adopted a daughter, Ruby Rose, who shares a birthday with Clark.<ref name=\"ruby\"/><ref name=\"racial\"/>  As a self-described \"crazy animal person,\" he has multiple pets.<ref name=\"guide\" /> He plays the guitar in an \"old man band,\" called \"El Cheapo\".<ref name=\"stg\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> Humorist [[John Hodgman]] is a \"dear friend.\"<ref name=\"Hodgman\"/>\n\nHe is the author of six screenplays,<ref name=\"duo\"/> including one about a Southern Baptist church called \"Sweet, Sweet Spirit,\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> but did not find success in that field.<ref name=\"grows\"/><ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> While in Los Angeles, he was a production assistant on TV commercials, a few indie movies, and music videos, which he says helped with the TV version of ''Stuff You Should Know''.<ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> He was hired at HowStuffWorks after a friend got a job there, and submitted the first act of a screenplay as a writing sample.<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n==Podcast==\n{{main article|List of Stuff You Should Know episodes}}\n\n===History===\nThe podcast was launched on April 17, 2008, with Bryant making his debut on May 13, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> Bryant became the permanent cohost on July 15, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> The podcast, which was named by Clark,<ref name=\"duo\"/> began as an attempt to re-purpose some of the written content on HowStuffWorks.com.<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"QA\"/> Clark had never listened to a podcast before he recorded his first episode in 2008.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> [[Jesse Thorn]] has held the name up as a model of how a podcast should be named saying \"it's like daring the listener ''not'' to listen to it.\"<ref name=\"purpose\"/>\n\nThe podcast has steadily grown in popularity since its introduction and has made appearances at events including [[South by Southwest]] and [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]. On October 26, 2017, ''Stuff You Should Know'' released their 1000th episode. Several episodes have been recorded during live events, including two during their World Tour of Canada in September and October 2014.<ref name=\"Canada\"/> While in Canada they also participated in the Northwest Podcast Festival,<ref name=\"northwest\"/> at SXSW in 2011 and 2012,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> and New York Comic Con in 2012 where they recorded their discussion entitled \"Time Travel: Science Fact or Science Fiction?\"<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"invades\"/>\n\nDuring the 4th of July weekend in 2011 there was a Stuff You Should Know About America [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] on Sirius XM radio.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> It featured previous episodes, as well as a live segment with [[Wyatt Cenac]] and [[Hallie Haglund]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as well as [[Joe Randazzo]], [[Joe Garden]] and [[Jill Morris]] of ''[[The Onion]]''.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> Their [[420 (cannabis culture)|420th]] episode was on [[medical marijuana]], although this was reportedly a coincidence.<ref name=\"mars\"/>\n\nIn 2011 the podcast added \"Bonus Videos\" to the podcast feed. These consist of humorous 60 second videos where Clark and Bryant converse about subjects they covered on previous podcasts while doing a variety of random activities (playing checkers, getting fitted for a suit, going to a doctor, driving through a car wash). As they speak, the scene changes repeatedly to something completely different, though their conversation continues uninterrupted as though nothing had happened. These clips have also aired during [[Television advertisement|commercial]] slots on [[Science Channel|Science]] and appear on their YouTube channel.\n\nThere is one unaired episode on [[animal detectives]] that they hope will never be published.<ref name=\"popular\"/> They have twice repeated a topic. They revisited the topic of [[Murphy's Law]] in 2011 after first doing it in 2008. As one of their first episodes, it was under 6 minutes in length. They also accidentally repeated a podcast on customs.<ref name=\"customs\"/> The first time was in 2010 and the second was in 2016.<ref name=\"customs\"/>\n\n===Format===\nThe podcast has been described as the \"heart and soul of the operation,\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and the \"well researched\" episodes cover a variety topics from the fields of \"science, history, urban legends, and pop culture, with the occasional conspiracy theory thrown in for good measure.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark and Bryant have a conversation about the given topic such that, by the end, listeners have a \"basic working knowledge of that subject.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark has said they are on a \"never ending quest to explain absolutely everything there is on planet earth and beyond.\"<ref name=\"circus\"/>\n\nTheir \"biggest hits\" include episodes on [[Spam (food)|Spam]], hangovers, tipping in restaurants, cheese, Barbie, and pinball.<ref name=\"toronto\"/> The topics that get the greatest response from listeners include death and grieving,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and episodes that received \"less enthusiastic feedback\" include shows on homelessness/addiction, Tourette's Syndrome, and transgender issues.<ref name=\"way\"/> It was the second podcast on HowStuffWorks.<ref name=\"duo\"/> Episodes are normally around 45 minutes in length, although for more in-depth topics the show occasionally runs long as an hour or more. Initial episodes were much shorter in duration, often less than 10 minutes.\n\nOne of the reasons the hosts believe the show has been so successful is that they are \"definitely not experts\" in the myriad subjects they explore, but are instead \"just guys who enjoy research and [are] very curious.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> Their formula \"is part self-deprecating humour, part infectious wonder and part self-discipline to go their separate ways and do all their own research and reflection before they get to the studio.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> They often try to surprise one another with their research,<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> and do not have a script or a time limit before they sit down to record.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/>\n\nMost episodes end with listener mail, although there is an occasional segment known as \"Administrative Details.\" Listener mail debuted on November 25, 2008, in the episode named \"How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked\".<ref name=\"albert\"/> On that episode, they called it \"Correction Time.\" The first time it was known as \"Listener Mail\" was on January 8, 2009, an episode that was inspired by a listener's email.<ref name=\"armor\"/> During the Listener Mail portion of the podcast on April 11, 2013, a new jingle for the show was introduced.<ref name=\"brains\"/> It was written and recorded by Rusty Matyas of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada, a musician and fan.<ref name=\"brains\"/> [http://www.jonbiegen.com Jon Biegen], another fan who covered Matyas' band, The Sheepdogs, has produced several new jingles for the show.<ref name=\"movies\"/>\n\nThe ''Stuff You Should Know'' staff includes Rebecca, the web producer, Matt and Noel, the occasional guest producers, as well as Sherry and Joe.<ref name=\"placebo\"/> Their studio is slightly larger than a broom closet.<ref name=\"replacing\"/>\n\n==YouTube==\n''Stuff You Should Know'' also has a YouTube channel, but stopped updating it regularly in 2017. Animated shorts are released on Mondays, This Day in History videos are released on Tuesdays, and Clark's series Don't Be Dumb airs a new episode on Thursdays.<ref name=\"welcometext\"/> In addition, the pair also offers live shorts and movie reviews.<ref name=\"welcome\"/>\n\nIn \"Don't Be Dumb,\" Clark explains a topic while wearing a tweed jacket and bow tie. His posture, gestures, and stilted language are intentionally uncomfortable and awkward. Each episode ends with Clark saying: \"So, next time someone tells you [subject of video], you set them straight! And tell them Josh sent you.\"\n\nInternet Roundup is a new video segment filmed in the studio. Chuck and Josh highlight a couple of posts found deep in the web that they find interesting, entreating or amusing. In 2009, Clark and Bryant began a \"short lived\" webscast.<ref name=\"zero\" /><ref name=\"webcast\"/>\n\n==TV show==\nA full-length ''Stuff You Should Know'' TV show premiered on January 19, 2013 on the [[Science Channel]], which was owned by [[Discovery Network]], the then-parent company of HowStuffWorks. The show included a pilot and 10 episodes each 30 minutes in length.<ref name=\"stars\"/><ref name=\"pilot\"/> The series was produced by production company School of Humans.\n\nDescribed as the \"love child of the British version of [[The Office (UK TV series)|''The Office'']] and an overheard conversation about science between two reasonably informed guys,\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> the show was about a real podcast that is set in a fictional world. Each episode followed Josh and Chuck inside and outside the recording booth, combining the factual information of their podcast with humorous, fictional story lines that align with each podcast topic.<ref name=\"tvshow\"/>\n\nThe show had \"the attention span of a teenaged boy\" and \"bounces from scene to scene without explanation or sense.\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> Focus groups at the 2012 South by Southwest screened episodes and provided feedback for the development of the show, and its pacing in particular.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nThe lead actress on the show was [[Caitlin Bitzegaio]] of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].<ref name=\"popular\" /> The shows were directed by L.C. Crowley<ref name=\"cast\"/> with a theme song and score composed by The Henry Clay People,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> the \"unofficial house band\" of Stuff You Should Know.<ref name=\"ticks\"/> Guests on the show included [[John Hodgman]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Michio Kaku]].<ref name=\"abouttv\"/>\n\nThe show was canceled after the first season \"due to poor ratings\",<ref name=\"ratings\"/> although each episode is made available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Google Play]]. It was the most expensive pilot episode ever produced by the Discovery Channel.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\n==Outside activities==\nAs with the other podcasts offered by HowStuffWorks, Stuff You Should Know has its own [[blog]] updated daily by its hosts and often featuring the same type of material found in the podcasts, often with show followups. There is also both a Twitter account and Facebook page for SYSK. Clark and Bryant were the co-hosts for the Science of Cyborgs event hosted by the [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]].<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n===Microlending===\nStarting in 2009, after doing an episode on how [[microlending]] works, the show began encouraging listeners to make loans on the online microlending site [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]].<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> A Stuff You Should Know team had raised $150,000 by the middle of 2010,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and more than $2.75 million by November 2014.<ref name=\"kiva\"/> In 2009 they challenged [[Stephen Colbert]] to see whose team could raise $100,000 first<ref name=\"colbert\"/> and they \"beat the pants off of\" him, reaching that goal in three months.<ref name=\"microlend\"/>\n\nThe lending team is now run by fan volunteers,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> has since consistently ranked among the top five teams in terms of both donations and users. {{As of|2014|11}} the team ranked #7 for new users among new Kiva users, and in the \"Friends\" category of teams, ranked #2 for new users and amount loaned.<ref name=\"kiva\"/>\n\n===Books===\nClark and Bryant also present two longer and more in-depth audio programs featuring interviews and portions recorded [[Location shooting|on location]] available for purchase as [[audiobook]]s, which are entitled ''The Super Stuffed Guide to the Economy'' and ''The Super Stuffed Guide to Happiness''.\n\nThey are also working on a ''Stuff You Should Know'' book, which they hope to have published \"before the end of the decade.\"<ref name=\"stg\"/>\n\n===Cooperative for Education===\nIn February 2010,<ref name=\"CoEd\"/> Clark, Bryant, and Rowland traveled to Guatemala to promote [[Cooperative for Education]], an organization which gives textbooks to schools in Guatemala to be rented by students for a small fee that is then deposited into an account that will be used to replace old textbooks in the future.<ref name=\"bites\"/> They produced a pair of podcasts on the topic.<ref name=\"CoEd\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe show is downloaded more than 1 million times per week and is consistently on the iTunes Top 10 podcast rankings,<ref name=\"stars\"/> peaking at #1.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> It is \"one of the most downloaded podcasts on the planet.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> The show won the 2014 People's Voice [[Webby Award]] in the Mobile \u2013 Podcast division.<ref name=\"webby\"/> and a place in [[Podcast Awards]]'s Education category.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> At live events the demographics of the audiences are \"all over the map. There are some geeks here and there, but also super cool people, and families and kids, and old people.\"<ref name=\"age\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' chose the TV show in early February 2013 as #7 for their \"The Must List: The Top 10 Things We Love This Week,\" writing, \"Whether you're curious about [[Beehive|bee colonies]] or [[Weather modification|weather control]], Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant have the scoop.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> The podcast has been said to cover \"a truly staggering range of topics.\"<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nClark and Bryant have been described as \"hosts so lovely you may just fall in love with them,\"<ref name=\"cosmo\"/> and provide the show with \"an everyman, conversational feel to the show \u2014 two pals sitting back and picking apart one topic after another.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> Several couples have been brought together because of their mutual fondness for the podcast, and one even had a ''Stuff You Should Know''-themed wedding.<ref name=\"grows\"/>\n\nThey receive over 350 pieces of fan mail a week.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"featured\"/> After two months, their Facebook page had over 10,000 likes,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and as of September 2015 it had more than 750,000. One reviewer said of it: \"It is never not fun to listen to.\"<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\n''Stuff You Should Know''{{'}}s \"beautifully, beautifully done\" production has set \"the audio standard,\" according to podcast reviewers [[Pod on Pod]]. They added that the audio quality \"could not be improved\" on the NPR-level production.<ref name=\"pod\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"abouttv\">{{cite web | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/about/about-the-tv-show/ | title = About the TV Show | accessdate = December 23, 2014 | publisher = Stuff You Should Know}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"age\">{{cite AV media | url = http://earlystart.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/05/stuff-you-should-know-podcast-hosts-the-age-of-being-dumb-is-over/ | title = 'Stuff You Should Know' podcast hosts: The age of being dumb...is over | medium = video | date = February 5, 2015 | accessdate = February 20, 2015 | publisher = CNN}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite AV media | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-albert-einsteins-brain-worked | title = How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked | website = Stuff You Should Know | host = Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant | date = November 25, 2008 | accessdate = September 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"armor\">{{cite podcast | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-body-armor-works-a-special-request/ | title = How Body Armor Works | website = Stuff You Should Know | host = Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant | date = January 8, 2009 | accessdate = January 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"bath\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bathroomreader.com/2012/12/stuff-you-should-know/ | title = Stuff You Should Know | date = December 24, 2012 | publisher = Uncle John's Bathroom Reader | accessdate = September 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/StuffYouShouldKnow/photos/a.116136575072083.15004.114186148600459/962443020441430/?type=1&theater | date = March 15, 2015 | accessdate = March 15, 2015 | title = Hey everybody, it's Chuck's birthday!

video series published by [[Stuff Media]] and hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant, both writers at [[HowStuffWorks]]. Since debuting in 2008, the podcast is consistently ranked in the Top 10 on [[iTunes]] and is one of the most popular podcasts in the world, being downloaded millions of times each month.<ref name=\"replacing\"/>\n\nThe podcast, released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, educates listeners on a wide variety of topics, often using popular culture as a reference giving the podcast comedic value.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> The podcast is available for free on the [[iTunes Store]]<ref name=\"itunes\"/> and consistently appears in the platform's Top 10.<ref name=\"stars\"/> On January 19, 2013, a television show based on the series aired on Science Channel and ran for one season. On April 1, 2017, replays of podcasts specially selected by the hosts, known as SYSK Selects, began running on Saturdays.\n\n==Josh & Chuck==\nJosh and chuck are the ultimate kings of the universe and own the iluminati.\nClark was a host of the show since the beginning, and before Bryant took over the co-hosting duties Clark was joined by several other editors.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"duo\"/> The chemistry between the two was immediately apparent, and Bryant became a permanent co-host.  Despite his actual knowledge on subject matter, which is researched beforehand, some speculate that Bryant's assertive albeit incorrect statements are meant to be a humorous device. This has not been confirmed by either Clark or Bryant.<ref name=\"featured\"/><ref name=\"way\"/> Bryant started working at HowStuffWorks about a month after Clark.<ref name=\"grows\"/> They had desks catty-corner across from each other and would often pop up to share their research.<ref name=\"liveshow\"/> They became good friends within a week.<ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\n===Josh Clark===\nJosh Malcolm<ref name=\"norris\" /> Clark was born July 15, 1976.<ref name=\"mobs\"/><ref name=\"space\"/><ref name=\"Christmas\" /><!---In the \"Space\" reference, he says July 20, 1969 was 5 years and 360 days before his birthday, which puts his birth date in 1975.  In the \"Christmas\" reference he says he was born in 1976.  In the \"mobs\" reference he gives his birthday as July 15.  This date assumes that he did the math wrong in the \"space\" episode and combines the day in \"mobs\" with the year in \"Christmas\".---> He grew up in [[Toledo, Ohio]]<ref name=\"duo\" /> and was raised Catholic<ref name=\"xmas\"/>, attending a Catholic school.<ref name=\"haunted\"/> He moved to Marietta, Georgia as a teenager.<ref name=\"duo\"/> Clark's father's name is Mal,<ref name=\"born\"/> an HVAC engineer.<ref name=\"geothermal\"/> He had a sister named Karen, who died in 1992 in a car accident when Josh was 16 years old,<ref name=\"cake\"/><ref name=\"born\"/> and two brothers-in-law,<ref name=\"moonshine\"/> one of whom is also named Josh.<ref name=\"drought\"/>\n\nIn 2010 Clark lived with his then-girlfriend Umi<!---Note: The correct spelling is Umi, not Yumi.---> (who is six months younger than him<ref name=\"ticks\"/>) in midtown Atlanta;<ref name=\"duo\"/> he proposed on August 13, 2011<ref name=\"team2\"/><ref name=\"propose\"/> and the couple has since married.<ref name=\"josh\"/> \n\nHe is a former smoker,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> drinks a lot of coffee,<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> and is an amateur mixologist.<ref name=\"stg\" /> His hero is [[Muhammad Yunus]].<ref name=\"quiz\"/>  His favorite books include ''1491'' and ''1493'' by [[Charles C. Mann]] which he frequently quotes and/or references in the SYSK podcast. Josh is also a fan of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', [[Dollywood]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nHe attended [[Sprayberry High School]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> and studied history and anthropology at the [[University of Georgia]].<ref name=\"josh\"/><ref name=\"clark\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/><ref name=\"bites\"/> As a youth interested in the [[paranormal]], he wanted to study [[parapsychology]] at [[Duke University]].<ref name=\"Nostradamus\"/> Also as a child, he was an avid reader of [[Uncle John's Bathroom Reader]], as mentioned in many podcasts, and he jokingly cites Uncle John's Bathroom Reader as the source of the majority of his knowledge. This admiration was eventually reciprocated when UJBR mentioned SYSK on their website and had one of their employees feature as a guest on SYSK's Barbie doll podcast.<ref name=\"bath\"/>\n\nAfter college he pursued a career in journalism,<ref name=\"featured\"/> working as \"a cub reporter\" in [[Henry County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"planning\"/> and was the founding editor of The Washboard Weekly, an \"edgy tabloid\" in Johnson City, Tennessee.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> It went out of business due to a lack of advertising.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"grows\"/> \n\nBefore joining HowStuffWorks in 2007<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"sugar\"/> he was a self described [[wikt:factotum#Noun|factotum]] who held many jobs.<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> He had a paper route, washed dogs, and held \"jobs that involved shovels.\"<ref name=\"interviewjosh\"/> Before recording his first episode in 2008, Clark had never listened to a podcast,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and didn't know what one was.<ref name=\"popular\"/>\n\n===Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant===\nCharles Wayne<ref name=\"quiz\"/><ref name=\"norris\"/> Bryant is always introduced on the show as Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant, but fans often refer to him as \"Chuckers.\"<ref name=\"team\"/> Born March 15,<ref name=\"birthday\"/><ref name=\"blood\"/> 1971,<ref name=\"Christmas\"/> Bryant was raised Baptist<ref name=\"haunted\"/> and played church league sports,<ref name=\"dog\"/> although his \"constant struggle with [his] religious upbringing\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/> has been \"well documented over the years.\"<ref name=\"gypies\"/>\n\nBryant grew up in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]] but his family lived in \"rural Mississippi since the dawn of time.\"<ref name=\"march\"/> He attended an elementary school where his father was the principal<ref name=\"hinkley\"/> and graduated from [[Redan High School]].<ref name=\"duo\"/> His mother, Diane,<ref name=\"flu\"/> was also a teacher.<ref name=\"teach\"/> He has a brother named Scott<ref name=\"reverse\"/> who is three years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a sister who is six years older,<ref name=\"jv\"/> and a brother-in-law who is a Marine Corps General.<ref name=\"citizen\"/><ref name=\"things\"/> His uncle, [[Ed Bryant]], is a former Republican member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from Tennessee. Bryant once appeared on the cover of ''[[Guideposts]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"satan\"/>\n\nBryant attended the [[University of Georgia]]<ref name=\"duo\"/> where he studied English.<ref name=\"bites\"/> After college, he took classes in screenwriting at New York University's film school and then moved to Los Angeles for four years.<ref name=\"duo\" /> He has also lived in New Jersey.<ref name=\"stonehenge\"/>\n\nBryant is married to Emilie Sennebogen,<ref name=\"stg\"/> and in 2015 the couple adopted a daughter, Ruby Rose, who shares a birthday with Clark.<ref name=\"ruby\"/><ref name=\"racial\"/>  As a self-described \"crazy animal person,\" he has multiple pets.<ref name=\"guide\" /> He plays the guitar in an \"old man band,\" called \"El Cheapo\".<ref name=\"stg\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> Humorist [[John Hodgman]] is a \"dear friend.\"<ref name=\"Hodgman\"/>\n\nHe is the author of six screenplays,<ref name=\"duo\"/> including one about a Southern Baptist church called \"Sweet, Sweet Spirit,\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> but did not find success in that field.<ref name=\"grows\"/><ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> While in Los Angeles, he was a production assistant on TV commercials, a few indie movies, and music videos, which he says helped with the TV version of ''Stuff You Should Know''.<ref name=\"drink\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> He was hired at HowStuffWorks after a friend got a job there, and submitted the first act of a screenplay as a writing sample.<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n==Podcast==\n{{main article|List of Stuff You Should Know episodes}}\n\n===History===\nThe podcast was launched on April 17, 2008, with Bryant making his debut on May 13, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> Bryant became the permanent cohost on July 15, 2008.<ref name=\"grows\"/> The podcast, which was named by Clark,<ref name=\"duo\"/> began as an attempt to re-purpose some of the written content on HowStuffWorks.com.<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"QA\"/> Clark had never listened to a podcast before he recorded his first episode in 2008.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/> [[Jesse Thorn]] has held the name up as a model of how a podcast should be named saying \"it's like daring the listener ''not'' to listen to it.\"<ref name=\"purpose\"/>\n\nThe podcast has steadily grown in popularity since its introduction and has made appearances at events including [[South by Southwest]] and [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]. On October 26, 2017, ''Stuff You Should Know'' released their 1000th episode. Several episodes have been recorded during live events, including two during their World Tour of Canada in September and October 2014.<ref name=\"Canada\"/> While in Canada they also participated in the Northwest Podcast Festival,<ref name=\"northwest\"/> at SXSW in 2011 and 2012,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> and New York Comic Con in 2012 where they recorded their discussion entitled \"Time Travel: Science Fact or Science Fiction?\"<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"invades\"/>\n\nDuring the 4th of July weekend in 2011 there was a Stuff You Should Know About America [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] on Sirius XM radio.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> It featured previous episodes, as well as a live segment with [[Wyatt Cenac]] and [[Hallie Haglund]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as well as [[Joe Randazzo]], [[Joe Garden]] and [[Jill Morris]] of ''[[The Onion]]''.<ref name=\"sirius\"/> Their [[420 (cannabis culture)|420th]] episode was on [[medical marijuana]], although this was reportedly a coincidence.<ref name=\"mars\"/>\n\nIn 2011 the podcast added \"Bonus Videos\" to the podcast feed. These consist of humorous 60 second videos where Clark and Bryant converse about subjects they covered on previous podcasts while doing a variety of random activities (playing checkers, getting fitted for a suit, going to a doctor, driving through a car wash). As they speak, the scene changes repeatedly to something completely different, though their conversation continues uninterrupted as though nothing had happened. These clips have also aired during [[Television advertisement|commercial]] slots on [[Science Channel|Science]] and appear on their YouTube channel.\n\nThere is one unaired episode on [[animal detectives]] that they hope will never be published.<ref name=\"popular\"/> They have twice repeated a topic. They revisited the topic of [[Murphy's Law]] in 2011 after first doing it in 2008. As one of their first episodes, it was under 6 minutes in length. They also accidentally repeated a podcast on customs.<ref name=\"customs\"/> The first time was in 2010 and the second was in 2016.<ref name=\"customs\"/>\n\n===Format===\nThe podcast has been described as the \"heart and soul of the operation,\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and the \"well researched\" episodes cover a variety topics from the fields of \"science, history, urban legends, and pop culture, with the occasional conspiracy theory thrown in for good measure.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark and Bryant have a conversation about the given topic such that, by the end, listeners have a \"basic working knowledge of that subject.\"<ref name=\"way\"/> Clark has said they are on a \"never ending quest to explain absolutely everything there is on planet earth and beyond.\"<ref name=\"circus\"/>\n\nTheir \"biggest hits\" include episodes on [[Spam (food)|Spam]], hangovers, tipping in restaurants, cheese, Barbie, and pinball.<ref name=\"toronto\"/> The topics that get the greatest response from listeners include death and grieving,<ref name=\"toronto\"/> and episodes that received \"less enthusiastic feedback\" include shows on homelessness/addiction, Tourette's Syndrome, and transgender issues.<ref name=\"way\"/> It was the second podcast on HowStuffWorks.<ref name=\"duo\"/> Episodes are normally around 45 minutes in length, although for more in-depth topics the show occasionally runs long as an hour or more. Initial episodes were much shorter in duration, often less than 10 minutes.\n\nOne of the reasons the hosts believe the show has been so successful is that they are \"definitely not experts\" in the myriad subjects they explore, but are instead \"just guys who enjoy research and [are] very curious.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> Their formula \"is part self-deprecating humour, part infectious wonder and part self-discipline to go their separate ways and do all their own research and reflection before they get to the studio.\"<ref name=\"toronto\"/> They often try to surprise one another with their research,<ref name=\"way\"/><ref name=\"popular\"/> and do not have a script or a time limit before they sit down to record.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"toronto\"/>\n\nMost episodes end with listener mail, although there is an occasional segment known as \"Administrative Details.\" Listener mail debuted on November 25, 2008, in the episode named \"How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked\".<ref name=\"albert\"/> On that episode, they called it \"Correction Time.\" The first time it was known as \"Listener Mail\" was on January 8, 2009, an episode that was inspired by a listener's email.<ref name=\"armor\"/> During the Listener Mail portion of the podcast on April 11, 2013, a new jingle for the show was introduced.<ref name=\"brains\"/> It was written and recorded by Rusty Matyas of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada, a musician and fan.<ref name=\"brains\"/> [http://www.jonbiegen.com Jon Biegen], another fan who covered Matyas' band, The Sheepdogs, has produced several new jingles for the show.<ref name=\"movies\"/>\n\nThe ''Stuff You Should Know'' staff includes Rebecca, the web producer, Matt and Noel, the occasional guest producers, as well as Sherry and Joe.<ref name=\"placebo\"/> Their studio is slightly larger than a broom closet.<ref name=\"replacing\"/>\n\n==YouTube==\n''Stuff You Should Know'' also has a YouTube channel, but stopped updating it regularly in 2017. Animated shorts are released on Mondays, This Day in History videos are released on Tuesdays, and Clark's series Don't Be Dumb airs a new episode on Thursdays.<ref name=\"welcometext\"/> In addition, the pair also offers live shorts and movie reviews.<ref name=\"welcome\"/>\n\nIn \"Don't Be Dumb,\" Clark explains a topic while wearing a tweed jacket and bow tie. His posture, gestures, and stilted language are intentionally uncomfortable and awkward. Each episode ends with Clark saying: \"So, next time someone tells you [subject of video], you set them straight! And tell them Josh sent you.\"\n\nInternet Roundup is a new video segment filmed in the studio. Chuck and Josh highlight a couple of posts found deep in the web that they find interesting, entreating or amusing. In 2009, Clark and Bryant began a \"short lived\" webscast.<ref name=\"zero\" /><ref name=\"webcast\"/>\n\n==TV show==\nA full-length ''Stuff You Should Know'' TV show premiered on January 19, 2013 on the [[Science Channel]], which was owned by [[Discovery Network]], the then-parent company of HowStuffWorks. The show included a pilot and 10 episodes each 30 minutes in length.<ref name=\"stars\"/><ref name=\"pilot\"/> The series was produced by production company School of Humans.\n\nDescribed as the \"love child of the British version of [[The Office (UK TV series)|''The Office'']] and an overheard conversation about science between two reasonably informed guys,\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> the show was about a real podcast that is set in a fictional world. Each episode followed Josh and Chuck inside and outside the recording booth, combining the factual information of their podcast with humorous, fictional story lines that align with each podcast topic.<ref name=\"tvshow\"/>\n\nThe show had \"the attention span of a teenaged boy\" and \"bounces from scene to scene without explanation or sense.\"<ref name=\"csi\"/> Focus groups at the 2012 South by Southwest screened episodes and provided feedback for the development of the show, and its pacing in particular.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nThe lead actress on the show was [[Caitlin Bitzegaio]] of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].<ref name=\"popular\" /> The shows were directed by L.C. Crowley<ref name=\"cast\"/> with a theme song and score composed by The Henry Clay People,<ref name=\"sxsw\"/> the \"unofficial house band\" of Stuff You Should Know.<ref name=\"ticks\"/> Guests on the show included [[John Hodgman]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Michio Kaku]].<ref name=\"abouttv\"/>\n\nThe show was canceled after the first season \"due to poor ratings\",<ref name=\"ratings\"/> although each episode is made available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Google Play]]. It was the most expensive pilot episode ever produced by the Discovery Channel.<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\n==Outside activities==\nAs with the other podcasts offered by HowStuffWorks, Stuff You Should Know has its own [[blog]] updated daily by its hosts and often featuring the same type of material found in the podcasts, often with show followups. There is also both a Twitter account and Facebook page for SYSK. Clark and Bryant were the co-hosts for the Science of Cyborgs event hosted by the [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]].<ref name=\"featured\"/>\n\n===Microlending===\nStarting in 2009, after doing an episode on how [[microlending]] works, the show began encouraging listeners to make loans on the online microlending site [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]].<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> A Stuff You Should Know team had raised $150,000 by the middle of 2010,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and more than $2.75 million by November 2014.<ref name=\"kiva\"/> In 2009 they challenged [[Stephen Colbert]] to see whose team could raise $100,000 first<ref name=\"colbert\"/> and they \"beat the pants off of\" him, reaching that goal in three months.<ref name=\"microlend\"/>\n\nThe lending team is now run by fan volunteers,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> has since consistently ranked among the top five teams in terms of both donations and users. {{As of|2014|11}} the team ranked #7 for new users among new Kiva users, and in the \"Friends\" category of teams, ranked #2 for new users and amount loaned.<ref name=\"kiva\"/>\n\n===Books===\nClark and Bryant also present two longer and more in-depth audio programs featuring interviews and portions recorded [[Location shooting|on location]] available for purchase as [[audiobook]]s, which are entitled ''The Super Stuffed Guide to the Economy'' and ''The Super Stuffed Guide to Happiness''.\n\nThey are also working on a ''Stuff You Should Know'' book, which they hope to have published \"before the end of the decade.\"<ref name=\"stg\"/>\n\n===Cooperative for Education===\nIn February 2010,<ref name=\"CoEd\"/> Clark, Bryant, and Rowland traveled to Guatemala to promote [[Cooperative for Education]], an organization which gives textbooks to schools in Guatemala to be rented by students for a small fee that is then deposited into an account that will be used to replace old textbooks in the future.<ref name=\"bites\"/> They produced a pair of podcasts on the topic.<ref name=\"CoEd\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe show is downloaded more than 1 million times per week and is consistently on the iTunes Top 10 podcast rankings,<ref name=\"stars\"/> peaking at #1.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> It is \"one of the most downloaded podcasts on the planet.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> The show won the 2014 People's Voice [[Webby Award]] in the Mobile \u2013 Podcast division.<ref name=\"webby\"/> and a place in [[Podcast Awards]]'s Education category.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> At live events the demographics of the audiences are \"all over the map. There are some geeks here and there, but also super cool people, and families and kids, and old people.\"<ref name=\"age\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' chose the TV show in early February 2013 as #7 for their \"The Must List: The Top 10 Things We Love This Week,\" writing, \"Whether you're curious about [[Beehive|bee colonies]] or [[Weather modification|weather control]], Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant have the scoop.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> The podcast has been said to cover \"a truly staggering range of topics.\"<ref name=\"way\"/>\n\nClark and Bryant have been described as \"hosts so lovely you may just fall in love with them,\"<ref name=\"cosmo\"/> and provide the show with \"an everyman, conversational feel to the show \u2014 two pals sitting back and picking apart one topic after another.\"<ref name=\"grows\"/> Several couples have been brought together because of their mutual fondness for the podcast, and one even had a ''Stuff You Should Know''-themed wedding.<ref name=\"grows\"/>\n\nThey receive over 350 pieces of fan mail a week.<ref name=\"mediashift\"/><ref name=\"featured\"/> After two months, their Facebook page had over 10,000 likes,<ref name=\"mediashift\"/> and as of September 2015 it had more than 750,000. One reviewer said of it: \"It is never not fun to listen to.\"<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\n''Stuff You Should Know''{{'}}s \"beautifully, beautifully done\" production has set \"the audio standard,\" according to podcast reviewers [[Pod on Pod]]. They added that the audio quality \"could not be improved\" on the NPR-level production.<ref name=\"pod\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"abouttv\">{{cite web | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/about/about-the-tv-show/ | title = About the TV Show | accessdate = December 23, 2014 | publisher = Stuff You Should Know}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"age\">{{cite AV media | url = http://earlystart.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/05/stuff-you-should-know-podcast-hosts-the-age-of-being-dumb-is-over/ | title = 'Stuff You Should Know' podcast hosts: The age of being dumb...is over | medium = video | date = February 5, 2015 | accessdate = February 20, 2015 | publisher = CNN}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite AV media | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-albert-einsteins-brain-worked | title = How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked | website = Stuff You Should Know | host = Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant | date = November 25, 2008 | accessdate = September 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"armor\">{{cite podcast | url = http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-body-armor-works-a-special-request/ | title = How Body Armor Works | website = Stuff You Should Know | host = Josh Clark and Charles W. \"Chuck\" Bryant | date = January 8, 2009 | accessdate = January 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"bath\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bathroomreader.com/2012/12/stuff-you-should-know/ | title = Stuff You Should Know | date = December 24, 2012 | publisher = Uncle John's Bathroom Reader | accessdate = September 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/StuffYouShouldKnow/photos/a.116136575072083.15004.114186148600459/962443020441430/?type=1&theater | date = March 15, 2015 | accessdate = March 15, 2015 | title = Hey everybody, it's Chuck's birthday!
