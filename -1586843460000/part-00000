Note that the omega (\u03c9) end of the chain is at carbon 18, and the double bond closest to the omega carbon begins at carbon 15 = 18\u22123.  Hence, ALA is a ''\u03c9\u2212''3 fatty acid with ''\u03c9'' = 18.]]\nThe terms ''\u03c9\u20133 (\"omega\u20133\") fatty acid'' and ''n\u20133 fatty acid'' are derived from organic [[Chemical nomenclature|nomenclature]].<ref name=\"annals2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratnayake WM, Galli C | title = Fat and fatty acid terminology, methods of analysis and fat digestion and metabolism: a background review paper | language = english | journal = Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism | volume = 55 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 8\u201343 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19752534 | doi = 10.1159/000228994 }}</ref>  One way in which an [[unsaturated fatty acid]] is named is determined by the location, in its [[carbon]] chain, of the [[double bond]] which is closest to the [[methyl group|methyl]] end of the molecule.<ref name=\"annals2009\" /> In general terminology, ''n'' (or \u03c9) represents the [[locant]] of the methyl end of the molecule, while the number ''n\u2013x'' (or \u03c9\u2013''x'') refers to the locant of its nearest [[double bond]]. Thus, in omega''\u2013''3 fatty acids in particular, there is a double bond located at the carbon numbered 3, starting from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. This classification scheme is useful since most chemical changes occur at the [[carboxyl group|carboxyl]] end of the molecule, while the methyl group and its nearest double bond are unchanged in most chemical or enzymatic reactions.\n\nIn the expressions ''n\u2013x'' or \u03c9\u2013''x'', the dash is actually meant to be a minus sign, although it is never read as such. Also, the symbol ''n'' (or \u03c9) represents the locant of the methyl end, counted from the [[carboxyl group|carboxyl]] end of the fatty acid carbon chain. For instance, in an omega-3 fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms (see illustration), where the methyl end is at location 18 from the carboxyl end, ''n'' (or \u03c9) represents the number 18, and the notation n\u20133 (or \u03c9\u20133) represents the subtraction 18\u20133 = 15, where 15 is the locant of the double bond which is closest to the methyl end, counted from the carboxyl end of the chain.<ref name=\"annals2009\" />\n\nAlthough ''n'' and \u03c9 (omega) are synonymous, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] recommends that ''n'' be used to identify the highest carbon number of a fatty acid.<ref name=annals2009/> Nevertheless, the more common name &ndash; omega''\u2013''3 fatty acid &ndash; is used in both the [[layperson|lay media]] and scientific literature.\n\n===Example===\nBy example, \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA; illustration) is an 18-carbon chain having three double bonds, the first being located at the third carbon from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. Hence, it is an omega''\u2013''3 fatty acid. Counting from the other end of the chain, that is the [[carboxyl group|carboxyl]] end, the three double bonds are located at carbons 9, 12, and 15. These three locants are typically indicated as \u03949c,12c,15c, or cis\u0394<sup>9</sup>,cis\u0394<sup>12</sup>,cis\u0394<sup>15</sup>, or cis-cis-cis-\u0394<sup>9,12,15</sup>, where ''c'' or ''cis'' means that the double bonds have a [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|''cis'' configuration]].\n\n\u03b1-Linolenic acid is [[polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated]] (containing more than one double bond) and is also described by a [[Fatty acid#Numbering of the carbon atoms in a fatty acid|lipid number, 18:3]], meaning that there are 18 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds.<ref name=\"annals2009\" />\n\n==Health

Note that the omega (\u03c9) end of the chain is at carbon 18, and the double bond closest to the omega carbon begins at carbon 15 = 18\u22123.  Hence, ALA is a ''\u03c9\u2212''3 fatty acid with ''\u03c9'' = 18.]]\nThe terms ''\u03c9\u20133 (\"omega\u20133\") fatty acid'' and ''n\u20133 fatty acid'' are derived from organic [[Chemical nomenclature|nomenclature]].<ref name=\"annals2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratnayake WM, Galli C | title = Fat and fatty acid terminology, methods of analysis and fat digestion and metabolism: a background review paper | language = english | journal = Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism | volume = 55 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = 8\u201343 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19752534 | doi = 10.1159/000228994 }}</ref>  One way in which an [[unsaturated fatty acid]] is named is determined by the location, in its [[carbon]] chain, of the [[double bond]] which is closest to the [[methyl group|methyl]] end of the molecule.<ref name=\"annals2009\" /> In general terminology, ''n'' (or \u03c9) represents the [[locant]] of the methyl end of the molecule, while the number ''n\u2013x'' (or \u03c9\u2013''x'') refers to the locant of its nearest [[double bond]]. Thus, in omega''\u2013''3 fatty acids in particular, there is a double bond located at the carbon numbered 3, starting from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. This classification scheme is useful since most chemical changes occur at the [[carboxyl group|carboxyl]] end of the molecule, while the methyl group and its nearest double bond are unchanged in most chemical or enzymatic reactions.\n\nIn the expressions ''n\u2013x'' or \u03c9\u2013''x'', the dash is actually meant to be a minus sign, although it is never read as such. Also, the symbol ''n'' (or \u03c9) represents the locant of the methyl end, counted from the [[carboxyl group|carboxyl]] end of the fatty acid carbon chain. For instance, in an omega-3 fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms (see illustration), where the methyl end is at location 18 from the carboxyl end, ''n'' (or \u03c9) represents the number 18, and the notation n\u20133 (or \u03c9\u20133) represents the subtraction 18\u20133 = 15, where 15 is the locant of the double bond which is closest to the methyl end, counted from the carboxyl end of the chain.<ref name=\"annals2009\" />\n\nAlthough ''n'' and \u03c9 (omega) are synonymous, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] recommends that ''n'' be used to identify the highest carbon number of a fatty acid.<ref name=annals2009/> Nevertheless, the more common name &ndash; omega''\u2013''3 fatty acid &ndash; is used in both the [[layperson|lay media]] and scientific literature.\n\n===Example===\nBy example, \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA; illustration) is an 18-carbon chain having three double bonds, the first being located at the third carbon from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. Hence, it is an omega''\u2013''3 fatty acid. Counting from the other end of the chain, that is the [[carboxyl group|carboxyl]] end, the three double bonds are located at carbons 9, 12, and 15. These three locants are typically indicated as \u03949c,12c,15c, or cis\u0394<sup>9</sup>,cis\u0394<sup>12</sup>,cis\u0394<sup>15</sup>, or cis-cis-cis-\u0394<sup>9,12,15</sup>, where ''c'' or ''cis'' means that the double bonds have a [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|''cis'' configuration]].\n\n\u03b1-Linolenic acid is [[polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated]] (containing more than one double bond) and is

{"title_page": "Philosophy for Children", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=June 2009}}\n'''Philosophy for Children''', sometimes abbreviated to '''P4C''', is a movement that aims to teach [[reasoning]] and argumentative skills to [[children]]. There are also related methods sometimes called \"''Philosophy for Young People''\" or \"''Philosophy for Kids''\". Often the hope is that this will be a key influential move towards a more democratic form of [[democracy]].<ref>Laurence Splitter and Ann M. Sharp, Teaching for Better Thinking, ACER: Melbourne.</ref> However, there is also a long tradition within [[higher education]] of developing alternative methods for teaching philosophy both in schools and colleges (see ''\"[[philosophy education]]\"'').<ref>See, for example, Philosophy 4 Skool, by Michael Brett, http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/philinschool.htm accessed July 19, 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough the noted [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Jean Piaget]] was of the impression that children were not capable of [[critical thinking]] until age 11 or 12, the experience of many philosophers and teachers with young children gives reason to believe that children benefit from philosophical inquiry even in early primary school. Furthermore, there is [[empirical evidence]] that teaching children [[reasoning]] skills early in life greatly improves other [[cognitive]] and [[academic]] skills and greatly assists learning in general.<ref>k.J. Topping and S. Trickey (2007) \"Collaborative Philosophical Inquiry for School Children\", British Journal of Educational Psychology, Dec 77(4).</ref>\n\nFor philosophy for children in Iran refer to [https://t.me/P4Cteachers \u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0644\u06cc\u067e\u0645\u0646- \u0634\u0627\u0631\u067e  \u0628\u0647 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062a \u062f\u06a9\u062a\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u062a\u0627\u0634]\n==Method==\n\nThe pedagogy of philosophy for children is diverse. However, many practitioners including those working in the tradition of [[Matthew Lipman]] and the [http://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/index.html Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children] emphasize the use of a community of inquiry method which has roots in the work of philosopher [[John Dewey]].<ref>Jennifer Bleazby (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools, Routledge: New York and London.</ref> The term \"inquiry\" is preferred to \"lesson\" because the emphasis is on the group inquiring together into questions with the teacher as a facilitator rather than the authoritative source of information.\n\n===Questions and pictures as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAs a basis for discussing philosophy with children, the questions used (\u201cWhat is friendship?\u201d, \u201cDo animals have feelings?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d) are of crucial importance. The German educational scientist Michael Siegmund recommends asking children a philosophical question along with an inspiring picture. Together, the image and question create an opening for discussing philosophy. Among other things, natural landscapes, pictures of animals and people, certain social situations, or even fantasy pictures can be used. This dual method can be used as early as at daycare for children ages 4 and up, as well as at school or with family.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2019) Philosophy for Children and Teenagers: The best 123 questions: Including many pictures that will encourage the joint thinking process, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n===Stories as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAlong with pictures, stories can also lead to discussions of philosophy with children. A story can thus be an occasion to start a philosophical conversation with children. Adults can ask the children philosophical questions while they are reading aloud as well. Stories, combined with profound questions, can inspire children and promote their creativity and imagination. Adults can either add \u201cphilosophical questions\u201d to \u201cclassic\u201d stories and fairy tales themselves, or use special children's books for discussing philosophy with children. Michael Siegmund recommends stories in which animals are the main characters and child-friendly questions are asked. Possible topics may include poverty and wealth, friendship and family, happiness, freedom, environmental pollution, justice, and more.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2020) Philosophy for Children. Grandpa Carl the Owl and his Grandson Nils the Owl, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n==Notable proponents and their styles in the world==\n\nOne of the salient differences between proponents of philosophy for children is in their choice of stimuli - starting points for discussions. [[Matthew Lipman]], called \"the most influential figure\" in helping young students develop philosophical thinking by Gareth Matthews, is credited with starting the Philosophy for Children movement in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/education/15lipman.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Matthew Lipman, Philosopher and Educator, Dies at 87 | date=2011-01-14}}</ref> After witnessing political upheaval taking place on University campuses nationwide in the 1960s, Lipman realized that philosophical and critical thinking should be encouraged much earlier in the academic setting. He founded the ''Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children''<ref>[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]</ref> at Montclair State University (then Montclair State College) in 1974. Lipman's method involves reading philosophically stimulating narrative to children and encouraging them to come up with philosophical questions in response.  The questions set the agenda for a collaborative inquiry where the teacher acts as both facilitator and co-inquirer. The lessons are dialogue based with students usually sitting in a circle and taking turns at suggesting solutions, expressing opinions, putting forth arguments and counter arguments, providing examples, constructing criteria and building on each other's ideas with the aim of coming to a settlement regarding the initial philosophical questions that stimulated the dialogue.

However, many practitioners including those working in the tradition of [[Matthew Lipman]] and the [http://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/index.html Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children] emphasize the use of a community of inquiry method which has roots in the work of philosopher [[John Dewey]].<ref>Jennifer Bleazby (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools, Routledge: New York and London.</ref> The term \"inquiry\" is preferred to \"lesson\" because the emphasis is on the group inquiring together into questions with the teacher as a facilitator rather than the authoritative source of information.\n\n===Questions and pictures as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAs a basis for discussing philosophy with children, the questions used (\u201cWhat is friendship?\u201d, \u201cDo animals have feelings?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d) are of crucial importance. The German educational scientist Michael Siegmund recommends asking children a philosophical question along with an inspiring picture. Together, the image and question create an opening for discussing philosophy. Among other things, natural landscapes, pictures of animals and people, certain social situations, or even fantasy pictures can be used. This dual method can be used as early as at daycare for children ages 4 and up, as well as at school or with family.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2019) Philosophy for Children and Teenagers: The best 123 questions: Including many pictures that will encourage the joint thinking process, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n===Stories as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAlong with pictures, stories can also lead to discussions of philosophy with children. A story can thus be an occasion to start a philosophical conversation with children. Adults can ask the children philosophical questions while they are reading aloud as well. Stories, combined with profound questions, can inspire children and promote their creativity and imagination. Adults can either add \u201cphilosophical questions\u201d to \u201cclassic\u201d stories and fairy tales themselves, or use special children's books for discussing philosophy with children. Michael Siegmund recommends stories in which animals are the main characters and child-friendly questions are asked. Possible topics may include poverty and wealth, friendship and family, happiness, freedom, environmental pollution, justice, and more.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2020) Philosophy for Children. Grandpa Carl the Owl and his Grandson Nils the Owl, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n==Notable proponents and their styles in the world==\n\nOne of the salient differences between proponents of philosophy for children is in their choice of stimuli - starting points for discussions. [[Matthew Lipman]], called \"the most influential figure\" in helping young students develop philosophical thinking by Gareth Matthews, is credited with starting the Philosophy for Children movement in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/education/15lipman.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Matthew Lipman, Philosopher and Educator, Dies at 87 | date=2011-01-14}}</ref> After witnessing political upheaval taking place on University campuses nationwide in the 1960s, Lipman realized that philosophical and critical thinking should be encouraged much earlier in the academic setting. He founded the ''Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children''<ref>[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]</ref> at Montclair State University (then Montclair State College) in 1974. Lipman's method involves reading philosophically stimulating narrative to children and encouraging them to come up with philosophical questions in response.  The questions set the agenda for a collaborative inquiry where the teacher acts as both facilitator and co-inquirer. The lessons are dialogue based with students usually sitting in a circle and taking turns at suggesting solutions, expressing opinions, putting forth arguments and counter arguments, providing examples, constructing criteria and building on each other's ideas with the aim of coming to a settlement regarding the initial philosophical questions that stimulated the dialogue.

His contribution to evolving the idea of p4c involves young people becoming novice critical theory action researchers and meaningful members of communities of inquiry focused on human flourishing for every person. Another key component of Barry's P4c\u00b2 is the importance of children gaining ontological weight from participation in their communities of inquiry by understanding the meaning of quality in praxis in a transformational way through TQ Theory. The Institute of P4c\u00b2 has recently been developed by Living Leadership Today, LLC Founder Maria Rachelle in Silicon Valley California and resulted in the creation of the online international scholarly journal, the ''International Journal of Transformative Research [http://IJTR.net].\n\n==Programs, competitions, and publications==\nThere are a number of college-level academic philosophy programs in the United States that do outreach to public schools, most notably at the [http://depts.washington.edu/nwcenter/ University of Washington], University of Massachusetts - Boston, [[University of Chicago]],  [[California State University Long Beach]], [[Texas A&M University]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Montclair State University]], [[Michigan State University]], [[University of Hawai`i at Manoa]], [[Notre Dame de Namur University]], [[Creighton University]], and [[Plattsburgh State University Of New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plattsburgh.edu/academics/schools/arts-sciences/philosophy/index.html|title=Philosophy Department {{!}} SUNY Plattsburgh|website=State University of New York (SUNY) College at Plattsburgh|language=en|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref>\n\nAt the University of Washington, the Center for Philosophy for Children educates University of Washington graduate and undergraduate students about how to facilitate philosophy sessions, and then sends them into Seattle classrooms with supervision and mentoring from experienced instructors. This program has introduced philosophy to thousands of public school students, and runs many year-long weekly philosophy sessions in Seattle public school classrooms. The Center has four graduate fellowships in pre-college philosophy and also runs regular workshops and programs for teachers, parents and other adults about how to introduce philosophy to young people.\n\nAt the University of Chicago, students in the college teach in schools on Chicago South Side through the University's [[Civic Knowledge Project]]. The class, known as [[Winning Words]], is an after school program that works with elementary, middle and high school students in Chicago.

Two tropical cyclones formed in the month of December, Cilida and Kenanga. Intense Tropical Cyclone Kenanga crossed into the basin from the [[2018\u201319 Australian region cyclone season|Australian region]], retaining its name assigned by [[TCWC Jakarta]]. Two moderate tropical storms formed in January, Desmond and Eketsang. Five more intense tropical cyclones formed during February and March: Funani, Gelena, Haleh, [[Cyclone Idai|Idai]], and Joaninha. In addition, Savannah crossed into the basin from the Australian basin as an intense tropical cyclone in March.

Consequently, MFR upgraded the system to a tropical cyclone, and the JTWC upgraded Lorna to Category 1 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale for the second time. Around this time, Lorna deviated from its predominantly southwards motion, and assumed a track to the south-southeast.

Lorna strengthened to peak intensity while tracking southwards along the boundary between the two regions, attaining ten-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) by 18:00 UTC on April 28.\n\nBy 29 April, the structure of the cyclone had degraded significantly, primarily due to strong vertical wind shear and resulting dry air intrusion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/francais/activiteope/bulletins/cmrs/CMRSF_201904290600_LORNA.pdf|title=Tropical Cyclone Analysis Bulletin #26 (Lorna)|last=|first=|date=29 April 2019|website=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|language=French|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> As a result, the system was downgraded by the MFR to a severe tropical storm.<ref name=\":3\" /> Very strong vertical wind shear, analysed at 40 knots (75 km/h; 45 mph) at 09:00 UTC on April 29,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/francais/activiteope/bulletins/cmrs/CMRSF_201904291200_EX-LORNA.pdf|title=Tropical Cyclone Analysis Bulletin #27 (Lorna)|last=|first=|date=29 April 2019|website=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|language=French|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> caused Lorna to become devoid of deep convection later that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh2519web.txt|title=Tropical Cyclone Warning #24 (Lorna)|date=29 April 2019|website=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429131720/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh2519web.txt|archive-date=29 April 2019|url-status=|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> Having lost tropical characteristics, the system was downgraded by the MFR at 12:00 UTC to a powerful [[Beaufort scale|storm-force]] [[Post-tropical cyclone|post-tropical depression]].

However, it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] and [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]]. If instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between [[30th meridian east|30\u00b0E]] and [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. Beginning from the 2016\u201317 season, name lists within the South-West Indian Ocean will be rotated on a triennial basis. Storm names are only used once, so any storm name used this year will be removed from rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2021\u201322 season. The unused names are expected to be reused in the list for the 2021\u201322 season.<ref name=\"TCOP-SWIO\">{{cite web|year=2016|title=Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for the South-West Indian Ocean|accessdate=2016-10-05|author=Regional Association I Tropical Cyclone Committee|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/OperationalPlan_TCP-12_WMO-1178_2016_En.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{| width=\"90%\"\n|\n*Alcide\n*Bouchra\n*Cilida\n*Desmond\n*Eketsang\n*Funani\n*Gelena\n*Haleh\n*[[Cyclone Idai|Idai]]\n|\n*Joaninha\n*[[Cyclone Kenneth|Kenneth]]\n*Lorna\n*{{tcname unused|Maipelo}}\n*{{tcname unused|Njazi}}\n*{{tcname unused|Oscar}}\n*{{tcname unused|Pamela}}\n*{{tcname unused|Quentin}}\n*{{tcname unused|Rajab}}\n|\n*{{tcname unused|Savana}}\n*{{tcname unused|Themba}}\n*{{tcname unused|Uyapo}}\n*{{tcname unused|Viviane}}\n*{{tcname unused|Walter}}\n*{{tcname unused|Xangy}}\n*{{tcname unused|Yemurai}}\n*{{tcname unused|Zanele}}\n|}\n\nKenanga entered this basin as a moderate tropical storm from the [[2018\u201319 Australian region cyclone season|Australian region]] on December 16, retaining its name assigned by [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency|TCWC Jakarta]].

It officially began on November 15, 2018, and ended on April 30, 2019, with the exception for [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]], which it ended on May 15, 2019. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of [[longitude|90\u00b0E]] and south of the [[Equator]]. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]] in [[R\u00e9union]]. \n\nThe first tropical cyclone was an unnamed moderate tropical storm that formed northeast of [[Madagascar]] on September 13, 2018, two months before the official start of the season. Two cyclones formed in the month of November, with Intense Tropical Cyclone Alcide forming on November 5, and Severe Tropical Storm Bouchra entering the basin from the Australian region on November 9. Two tropical cyclones formed in the month of December, Cilida and Kenanga. Intense Tropical Cyclone Kenanga crossed into the basin from the [[2018\u201319 Australian region cyclone season|Australian region]], retaining its name assigned by [[TCWC Jakarta]].

Consequently, MFR upgraded the system to a tropical cyclone, and the JTWC upgraded Lorna to Category 1 status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale for the second time. Around this time, Lorna deviated from its predominantly southwards motion, and assumed a track to the south-southeast.

Lorna strengthened to peak intensity while tracking southwards along the boundary between the two regions, attaining ten-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) by 18:00 UTC on April 28.\n\nBy 29 April, the structure of the cyclone had degraded significantly, primarily due to strong vertical wind shear and resulting dry air intrusion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/francais/activiteope/bulletins/cmrs/CMRSF_201904290600_LORNA.pdf|title=Tropical Cyclone Analysis Bulletin #26 (Lorna)|last=|first=|date=29 April 2019|website=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|language=French|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> As a result, the system was downgraded by the MFR to a severe tropical storm.<ref name=\":3\" /> Very strong vertical wind shear, analysed at 40 knots (75 km/h; 45 mph) at 09:00 UTC on April 29,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/francais/activiteope/bulletins/cmrs/CMRSF_201904291200_EX-LORNA.pdf|title=Tropical Cyclone Analysis Bulletin #27 (Lorna)|last=|first=|date=29 April 2019|website=M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France|language=French|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> caused Lorna to become devoid of deep convection later that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh2519web.txt|title=Tropical Cyclone Warning #24 (Lorna)|date=29 April 2019|website=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429131720/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh2519web.txt|archive-date=29 April 2019|url-status=|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> Having lost tropical characteristics, the system was downgraded by the MFR at 12:00 UTC to a powerful [[Beaufort scale|storm-force]] [[Post-tropical cyclone|post-tropical depression]].

However, it is the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar who name the systems. The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius names a storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] and [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]]. If instead a cyclone intensifies into a moderate tropical storm between [[30th meridian east|30\u00b0E]] and [[55th meridian east|55\u00b0E]] then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. Beginning from the 2016\u201317 season, name lists within the South-West Indian Ocean will be rotated on a triennial basis. Storm names are only used once, so any storm name used this year will be removed from rotation and replaced with a new name for the 2021\u201322 season. The unused names are expected to be reused in the list for the 2021\u201322 season.<ref name=\"TCOP-SWIO\">{{cite web|year=2016|title=Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for the South-West Indian Ocean|accessdate=2016-10-05|author=Regional Association I Tropical Cyclone Committee|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/OperationalPlan_TCP-12_WMO-1178_2016_En.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{| width=\"90%\"\n|\n*Alcide\n*Bouchra\n*Cilida\n*Desmond\n*Eketsang\n*Funani\n*Gelena\n*Haleh\n*[[Cyclone Idai|Idai]]\n|\n*Joaninha\n*[[Cyclone Kenneth|Kenneth]]\n*Lorna\n*{{tcname unused|Maipelo}}\n*{{tcname unused|Njazi}}\n*{{tcname unused|Oscar}}\n*{{tcname unused|Pamela}}\n*{{tcname unused|Quentin}}\n*{{tcname unused|Rajab}}\n|\n*{{tcname unused|Savana}}\n*{{tcname unused|Themba}}\n*{{tcname unused|Uyapo}}\n*{{tcname unused|Viviane}}\n*{{tcname unused|Walter}}\n*{{tcname unused|Xangy}}\n*{{tcname unused|Yemurai}}\n*{{tcname unused|Zanele}}\n|}\n\nKenanga entered this basin as a moderate tropical storm from the [[2018\u201319 Australian region cyclone season|Australian region]] on December 16, retaining its name assigned by [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency|TCWC Jakarta]].

The size, shape and width may vary considerably. Banjo and guitar players may wear a metal or plastic thumb pick mounted on a ring, and bluegrass banjo players often wear metal or plastic [[fingerpick]]s on their fingertips. Guitarists also use fingerpicks.\n\nGuitar picks are made of a variety of materials, including [[celluloid]], metal, and rarely other exotic materials such as turtle shell, but today [[delrin]] is the most common {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. For other instruments in the modern day most players use plastic plectra but a variety of other materials, including wood and [[felt]] (for use with the [[ukulele]]) are common. Guitarists in the [[Rock and roll|rock]], [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] genres tend to use a plectrum, partly because the use of steel strings tends to wear out the fingernails quickly, and also because a plectrum provides a more \"focused\" and \"aggressive\" sound. Many guitarists also use the pick and the remaining right-hand fingers simultaneously to combine some advantages of flat-picking and [[finger picking]].  This technique is called ''[[hybrid picking]]''.\n\nA plectrum of the guitar type is often called a pick (or a ''flatpick'' to distinguish it from fingerpicks).\n\n===Non-Western instruments===\nThe plectra for the [[Japan]]ese [[biwa]] and [[shamisen]] can be quite large, and those used for the Arabic [[oud]] are longer and narrower, replacing the formerly used eagle feather.

These plectra are very small, often only about 10 millimeters long, about 1.5 millimeters wide, and half a millimeter thick. The plectrum is gently tapered, being narrowest at the plucking end. The top surface of the plectrum is flat and horizontal and is held in the tongue of the jack, which permits it to pluck moving upward and pass almost silently past the string moving downward.\n\nIn the historical period of harpsichord construction (up to about 1800) plectra were made of sturdy feather quills, usually from [[crow]]s or [[raven]]s. In Italy, some makers (including [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]]) used [[vulture]] quills.<ref>Jensen 1998, 85. Not all bird species suffice; [[Wolfgang Zuckermann]] observed in 1969 that \"quill from birds such as goose or chicken have given this material a bad name, since feathers from these fowl are not satisfactory for the purpose.\" Aside from crow and raven, he mentions [[condor]], eagle and turkey as good sources for plectra. See Wolfgang Zuckermann (1969): ''The Modern Harpsichord'', New York, October House, p. 61.</ref> Other Italian harpsichords employed plectra of [[leather]].<ref name=\"Hubbard 1967\">Hubbard 1967</ref> In late French harpsichords by the great builder [[Pascal Taskin]], ''peau de buffle'', a [[chamois]]-like material from the hide of the [[European bison]], was used for plectra to produce a delicate [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]].<ref name=\"Hubbard 1967\" />\n\nModern harpsichords frequently employ plectra made with plastic, specifically the plastic known as [[Polyoxymethylene|acetal]]. Some plectra are of the [[homopolymer]] variety of acetal, sold by [[DuPont]] under the name \"Delrin\", while others are of the [[copolymer]] variety, sold by [[Ticona]] as \"Celcon\".<ref>For a discussion of these plastics, see [http://www.fortepiano.com/plectra/plectra_002.htm].</ref> Harpsichord technicians and builders generally use the trade names to refer to these materials.

The correct form of voicing, O'Brien suggests, involves tapering, so that a plectrum will display constant curvature at the moment it is maximally displaced in plucking.

In addition, quill plectra are observed to fail gradually, giving warning by the diminishing volume, whereas acetal plectra fail suddenly and completely, sometimes in the middle of a performance.\n\n===Voicing harpsichord plectra===\nThe plectra of a harpsichord must be cut precisely, in a process called \"voicing\". A properly voiced plectrum will pluck the string in a way that produces a good musical tone and matches well in loudness with all of the other strings. The underside of the plectrum must be appropriately slanted and entirely smooth, so that the jack will not \"hang\" (get caught on the string) when, after sounding a note, it is moved back down below the level of the string.\n\nNormally, voicing is carried out by inserting the plectrum into the jack, then placing the jack on a small wooden voicing block, so that the top of the plectrum sits flush with the block. The plectrum is then cut and thinned on the underside with a small, very sharp knife, such as an [[X-Acto|X-Acto knife]].<ref>Kottick (1987)</ref> As the plectrum is progressively trimmed, its jack is replaced in the instrument at intervals to test the result for loudness, tone quality, and the possibility of hanging.\n\nVoicing is a refined skill, carried out fluently by professional builders, but one that usually must also be learned (at least to some degree) by harpsichord owners.<ref>Source for all of this section: Kottick (1987)</ref>\n\n== Etymology and usage ==\n\nFirst attested in English 15th century,<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', online edition (www.oed.com)</ref> the word \"plectrum\" comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''plectrum'', itself derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c0\u03bb\u1fc6\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary''</ref> (''pl\u0113ktron''), \"anything to strike with, an instrument for striking the lyre, a spear point\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383798 \u03c0\u03bb\u1fc6\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref><ref>Greek \"\u03c0\u03bb\u1fc6\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\" comes from the verb \"\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9\" or \"\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9\" (''pl\u0113ss\u014d''), \"to hit, to strike, to smite, to sting\".

Klyosov''' (born 20 November 1946 in [[Chernyakhovsk]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of [[Russian SFSR]])<ref name=mgu/> is a scientist who worked in the fields of physical chemistry, enzyme catalysis, and industrial biochemistry. In 1989 Klyosov immigrated to the US.
