It serves as the project's international [[lead single]] and her debut release with [[Universal Motown]]. It was co-written by American songwriter [[Rico Love]], who described the song as a \"fun and aggressive club record\" with themes of female empowerment and lyrics with deliberate grammatical errors. French disc jockeys and producers [[David Guetta]] and [[Sandy Vee]] produced \"Commander\" with [[synthesizer|synthesized]] [[dance music|dance]] beats that blend [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with [[electronica]] and [[house music]]. Rowland and Guetta had previously topped charts around the world with a similar dance production, \"[[When Love Takes Over]]\", in 2009. The song was premiered at the 2010 ''[[Winter Music Conference]]'' and subsequently garnered acclaim from contemporary critics for Rowland's vocal performance as well as Guetta's musical production.\n\nJust over a month after release, it topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and later peaked within the top-ten in the United Kingdom and top-twenty in Ireland and New Zealand. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named \"Commander\" the number-one summer jam of 2010 and named by [[Fitness Magazine]] as one of The Top 100 Workout Songs of 2010. The song was nominated at the [[International Dance Music Awards]] for Best R&B/Urban Dance Track. An accompanying music video was directed by Masashi Muto, and portrays Rowland facing herself in various [[dance competition|dance-off]] scenes. Promotion for the release included performing the song live on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]] and ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''. The Extended Dance Mix, also produced by Guetta, was released alongside the main single worldwide, whereas the urban remix with American rapper [[Nelly]] was released in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Background and context ==\n[[File:David Guetta One Love Tour M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Guetta during a DJ set on his One Love World Tour]]\nIn 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for \"When Love Takes Over\", the media reported that [[Columbia Records]] and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a233039/kelly-rowland-old-label-dumped-me.html |title=Kelly Rowland \"Old Label Dumped Me\" |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |work=[[Digital Spy]] |last=Copsey |first=Robert |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> However in a 2010 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Rowland stated the decision to leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' did not sell sufficiently well.

The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output \u2013 Kelis'  '[[Acapella (Kelis song)|Acapella]]', for example \u2013 but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic.\"<ref name=\"Copsey\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a217143/another-summer-smash-from-kelly-rowland.html |title=Another summer smash from Kelly Rowland |publisher=Hachette Filipacchi UK |work=Digital Spy |last=Copsey |first=Robert |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-05-10}}</ref> The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song \"thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967.\"<ref name=\"Levine\"/> Robert Daw of ''Idolator'' said \"if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower.

It serves as the project's international [[lead single]] and her debut release with [[Universal Motown]]. It was co-written by American songwriter [[Rico Love]], who described the song as a \"fun and aggressive club record\" with themes of female empowerment and lyrics with deliberate grammatical errors. French disc jockeys and producers [[David Guetta]] and [[Sandy Vee]] produced \"Commander\" with [[synthesizer|synthesized]] [[dance music|dance]] beats that blend [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with [[electronica]] and [[house music]]. Rowland and Guetta had previously topped charts around the world with a similar dance production, \"[[When Love Takes Over]]\", in 2009. The song was premiered at the 2010 ''[[Winter Music Conference]]'' and subsequently garnered acclaim from contemporary critics for Rowland's vocal performance as well as Guetta's musical production.\n\nJust over a month after release, it topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and later peaked within the top-ten in the United Kingdom and top-twenty in Ireland and New Zealand. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named \"Commander\" the number-one summer jam of 2010 and named by [[Fitness Magazine]] as one of The Top 100 Workout Songs of 2010. The song was nominated at the [[International Dance Music Awards]] for Best R&B/Urban Dance Track. An accompanying music video was directed by Masashi Muto, and portrays Rowland facing herself in various [[dance competition|dance-off]] scenes. Promotion for the release included performing the song live on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]] and ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''. The Extended Dance Mix, also produced by Guetta, was released alongside the main single worldwide, whereas the urban remix with American rapper [[Nelly]] was released in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Background and context ==\n[[File:David Guetta One Love Tour M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Guetta during a DJ set on his One Love World Tour]]\nIn 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for \"When Love Takes Over\", the media reported that [[Columbia Records]] and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a233039/kelly-rowland-old-label-dumped-me.html |title=Kelly Rowland \"Old Label Dumped Me\" |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |work=[[Digital Spy]] |last=Copsey |first=Robert |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> However in a 2010 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Rowland stated the decision to leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of \"When Love Takes Over\" she would go on to fire [[Mathew Knowles]].<ref name=\"EW interview\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Kelly Rowland \"My Old Label Dumped Me & Why I Had to Fire Matthew\" |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |issue=1109 |pages=43\u201345}}</ref> It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow [[Destiny's Child]] singer [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]]. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video (\"[[Why Don't You Love Me (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]\") from her album ''[[I Am...

Sybase was acquired by [[SAP AG|SAP]] in 2010; SAP ceased using the Sybase name in 2014.<ref>[http://www.bloorresearch.com/blog/the-norfolk-punt/sap-finally-drops-the-sybase-name/ SAP finally drops the Sybase name]</ref>\n\n==History==\n*1984: Robert Epstein, Mark Hoffman, Jane Doughty, and Tom Haggin found Sybase (initially as ''System ware'') in Epstein\u2019s home in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=History of Sybase|last=Epstein|first=Bob|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=35|issue=2|pages=31\u201341|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2012.52|year=2013}}</ref><ref>[https://www.referenceforbusinesz.com/history2/49/Sybase-Inc.html Sybase, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Sybase, Inc.]</ref><ref>[https://www.kleinerperkins.com/case-studies/sybase/ Managing and analyzing information with relational databases]</ref> Their first commercial location is half of an office suite at 2107 Dwight Way in Berkeley. They set out to create a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) that will organize information and make it available to computers within a network.\n*March 1986: Sybase enters into talks with [[Microsoft]] to license Data Server, a database product built to run on [[UNIX]] computers.  Those talks lead to a product called [[Ashton-Tate]]/[[Microsoft SQL Server]] 1.0, shipping in May 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.microsoft.com/2001/06/28/building-the-billion-dollar-database-microsoft-sql-server-climbs-to-new-heights/ |title=Building the Billion Dollar Database: Microsoft SQL Server Climbs to New Heights |date=2001-06-28 }}</ref>\n*1986: Sybase ships its first test programs.\n*1987: Sybase formally releases the Sybase system, the first high-performance DBMS for online applications{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} providing the [[Human Genome Project]] with licenses for the first generation of client-server relational databases. Rather than having a vast central bank of data stored in a large mainframe computer, the Sybase System provides for a [[Client\u2013server model|client-server computer architecture]]. Base calls the database server \"[[Sybase SQL Server]]\".\n*1988: Sybase, [[Microsoft]], and [[Ashton-Tate]] port the Sybase DBMS to the [[OS/2]] platform. Microsoft markets the new product as [[Microsoft SQL Server|''SQL Server'']]. The terms of the agreement give Microsoft a sole license to products on the Intel x86 platform. Ashton-Tate soon drops out.\n*October 1989: Sybase releases additional products, introducing the Sybase Open Client-Server Interfaces \u2014 new software programs that provide generic client-server communication, allowing for greater connectivity within computer networks. Two phase commit protocols are included as part of Sybase SQL Server 3.0, as are stored procedures and triggers\n*1989: Sybase achieves sales of $56 million.\n* August 1991: Sybase goes public at a split adjusted price of $4.40. Sybase SQL server 4.0, and later 4.8 (the first smp server) and 4.9.1, all outperformed competitors by significant margins in standard benchmarks.\n*1993: Sybase and Microsoft dissolve their partnership. Microsoft receives a copy of the SQL Server code base. In exchange Sybase is free to deploy on the [[x86]] platform which has now become the chip of choice for Unix. Sybase SQL Server version 4.2 and Microsoft SQL Server are identical. Their [[Transact-SQL]] (T-SQL) procedural language is the same, as is the basic process architecture. From this point the products diverge as Microsoft includes more Windows features whilst Sybase adds Enterprise features (performance and scaling).\n*April 1993: Sybase introduces the first component of System 10, called OmniSQL Gateway. This program connects the various parts of a computer network, enabling users to access [[data]] changes made within the network.\n*June 1993: Sybase announces its latest generation of software, named the System 10 product family; this consists of the Database server, Replication Server for keeping replicate data up-to-date in near real time, and Navigation Server which had been developed in partnership with NCR to do shared nothing parallelisation across large numbers of databases. Backup Server is introduced to do high performance parallel backups and restores. SQL Monitor and SA Companion are provided to manage multiple servers.\n*1994 Sybase acquires OASiS Group plc, a British management consulting firm of some 150 staff that implemented organisational change solutions as well as bespoke information systems. The acquisition was intended to position Sybase as a provider of enterprise business solutions but within 4 years the OASiS leadership team and most of its consultants had left.\n*1994: Sybase acquires Powersoft, the leading maker of development tools for client-server computing, with 40 per cent of that market. Through the deal, Sybase acquires [[PowerBuilder]], a [[rapid application development]] (RAD) tool and Powersoft\u2019s leading product. The acquisition also marks Sybase\u2019s entry into the enterprise mobility market with [[Watcom]] SQL, which Sybase renames [[SQL Anywhere]].  When Sybase launches its mobility subsidiary, Sybase iAnywhere, in 2000, SQL Anywhere becomes its flagship relational database management system (RDBMS) and helps the company to become the leader of the mobile database market. Sybase revenues are over $1bn.\n*1994: Sybase acquires Micro Decisionware (MDI), a privately-held middleware company based in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Its first product is PC/SQL-link, a tool that enables PC users to build SQL statements and send them to mainframe databases, with results returned to the PC. MDI's second product, the MDI Database Gateway, provided connectivity for PC-based applications (such as PowerBuilder) to execute SQL queries against mainframe databases.The MDI Database Gateway was in competition with the Sybase middleware solution.{{buzzword inline|date=August 2019}} After the acquisition, some MDI Database Gateway features were integrated into the Sybase solution.{{buzzword inline|date=August 2019}}\n*1995: Sybase\u2019s flagship database product Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) V11.0 released. This was a major performance release giving massive scalability up to 16 processors. (100% for the first 15 and 25% for the 16th in a benchmark run for a UK government contract). This server outperformed all competitors in standard benchmarks.  Sybase launches PowerDesigner, a modeling and metadata management solution{{buzzword inline|date=August 2019}}, following its acquisition of PowerAMC. Sybase share price peaks at $96.\n*1996 Sybase renames the main product SQL Server to its current name Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) for version 11.5.  Anywhere 5 is released. It includes SQL Remote, SQL Central, Transact SQL syntax, and support for the Sybase Replication Server.\n*In 1996, Mitchell Kertzman, Powersoft CEO, was appointed CEO of Sybase. Sybase launched [[Sybase IQ]], the first column-based analytics platform.\n*January 1998: Sybase announced that it had found inconsistencies in profits reporting from its Japanese division, and would restate the financial results for the company for the last three quarters of 1997.<ref>{{cite web |last=Magee|first=Mike |title=Sybase to restate following Japanese accounting scandal |url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1992960/sybase-restate-following-japanese-accounting-scandal|work=V3.co.uk |publisher=Incisive Media |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> Five executives in Sybase's Japanese subsidiary were found to have used [[Side letter (collective bargaining)|side letters]] to artificially inflate the profits from their operations.

They set out to create a [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) that will organize information and make it available to computers within a network.\n*March 1986: Sybase enters into talks with [[Microsoft]] to license Data Server, a database product built to run on [[UNIX]] computers.  Those talks lead to a product called [[Ashton-Tate]]/[[Microsoft SQL Server]] 1.0, shipping in May 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.microsoft.com/2001/06/28/building-the-billion-dollar-database-microsoft-sql-server-climbs-to-new-heights/ |title=Building the Billion Dollar Database: Microsoft SQL Server Climbs to New Heights |date=2001-06-28 }}</ref>\n*1986: Sybase ships its first test programs.\n*1987: Sybase formally releases the Sybase system, the first high-performance DBMS for online applications{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} providing the [[Human Genome Project]] with licenses for the first generation of client-server relational databases. Rather than having a vast central bank of data stored in a large mainframe computer, the Sybase System provides for a [[Client\u2013server model|client-server computer architecture]]. Base calls the database server \"[[Sybase SQL Server]]\".\n*1988: Sybase, [[Microsoft]], and [[Ashton-Tate]] port the Sybase DBMS to the [[OS/2]] platform. Microsoft markets the new product as [[Microsoft SQL Server|''SQL Server'']]. The terms of the agreement give Microsoft a sole license to products on the Intel x86 platform. Ashton-Tate soon drops out.\n*October 1989: Sybase releases additional products, introducing the Sybase Open Client-Server Interfaces \u2014 new software programs that provide generic client-server communication, allowing for greater connectivity within computer networks. Two phase commit protocols are included as part of Sybase SQL Server 3.0, as are stored procedures and triggers\n*1989: Sybase achieves sales of $56 million.\n* August 1991: Sybase goes public at a split adjusted price of $4.40. Sybase SQL server 4.0, and later 4.8 (the first smp server) and 4.9.1, all outperformed competitors by significant margins in standard benchmarks.\n*1993: Sybase and Microsoft dissolve their partnership. Microsoft receives a copy of the SQL Server code base. In exchange Sybase is free to deploy on the [[x86]] platform which has now become the chip of choice for Unix. Sybase SQL Server version 4.2 and Microsoft SQL Server are identical. Their [[Transact-SQL]] (T-SQL) procedural language is the same, as is the basic process architecture. From this point the products diverge as Microsoft includes more Windows features whilst Sybase adds Enterprise features (performance and scaling).\n*April 1993: Sybase introduces the first component of System 10, called OmniSQL Gateway. This program connects the various parts of a computer network, enabling users to access [[data]] changes made within the network.\n*June 1993: Sybase announces its latest generation of software, named the System 10 product family; this consists of the Database server, Replication Server for keeping replicate data up-to-date in near real time, and Navigation Server which had been developed in partnership with NCR to do shared nothing parallelisation across large numbers of databases. Backup Server is introduced to do high performance parallel backups and restores. SQL Monitor and SA Companion are provided to manage multiple servers.\n*1994 Sybase acquires OASiS Group plc, a British management consulting firm of some 150 staff that implemented organisational change solutions as well as bespoke information systems. The acquisition was intended to position Sybase as a provider of enterprise business solutions but within 4 years most of the OASiS consultants had left.\n*1994: Sybase acquires Powersoft, the leading maker of development tools for client-server computing, with 40 per cent of that market. Through the deal, Sybase acquires [[PowerBuilder]], a [[rapid application development]] (RAD) tool and Powersoft\u2019s leading product. The acquisition also marks Sybase\u2019s entry into the enterprise mobility market with [[Watcom]] SQL, which Sybase renames [[SQL Anywhere]].  When Sybase launches its mobility subsidiary, Sybase iAnywhere, in 2000, SQL Anywhere becomes its flagship relational database management system (RDBMS) and helps the company to become the leader of the mobile database market. Sybase revenues are over $1bn.\n*1994: Sybase acquires Micro Decisionware (MDI), a privately-held middleware company based in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Its first product is PC/SQL-link, a tool that enables PC users to build SQL statements and send them to mainframe databases, with results returned to the PC. MDI's second product, the MDI Database Gateway, provided connectivity for PC-based applications (such as PowerBuilder) to execute SQL queries against mainframe databases.The MDI Database Gateway was in competition with the Sybase middleware solution.{{buzzword inline|date=August 2019}} After the acquisition, some MDI Database Gateway features were integrated into the Sybase solution.{{buzzword inline|date=August 2019}}\n*1995: Sybase\u2019s flagship database product Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) V11.0 released. This was a major performance release giving massive scalability up to 16 processors. (100% for the first 15 and 25% for the 16th in a benchmark run for a UK government contract). This server outperformed all competitors in standard benchmarks.  Sybase launches PowerDesigner, a modeling and metadata management solution{{buzzword inline|date=August 2019}}, following its acquisition of PowerAMC. Sybase share price peaks at $96.\n*1996 Sybase renames the main product SQL Server to its current name Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) for version 11.5.  Anywhere 5 is released. It includes SQL Remote, SQL Central, Transact SQL syntax, and support for the Sybase Replication Server.\n*In 1996, Mitchell Kertzman, Powersoft CEO, was appointed CEO of Sybase. Sybase launched [[Sybase IQ]], the first column-based analytics platform.\n*January 1998: Sybase announced that it had found inconsistencies in profits reporting from its Japanese division, and would restate the financial results for the company for the last three quarters of 1997.<ref>{{cite web |last=Magee|first=Mike |title=Sybase to restate following Japanese accounting scandal |url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1992960/sybase-restate-following-japanese-accounting-scandal|work=V3.co.uk |publisher=Incisive Media |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> Five executives in Sybase's Japanese subsidiary were found to have used [[Side letter (collective bargaining)|side letters]] to artificially inflate the profits from their operations.

This detail of the \"Standard of Ur\", c. 2500 BC., displays a Sumerian [[chariot]]]]\n\nThe '''history of technology''' is the history of the [[invention]] of [[tool]]s and techniques and is one of the categories of world history. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as [[stone tools]] to the complex [[genetic engineering]] and [[information technology]] that has emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology|title=history of technology \u2013 Summary & Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nNew knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by [[technologies]] which assist humans in [[travel]]ing to places they could not previously reach, and by [[scientific instrument]]s by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.\n\nSince much of technology is [[applied science]], technical history is connected to the [[history of science]]. Since technology uses [[resource]]s, technical history is tightly connected to [[economic history]]. From those [[Resource (Windows)|resources]], technology produces other resources, including ''technological artifacts'' used in [[everyday life]].\n\n[[Technological change]] affects, and is affected by, a society's cultural [[tradition]]s. It is a force for [[economic growth]] and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Measuring technological progress ==\nMany [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with [[social evolution|social]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]] have declared [[technological progress]] to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. [https://www.techmaster.online/?m=1 Morgan's concept] of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, [[Primitive culture|barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, such as fire. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Elliot|last2=Smith|first2=Karen|title=American Materialism|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism|website=The University of Alabama \u2013 Department of Anthropology|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor White, \"the primary function of [[culture]]\" is to \"harness and control energy.\" White differentiates between five stages of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of [[natural resource]]s: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In his own words, \"culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased\". [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated his theory, creating the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.\n\nLenski's approach focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of [[natural environment]]) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in [[communications technology]] translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of wealth]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy:\n* [[hunter-gatherer]],\n* simple [[Agriculture|agricultural]],\n* advanced agricultural,\n* [[Industry|industrial]],\n* special (such as fishing societies).\n\nIn economics, [[productivity]] is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first=Gordon J. |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT; London |isbn=978-0-275-96532-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wayitworkedwhyit0000bjor/page/2 2, 67] |url=https://archive.org/details/wayitworkedwhyit0000bjor/page/2 }}</ref> For example, employment in [[manufacturing in the United States]] declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as ''post-industrial''.\n\nIn the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached the theories of [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]]. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in [[Fictional technology|fiction]], are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-[[Technological singularity|Singularity]] societies. <ref>Daniele Archibugi,  and Mario Planta. \"Measuring technological change through patents and innovation surveys.\" ''Technovation'' 16.9 (1996): 451-519.</ref>\n\n== By period and geography ==\n[[File:Farming-on-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[Agriculture]] preceded [[writing]] in the history of technology.]]\nThe following is a summary of the history of technology by time period and geography:\n\n{{Div col |colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Olduvai Gorge|Olduvai]] [[stone technology]] ([[Oldowan]]) 2.5&nbsp;million years ago (scrapers; to butcher dead animals)\n* [[Acheulean]] stone technology 1.6&nbsp;million years ago (hand axe)\n* [[Fire]] creation and manipulation, used since the [[Paleolithic]], possibly by [[Homo erectus]] as early as [[1 E13 s|1.5 Million years ago]]\n* ([[Homo sapiens sapiens]] \u2013 modern human anatomy arises, around 200,000 years ago.)\n* [[Clothing]] possibly 170,000 years ago.\n* [[Stone tool]]s, used by [[Homo floresiensis]], possibly [[1 E12 s|100,000&nbsp;years ago]].\n* [[Ceramic]]s c. 25,000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Domestication]] of animals, c. 15,000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Bow (weapon)|Bow]], [[Sling (weapon)|sling]] c. 9th millennium&nbsp;BC\n* [[Microlith]]s c. 9th millennium BC\n* Handmade bricks first used for construction in the Middle East c. 6000&nbsp;BCE\n* [[Agriculture]] and [[Plough]] c. 4000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Wheel]] c. 4000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Gnomon]] c. 4000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Writing system]]s c. 3500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Copper]] c. 3200 BC\n* [[Bronze]] c. 2500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Salt]] c. 2500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Chariot]] c. 2000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Iron]] c. 1500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Sundial]] c. 800&nbsp;BC\n* [[Glass]] ca. 500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Catapult]] c. 400&nbsp;BC\n* [[Cast iron]] c. 400&nbsp;BC\n* [[Horseshoe]] c. 300&nbsp;BC\n* [[Stirrup]] first few centuries&nbsp;AD\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Human timeline}}\n{{Main|Prehistoric technology}}\n\n==== Stone Age ====\n{{Main|Stone Age}}\n[[File:Prehistoric Tools - Les Combarelles - Les Eyzies de Tayac - MNP.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of [[stone tool]]s]]\nDuring most of the '''[[Paleolithic]]''' \u2013 the bulk of the Stone Age \u2013 all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements.

The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared.

Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery [[kiln]]s allowed sufficiently high temperatures.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>  The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields [[arsenical bronze]], which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>  [[Bronze]] is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze became widespread. (See: [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]) [[Bronze]] was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects.\n\nBronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.  Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC|location= New York|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>  Better ships enabled long distance trade and the advance of civilization. \n   \nThis technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The [[three-age system]] does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of [[Eurasia]], and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the [[Spinifex People]], the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.\n\n==== Iron Age ====\n{{Main|Iron Age}}\n[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from the Swedish [[Iron Age]]]]\nBefore iron smelting was developed the only iron was obtained from meteorites and is usually identified by having nickel content.  [[Meteoric iron]] was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks.\n\nThe '''[[Iron Age]]''' involved the adoption of iron [[bloomery|smelting]] technology. It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores. Consequently, iron was produced in many areas.\n\nIt was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.  Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.  [[Steel]] could be produced by [[forging]] bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous.\n\nIn many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case.\n\nIn Europe, large [[hill fort]]s were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.\n\n==== Mesopotamia ====\n[[Mesopotamia]] (modern Iraq) and its peoples ([[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkad (region)|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonia]]ns) lived in cities from c. 4000&nbsp;BC,<ref>JN Postgate, ''Early Mesopotamia'', Routledge (1992)</ref> and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,<ref>See entries under [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]</ref> including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a [[Wonder of the World]]. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.<ref name=Dalley2013>S Dalley, ''The Mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon'', Oxford University Press(2013)</ref>\n\n[[Writing]] was invented in Mesopotamia, using the [[cuneiform]] script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200&nbsp;BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece.\n\nSeveral of the six classic [[simple machines]] were invented in Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moorey |first1=Peter Roger Stuart |title=Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: The Archaeological Evidence |date=1999 |publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]] |isbn=9781575060422}}</ref> Mesopotamians have been credited with the invention of the [[wheel]].

Historians and archaeologists have found evidence that the [[pyramid]]s were built using three of what is called the [[Simple machine|Six Simple Machines]], from which all machines are based. These machines are the [[inclined plane]], the [[wedge]], and the [[lever]], which allowed the ancient Egyptians to move millions of limestone blocks which weighed approximately 3.5 tons (7,000 lbs.) each into place to create structures like the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], which is 481 feet (146.7 meters) high.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ancient Machines: From Grunts to Graffiti|last=Wood|first=Michael|publisher=Runestone Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8225-2996-3|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientcommunica00wood/page/35 35, 36]|authorlink=|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientcommunica00wood/page/35}}</ref>\n\nThey also made writing medium similar to paper from [[papyrus]], which Joshua Mark states is the foundation for modern paper. Papyrus is a plant (cyperus papyrus) which grew in plentiful amounts in the Egyptian Delta and throughout the Nile River Valley during ancient times. The papyrus was harvested by field workers and brought to processing centers where it was cut into thin strips. The strips were then laid out side by side perpendicularly then covered in plant resin and the second layer of strips was laid on horizontally, then pressed together until the sheet was dry. The sheets were then joined together to form a roll and later used for writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Egyptian_Papyrus/|title=Egyptian Papyrus|last=Mark|first=Joshua J.|date=8 November 2016|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nEgyptian society made several significant advances during dynastic periods in many areas of technology. According to Hossam Elanzeery, they were the first civilization to use timekeeping devices such as sundials, shadow clocks, and obelisks and successfully leveraged their knowledge of astronomy to create a calendar model that society still uses today. They developed shipbuilding technology that saw them progress from papyrus reed vessels to cedar wood ships while also pioneering the use of rope trusses and stem-mounted rudders. The Egyptians also used their knowledge of anatomy to lay the foundation for many modern medical techniques and practiced the earliest known version of neuroscience. Elanzeery also states that they used and furthered mathematical science, as evidenced in the building of the pyramids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lindau-nobel.org/science-in-ancient-egypt-today-connecting-eras/|title=Science in Ancient Egypt & Today: Connecting Eras|last=Elanzeery|first=Hossam|website=The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptians also invented and pioneered many food technologies that have become the basis of modern food technology processes. Based on paintings and reliefs found in tombs, as well as archaeological artifacts, scholars like Paul T Nicholson believe that the Ancient Egyptians established systematic farming practices, engaged in cereal processing, brewed beer and baked bread, processed meat, practiced viticulture and created the basis for modern wine production, and created condiments to complement, preserve and mask the flavors of their food.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology|last= Nicholson |first= Paul T. |authorlink= |year= 2000|publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-521-45257-0 |pages=505\u2013650}}</ref>\n\n==== Indus Valley ====\nThe [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area (in modern [[Pakistan]] and northwestern [[India]]), is notable for its early application of city planning, [[Sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilisation|sanitation technologies]], and [[plumbing]].<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Teresi| first1 = Dick| authorlink = Dick Teresi| title = Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science--from the Babylonians to the Maya| publisher = Simon & Schuster| year = 2002| location = New York| pages = [https://archive.org/details/lostdiscoveriesa00tere/page/351 351\u2013352]| isbn = 0-684-83718-8| url = https://archive.org/details/lostdiscoveriesa00tere/page/351}}</ref> Indus Valley construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.\n\n==== China ====\nThe Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments.

The [[Hellenistic period]] saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and its close association with the adjacent [[museion]]. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as [[Archimedes]], [[Philo of Byzantium]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]], [[Ctesibius]], and [[Archytas]] remain known by name to posterity.\n\nAncient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical [[water-wheel]], the compartmented wheel, the water [[turbine]], [[Archimedes' screw]], the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the [[force pump]], the [[suction pump]], the double-action [[piston pump]] and quite possibly the [[chain pump]].<ref name=\"Lewis 2000 356f.\">{{Cite book\n | last = Oleson\n | first = John Peter Oleson\n | author-link = John Peter Oleson\n | year = 2000\n | contribution = Water-Lifting\n | editor-last = Wikander\n | editor-first = \u00d6rjan\n | editor-link = \u00d6rjan Wikander\n | title = Handbook of Ancient Water Technology\n | series = Technology and Change in History\n | location = Leiden\n | volume = 2\n | pages = 217\u2013302\n | isbn = 978-90-04-11123-3\n}}</ref>\n\nIn music, the [[water organ]], invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a [[keyboard instrument]]. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a [[feedback|feedback system]] and the [[escapement]] mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.\n\nInnovations in mechanical technology included the newly devised right-angled [[gear]], which would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. Hellenistic engineers also devised [[automata]] such as suspended ink pots, automatic [[washstand]]s, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured new useful mechanisms such as the [[cam]] and [[gimbal]]s.\n\nThe [[Antikythera mechanism]], a kind of [[analog computer|analogous computer]] working with a [[differential gear]], and the [[astrolabe]] both show great refinement in astronomical science.\n\nIn other fields, ancient Greek innovations include the [[catapult]] and the [[gastraphetes]] crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the [[dioptra]] for surveying, in infrastructure the [[lighthouse]], [[central heating]], a [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations]], and the [[Diolkos|ship trackway]]. In transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the [[winch]] and the [[odometer]].\n\nFurther newly created techniques and items were [[List of ancient spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], the [[chain drive]], [[caliper|sliding calipers]] and [[shower]]s.\n\n==== Roman Empire ====\n[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] expanded from [[Roman Italy|Italia]] across the entire [[Mediterranean region]] between the 1st century BC and 1st century AD.

Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.\n\nIn Roman Egypt, the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] was the first to experiment with a [[wind-power]]ed mechanical device (see [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s windwheel) and even created the earliest [[steam-power]]ed device (the [[aeolipile]]), opening up new possibilities in harnessing natural forces. He also devised a [[vending machine]]. However, his inventions were primarily toys, rather than practical machines.\n\n==== Inca, Maya, and Aztec ====\n[[File:Walls at Sacsayhuaman.jpg|thumb|Walls at Sacsayhuaman]]\n\nThe engineering skills of the [[Inca]] and [[Maya peoples|Maya]] were great, even by today's standards. An example of this exceptional engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks. Inca villages used irrigation canals and [[drainage]] systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of [[hydroponics]], their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced.\n\nThough the [[Maya civilization]] did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. The Maya are also responsible for creating the first pressurized water system in Mesoamerica, located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}</ref>\n\nThe main contribution of the [[Aztec]] rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities and the ubiquity of the ingenious agricultural technology of [[chinampas]]. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations. The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inherited many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the [[Olmec]] (see [[Native American inventions and innovations]]).\n\n=== Medieval to early modern ===\nOne of the most significant development of the Medieval era was the development of economies where water and wind power were more significant than animal and human muscle power.<ref name=\"Stark_2005\">{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|url= https://archive.org/details/victoryofreasonh00star|url-access= registration|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=0-8129-7233-3|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.

Genuine medieval contributions include for example [[mechanical clock]]s, [[spectacles]] and vertical [[windmill]]s. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the [[watermark]] or the [[push button|functional button]]. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent [[age of exploration]] was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon [[rudder]]s, [[lateen sail]]s, the [[dry compass]], the horseshoe and the [[astrolabe]].\n\nSignificant advances were also made in military technology with the development of [[plate armour]], steel [[crossbow]]s and [[cannon]].

These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\">{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.

[[Machine tools]] used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. The development of [[interchangeable parts]] through what is now called the [[American system of manufacturing]] began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.\n\n=== Second Industrial Revolution (1860s\u20131914) ===\n{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:Thomas_Edison_Lightbulbs_1879-1880.jpg|thumb|right|upright| Edison electric light bulbs 1879\u201380.]]\n\nThe 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until [[World War I]]. It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.\n\n[[Telegraphy]] developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Visible Hand: The Management Revolution in American Business |last=Chandler Jr. |first=Alfred D. |year=1993 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-94052-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/visiblehandmanag00chan }}</ref> Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first [[telephone]].

[[Military research]] and development sped advances including electronic [[computing]] and [[jet engine]]s. [[Radio]] and [[telephony]] greatly improved and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until [[mobile phones]] became affordable to [[developing world]] residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nEnergy and engine technology improvements included [[nuclear power]], developed after the [[Manhattan project]] which heralded the new [[Atomic Age]]. [[Rocket]] development led to long range missiles and the first [[space age]] that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.\n\n[[Electrification]] spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the [[World Wide Web]] was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfordevelopment.com/2014/11/rural-electrification-by-numbers-1970_2.html|title=Two Billion People Gain Electricity Access: 1970\u20132010|website=www.energyfordevelopment.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> the rural developing world.\n\n[[Birth control]] also became widespread during the 20th century. [[Electron microscopes]] were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in [[genetic engineering]].\n\nThe first \"[[test tube baby]]\" [[Louise Brown]] was born in 1978, which led to the first successful [[gestational surrogacy]] pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.\n\nThe massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider]] led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] to create the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n[[Vaccination]] spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.\n\nThe US [[National Academy of Engineering]], by expert vote, established the following ranking of the most important technological developments of the 20th century:<ref>{{cite web|title=Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/|website=greatachievements.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col |colwidth=27em}}\n\n# [[Electrification]]\n# [[Automobile]]\n# [[Airplane]]\n# [[Water supply]] and Distribution\n# [[Electronics]]\n# [[Radio]] and [[Television]]\n# [[Mechanized agriculture]]\n# [[Computer]]s\n# [[Telephone]]\n# [[Air Conditioning]] and [[Refrigeration]]\n# [[Highways]]\n# [[Spacecraft]]\n# [[Internet]]\n# [[Imaging technology]]\n# [[Household appliances]]\n# [[Health technology]]\n# [[Petroleum]] and [[Petrochemical]] technologies\n# [[Laser]] and [[Fiber Optics]]\n# [[Nuclear technology]]\n# [[Materials science]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s provided huge amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original lifespan estimates.]]\n\n{{Main|2000s in science and technology}}\n\nIn the early 21st century research is ongoing into [[quantum computers]], [[gene therapy]] (introduced 1990), [[3D printing]] (introduced 1981), [[nanotechnology]] (introduced 1985), [[bioengineering]]/[[biotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Materials science|advanced materials]] (e.g., graphene), the [[scramjet]] and [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]] (along with [[railgun]]s and high-energy laser beams for military uses), [[superconductivity]], the [[memristor]], and green technologies such as [[alternative fuel]]s (e.g., [[fuel cells]], self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), [[augmented reality]] devices and [[wearable electronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and more efficient and powerful [[LEDs]], [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]], [[wireless power]] devices, engines, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].\n\nPerhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the largest single machine ever built.

This detail of the \"Standard of Ur\", c. 2500 BC., displays a Sumerian [[chariot]]]]\n\nThe '''history of technology''' is the history of the [[invention]] of [[tool]]s and techniques and is one of the categories of world history. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as [[stone tools]] to the complex [[genetic engineering]] and [[information technology]] that has emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology|title=history of technology \u2013 Summary & Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nNew knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by [[technologies]] which assist humans in [[travel]]ing to places they could not previously reach, and by [[scientific instrument]]s by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.\n\nSince much of technology is [[applied science]], technical history is connected to the [[history of science]]. Since technology uses [[resource]]s, technical history is tightly connected to [[economic history]]. From those [[Resource (Windows)|resources]], technology produces other resources, including ''technological artifacts'' used in [[everyday life]].\n\n[[Technological change]] affects, and is affected by, a society's cultural [[tradition]]s. It is a force for [[economic growth]] and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Measuring technological progress ==\nMany [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with [[social evolution|social]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]] have declared [[technological progress]] to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, [[Primitive culture|barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, such as fire. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Elliot|last2=Smith|first2=Karen|title=American Materialism|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism|website=The University of Alabama \u2013 Department of Anthropology|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor White, \"the primary function of [[culture]]\" is to \"harness and control energy.\" White differentiates between five stages of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of [[natural resource]]s: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In his own words, \"culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased\". [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated his theory, creating the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.\n\nLenski's approach focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of [[natural environment]]) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in [[communications technology]] translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of wealth]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy:\n* [[hunter-gatherer]],\n* simple [[Agriculture|agricultural]],\n* advanced agricultural,\n* [[Industry|industrial]],\n* special (such as fishing societies).\n\nIn economics, [[productivity]] is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first=Gordon J. |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT; London |isbn=978-0-275-96532-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wayitworkedwhyit0000bjor/page/2 2, 67] |url=https://archive.org/details/wayitworkedwhyit0000bjor/page/2 }}</ref> For example, employment in [[manufacturing in the United States]] declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as ''post-industrial''.\n\nIn the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached the theories of [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]]. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in [[Fictional technology|fiction]], are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-[[Technological singularity|Singularity]] societies. <ref>Daniele Archibugi,  and Mario Planta. \"Measuring technological change through patents and innovation surveys.\" ''Technovation'' 16.9 (1996): 451-519.</ref>\n\n== By period and geography ==\n[[File:Farming-on-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[Agriculture]] preceded [[writing]] in the history of technology.]]\nThe following is a summary of the history of technology by time period and geography:\n\n{{Div col |colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Olduvai Gorge|Olduvai]] [[stone technology]] ([[Oldowan]]) 2.5&nbsp;million years ago (scrapers; to butcher dead animals)\n* [[Acheulean]] stone technology 1.6&nbsp;million years ago (hand axe)\n* [[Fire]] creation and manipulation, used since the [[Paleolithic]], possibly by [[Homo erectus]] as early as [[1 E13 s|1.5 Million years ago]]\n* ([[Homo sapiens sapiens]] \u2013 modern human anatomy arises, around 200,000 years ago.)\n* [[Clothing]] possibly 170,000 years ago.\n* [[Stone tool]]s, used by [[Homo floresiensis]], possibly [[1 E12 s|100,000&nbsp;years ago]].\n* [[Ceramic]]s c. 25,000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Domestication]] of animals, c. 15,000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Bow (weapon)|Bow]], [[Sling (weapon)|sling]] c. 9th millennium&nbsp;BC\n* [[Microlith]]s c. 9th millennium BC\n* Handmade bricks first used for construction in the Middle East c. 6000&nbsp;BCE\n* [[Agriculture]] and [[Plough]] c. 4000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Wheel]] c. 4000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Gnomon]] c. 4000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Writing system]]s c. 3500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Copper]] c. 3200 BC\n* [[Bronze]] c. 2500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Salt]] c. 2500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Chariot]] c. 2000&nbsp;BC\n* [[Iron]] c. 1500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Sundial]] c. 800&nbsp;BC\n* [[Glass]] ca. 500&nbsp;BC\n* [[Catapult]] c. 400&nbsp;BC\n* [[Cast iron]] c. 400&nbsp;BC\n* [[Horseshoe]] c. 300&nbsp;BC\n* [[Stirrup]] first few centuries&nbsp;AD\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Human timeline}}\n{{Main|Prehistoric technology}}\n\n==== Stone Age ====\n{{Main|Stone Age}}\n[[File:Prehistoric Tools - Les Combarelles - Les Eyzies de Tayac - MNP.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of [[stone tool]]s]]\nDuring most of the '''[[Paleolithic]]''' \u2013 the bulk of the Stone Age \u2013 all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements.

The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared.

Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery [[kiln]]s allowed sufficiently high temperatures.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>  The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields [[arsenical bronze]], which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>  [[Bronze]] is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze became widespread. (See: [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]) [[Bronze]] was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects.\n\nBronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.  Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC|location= New York|isbn= |pages=}}</ref>  Better ships enabled long distance trade and the advance of civilization. \n   \nThis technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The [[three-age system]] does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of [[Eurasia]], and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the [[Spinifex People]], the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.\n\n==== Iron Age ====\n{{Main|Iron Age}}\n[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from the Swedish [[Iron Age]]]]\nBefore iron smelting was developed the only iron was obtained from meteorites and is usually identified by having nickel content.  [[Meteoric iron]] was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks.\n\nThe '''[[Iron Age]]''' involved the adoption of iron [[bloomery|smelting]] technology. It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores. Consequently, iron was produced in many areas.\n\nIt was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.  Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.  [[Steel]] could be produced by [[forging]] bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous.\n\nIn many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case.\n\nIn Europe, large [[hill fort]]s were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.\n\n==== Mesopotamia ====\n[[Mesopotamia]] (modern Iraq) and its peoples ([[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkad (region)|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonia]]ns) lived in cities from c. 4000&nbsp;BC,<ref>JN Postgate, ''Early Mesopotamia'', Routledge (1992)</ref> and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,<ref>See entries under [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]</ref> including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a [[Wonder of the World]]. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.<ref name=Dalley2013>S Dalley, ''The Mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon'', Oxford University Press(2013)</ref>\n\n[[Writing]] was invented in Mesopotamia, using the [[cuneiform]] script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200&nbsp;BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece.\n\nSeveral of the six classic [[simple machines]] were invented in Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moorey |first1=Peter Roger Stuart |title=Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: The Archaeological Evidence |date=1999 |publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]] |isbn=9781575060422}}</ref> Mesopotamians have been credited with the invention of the [[wheel]].

Historians and archaeologists have found evidence that the [[pyramid]]s were built using three of what is called the [[Simple machine|Six Simple Machines]], from which all machines are based. These machines are the [[inclined plane]], the [[wedge]], and the [[lever]], which allowed the ancient Egyptians to move millions of limestone blocks which weighed approximately 3.5 tons (7,000 lbs.) each into place to create structures like the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], which is 481 feet (146.7 meters) high.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ancient Machines: From Grunts to Graffiti|last=Wood|first=Michael|publisher=Runestone Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8225-2996-3|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientcommunica00wood/page/35 35, 36]|authorlink=|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientcommunica00wood/page/35}}</ref>\n\nThey also made writing medium similar to paper from [[papyrus]], which Joshua Mark states is the foundation for modern paper. Papyrus is a plant (cyperus papyrus) which grew in plentiful amounts in the Egyptian Delta and throughout the Nile River Valley during ancient times. The papyrus was harvested by field workers and brought to processing centers where it was cut into thin strips. The strips were then laid out side by side perpendicularly then covered in plant resin and the second layer of strips was laid on horizontally, then pressed together until the sheet was dry. The sheets were then joined together to form a roll and later used for writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Egyptian_Papyrus/|title=Egyptian Papyrus|last=Mark|first=Joshua J.|date=8 November 2016|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nEgyptian society made several significant advances during dynastic periods in many areas of technology. According to Hossam Elanzeery, they were the first civilization to use timekeeping devices such as sundials, shadow clocks, and obelisks and successfully leveraged their knowledge of astronomy to create a calendar model that society still uses today. They developed shipbuilding technology that saw them progress from papyrus reed vessels to cedar wood ships while also pioneering the use of rope trusses and stem-mounted rudders. The Egyptians also used their knowledge of anatomy to lay the foundation for many modern medical techniques and practiced the earliest known version of neuroscience. Elanzeery also states that they used and furthered mathematical science, as evidenced in the building of the pyramids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lindau-nobel.org/science-in-ancient-egypt-today-connecting-eras/|title=Science in Ancient Egypt & Today: Connecting Eras|last=Elanzeery|first=Hossam|website=The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptians also invented and pioneered many food technologies that have become the basis of modern food technology processes. Based on paintings and reliefs found in tombs, as well as archaeological artifacts, scholars like Paul T Nicholson believe that the Ancient Egyptians established systematic farming practices, engaged in cereal processing, brewed beer and baked bread, processed meat, practiced viticulture and created the basis for modern wine production, and created condiments to complement, preserve and mask the flavors of their food.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology|last= Nicholson |first= Paul T. |authorlink= |year= 2000|publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-521-45257-0 |pages=505\u2013650}}</ref>\n\n==== Indus Valley ====\nThe [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area (in modern [[Pakistan]] and northwestern [[India]]), is notable for its early application of city planning, [[Sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilisation|sanitation technologies]], and [[plumbing]].<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Teresi| first1 = Dick| authorlink = Dick Teresi| title = Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science--from the Babylonians to the Maya| publisher = Simon & Schuster| year = 2002| location = New York| pages = [https://archive.org/details/lostdiscoveriesa00tere/page/351 351\u2013352]| isbn = 0-684-83718-8| url = https://archive.org/details/lostdiscoveriesa00tere/page/351}}</ref> Indus Valley construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.\n\n==== China ====\nThe Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments.

Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent [[Treasure voyages|large fleets]] on maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.\n\n==== Hellenistic Mediterranean ====\nThe [[Hellenistic period]] of [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean history]] began in the 4th century BC with [[Alexander's conquests]], which led to the emergence of a [[Hellenistic civilization]] representing a synthesis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Near-East]]ern cultures in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] region, including the [[Balkans]], [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]].<ref name=\"Green\">Green, Peter.

The [[Hellenistic period]] saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and its close association with the adjacent [[museion]]. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as [[Archimedes]], [[Philo of Byzantium]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]], [[Ctesibius]], and [[Archytas]] remain known by name to posterity.\n\nAncient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical [[water-wheel]], the compartmented wheel, the water [[turbine]], [[Archimedes' screw]], the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the [[force pump]], the [[suction pump]], the double-action [[piston pump]] and quite possibly the [[chain pump]].<ref name=\"Lewis 2000 356f.\">{{Cite book\n | last = Oleson\n | first = John Peter Oleson\n | author-link = John Peter Oleson\n | year = 2000\n | contribution = Water-Lifting\n | editor-last = Wikander\n | editor-first = \u00d6rjan\n | editor-link = \u00d6rjan Wikander\n | title = Handbook of Ancient Water Technology\n | series = Technology and Change in History\n | location = Leiden\n | volume = 2\n | pages = 217\u2013302\n | isbn = 978-90-04-11123-3\n}}</ref>\n\nIn music, the [[water organ]], invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a [[keyboard instrument]]. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a [[feedback|feedback system]] and the [[escapement]] mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.\n\nInnovations in mechanical technology included the newly devised right-angled [[gear]], which would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. Hellenistic engineers also devised [[automata]] such as suspended ink pots, automatic [[washstand]]s, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured new useful mechanisms such as the [[cam]] and [[gimbal]]s.\n\nThe [[Antikythera mechanism]], a kind of [[analog computer|analogous computer]] working with a [[differential gear]], and the [[astrolabe]] both show great refinement in astronomical science.\n\nIn other fields, ancient Greek innovations include the [[catapult]] and the [[gastraphetes]] crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the [[dioptra]] for surveying, in infrastructure the [[lighthouse]], [[central heating]], a [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations]], and the [[Diolkos|ship trackway]]. In transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the [[winch]] and the [[odometer]].\n\nFurther newly created techniques and items were [[List of ancient spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], the [[chain drive]], [[caliper|sliding calipers]] and [[shower]]s.\n\n==== Roman Empire ====\n[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] expanded from [[Roman Italy|Italia]] across the entire [[Mediterranean region]] between the 1st century BC and 1st century AD.

Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.\n\nIn Roman Egypt, the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] was the first to experiment with a [[wind-power]]ed mechanical device (see [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s windwheel) and even created the earliest [[steam-power]]ed device (the [[aeolipile]]), opening up new possibilities in harnessing natural forces. He also devised a [[vending machine]]. However, his inventions were primarily toys, rather than practical machines.\n\n==== Inca, Maya, and Aztec ====\n[[File:Walls at Sacsayhuaman.jpg|thumb|Walls at Sacsayhuaman]]\n\nThe engineering skills of the [[Inca]] and [[Maya peoples|Maya]] were great, even by today's standards. An example of this exceptional engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks. Inca villages used irrigation canals and [[drainage]] systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of [[hydroponics]], their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced.\n\nThough the [[Maya civilization]] did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. The Maya are also responsible for creating the first pressurized water system in Mesoamerica, located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}</ref>\n\nThe main contribution of the [[Aztec]] rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities and the ubiquity of the ingenious agricultural technology of [[chinampas]]. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations. The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inherited many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the [[Olmec]] (see [[Native American inventions and innovations]]).\n\n=== Medieval to early modern ===\nOne of the most significant development of the Medieval era was the development of economies where water and wind power were more significant than animal and human muscle power.<ref name=\"Stark_2005\">{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|url= https://archive.org/details/victoryofreasonh00star|url-access= registration|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=0-8129-7233-3|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.

The science and technology of previous empires in the region, including the Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Persian, Hellenistic and Roman empires, were inherited by the [[Muslim world]], where Arabic replaced Syriac, Persian and Greek as the lingua franca of the region. Significant advances were made in the region during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th-16th centuries).\n\nThe [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]] occurred during this period. It was a transformation in [[agriculture]] from the [[Golden Age of Islam|8th to the 13th century in the Islamic region]] of the [[Old World]]. The economy established by [[Arab]] and other [[Islamic economics in the world|Muslim traders]] across the Old World enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques throughout the Islamic world, as well as the adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it.{{sfn|Watson|1974|pp=8\u201335}} Advances were made in [[animal husbandry]], [[irrigation]], and farming, with the help of new technology such as the [[windmill]].

Genuine medieval contributions include for example [[mechanical clock]]s, [[spectacles]] and vertical [[windmill]]s. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the [[watermark]] or the [[push button|functional button]]. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent [[age of exploration]] was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon [[rudder]]s, [[lateen sail]]s, the [[dry compass]], the horseshoe and the [[astrolabe]].\n\nSignificant advances were also made in military technology with the development of [[plate armour]], steel [[crossbow]]s and [[cannon]].

The British [[Industrial Revolution]] is characterized by developments in the areas of textile machinery, [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]] the [[steam engine]] and the invention of [[machine tool]]s.\n\n[[Image:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]]]]\nBefore invention of machinery to spin yarn and weave cloth, spinning was done using the spinning wheel and weaving was done on a hand-and-foot-operated loom.

The [[spinning frame]] for wool was invented in 1738. The [[spinning jenny]], invented in 1764, was a machine that used multiple spinning wheels; however, it produced low quality thread. The [[water frame]] patented by Richard Arkwright in 1767, produced a better quality thread than the spinning jenny. The [[spinning mule]], patented in 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]], produced a high quality thread.<ref name=\"Landes_1969\"/><ref name=\"Ayres_1989\"/> The [[power loom]] was invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1787.<ref name=\"Landes_1969\"/>\n\n[[Image:Iron Bridge.JPG|thumb|left|The Iron Bridge]]\nIn the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\">{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.

Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power.\n\n[[File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|The preserved ''Rocket'']]\nThe steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased.

The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the [[Rocket locomotive]] of [[Robert Stephenson]] being one of its first working [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] used.\n\nManufacture of ships' pulley [[Block and tackle|blocks]] by all-metal machines at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in 1803 instigated the age of sustained [[mass production]]. [[Machine tools]] used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. The development of [[interchangeable parts]] through what is now called the [[American system of manufacturing]] began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.\n\n=== Second Industrial Revolution (1860s\u20131914) ===\n{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:Thomas_Edison_Lightbulbs_1879-1880.jpg|thumb|right|upright| Edison electric light bulbs 1879\u201380.]]\n\nThe 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until [[World War I]]. It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.\n\n[[Telegraphy]] developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Visible Hand: The Management Revolution in American Business |last=Chandler Jr. |first=Alfred D. |year=1993 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-94052-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/visiblehandmanag00chan }}</ref> Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first [[telephone]].

[[Military research]] and development sped advances including electronic [[computing]] and [[jet engine]]s. [[Radio]] and [[telephony]] greatly improved and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until [[mobile phones]] became affordable to [[developing world]] residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nEnergy and engine technology improvements included [[nuclear power]], developed after the [[Manhattan project]] which heralded the new [[Atomic Age]]. [[Rocket]] development led to long range missiles and the first [[space age]] that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.\n\n[[Electrification]] spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the [[World Wide Web]] was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfordevelopment.com/2014/11/rural-electrification-by-numbers-1970_2.html|title=Two Billion People Gain Electricity Access: 1970\u20132010|website=www.energyfordevelopment.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> the rural developing world.\n\n[[Birth control]] also became widespread during the 20th century. [[Electron microscopes]] were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in [[genetic engineering]].\n\nThe first \"[[test tube baby]]\" [[Louise Brown]] was born in 1978, which led to the first successful [[gestational surrogacy]] pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.\n\nThe massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider]] led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] to create the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n[[Vaccination]] spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.\n\nThe US [[National Academy of Engineering]], by expert vote, established the following ranking of the most important technological developments of the 20th century:<ref>{{cite web|title=Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/|website=greatachievements.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col |colwidth=27em}}\n\n# [[Electrification]]\n# [[Automobile]]\n# [[Airplane]]\n# [[Water supply]] and Distribution\n# [[Electronics]]\n# [[Radio]] and [[Television]]\n# [[Mechanized agriculture]]\n# [[Computer]]s\n# [[Telephone]]\n# [[Air Conditioning]] and [[Refrigeration]]\n# [[Highways]]\n# [[Spacecraft]]\n# [[Internet]]\n# [[Imaging technology]]\n# [[Household appliances]]\n# [[Health technology]]\n# [[Petroleum]] and [[Petrochemical]] technologies\n# [[Laser]] and [[Fiber Optics]]\n# [[Nuclear technology]]\n# [[Materials science]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s provided huge amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original lifespan estimates.]]\n\n{{Main|2000s in science and technology}}\n\nIn the early 21st century research is ongoing into [[quantum computers]], [[gene therapy]] (introduced 1990), [[3D printing]] (introduced 1981), [[nanotechnology]] (introduced 1985), [[bioengineering]]/[[biotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Materials science|advanced materials]] (e.g., graphene), the [[scramjet]] and [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]] (along with [[railgun]]s and high-energy laser beams for military uses), [[superconductivity]], the [[memristor]], and green technologies such as [[alternative fuel]]s (e.g., [[fuel cells]], self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), [[augmented reality]] devices and [[wearable electronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and more efficient and powerful [[LEDs]], [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]], [[wireless power]] devices, engines, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].\n\nPerhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the largest single machine ever built.
