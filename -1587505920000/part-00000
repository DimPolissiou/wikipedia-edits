On 5 January 1869 the club was founded during a general meeting at Robertson's Temperance Hotel on Portland Street.<ref>{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn= 1-874427-75-5}}</ref> Originally they played a game more similar to [[Rugby football|rugby]] and these origins are reflected to this day by the name of the club's home ground&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rugby Park]]. The difficulty in organising fixtures under this code and the growing influence of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] soon persuaded them to adopt the association code instead. At this time, the club played games in a number locations including Holm Quarry, the Grange on Irvine Road and a location close to the current Rugby Park.\n\nFollowing the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.\n\n[[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs \u2013 Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville \u2013 attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to form the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\nThat day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that: The clubs here represented form themselves into an association for the promotion of football according to the rules of The Football Association and that the clubs connected with this association subscribe for a challenge cup to be played for annually, the committee to propose the laws of the competition.\n\nKilmarnock also competed in the inaugural [[Scottish Cup]] tournament in 1873\u201374. Their 2\u20130 defeat against [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] in the First Round on 18 October 1873 is thought to have been the first match ever played in the competition.\n\nKilmarnock joined the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] in [[1895\u201396 in Scottish football|1895]] and after winning consecutive Second Division titles were elected to the top flight for the first time in [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899]]. In 1920 Kilmarnock won the Scottish Cup for the first time beating [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] at Hampden. This was followed soon by their second success in 1929 where they beat massive favourites [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20130 at the national stadium in front of a crowd of 114,708 people.<ref name=\"Ross 1994\">{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn=1-874427-75-5}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] fought out a championship title race with [[Willie Waddell]]'s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with [[Dundee United]] meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Tommy Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post.

On 11 January 2010, Jim Jefferies left the club by \"mutual consent\" and [[Jimmy Calderwood]] was appointed manager.

Kilmarnock began the game with a two-point advantage over their rivals and a goalless draw on the day was good enough to secure top-flight football for another year. They ended the season with just 33 points, their worst points finish in the SPL.\n\nAfter Calderwood left the team at the end the season, [[Mixu Paatelainen]] was appointed manager for the next two years with an option for a third.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/8754914.stm|title=Football \u2013 Mixu Paatelainen is named as the new Kilmarnock manager|publisher=BBC|date=23 June 2010}}</ref> Despite being the favourites for relegation that season, Kilmarnock finished the season in fifth position.

In an unexpected move, Kilmarnock appointed former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] coach [[Steve Clarke]] two weeks later.

The season's results also set a new record points total for the club and their highest placed finish in the league since 1966. The following day, Clarke was signed by the [[Scottish FA]] to become the head coach of the [[Scotland National Football Team|Scotland National Team]].\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n[[File:Kilmarnock_FC_150th_Anniversary_Logo.svg|thumb|left|The 150th Anniversary Badge from 2018\u20132019]]\n\nThe earliest known Kilmarnock kit from 1879 consisted of an all blue jersey with white trousers. The shirt bore a crest which was described as \"a hand, index and second fingers upright, thumb outstretched, other fingers enclosed over a palm\" (an adoption of the historic [[Clan Boyd]] chief's heraldic crest). The hand rested on a bar over a ball marked KFC. Between 1887-1890 Kilmarnock wore black and white striped tops. Thereafter, the club has predominantly played in blue and white striped or hooped shirts with either blue or white shorts. The club have also occasionally played in plain blue and plain white tops; this was suggested by Ross Quigley whom at the time was one of the first directors of the club, although the kit was later changed to the hooped style in 1920. The club's away colours have varied greatly over time. Yellow is generally regarded as the club's main third colour; but white, red and purple away kits have also appeared in recent years.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the club manufactured their kits under their own sportswear brand, 1869. Following this, Italian company Erre\u00e1 was the manufacturer. The current shirt sponsors are the locally based QTS Group with American company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] manufacturing the kit, which can only be bought from their own store at [[Rugby Park]].\n\nThe club badge is a modernised version of previous club badges. It features a ball bearing a hand in a blessing position, flanked by two red squirrels. The club's Latin motto, 'confidemus' ('we trust'), is written above the badge (similar to the [[Clan Boyd]] heraldic motto, 'confido' ('I trust')). The club adopted the badge in 1993 after [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|The Lord Lyon]] decreed that the previous badge, based heavily upon the town crest, was in breach of ancient Scottish [[heraldry|heraldic]] rules.\n\nIn October 2018 the club unveiled a special badge for the club's 150th anniversary.\n\n<center>\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la =\n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra =\n| leftarm    = 000066\n| body       = 000066\n| rightarm   = 000066\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Dark blue jersey, white shorts, dark blue socks\n| title      = Kilmarnocks's first known kit from 1879.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so = _2_stripes_white\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1920 & 1929\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripes\n| pattern_ra = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 0000ff\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = League winning kit from 1965.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = 0000FF\n| socks      = 0000FF\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Home kit from 1977 to 1989\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_b  = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_ra = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_sh = _fortaleza09a\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FFFFFF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = FFFFFF\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, white socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1997\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_b  = _bluesides_horizontal_line\n| pattern_ra = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_sh = _bluesides_bottom_line\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = ffff66\n| body       = ffff66\n| rightarm   = ffff66\n| shorts     = ffff66\n| socks      = ffff66\n| alt        = Yellow jersey, yellow shorts, yellow socks.\n| title      = Scottish League Cup winning away kit from 2012\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n</center>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{see|Rugby Park}}\n[[File:Rugby Park.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Rugby Park]] stadium, situated on Rugby Road, home of Kilmarnock FC]]\nKilmarnock first played football matches at the present [[Rugby Park]] site in 1899.

Their completion brought the capacity of the stadium to {{SPFL-stadiums|kilmarnock}}.<ref name=\"capacity\">{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/kilmarnock/ |title=Kilmarnock Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref> The stadium opened on 6 August 1995, in a friendly match against English champions [[Blackburn Rovers]].

The pitch is capable of hosting [[rugby football|rugby]] matches as well as football.

On 5 January 1869 the club was founded during a general meeting at Robertson's Temperance Hotel on Portland Street.<ref>{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn= 1-874427-75-5}}</ref> Originally they played a game more similar to [[Rugby football|rugby]] and these origins are reflected to this day by the name of the club's home ground&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rugby Park]]. The difficulty in organising fixtures under this code and the growing influence of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] soon persuaded them to adopt the association code instead. At this time, the club played games in a number locations including Holm Quarry, the Grange on Irvine Road and a location close to the current Rugby Park.\n\nFollowing the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.\n\n[[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs \u2013 Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville \u2013 attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to form the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\nThat day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that: The clubs here represented form themselves into an association for the promotion of football according to the rules of The Football Association and that the clubs connected with this association subscribe for a challenge cup to be played for annually, the committee to propose the laws of the competition.\n\nKilmarnock also competed in the inaugural [[Scottish Cup]] tournament in 1873\u201374. Their 2\u20130 defeat against [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] in the First Round on 18 October 1873 is thought to have been the first match ever played in the competition.\n\nKilmarnock joined the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] in [[1895\u201396 in Scottish football|1895]] and after winning consecutive Second Division titles were elected to the top flight for the first time in [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899]]. In 1920 Kilmarnock won the Scottish Cup for the first time beating [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] at Hampden. This was followed soon by their second success in 1929 where they beat massive favourites [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20130 at the national stadium in front of a crowd of 114,708 people.<ref name=\"Ross 1994\">{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn=1-874427-75-5}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] fought out a championship title race with [[Willie Waddell]]'s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with [[Dundee United]] meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Tommy Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post.

On 11 January 2010, Jim Jefferies left the club by \"mutual consent\" and [[Jimmy Calderwood]] was appointed manager.

Kilmarnock began the game with a two-point advantage over their rivals and a goalless draw on the day was good enough to secure top-flight football for another year. They ended the season with just 33 points, their worst points finish in the SPL.\n\nAfter Calderwood left the team at the end the season, [[Mixu Paatelainen]] was appointed manager for the next two years with an option for a third.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/8754914.stm|title=Football \u2013 Mixu Paatelainen is named as the new Kilmarnock manager|publisher=BBC|date=23 June 2010}}</ref> Despite being the favourites for relegation that season, Kilmarnock finished the season in fifth position.

McCulloch was sacked in September 2017 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table. In an unexpected move, Kilmarnock appointed former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] coach [[Steve Clarke]] two weeks later. It was Clarke\u2019s first involvement with the Scottish game in 30 years.

Kilmarnock won the match 2\u20131 and the result secured a third place finish in the league, which guaranteed Kilmarnock European football for the first time since 2001. The season's results also set a new record points total for the club and their highest placed finish in the league since 1966. The following day, Clarke was signed by the [[Scottish FA]] to become the head coach of the [[Scotland National Football Team|Scotland National Team]].\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n[[File:Kilmarnock_FC_150th_Anniversary_Logo.svg|thumb|left|The 150th Anniversary Badge from 2018\u20132019]]\n\nThe earliest known Kilmarnock kit from 1879 consisted of an all blue jersey with white trousers. The shirt bore a crest which was described as \"a hand, index and second fingers upright, thumb outstretched, other fingers enclosed over a palm\" (an adoption of the historic [[Clan Boyd]] chief's heraldic crest). The hand rested on a bar over a ball marked KFC. Between 1887-1890 Kilmarnock wore black and white striped tops. Thereafter, the club has predominantly played in blue and white striped or hooped shirts with either blue or white shorts. The club have also occasionally played in plain blue and plain white tops; this was suggested by Ross Quigley whom at the time was one of the first directors of the club, although the kit was later changed to the hooped style in 1920. The club's away colours have varied greatly over time. Yellow is generally regarded as the club's main third colour; but white, red and purple away kits have also appeared in recent years.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the club manufactured their kits under their own sportswear brand, 1869. Following this, Italian company Erre\u00e1 was the manufacturer. The current shirt sponsors are the locally based QTS Group with American company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] manufacturing the kit, which can only be bought from their own store at [[Rugby Park]].\n\nThe club badge is a modernised version of previous club badges. It features a ball bearing a hand in a blessing position, flanked by two red squirrels. The club's Latin motto, 'confidemus' ('we trust'), is written above the badge (similar to the [[Clan Boyd]] heraldic motto, 'confido' ('I trust')). The club adopted the badge in 1993 after [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|The Lord Lyon]] decreed that the previous badge, based heavily upon the town crest, was in breach of ancient Scottish [[heraldry|heraldic]] rules.\n\nIn October 2018 the club unveiled a special badge for the club's 150th anniversary.\n\n<center>\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la =\n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra =\n| leftarm    = 000066\n| body       = 000066\n| rightarm   = 000066\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Dark blue jersey, white shorts, dark blue socks\n| title      = Kilmarnocks's first known kit from 1879.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so = _2_stripes_white\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1920 & 1929\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripes\n| pattern_ra = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 0000ff\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = League winning kit from 1965.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = 0000FF\n| socks      = 0000FF\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Home kit from 1977 to 1989\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_b  = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_ra = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_sh = _fortaleza09a\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FFFFFF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = FFFFFF\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, white socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1997\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_b  = _bluesides_horizontal_line\n| pattern_ra = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_sh = _bluesides_bottom_line\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = ffff66\n| body       = ffff66\n| rightarm   = ffff66\n| shorts     = ffff66\n| socks      = ffff66\n| alt        = Yellow jersey, yellow shorts, yellow socks.\n| title      = Scottish League Cup winning away kit from 2012\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n</center>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{see|Rugby Park}}\n[[File:Rugby Park.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Rugby Park]] stadium, situated on Rugby Road, home of Kilmarnock FC]]\nKilmarnock first played football matches at the present [[Rugby Park]] site in 1899. Despite this, the venue is actually Kilmarnock\u2019s fourth home ground. The Grange, Holm Quarry and Ward's Park all hosted matches before the club moved to Rugby Park in 1877. This was not the present stadium, but one situated close by near South Hamilton Street. This ground was shared by cricket and rugby teams&nbsp;\u2013 sports which Kilmarnock had played previously&nbsp;\u2013 and the connection with rugby gave the ground its name. This name was taken with the club when they moved to their present stadium.\n\nDuring 1994\u201395 season the stadium capacity was significantly reduced as three new stands were constructed; the Moffat Stand, the Chadwick Stand and the East Stand. Their completion brought the capacity of the stadium to {{SPFL-stadiums|kilmarnock}}.<ref name=\"capacity\">{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/kilmarnock/ |title=Kilmarnock Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref> The stadium opened on 6 August 1995, in a friendly match against English champions [[Blackburn Rovers]]. [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] hit a hat-trick as the home team lost 5\u20130.\n\nA [[FIFA]] 2 star [[FieldTurf]] [[Artificial Turf|artificial pitch]] was installed at Rugby Park for the start of the [[2014\u201315 Kilmarnock F.C. season|2014\u201315]] season. The pitch is capable of hosting [[rugby football|rugby]] matches as well as football. A new artificial hybrid surface was installed during the 2019 close season. \n\nIn February 2019 Kilmarnock received approval to install a new safe-standing section in areas of the East and Moffat stands. The installation process was completed in early December of that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48612693 |title=Kilmarnock U16s safe-standing section is British first |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=12 June 2019 |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Panorama RugbyPark.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Rugby Park looking towards the Chadwick (Away) Stand}}\n\n==Ayrshire Derby==\nKilmarnock's biggest rivalry is with their South Ayrshire neighbours [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] and together they contest the [[Ayrshire derby|Ayrshire Derby]].

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nChristian thought of this age was heavily influenced by Pope Gregory the Great, monasticism and St.Benedict. Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile.

However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die.

For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position.

There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A.

Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope.

Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die.

For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones.

In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies. [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony of [[Rhode Island]], \"a haven for persecuted minorities,\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> [[John Locke]] drafted the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]] and [[William Penn]] drew up the constitution of Pennsylvania. Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
