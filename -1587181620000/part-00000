Later that year, the Legislature appropriated funds for the operation of the College to serve the graduates of state junior, community, and technical colleges/institutions.\n\nLater, in 1998, the college became Athens State University.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19367469/the_montgomery_advertiser/|title=Governor gives legislators 'pork' money at last minute|newspaper=The Montgomery Advertiser|location=Montgomery, Alabama|last1=Poovey|first1=Bill|date=May 9, 1998|page=9}}</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2012, a bill was passed by the Alabama Legislature allowing the creation of an autonomous Board of Trustees for the University. This Board of Trustees took office in October 2012. Athens State University remains the only upper-division University in the State of Alabama.  The long history of service by the University is the foundation upon which the future of the University rests.\n\n==Athens State College Historic District==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Athens State College Historic District\n  | nrhp_type = hd\n  | image = Founders Hall Athens State Univ.jpg\n  | caption = Founders Hall is a contributing property to the historic district\n  | location= 202--212 and 311 N.

The usual approach was to construct a dam to retain surface water, or to drill a series of [[water well|well]]s, and store the water in a [[water tank]]. Railroad communities often grew up around these reservoirs or [[water stop]]s. Ash Fork had been such a town from when the ATSF first arrived some years earlier although it had been a way point for [[stagecoach]] lines previously.\n\nRailroads in the U.S. and elsewhere had been leaders in structural development. The [[masonry]] [[arch bridge]]s and viaducts of the early 19th century had given way to bridges made mostly of [[steel]], with considerable economy of material, construction cost, and time, and Bainbridge speculated that similar savings might be possible for dams. This dam was a significant departure from the more typical [[masonry]] construction. Already familiar with the construction of the ATSF's many steel bridges, Bainbridge decided to see whether steel construction could replace masonry in dams as well. The dam's light weight and prefabricated components must have made assembly easy relative to the laborious job of quarrying and setting stone.\n\nSteel dams use relatively thin steel plates in contact with the water surface, with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the load to the ground. The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow, so that the weight of the water puts [[compression (physical)|compressive]] forces on the girders holding the plates up. This transmits force to the ground without the [[moment (physics)|bending moment]] that a vertical wall of plates would engender. It was believed that these dams could be constructed faster and more cheaply than masonry dams.\n\n==Location==\nThe dam lies about {{convert|3|mi|km}} to the east of Ash Fork, in Johnson Canyon, and about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Williams, Arizona]]. It is near the former [[U.S. Route 66]] and [[Interstate 40]]. About a mile upstream lies Stone Dam, a masonry structure constructed 13 years later. The [[Grand Canyon Railway]] originates in Williams, branching from the ATSF main that this dam served, and runs northeast to the [[Grand Canyon]].\n\n==Construction details==\nThe dam was fabricated by the [[Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company]] and shipped to the site in pieces for erection. Construction of the dam began in 1897 and was completed March 5, 1898, at a total cost of US$63,519 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|.063519|1898|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).\n\nThe structure gets its scalloped appearance from 24 curved {{nowrap|{{frac|3|8}}-inch}} ({{cvt|.375|in|mm|disp=out|}}) steel plates that slope downstream.

It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador. It was named after the city of [[Quito]]: San Francisco de Quito, in response to the need of a private [[higher education|higher-education]] institution in Ecuador. It was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in October 1995 and accredited by [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] in May 2001.<ref>[http://www.conesup.net/info_universidades.php?id_univ=1038]. conesup.net.</ref>\n\n===Establishment of the ''Corporaci\u00f3n de Promoci\u00f3n Universitaria''===\nIn 1980, a group of Ecuadorian and international intellectuals and businesspeople, under the leadership of Santiago Gangotena Gonz\u00e1lez, established the non-profit ''Corporaci\u00f3n de Promoci\u00f3n Universitaria'', with the mission to create a private Ecuadorian university. The corporation was legalized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in June 1985 (published in the Official Registry of the Ecuadorian Government in 28 de June 1985).\n\n===Foundation of the University===\nAfter eight years of planning and promotion, the first class of USFQ students started on September 1, 1988, in a manor located on the 12 de Octubre Ave. 1983 and Salazar St.,in the northern area of [[Quito]], with 130 students. The university was recognized by the Ecuadorian government on October 18, 1995, under Executive Decree 3166, published in the Official Registry 809 on October 25, 1995. The statutes of the university were approved by the National Council of High Education [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] on May 18, 2001.\n\n===Creation of the colleges===\nUSFQ is divided among academic colleges ([[Faculty (division)|faculties]]). In 1988, students were distributed among three academic colleges: ''Colegio de Administraci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo'' for business studies, ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'' for applied sciences, and ''Colegio de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Cultura'' for communication, arts and cultural studies. In 1990, USFQ started the ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'' for environmental sciences.\n\nIn 1992, six colleges were established: ''Colegio de Administraci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo'', ''Colegio de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Artes'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'', y ''Colegio de Lenguas''. Subsequently, in 1993, the ''Colegio de Arquitectura'' started, followed in 1994 by the ''Colegio de Agricultura'' and the ''Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud''. In 1997, the ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'' changed its name to ''Colegio de Artes Liberales''.\n\n===Colleges of the university===\nBy 2017, USFQ is divided in 15 academic colleges and institutes spread across three campuses across [[Ecuador]] ([[Quito|Cumbay\u00e1-Quito]], [[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]], and the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]<ref name=\"sobrelausfq\" />):\n* Colegio de Administraci\u00f3n y Econom\u00eda (CADE) - College of Business Administration and Economics\n* Colegio de Arquitectura y Dise\u00f1o Interior (CADI) - College of Architecture and Interior Design\n* Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades  (COCISOH) - College of Social Sciences and Humanities\n* Colegio de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas y Ambientales (COCIBA) - College of Biological and Environmental Sciences\n* Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud (COCSA) - College of Health Science\n* Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00eda (Polit\u00e9cnico) - College of Sciences and Engineering - The Polytechnic\n* Colegio de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Artes Contempor\u00e1neas (COCOA) - College of Communication and Contemporary Arts\n* Colegio de Hospitalidad, Arte Culinario y Turismo (CHAT) - College of Hospitality, Culinary Arts, and Tourism\n* Colegio de Jurisprudencia (JUR)- College of Jurisprudence\n* Colegio de Musica (CoM) - College of Music\n* Academia Regional de Redes CISCO-USFQ - Regional [[CISCO]]-USFQ Academy\n* GAIAS - Galapagos Academic Institute for the Arts and Sciences\n* Instituto Confucio - [[Confucius Institute]]\n* Instituto de Ense\u00f1anza y Aprendizaje (IDEA) - Institute of Teaching and Learning\n* Instituto de Lenguas Extranjeras (ILE) - Institute of Foreign Languages\n\n===Contributions to the advancement of science and society===\n* [[D\u00d8 experiment]], by Bruce Hoeneisen, founder and professor of the Physics department at the Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00eda El Polit\u00e9cnico, USFQ.\n* Hosting the First and Second [[World Summit on Evolution]] (called \"The Woodstock of Evolution\"<ref>Shermer, Michael. 27 June 2005.

It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador. It was named after the city of [[Quito]]: San Francisco de Quito, in response to the need of a private [[higher education|higher-education]] institution in Ecuador. It was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in October 1995 and accredited by [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] in May 2001.<ref>[http://www.conesup.net/info_universidades.php?id_univ=1038]. conesup.net.</ref>\n\n===Establishment of the ''Corporaci\u00f3n de Promoci\u00f3n Universitaria''===\nIn 1980, a group of Ecuadorian and international intellectuals and businesspeople, under the leadership of Santiago Gangotena Gonz\u00e1lez, established the non-profit ''Corporaci\u00f3n de Promoci\u00f3n Universitaria'', with the mission to create a private Ecuadorian university. The corporation was legalized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in June 1985 (published in the Official Registry of the Ecuadorian Government in 28 de June 1985).\n\n===Foundation of the University===\nAfter eight years of planning and promotion, the first class of USFQ students started on September 1, 1988, in a manor located on the 12 de Octubre Ave. 1983 and Salazar St.,in the northern area of [[Quito]], with 130 students. The university was recognized by the Ecuadorian government on October 18, 1995, under Executive Decree 3166, published in the Official Registry 809 on October 25, 1995. The statutes of the university were approved by the National Council of High Education [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] on May 18, 2001.\n\n===Creation of the colleges===\nUSFQ is divided among academic colleges ([[Faculty (division)|faculties]]). In 1988, students were distributed among three academic colleges: ''Colegio de Administraci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo'' for business studies, ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'' for applied sciences, and ''Colegio de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Cultura'' for communication, arts and cultural studies. In 1990, USFQ started the ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'' for environmental sciences.\n\nIn 1992, six colleges were established: ''Colegio de Administraci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo'', ''Colegio de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Artes'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'', y ''Colegio de Lenguas''. Subsequently, in 1993, the ''Colegio de Arquitectura'' started, followed in 1994 by the ''Colegio de Agricultura'' and the ''Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud''. In 1997, the ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'' changed its name to ''Colegio de Artes Liberales''.\n\n===Colleges of the university===\nBy 2017, USFQ is divided in 15 academic colleges and institutes spread across three campuses across [[Ecuador]] ([[Quito|Cumbay\u00e1-Quito]], [[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]], and the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]<ref name=\"sobrelausfq\" />):\n* Colegio de Administraci\u00f3n y Econom\u00eda (CADE) - College of Business Administration and Economics\n* Colegio de Arquitectura y Dise\u00f1o Interior (CADI) - College of Architecture and Interior Design\n* Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades  (COCISOH) - College of Social Sciences and Humanities\n* Colegio de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas y Ambientales (COCIBA) - College of Biological and Environmental Sciences\n* Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud (COCSA) - College of Health Science\n* Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00eda (Polit\u00e9cnico) - College of Sciences and Engineering - The Polytechnic\n* Colegio de Comunicaci\u00f3n y Artes Contempor\u00e1neas (COCOA) - College of Communication and Contemporary Arts\n* Colegio de Hospitalidad, Arte Culinario y Turismo (CHAT) - College of Hospitality, Culinary Arts, and Tourism\n* Colegio de Jurisprudencia (JUR)- College of Jurisprudence\n* Colegio de Musica (CoM) - College of Music\n* Academia Regional de Redes CISCO-USFQ - Regional [[CISCO]]-USFQ Academy\n* GAIAS - Galapagos Academic Institute for the Arts and Sciences\n* Instituto Confucio - [[Confucius Institute]]\n* Instituto de Ense\u00f1anza y Aprendizaje (IDEA) - Institute of Teaching and Learning\n* Instituto de Lenguas Extranjeras (ILE) - Institute of Foreign Languages\n\n===Contributions to the advancement of science and society===\n* [[D\u00d8 experiment]], by Bruce Hoeneisen, founder and professor of the Physics department at the Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00eda El Polit\u00e9cnico, USFQ.\n* Hosting the First and Second [[World Summit on Evolution]] (called \"The Woodstock of Evolution\"<ref>Shermer, Michael. 27 June 2005.

The simple, gray pottery allowed them a better tool for cooking and storage. Beans were added to the cultivated diet.  Bows and arrows made hunting easier and thus the acquisition of hides for clothing.  Turkey feathers were woven into blankets and robes.

Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in U, E and L shapes.  The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration.  Towers were built near kivas and likely used for look-outs. Pottery became more versatile, not just for cooking, but now included pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants.  Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams also emerged during this period.<ref>Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980].

This dramatically increased access to unique goods, such as Chacoan style pottery, copper bells, macaw remains, sea shells and raw materials used to create artifacts.  In addition to the integration of new goods into their culture, the extensive trade routes also brought new ideas and people to the region.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n* The Chaco culture had a unique architecture, \"great houses\" which were large, multi-storied and multi-room complexes, with great [[kiva]]s located inside the structure.  More than 225 great houses have been found in the northern Anasazi regions, including the Mesa Verde region.  Great houses built outside of Chaco Canyon were called \"outliers,\" connected back to Chaco Canyon through a network of roads.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n\nUntil this time, most of the people lived in disperse communities of small farmsteads, clustered around community centers which included large buildings for meetings and ceremonies and great [[kiva]]s.  There also appeared to have been storage areas for harvested crops.  The Chacoan cultural influence was reflected in \"great houses\" that began appearing in Mesa Verde region communities starting about 1080, and lasting until 1140 after which point great houses were no longer built in Mesa Verde region settlements.

The simple, gray pottery allowed them a better tool for cooking and storage. Beans were added to the cultivated diet.  Bows and arrows made hunting easier and thus the acquisition of hides for clothing.  Turkey feathers were woven into blankets and robes.

Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in U, E and L shapes.  The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration.  Towers were built near kivas and likely used for look-outs. Pottery became more versatile, not just for cooking, but now included pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants.  Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams also emerged during this period.<ref>Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980].

This dramatically increased access to unique goods, such as Chacoan style pottery, copper bells, macaw remains, sea shells and raw materials used to create artifacts.  In addition to the integration of new goods into their culture, the extensive trade routes also brought new ideas and people to the region.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n* The Chaco culture had a unique architecture, \"great houses\" which were large, multi-storied and multi-room complexes, with great [[kiva]]s located inside the structure.  More than 225 great houses have been found in the northern Anasazi regions, including the Mesa Verde region.  Great houses built outside of Chaco Canyon were called \"outliers,\" connected back to Chaco Canyon through a network of roads.<ref name=CC-PII/>\n\nUntil this time, most of the people lived in disperse communities of small farmsteads, clustered around community centers which included large buildings for meetings and ceremonies and great [[kiva]]s.  There also appeared to have been storage areas for harvested crops.  The Chacoan cultural influence was reflected in \"great houses\" that began appearing in Mesa Verde region communities starting about 1080, and lasting until 1140 after which point great houses were no longer built in Mesa Verde region settlements.
