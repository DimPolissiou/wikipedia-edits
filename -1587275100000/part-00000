Then, after a successful [[onside kick]], [[Marshawn Lynch]] rushed for another touchdown, giving his team its first lead.

Her high-point came with Modi's ''[[Pukar (1939 film)|Pukar]]'' (1939) in which she played the role of Empress [[Nur Jahan]].

She had started her career with ''[[Khoon Ka Khoon]]'' (Hamlet) (1935){{citation needed|date=January 2017}} and went on to make several films with Modi under the Minerva Movietone banner. After acting in films like \"Khan Bahadur\" (1937), ''[[Talaq (1938 film)|Talaq]]'' (Divorce) (1938), ''[[Meetha Zahar]]'' and ''Vasanti'' (1938) she started work in what became known as her most famous film ''Pukar'' in the role of Noor Jahan.

In the inner temple, the Gadiwalla (the Acharya's wife & spiritual leader of the women in the Swaminarayan Sampraday) holds religious assemblies solely for the benefit of the women.

The bottom of the board is divided into 15 slots marked with various [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] amounts; eight of these range from $1 to $100 and remain constant throughout the game, while the others have higher values and increase from round to round. Seven numbered \"drop zones\" are centered at the top of the board (above the center seven slots), from which balls can be dropped into play.\n\nA team of two contestants plays each game, with a potential top prize of $12,374,994.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wall|url=http://www.nbc.com/the-wall?nbc=1|website=NBC.com}}</ref><ref name=\"deadlinePremDate\">{{cite web|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|title=\u2018The Wall\u2019: NBC Sets Premiere Date For Game Show From EPs Chris Hardwick & LeBron James|url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/the-wall-premiere-date-nbc-game-show-lebron-james-chris-hardwick-1201854108/|website=Deadline|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=14 November 2016}}</ref> Green balls dropped on the board will add to the team's bank, while red balls dropped on the board will subtract from it. Throughout the game, the bank has a floor of $0.\n\n===Round 1: Free Fall===\nIn Free Fall, the team is asked a series of five questions, each with two answer choices. As each question is asked, three balls are simultaneously released from drop zones 1, 4, and 7. The team must select one answer and lock it in before the first ball crosses the threshold of a money slot. If the team's answer is correct, the balls turn green and their values are added to the team's bank. If the team answers incorrectly or fails to lock in an answer, the balls turn red and their values are subtracted from the team's bank.\n\nIf the team's bank balance is zero at the end of this round, the game is over and they leave without any winnings. If not, their earnings become part of a guaranteed payout to be offered to them at the end of the game. The highest amount that a team can bank in this round is $375,000.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $25,000, and are arranged as follows:\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $20,000 || $10 || $10,000 || $1 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$25,000''' || $1 || $10,000 || $10 || $20,000 || $100 || $5,000 || $1\n|}\n\n===Round 2===\nAt the start of the second round, the contestants are separated from each other for the remainder of the game. One enters an isolation chamber behind The Wall, while the other remains onstage. A set number of green balls are played simultaneously at the beginning of the round. Three multiple-choice questions are then played, each with three answer choices. The onstage player is shown only the answers to each question, and must decide which zone to use, based on how confident he/she is that the isolated player can answer correctly. The question and answers are then presented to the isolated player. After he/she responds, the ball is dropped from the chosen zone. A correct answer turns the ball green and adds the value of the slot it lands in to the team bank, while a wrong answer turns the ball red and deducts the value. The isolated player is not told which of his/her answers are correct or given any information on the team bank until they are brought out of isolation near the end of the game.\n\nThe onstage player is offered an opportunity to \"Double Up\" on the second question and \"Triple Up\" on the third. These options allow the onstage player to play two or three balls from the selected drop zone instead of one, respectively. After the third question, if the banked total is at least $1 more than the number of green balls played at the start of the round, an equal number of red balls are played simultaneously from the same zones.\n\nIn the first two seasons, two initial green balls were played from different zones chosen by the onstage player, and a team could bank up to $1,999,998. Beginning with the third season, seven initial green balls are played in a \"SuperDrop,\" one from every zone, and a team can bank up to $3,249,993.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $250,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $10,000 || $10 || $25,000 || $1 || $50,000 || $1 || $100,000 || $10 || $125,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$250,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Round 3===\nGameplay proceeds as in Round 2, but each of the three questions now has four answer choices. In addition, four green and four red balls are played at the start and end of the round respectively, and are dropped one at a time, rather than simultaneously. The \"Double Up\" and \"Triple Up\" options are available as before.\n\nThe maximum amount that a team can bank in this round is $9,999,996.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $1,000,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $50,000 || $100 || $100,000 || $10 || $200,000 || $1 || $300,000 || $1 || $400,000 || $10 || $500,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$1,000,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Final Decision===\nAfter the third question in Round 3, the isolated player is sent a contract by the host, and he/she must sign it or tear it up. Signing the contract gives up the team bank in favor of a guaranteed payout, equal to the Free Fall winnings plus an additional $20,000 for every question answered correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. If the isolated player tears up the contract, the team receives their final bank total instead. After the four red balls have dropped in Round 3 and the final bank is calculated (or after the last question if there is less than $5 banked), the isolated player returns to the stage to reveal his/her decision. Only at this point does he/she learn the number of correct answers given, the payout total, and the team's final bank.\n\nThe maximum possible guaranteed payout is $495,000, obtained by scoring $375,000 in Free Fall and answering all questions correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. The maximum possible bank total in the first two seasons is $12,374,994, obtained by answering every question correctly, using every Double Up and Triple Up option, having every green ball drop into the highest-valued slot, and having the six mandatory red balls each drop into a $1 slot. In the third season, the maximum possible total is $13,624,989 due to the number of mandatory green/red balls increasing to 11 each.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Wall'' has received mixed reviews by critics. Jan Chaney of ''Vulture'' dubbed ''The Wall'' as being \"the most stereotypically American game show on television right now\" and \"absurd yet undeniably diverting.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/01/wall-the-most-american-game-show-on-tv.html|title=The Wall Is the Most American Game Show on TV|date=2017-01-03|newspaper=Vulture|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref> Chaney criticized the show for making \"attempts to sell us something new, even though its concept is really based on old ideas [...] mixed up just enough [to] seem fresh\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBethonie Butler of the ''Chicago Tribune'' agreed that \"''The Wall'' looks a lot like the famed Plinko game from CBS\", but qualified that \"originality is relative when it comes to game shows\", remarking on the similarity between popular trivia game shows such as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The bottom of the board is divided into 15 slots marked with various [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] amounts; eight of these range from $1 to $100 and remain constant throughout the game, while the others have higher values and increase from round to round. Seven numbered \"drop zones\" are centered at the top of the board (above the center seven slots), from which balls can be dropped into play.\n\nA team of two contestants plays each game, with a potential top prize of $12,374,994.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wall|url=http://www.nbc.com/the-wall?nbc=1|website=NBC.com}}</ref><ref name=\"deadlinePremDate\">{{cite web|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|title=\u2018The Wall\u2019: NBC Sets Premiere Date For Game Show From EPs Chris Hardwick & LeBron James|url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/the-wall-premiere-date-nbc-game-show-lebron-james-chris-hardwick-1201854108/|website=Deadline|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=14 November 2016}}</ref> Green balls dropped on the board will add to the team's bank, while red balls dropped on the board will subtract from it. Throughout the game, the bank has a floor of $0.\n\n===Round 1: Free Fall===\nIn Free Fall, the team is asked a series of five questions, each with two answer choices. As each question is asked, three balls are simultaneously released from drop zones 1, 4, and 7. The team must select one answer and lock it in before the first ball crosses the threshold of a money slot. If the team's answer is correct, the balls turn green and their values are added to the team's bank. If the team answers incorrectly or fails to lock in an answer, the balls turn red and their values are subtracted from the team's bank.\n\nIf the team's bank balance is zero at the end of this round, the game is over and they leave without any winnings. If not, their earnings become part of a guaranteed payout to be offered to them at the end of the game. The highest amount that a team can bank in this round is $375,000.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $25,000, and are arranged as follows:\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $20,000 || $10 || $10,000 || $1 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$25,000''' || $1 || $10,000 || $10 || $20,000 || $100 || $5,000 || $1\n|}\n\n===Round 2===\nAt the start of the second round, the contestants are separated from each other for the remainder of the game. One enters an isolation chamber behind The Wall, while the other remains onstage. A set number of green balls are played simultaneously at the beginning of the round. Three multiple-choice questions are then played, each with three answer choices. The onstage player is shown only the answers to each question, and must decide which zone to use, based on how confident he/she is that the isolated player can answer correctly. The question and answers are then presented to the isolated player. After he/she responds, the ball is dropped from the chosen zone. A correct answer turns the ball green and adds the value of the slot it lands in to the team bank, while a wrong answer turns the ball red and deducts the value. The isolated player is not told which of his/her answers are correct or given any information on the team bank until they are brought out of isolation near the end of the game.\n\nThe onstage player is offered an opportunity to \"Double Up\" on the second question and \"Triple Up\" on the third. These options allow the onstage player to play two or three balls from the selected drop zone instead of one, respectively. After the third question, if the banked total is at least $1 more than the number of green balls played at the start of the round, an equal number of red balls are played simultaneously from the same zones.\n\nIn the first two seasons, two initial green balls were played from different zones chosen by the onstage player, and a team could bank up to $1,999,998. Beginning with the third season, seven initial green balls are played in a \"SuperDrop,\" one from every zone, and a team can bank up to $3,249,993.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $250,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $5,000 || $100 || $10,000 || $10 || $25,000 || $1 || $50,000 || $1 || $100,000 || $10 || $125,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$250,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Round 3===\nGameplay proceeds as in Round 2, but each of the three questions now has four answer choices. In addition, four green and four red balls are played at the start and end of the round respectively, and are dropped one at a time, rather than simultaneously. The \"Double Up\" and \"Triple Up\" options are available as before.\n\nThe maximum amount that a team can bank in this round is $9,999,996.\n\nThe values on the board range from $1 to $1,000,000, and are arranged as follows:\n\n{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:50%;\"\n| $1 || $50,000 || $100 || $100,000 || $10 || $200,000 || $1 || $300,000 || $1 || $400,000 || $10 || $500,000 || $100 ||style=\"background:gold\"| '''$1,000,000'''|| $1\n|}\n\n===Final Decision===\nAfter the third question in Round 3, the isolated player is sent a contract by the host, and he/she must sign it or tear it up. Signing the contract gives up the team bank in favor of a guaranteed payout, equal to the Free Fall winnings plus an additional $20,000 for every question answered correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. If the isolated player tears up the contract, the team receives their final bank total instead. After the four red balls have dropped in Round 3 and the final bank is calculated (or after the last question if there is less than $5 banked), the isolated player returns to the stage to reveal his/her decision. Only at this point does he/she learn the number of correct answers given, the payout total, and the team's final bank.\n\nThe maximum possible guaranteed payout is $495,000, obtained by scoring $375,000 in Free Fall and answering all questions correctly in Rounds 2 and 3. The maximum possible bank total in the first two seasons is $12,374,994, obtained by answering every question correctly, using every Double Up and Triple Up option, having every green ball drop into the highest-valued slot, and having the six mandatory red balls each drop into a $1 slot. In the third season, the maximum possible total is $13,624,989 due to the number of mandatory green/red balls increasing to 11 each.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Wall'' has received mixed reviews by critics. Jan Chaney of ''Vulture'' dubbed ''The Wall'' as being \"the most stereotypically American game show on television right now\" and \"absurd yet undeniably diverting.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/01/wall-the-most-american-game-show-on-tv.html|title=The Wall Is the Most American Game Show on TV|date=2017-01-03|newspaper=Vulture|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref> Chaney criticized the show for making \"attempts to sell us something new, even though its concept is really based on old ideas [...] mixed up just enough [to] seem fresh\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBethonie Butler of the ''Chicago Tribune'' agreed that \"''The Wall'' looks a lot like the famed Plinko game from CBS\", but qualified that \"originality is relative when it comes to game shows\", remarking on the similarity between popular trivia game shows such as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
