The film tells the story of Lieutenant Chris Burnett, an American [[naval flight officer]] who is shot down over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and uncovers [[Bosnian genocide|genocide]] during the [[Bosnian War]]. Meanwhile, his commanding officer is struggling to gain approval to launch a [[combat search and rescue]] mission to save Burnett. The plot is loosely based on the 1995 [[Mrkonji\u0107 Grad incident]] that occurred during the war.<ref name=EntertainmentWeekly>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,338983,00.html |title=Plane Truth: Downed airman sues over \"Behind Enemy Lines\"|date=August 20, 2002| last =Susman |first = Gary|accessdate=August 22, 2009 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\nReleased on November 30, 2001, ''Behind Enemy Lines'' received generally negative reviews from critics. However, it was a considerable box office success, taking in nearly $92 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. The film was followed by three [[direct-to-video]] sequels, ''[[Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil]]'', ''[[Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia]]'', and ''[[SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines]]'', with the third film being co-produced by [[WWE Studios]]. None of these sequels feature the cast and crew of the original.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a group of [[Serbian Army]] [[soldiers]] burying [[Bosnian Muslim]] civilians in [[mass graves]] that they massacred during the [[Bosnian War]]. During the Bosnian War, United States Navy flight officer Lieutenant Chris Burnett and pilot Lieutenant Jeremy Stackhouse, who are stationed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70)|USS ''Carl Vinson'']] in the [[Adriatic Sea]], are assigned an [[aerial reconnaissance]] mission by their commanding officer, Admiral Reigart. The mission goes smoothly until they spot suspicious activity in the [[demilitarized zone]] where NATO aircraft and the warring factions are prohibited from engaging in military activity. Burnett persuades Stackhouse to fly their [[Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornet]] off-course to get a close look and photograph the target. They are unaware that they photographed mass graves, and Serb paramilitaries see the jet. The local [[Republika Srpska (1992\u201395)|Bosnian Serb]] paramilitary commander, General Miroslav Lokar, is conducting a secret [[genocide|genocidal]] campaign against the local [[Bosniak]] population. Not wanting the mass graves to be discovered, Lokar orders the jet be shot down.\n\nDespite trying to outmaneuver the missiles fired at them, their jet is hit and both men are forced to eject. Shortly after touching ground, a Serb patrol finds an injured Stackhouse and interrogate him. Stackhouse is then executed by Sasha, one of Lokar's right-hand men. Burnett, who was observing the Serbs' interrogation of Stackhouse from a hill, flees the area, but exposes his location. Wanting Burnett dead as well, Lokar orders both his deputy, Colonel Bazda, and Sasha to find him. After Burnett contacts Reigart for help, he orders Burnett to move to a certain location in order to be extracted. However, Reigart is forced to stand down after Admiral Piquet, the commander of NATO naval forces in the region, warns him that rescuing Burnett in the demilitarized zone risks derailing the peace process. When Burnett reaches the extraction point, Reigart informs him that he must move to another location miles outside of the demilitarized zone in order to be rescued.\n\nImmediately after being informed, Burnett sees a Serb patrol, led by Bazda, looking for him. Running from them, he falls into the mass grave that he and Stackhouse had photographed and hides under a dead body. When the patrol is out of sight, he continues to run. On his way to the new extraction point, Burnett encounters a group of Bosniak guerrillas in a pickup truck who offer him a ride. The guerrillas inform Burnett that they are heading to Ha\u010d, which is supposedly a safe haven but turns out to be a war zone. During the battle, Serb troops believe that they have found Burnett's body, but Sasha realizes that Burnett had switched uniforms with a dead Serb guerrilla and escaped Ha\u010d.\n\nThe Serbs turn the situation to their advantage, presenting the corpse wearing Burnett's uniform to the media, and saying he was killed by guerrillas. The ruse works and a mission to rescue Burnett is aborted. However, Burnett notices an angel statue near where his ejection seat landed. He returns to his seat and activates the rescue beacon. Though the carrier group notices his signal and positively identifies him, Burnett has also alerted the Serbs to his location.\n\nKnowing he risks being relieved of command, Reigart prepares a task force to rescue Burnett in open defiance of Piquet's orders. Meanwhile, Bazda and Sasha are ordered by Lokar to find Burnett and kill him, but on their way, Bazda steps on a landmine and Sasha abandons him to his fate. The mine eventually explodes, alerting Burnett that someone is following him. After Sasha finds the ejection seat, Burnett ambushes him and the two men engage in hand-to-hand combat until Burnett fatally stabs Sasha. Immediately thereafter, Lokar arrives with armored vehicles and infantry who open fire on Burnett. Reigart's task force arrives and holds off Lokar's forces. After retrieving the hard drive containing the photos of the mass graves, Burnett is successfully rescued.\n\nThe footage Burnett retrieved leads to the arrest and conviction of Lokar for war crimes including genocide, while Reigart's actions result in him being relieved of command and his eventual retirement. Burnett continues his career in the Navy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}<!-- List in credits order; do not change -->\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Burnett\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Reigart\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as Stackhouse\n* [[Charles Malik Whitfield]] as Rodway\n* [[David Keith]] as O'Malley\n* [[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]] as Lokar\n* [[Joaquim de Almeida]] as Piquet\n* [[Vladimir Mashkov]] as Sasha \"Tracker\" \n* [[Eyal Podell]] as Petty Officer Kennedy\n* [[Geoff Pierson|Geoffrey Pierson]] as Admiral Donnelly\n* [[Tarik Filipovi\u0107]] as Serbian soldier \n* Marko Igonda as Bazda\n* Kamil Koll\u00e1rik as Babi\u0107\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Slovakia]], plus [[Koliba Studios]], [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe {{USS|Carl Vinson}} was the aircraft carrier featured in the film.

He managed to survive for six days before being rescued by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]. O'Grady, who later became a children's author and motivational speaker, filed suit against both the producers of ''Behind Enemy Lines'' as well as ''Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O\u2019Grady Story'', a 1998 documentary that [[Discovery Channel]] aired on his experience, for [[defamation]] of character, accusing the film's producers of invasion of privacy through the misappropriation of his name, likeness and identity, false representation and false advertising, and contending that those involved in both works produced them without his permission, and that the commercial value of his name was damaged by them. O'Grady's complaint indicated that among other things, he was troubled by the disobedience and profanity exhibited by the feature film's main character. O'Grady also accused Fox of using the documentary to promote the feature film and making a film about his ordeal without his permission. The film's characters and events differ from O'Grady's experience; he never entered populated areas, nor did he interact with civilians, and did not engage in direct combat with enemy soldiers. Also, O'Grady never flew an F/A-18F but rather an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]].<ref name=EntertainmentWeekly/><ref>{{cite news|title=Pilot sues over Bosnian escape film|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London, England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2205560.stm|date=August 20, 2002|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}</ref> The case was settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web|first=Sarah|last=Hall|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/46666/behind-enemy-lines-suit-settled |title=Behind Enemy Lines Suit Settled |website=[[E!

The case was'' United States v. Tramunti.''  Carmine Tramunti and thirty others were charged with a massive conspiracy to violate the federal narcotics laws in connection with many sales of heroin. Several defendants pleaded guilty; some cooperated and testified; three became fugitives prior to trial; one was murdered before trial; another, who was on bail, fell down a flight of stairs and fractured his skull during the trial; and, an attorney for another of the defendants died suddenly during the trial. With the exception of these events, it was a normal criminal trial. \"Through it all, the young and relatively inexperienced Judge Duffy presided with poise, calm and good grace.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the fall of 1985, Judge Duffy began a complicated multi-defendant trial involving the then-alleged leader and other members of the Gambino organized crime family. In an insightful pre-trial decision, he severed many defendants in the case, pointing out that if the trial were held on the original indictment, the case would have been much too unwieldy and cumbersome and would have lasted more than a year.  But even with the severance, the Castellano trial was an extremely difficult case to manage and on December 16, 1985, Paul Castellano, the alleged Gambino leader, and his bodyguard were gunned down outside of Sparks Steak House on East Forty-Sixth Street in Manhattan.\tHeadlines followed; mistrial motions ensued; and through it all, an older and more experienced Judge Duffy presided with the same poise, calm and good grace he exhibited with Tramunti.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuffy also presided over the trial and conviction of the four principal perpetrators of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. In a recent book about the trial, \"Defending Mohammad: Justice on Trial,\" Robert E. Precht, a defense attorney for Mohammad Salameh (who rented the yellow Ryder van that carried the explosives), accuses Judge Duffy of bias and of \"essentially convicting his client before the trial ended.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Defense Lawyer Revisits Terrorism Trial With a Critical Eye |first=Benjamin |last=Weiser |work=New York Times |date=July 5, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/05/nyregion/defense-lawyer-revisits-terrorism-trial-with-a-critical-eye.html }}</ref> Other defense lawyers have applauded the Judge's fair handling of the case and after the trial, the New York Post ran a headline calling him the \"Avenger.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe also presided over the trial of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the [[Bojinka plot]] (the Manilla Bombing Conspiracy), to hijack planes bound for the west coast of the United States and fly them into the Pacific Ocean on a coordinated schedule. In the words of the  Second Circuit, \"Judge Duffy carefully, impartially, and commendably conducted the two lengthy and extraordinarily complex trials from which these appeals were taken.

Judge Duffy has been criticized for his opinion in ''Grand Upright v. Warner'', not because the decision was wrong, but because Judge Duffy begins his opinion with the biblical admonition \u2013 \"thou shalt not steal\" and later referred the defendant to the U.S. Attorney suggesting criminal charges.

The case was'' United States v. Tramunti.''  Carmine Tramunti and thirty others were charged with a massive conspiracy to violate the federal narcotics laws in connection with many sales of heroin. Several defendants pleaded guilty; some cooperated and testified; three became fugitives prior to trial; one was murdered before trial; another, who was on bail, fell down a flight of stairs and fractured his skull during the trial; and, an attorney for another of the defendants died suddenly during the trial. With the exception of these events, it was a normal criminal trial. \"Through it all, the young and relatively inexperienced Judge Duffy presided with poise, calm and good grace.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the fall of 1985, Judge Duffy began a complicated multi-defendant trial involving the then-alleged leader and other members of the Gambino organized crime family. In an insightful pre-trial decision, he severed many defendants in the case, pointing out that if the trial were held on the original indictment, the case would have been much too unwieldy and cumbersome and would have lasted more than a year.  But even with the severance, the Castellano trial was an extremely difficult case to manage and on December 16, 1985, Paul Castellano, the alleged Gambino leader, and his bodyguard were gunned down outside of Sparks Steak House on East Forty-Sixth Street in Manhattan.\tHeadlines followed; mistrial motions ensued; and through it all, an older and more experienced Judge Duffy presided with the same poise, calm and good grace he exhibited with Tramunti.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuffy also presided over the trial and conviction of the four principal perpetrators of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. In a recent book about the trial, \"Defending Mohammad: Justice on Trial,\" Robert E. Precht, a defense attorney for Mohammad Salameh (who rented the yellow Ryder van that carried the explosives), accuses Judge Duffy of bias and of \"essentially convicting his client before the trial ended.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Defense Lawyer Revisits Terrorism Trial With a Critical Eye |first=Benjamin |last=Weiser |work=New York Times |date=July 5, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/05/nyregion/defense-lawyer-revisits-terrorism-trial-with-a-critical-eye.html }}</ref> Other defense lawyers have applauded the Judge's fair handling of the case and after the trial, the New York Post ran a headline calling him the \"Avenger.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe also presided over the trial of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the [[Bojinka plot]] (the Manilla Bombing Conspiracy), to hijack planes bound for the west coast of the United States and fly them into the Pacific Ocean on a coordinated schedule. In the words of the  Second Circuit, \"Judge Duffy carefully, impartially, and commendably conducted the two lengthy and extraordinarily complex trials from which these appeals were taken.

Judge Duffy has been criticized for his opinion in ''Grand Upright v. Warner'', not because the decision was wrong, but because Judge Duffy begins his opinion with the biblical admonition \u2013 \"thou shalt not steal\" and later referred the defendant to the U.S. Attorney suggesting criminal charges.

The bullion was being transported to The United States and members of the British Commonwealth to pay for war materials.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{citeweb|title=Treasure hunt to recover \u00a34.5billion worth of British gold trapped in merchant ships torpedoed by Nazis|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/18/treasure-hunt-recover-45billion-worth-british-gold-trapped-merchant/|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe company estimates that some 2000 tons of precious metals (mainly gold and silver bullion) was sunk from ships that mainly left from Glasgow and Liverpool.<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\n==Retrieval==\nThe company has not revealed details of which port they are based for security reasons.

From this ship the crew will lower submersibles (to depths of 5,500m) to investigate the ships and prepare for the next stage of retrieving the precious metals. The cost of the first expedition is estimated at \u00a315 million.<ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\nAs the bullion remains in the ownership of the British Government the company will need to negotiate how the retrieved bullion is brough back to the UK.<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> Since 1914 all British warships sunk are classified as both war graves and sovereign territory, merchant vessel wrecks however do not have the same legal protection.<ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\n==Financial backing==\nBritannia's Gold Ltd is backed by private investment but it is also crowd-sourcing an initial \u00a38 million to conduct the first surveys.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Team of salvage experts hoping to recover billions of pounds worth of gold from deep-sea shipwrecks are looking for investors|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-4527842/Investors-join-salvage-hunt-4-5bn-gold.html|website=[[This is Money]]|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Treasure hunting (marine)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://britanniasgold.com/ Britannia's Gold] (Official Web site)\n", "name_user": "Bearcat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:uncategorized", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britannia%27s_Gold_Ltd"}
