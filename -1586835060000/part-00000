It is the most populated local council in the United Kingdom (excluding counties) with, following a reorganisation of boundaries in June 2004, 120 [[List of Birmingham City councillors|Birmingham City councillors]] representing over one million people, in 40 [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]].<ref name=\"wards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/wards|title=Birmingham City Council: Wards|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> This means that Birmingham is technically the largest city in the United Kingdom. The council headquarters are at the [[Council House, Birmingham|Council House]] in the city centre. The council is responsible for running nearly all local services, with the exception of those run by [[Joint-board|joint boards]]. The provision of certain services has in recent years been devolved to several council constituencies,<ref name=\"constituencies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/constituencies|title=Birmingham City Council: Constituencies|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> which each have a [[constituency committee]] made up of councillors from that district.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham.jpg|thumb|Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham, used after 1838 and until 1889]]\n\nThe original [[Charter of Incorporation]], dated 31 October 1838, was received in Birmingham on 1 November, then read in the [[Birmingham Town Hall|Town Hall]] on 5 November with elections for the first Town Council being held on 26 December. Sixteen Aldermen and 48 Councillors were elected and the Borough was divided into 13 wards. [[William Scholefield]] became the first Mayor and William Redfern was appointed as Town Clerk.\n\nIt was not until 14 January 1889 that another Charter conferred the rank of City on Birmingham. On 9 November 1891, the districts of [[Balsall Heath]], [[Harborne]], [[Saltley]] and [[Little Bromwich]] were absorbed into the City. The dignity of a [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham|Lord Mayor]] was conferred in 1896 and Sir James Smith Kt was appointed as the City's first Lord Mayor on 3 June 1896. The parish of [[Quinton, Birmingham|Quinton]] became part of Birmingham on 9 November 1909 and two years later, under what was termed 'The Greater Birmingham Scheme', the Boroughs of [[Aston Manor]], the [[Urban District of Handsworth]] and [[Urban District of Erdington|of Erdington]], part of the [[Urban District of Kings Norton and Northfield]] and the [[Rural District of Yardley]] were all incorporated. Such was the expansion involved that the Council Chamber, originally designed to accommodate 80 members, had to be modified to seat the representatives of the new wards. Further additions occurred on 1 April 1928 (part of the [[Urban District of Perry Barr]]) and 1 April 1931 (parts of the Parishes of [[Solihull]], [[Castle Bromwich]], [[Minworth]] and [[Sheldon, West Midlands|Sheldon]]). By 1972, there were 39 Wards each represented by an Alderman and 3 Councillors, a total of 156 Members.\n\nA major national re-organisation of local government was implemented in 1974 and saw the City of Birmingham being combined with the [[Borough of Sutton Coldfield]] to form the new Birmingham District Council consisting of 42 Wards each with 3 elected Councillors (in 1982 the number of Wards was reduced to 39). On 1 July 1986, the title was changed to Birmingham City Council. Part of [[Bromsgrove District]] known as [[Frankley and Kitwell Estates]] were added to the City on 1 April 1995. A review of the Ward boundaries on 10 June 2004 resulted in an increase from 39 Wards to 40 Wards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=SystemAdmin%2FCFPageLayout&cid=1223092734590&packedargs=website%3D4&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FCFWrapper&rendermode=Live |title=History of the Council |publisher=Birmingham.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Women ===\n\nThe first woman elected  to the council, on 1 November 1911, was [[Ellen Pinsent]].<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite web|url=https://theironroom.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/my-whole-time-is-given-to-the-service-of-my-fellow-citizens-the-first-women-elected-to-birmingham-city-council/|title=\u2018My whole time is given to the service of my fellow citizens\u2019 \u2013 the first women elected to Birmingham City Council|last=Roberts|first=Sian|date=4 March 2015|publisher=[[Library of Birmingham]]|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> She represented the Edgbaston Ward as a [[Liberal Unionist]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She had earlier been co-opted as a member of the council's Education Committee and served as Chairman of the Special School Sub-Committee.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She stood down from the council in October 1913 upon appointment as Commissioner for the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nPinsent's time on the council overlapped with that of [[Margaret Frances Pugh]], who was elected on 22 November 1911 to serve the in North Erdington ward.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She resigned in November 1913.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nBirmingham's third woman councillor, [[Clara Martineau]], was elected on 14 October 1913 in the Edgbaston ward, and served until 1932, when she died, aged 57.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> Her father was former Mayor Sir [[Thomas Martineau]], Lord Mayor [[Ernest Martineau]] was her brother, and Alderman Sir [[George Kenrick]] was her uncle.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nMary E.

They lost overall control in 2003 but continued to run the council as a minority administration for the following year. At the election of 10 June 2004, the 121 seats were divided between the Labour, (53 councillors), [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (39) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (28) parties. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat groups then formed a governing coalition, moving Labour into opposition.\n\nIn 2005, [[Richard Mawrey]] QC (as an election commissioner) ruled invalid Birmingham City Council elections in two wards, Aston and Bordesley Green, held the year before, and required re-votes. He blamed most of the [[electoral fraud]] on [[absentee ballot]] manipulation, and implicated the returning officer and six Labour councillors. By-elections and defections in 2005 altered the distribution of seats within the council with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] holding 46 seats, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] holding 40, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] holding 30, the [[People's Justice Party (UK)|People's Justice Party]] holding 2 and independent councillors holding a further 2.\n\nIn 2006, the People's Justice Party disbanded, with their two councillors joining the Liberal Democrats, and Councillor Ann Holtom defected from Labour to the Liberal Democrats. In the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 local elections]] the [[British National Party]] initially gained a seat, but it soon transpired their candidate's election had been caused by a counting error and the result was subsequently overturned in favour of the previously third-placed Labour party candidate following an election petition.<ref name=\"Post-2006-07-27\">{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Jonathan|date=27 July 2006|title=BNP never won seat on city council|journal=Birmingham Post|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/news/tm_objectid=17458343&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=bnp-never-won-seat-on-city-council-name_page.html |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[2008 Birmingham Council election|local elections on 1 May 2008]], there remained no overall control, with the 120 seats divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (49 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (36), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (32) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\">[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/elections Birmingham City Council election service] Birmingham.gov.uk</ref> After the 2010 elections the seats were divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (45 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (41), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (31) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\"/> The Conservatives' main local strongholds are in the [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Edgbaston]] constituencies.

It is the most populated local council in the United Kingdom (excluding counties) with, following a reorganisation of boundaries in June 2004, 120 [[List of Birmingham City councillors|Birmingham City councillors]] representing over one million people, in 40 [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]].<ref name=\"wards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/wards|title=Birmingham City Council: Wards|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> This means that Birmingham is technically the largest city in the United Kingdom. The council headquarters are at the [[Council House, Birmingham|Council House]] in the city centre. The council is responsible for running nearly all local services, with the exception of those run by [[Joint-board|joint boards]]. The provision of certain services has in recent years been devolved to several council constituencies,<ref name=\"constituencies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/constituencies|title=Birmingham City Council: Constituencies|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> which each have a [[constituency committee]] made up of councillors from that district.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham.jpg|thumb|Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham, used after 1838 and until 1889]]\n\nThe original [[Charter of Incorporation]], dated 31 October 1838, was received in Birmingham on 1 November, then read in the [[Birmingham Town Hall|Town Hall]] on 5 November with elections for the first Town Council being held on 26 December. Sixteen Aldermen and 48 Councillors were elected and the Borough was divided into 13 wards. [[William Scholefield]] became the first Mayor and William Redfern was appointed as Town Clerk.\n\nIt was not until 14 January 1889 that another Charter conferred the rank of City on Birmingham. On 9 November 1891, the districts of [[Balsall Heath]], [[Harborne]], [[Saltley]] and [[Little Bromwich]] were absorbed into the City. The dignity of a [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham|Lord Mayor]] was conferred in 1896 and Sir James Smith Kt was appointed as the City's first Lord Mayor on 3 June 1896. The parish of [[Quinton, Birmingham|Quinton]] became part of Birmingham on 9 November 1909 and two years later, under what was termed 'The Greater Birmingham Scheme', the Boroughs of [[Aston Manor]], the [[Urban District of Handsworth]] and [[Urban District of Erdington|of Erdington]], part of the [[Urban District of Kings Norton and Northfield]] and the [[Rural District of Yardley]] were all incorporated. Such was the expansion involved that the Council Chamber, originally designed to accommodate 80 members, had to be modified to seat the representatives of the new wards. Further additions occurred on 1 April 1928 (part of the [[Urban District of Perry Barr]]) and 1 April 1931 (parts of the Parishes of [[Solihull]], [[Castle Bromwich]], [[Minworth]] and [[Sheldon, West Midlands|Sheldon]]). By 1972, there were 39 Wards each represented by an Alderman and 3 Councillors, a total of 156 Members.\n\nA major national re-organisation of local government was implemented in 1974 and saw the City of Birmingham being combined with the [[Borough of Sutton Coldfield]] to form the new Birmingham District Council consisting of 42 Wards each with 3 elected Councillors (in 1982 the number of Wards was reduced to 39). On 1 July 1986, the title was changed to Birmingham City Council. Part of [[Bromsgrove District]] known as [[Frankley and Kitwell Estates]] were added to the City on 1 April 1995. A review of the Ward boundaries on 10 June 2004 resulted in an increase from 39 Wards to 40 Wards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=SystemAdmin%2FCFPageLayout&cid=1223092734590&packedargs=website%3D4&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FCFWrapper&rendermode=Live |title=History of the Council |publisher=Birmingham.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Women ===\n\nThe first woman elected  to the council, on 1 November 1911, was [[Ellen Pinsent]].<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite web|url=https://theironroom.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/my-whole-time-is-given-to-the-service-of-my-fellow-citizens-the-first-women-elected-to-birmingham-city-council/|title=\u2018My whole time is given to the service of my fellow citizens\u2019 \u2013 the first women elected to Birmingham City Council|last=Roberts|first=Sian|date=4 March 2015|publisher=[[Library of Birmingham]]|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> She represented the Edgbaston Ward as a [[Liberal Unionist]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She had earlier been co-opted as a member of the council's Education Committee and served as Chairman of the Special School Sub-Committee.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She stood down from the council in October 1913 upon appointment as Commissioner for the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nPinsent's time on the council overlapped with that of [[Margaret Frances Pugh]], who was elected on 22 November 1911 to serve the in North Erdington ward.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She resigned in November 1913.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nBirmingham's third woman councillor, [[Clara Martineau]], was elected on 14 October 1913 in the Edgbaston ward, and served until 1932, when she died, aged 57.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> Her father was former Mayor Sir [[Thomas Martineau]], Lord Mayor [[Ernest Martineau]] was her brother, and Alderman Sir [[George Kenrick]] was her uncle.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nMary E.

They lost overall control in 2003 but continued to run the council as a minority administration for the following year. At the election of 10 June 2004, the 121 seats were divided between the Labour, (53 councillors), [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (39) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (28) parties. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat groups then formed a governing coalition, moving Labour into opposition.\n\nIn 2005, [[Richard Mawrey]] QC (as an election commissioner) ruled invalid Birmingham City Council elections in two wards, Aston and Bordesley Green, held the year before, and required re-votes. He blamed most of the [[electoral fraud]] on [[absentee ballot]] manipulation, and implicated the returning officer and six Labour councillors. By-elections and defections in 2005 altered the distribution of seats within the council with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] holding 46 seats, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] holding 40, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] holding 30, the [[People's Justice Party (UK)|People's Justice Party]] holding 2 and independent councillors holding a further 2.\n\nIn 2006, the People's Justice Party disbanded, with their two councillors joining the Liberal Democrats, and Councillor Ann Holtom defected from Labour to the Liberal Democrats. In the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 local elections]] the [[British National Party]] initially gained a seat, but it soon transpired their candidate's election had been caused by a counting error and the result was subsequently overturned in favour of the previously third-placed Labour party candidate following an election petition.<ref name=\"Post-2006-07-27\">{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Jonathan|date=27 July 2006|title=BNP never won seat on city council|journal=Birmingham Post|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/news/tm_objectid=17458343&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=bnp-never-won-seat-on-city-council-name_page.html |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[2008 Birmingham Council election|local elections on 1 May 2008]], there remained no overall control, with the 120 seats divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (49 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (36), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (32) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\">[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/elections Birmingham City Council election service] Birmingham.gov.uk</ref> After the 2010 elections the seats were divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (45 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (41), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (31) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\"/> The Conservatives' main local strongholds are in the [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Edgbaston]] constituencies.

Born in [[Cern\u0103u\u0163i]], [[Romania]], Laron is a professor emeritus at [[Tel Aviv University]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ghresearchsociety.org/grs%20honorary%20members.htm#Zvi_Laron | title=The Growth Hormone Research Society | publisher=The Growth Hormone Research Society | accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref>\nIn 1966, he described the type of [[dwarfism]] later called [[Laron syndrome]]. His research opened the way to the treatment of many cases of growth hormone disorders. He was the first to introduce the multidisciplinary treatment for juvenile diabetes.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family background and childhood===\nLaron was born on February 7, 1927, to a Jewish family in the [[Bukovina|Bukovinian]] city of Cern\u0103u\u0163i (Chernivtsi), then in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (now in [[Ukraine]]). At the age of 6, he moved with his family to another Bukovinian town, [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]]. Following the June 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the USSR by Nazi Germany]], Romania allied itself with [[Nazi Germany]] and regained Northern Bukovina (which had been [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annexed by the USSR]] in 1940), the 14 years old child and his family were deported to the concentration camps of [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]]. There he had the chance to survive as a worker in a factory, which was founded in [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Mogilev]] by his uncle, Siegfried Sami Jagendorf (1885\u20131970), in order to save as many Jewish deportees as possible. Accordingly, Laron became a licensed iron [[turning|turner]].\n\n===Studies in Romania and Israel===\nAfter the end of the war, Laron was able to complete his high school studies and in 1945 he commenced his studies in [[medicine]] at the newly founded Medical School (Institutul medico-farmaceutic) in the town of [[Timi\u0219oara]], in western Romania.\nHe was an active member of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] students movement \"Hasmonea\", and left Romania in 1947 in order to emigrate illegally to [[Eretz Israel]], then [[Mandatory Palestine]]. The ship of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe, \"Pan York\" (nicknamed in Hebrew \"Kibbutz Galuyot\") was captured in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] by the [[Royal Navy|British navy]] and its passengers, including Laron, were deported to internment camps in [[Cyprus]]. After the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|proclamation]] of the [[State of Israel]] in May 1948, Laron was freed and allowed to enter the country. After his arrival, he joined the army and served in the  \"Dajani\" and [[Tel Hashomer]]'s hospitals. In 1952, he graduated with MD from the [[Hadassah Hospital]] [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] [[Medical School]], [[Jerusalem]].

His research opened the way to the treatment of many cases of growth hormone disorders. He was the first to introduce the multidisciplinary treatment for juvenile diabetes.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family background and childhood===\nLaron was born on February 7, 1927, to a Jewish family in the [[Bukovina|Bukovinian]] city of Cern\u0103u\u0163i (Chernivtsi), then in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (now in [[Ukraine]]). At the age of 6, he moved with his family to another Bukovinian town, [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]]. Following the June 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the USSR by Nazi Germany]], Romania allied itself with [[Nazi Germany]] and regained Northern Bukovina (which had been [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annexed by the USSR]] in 1940), the 14 years old child and his family were deported to the concentration camps of [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]]. There he had the chance to survive as a worker in a factory, which was founded in [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Mogilev]] by his uncle, Siegfried Sami Jagendorf (1885\u20131970), in order to save as many Jewish deportees as possible. Accordingly, Laron became a licensed iron [[turning|turner]].\n\n===Studies in Romania and Israel===\nAfter the end of the war, Laron was able to complete his high school studies and in 1945 he commenced his studies in [[medicine]] at the newly founded Medical School (Institutul medico-farmaceutic) in the town of [[Timi\u0219oara]], in western Romania.\nHe was an active member of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] students movement \"Hasmonea\", and left Romania in 1947 in order to emigrate illegally to [[Eretz Israel]], then [[Mandatory Palestine]]. The ship of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe, \"Pan York\" (nicknamed in Hebrew \"Kibbutz Galuyot\") was captured in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] by the [[Royal Navy|British navy]] and its passengers, including Laron, were deported to internment camps in [[Cyprus]]. After the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|proclamation]] of the [[State of Israel]] in May 1948, Laron was freed and allowed to enter the country. After his arrival, he joined the army and served in the  \"Dajani\" and [[Tel Hashomer]]'s hospitals. In 1952, he graduated with MD from the [[Hadassah Hospital]] [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] [[Medical School]], [[Jerusalem]]. He then did his internship at [[Rambam Hospital]] in [[Haifa]]. During 1954\u20131957, he was a research and clinical fellow in paediatrics at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and [[Harvard Medical School]] [[Boston]], and at the Children's Hospital in [[Pittsburgh]], while his fellowships was focalized especially on childhood endocrinology.\n\n===Work as endocrinologist in Israel===\nEnd of 1957, Laron returned to Israel and joined [[Andr\u00e9 de Vries]] in founding the pediatric endocrinological clinic and research in Israel. In 1958 he was the founder of the Institute for Pediatric and Adolescent Endocrinology at the [[Rabin Medical Center|Beilinson Medical Center]] in [[Petah Tikva]], affiliated to Tel Aviv University, and led it until 1992.\nLaron was one of the first members of the teaching staff of the School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University and had a leading role in elaborating the pediatric teaching program at that institution.\nFrom 1983 to 1997 Laron was Incumbent of the Irene and Nicholas Marsh Chair in Endocrinology and Juvenile Diabetes, [[Sackler Faculty of Medicine]], Tel Aviv University.\nHe also founded the All-Country Center for Juvenile Diabetes and an endocrinological laboratory aimed to develop new methods of detecting hormones in blood. This laboratory worked in the frame of the Felsenstein Institute of Research.\n\nSince 1998 Laron has been [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[Pediatric endocrinology|Pediatric Endocrinology]], Tel Aviv University and Director of [[Endocrinology]] and [[Diabetes]] Research Unit, [[Schneider Children's Medical Center|Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel]].\n\nIn 1966 together with A.
