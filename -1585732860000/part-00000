The monastery's narthex, called \"the Paradise\", is the oldest example of [[Gothic architecture]] in [[Germany]].\n\nIt is part of the [[Northern Black Forest]] Monastery Route with [[Alpirsbach Abbey|Alpirsbach]], [[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]], and {{ill|Reuthin Abbey|de|Kloster Reuthin|lt=Reuthin}} monasteries.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterroute Nordschwarzwald}}\n\nThe complex, surrounded by turreted walls and a tower gate, today houses the Maulbronn town hall and other administrative offices, a police station, and several restaurants. The monastery itself contains an [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|Evangelical seminary]] in the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberger tradition]] and a boarding school.\n\nAn average of 235,000 persons visit the monastery per annum.{{sfn|City of Maulbronn: Stadtgeschichte Maulbronn}}\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name=''Reichskloster Maulbronn''\n|conventional_long_name=Imperial Monastery of Maulbronn\n|status=Imperial Abbey\n|empire=Holy Roman Empire\n|event_start=Founded as [[Imperial abbey]]\n|date_start=1147\n|event1=Placed under Imperial [[Vogt|protection]]\n|date_event1=1156\n|event2=Seized by [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_event2=1504\n|event3=Monastery alternates between Protestantism and [[Cistercians]]\n|date_event3=1534\u20131651\n|event4=[[Peace of Westphalia]] settles monastery to Protestantism\n|date_event4=1648\n|event_end=[[German Mediatisation|Secularized]] to [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_end=1806\n|event_post=Seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]]\n|date_post=1818\n|p1=Bishopric of Speyer\n|flag_p1=Coat of Arms of the Bishopric of Speyer.svg\n|s1=Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_s1=Flagge K\u00f6nigreich W\u00fcrttemberg.svg\n|image_coat=Wolleber Chorographia Mh6-1 0062 Wappen.jpg\n|image_map=KlosterMaulbronn.jpg\n}}\n\nAs early as 1138, the [[Cistercians]] had established a religious community in Eckenweihar (now [[Eckenweiler]]), a plot of land donated by a [[free knight]] named [[Walter von Lomersheim]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Meilensteine}} Twelve [[monks]] and an unspecified number of [[lay brothers]], from [[Neubourg Abbey]] in [[Alsace]],{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Eckenweiher}} arrived at Eckenweihar on 23 March 1138.{{sfn|Klunzinger|1854|p=12}} The site was soon abandoned, however, as it was found by the monks to have water and pasture space in poor quality and quantity.{{sfn|Gillich|2017|p=275}} {{ill|G\u00fcnther von Henneberg|de}}, [[Bishop of Speyer]], deeded the fiefdom of Mulinbrunn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] to the Eckenweihar community and moved the latter community there in 1147.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Maulbronn}}{{efn|While the move from Eckenweiler to [[Maulbronn]] occurred in 1147, the deed confirming the ceding of Maulbronn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] was crafted and confirmed a decade later.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}}} Local legend tells that the Cistercians decided to use a [[mule]] to locate water, and built the monastery at its present location when it found water. The [[etymology]] of the name \"Mulenbrunnen,\" the root of [[Maulbronn]] (\"Maul\" is [[German language|German]] for \"[[Mule]]\"), reveals that the monastery was likely founded at the site of a spring and a [[watermill]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Gr\u00fcndungslegende}}\n\n===Development===\nFrom 1156, the monastery was a [[Vogt#Holy Roman Empire|Vogtei]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was confirmed in 1332. However, the abbey continued chose to be under the protection of the [[List of bishops of Speyer|Bishop of Speyer]], who awarded the title as a sub-Vogt to his minister Heinrich von Enzberg, who would from 1236 appear in documentation as the protector of the abbey. Over the following decades, Maulbronn monastery would struggle, sometimes violently, with the {{ill|House of Enzberg|de|Enzberg (Adelsgeschlecht)|lt=von Enzbergs}} who tried to use their protection of the monastery to expand their own power base. From 1325 onward the [[Electoral Palatinate|Rhenish Palatine]] Counts were entrusted with the Vogt title.\n\nIn 1525, during the [[German Peasants' War]], the monastery was looted by rebel forces. Their leader, {{ill|J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach|de}}, stayed at Maulbronn for a time and complained to {{ill|Hans Wunderer|de}} of the disorganization of the peasant force who were unable to decide whether to demolish or ransom the abbey. Due to Rohrbach's intercession, Maulbronn Abbey still exists today.\n\nBecause the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg became Protestant, the monks of the abbey were no longer tolerated by the political authority of the state. The monastery was at first intended to be a collection monastery ({{lang-de|Sammelkloster}}) for retired monks from all the remaining monasteries in W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1537, the abbot and the convent moved to [[Pairis Abbey]] in [[Alsace]], the abbot died 1547 in [[Einsiedeln]]. After the defeat of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], Ulrich had to return the monastery to the Cistercians in 1546-47.\n\nThe [[Peace of Augsburg]] gave the Duke the right to decide on the faith of his subjects. In 1556 he issued the W\u00fcrttemberger Klosterordnung, a decree that would form the basis for a regulated education system in all the remaining monasteries for men in W\u00fcrttemberg. The conversion of the monastery into a school remained legally disputed for a long time, the Emperor trying twice to reverse this development. During the Interims from 1548\u20131555 and 1630\u20131649 due to the Imperial restitution edicts, monks could return to the monastery due to the temporary political situation of the time.\n\nThe possessions of the Abbey grew first and foremost through donations and endowments. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the abbey's possessions were realigned via purchase so as to make its boundaries more compact. At the end of this development, the monastery's possessions included 20 villages, called ''Klosterflecken''. Besides the income provided by the abbey's immediate surroundings, there were also [[cottage industries]] in [[Illingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Illingen]], [[Knittlingen]], and {{ill|Unter\u00f6wisheim|de}} and 6000 acres of forest, spread out over 25 villages, that were administered by the abbey. Land privileges were loaned out for additional income in addition to the tithe, giving the abbey enormous income as a result, illustrated by the size of the abbey's [[granary]]. To manage this income, the abbey had seven {{ill|Pfleghof|de|lt=Pflegh\u00f6fe}}, located in Illingen, [[Kirchheim am Neckar]], Knittlingen, [[\u00d6tisheim]], [[Speyer]], Unter\u00f6wisheim and [[Wiernsheim]].\n\n[[Ulrich, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] became the owner of Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] began in the year 1517, Ulrich built his hunting lodge and stables here. The monastery was pillaged repeatedly: first by the knights under [[Franz von Sickingen]] in 1519, then again during the [[German Peasants' War]] six years later. In 1534, Duke Ulrich secularized the monastery, but the Cistercians regained control \u2014 and Imperial recognition \u2014 under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s [[Augsburg Interim]].\n\nIn 1556, [[Christoph, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], established a [[Protestant]] [[seminary]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Geb\u00e4ude}} with {{ill|Valentin Vannius|de}} becoming its first [[abbot]] two years later although the Reformation banned religious orders and abbots; [[Johannes Kepler]] studied there 1586\u201389.\n\nIn 1630, the abbey was returned to the Cistercians by force of arms, with Christoph Schaller von Sennheim becoming abbot. This restoration was short-lived, however, as [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the monks to leave again two years later, with a Protestant abbot returning in 1633; the seminary reopened the following year, however the Cistercians under Schaller also returned in 1634. Under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], in 1648, the confession of the monastery was settled in favor of Protestantism; with abbot Buchinger withdrawing in process. A Protestant abbacy was re-established in 1651, with the seminary reopening five years later. In 1692, the seminarians were removed to safety when [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]], torched the school, which remained closed for a decade.\n\nThe monastery was secularized by King [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the course of the [[German Mediatisation]] in 1807, forever removing its political quasi-independence; the seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]] the following year, now known as the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren]].\n\nThe monastery, which features prominently in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s novel ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]'', was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1993. The justification for the inscription was as follows: \"The Maulbronn complex is the most complete survival of a Cistercian monastic establishment in Europe, in particular because of the survival of its extensive water-management system of reservoirs and channels\". Hesse himself attended the seminary before fleeing in 1891 after a suicide attempt, and a failed attempt to save Hesse from his personal religious crisis by a well-known theologian and faith healer.\n\nThe Paradise and the fountain in the lavatorium appear on the 2013 [[German euro coins#\u20ac2 commemorative coins|German Bundesl\u00e4nder series]] 2 euro coin.{{sfn|European Union Journal, 28 December 2013}} 30 million of these coins were minted in [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Karlsruhe]], and [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: 2-Euro-M\u00fcnze}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Lageplan Kloster Maulbronn.png|thumb|right|alt=This is a map of the monastery complex|Map of the monastery complex]]\n\nMaulbronn was constructed in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Stilgeschichte}} then native to Swabia. Motifs of the \"[[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]] style\" are uniform pillars and the rectangular frames around the Romanesque arches, as at Maulbronn. Near the end of the 12th century the architecture of the [[Cistercians]] became influenced by [[Gothic architecture]], which required less stone than the Romanesque style, and the order began disseminating it from northeastern [[France]]. An anonymous architect trained in [[Paris]] erected the first example of Gothic architecture in [[Germany]] at Maulbronn's [[narthex]], the southern portion of its [[cloister]], and the monks' [[refectory]].{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|pp=77, 78-79}}{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Weltkulturerbe Maulbronn}} The Late Gothic came to Maulbronn from the late 13th century to the mid-14th century, and again in the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] era of the late 19th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Stilgeschichte}}\n\nAlthough little of the 12th century work, such as the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] and its original doors, have been preserved,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Stilgeschichte}} the monastery as a whole survives due mostly to the [[Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who obtained ownership of it in the 16th century.{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} The architectural history of the complex is still not fully understood.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}}\n\n===Water system===\nAs was customary with Cistercian monasteries,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} Maulbronn stands on top of a sophisticated water management system.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Kloster Maulbronn}} By draining the wetlands around the monastery and digging a series of canals,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} the monks created some 20 ponds and lakes. A local stream, the Salzach, was diverted to flow under the monastery to form its [[sewerage]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Wasserwirtschaft}} The water levels in these lakes could be controlled, allowing Maulbronn's monks to power their [[Watermill|mill]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Umgebung des Klosters}} but also to raise fish and [[eels]] for consumption or [[commerce]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fischzucht}}{{efn|[[Cistercians]] were forbidden from eating meat, but consuming fish was allowable as they were classified as \"river vegetables.\" Maulbronn's monks raised fish, most notably the [[mirror carp]], in different bodies of water depending on their species, size, and age, then sold them to surrounding communities.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fischzucht}}}} In one of these ponds, the [[Aalkistensee]], the monks could raise up to 5000 carp.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kochbuch Bernhard Buchingers}} Much of the system remains in use and is part of Maulbronn's [[UNESCO]] inscription.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Wasserwirtschaft}}{{sfn|UNESCO: Maulbronn Monastery Complex}} The water system has been the subject of study for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's {{ill|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Office for the Preservation of Monuments|de|Landesamt f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|lt=Office for the Preservation of Monuments}} since 1989.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: UNESCO-Welterbest\u00e4tte Kloster Maulbronn}}\n\n==Monastery complex==\n[[File:Maulbronn Kloster - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of the gate (left of center, background) and flanking buildings. The closest, on the right, is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus.|Entrance area, western courtyard]]\n\nThe monastery was protected by stone wall, a [[drawbridge]] gate, and five towers.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=75}} The complex is still entered through the gatehouse, at its southwest corner, though the drawbridge is no longer present. The [[half-timber]] building on the back of the gatehouse was built around 1600, and the present roof is Baroque, built in 1751. Just behind the gatehouse is another the [[pharmacy]], originally an [[inn]] and also built in the Baroque style. Also attached to the old pharmacy is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus (Early morning house), residence of the monk responsible for early morning mass for monastery guests.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Westlicher Eingangsbereich}} The interior of the building is divided into a large, open fireplace and the entrance hall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: K\u00fcchenbereiche}} Also attached to the old pharmacy is a 19th century [[carriage house]], now a museum, standing on top of a chapel built around 1480. The foundation for the choir of this chapel are still extant behind the carriage house, as are the remains of a Romanesque gate demolished in 1813. The [[lead pipe]] in the locality suggests that there used to be a [[well]] in the area.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Westlicher Eingangsbereich}} East of the gate is the Fruchtkasten, today a concert hall. It was built in the 13th century and then totally rebuilt and enlarged in 1580 for the storage and use of wine-making equipment.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterhof mit Wirtschaftsgeb\u00e4uden}}\n\nTo the north of the gate is the monastery's administrative and economic buildings. Along the western wall of the monastery are what used to be the blacksmithy [[wheelwright]]'s workshop. East of the blacksmithy is the former [[mews]], which has been [[Maulbronn]]'s [[city hall]] since the early 19th century. The building was converted in 1600 from its original Gothic appearance into the present [[Renaissance style]] structure. Just north of the city hall is the Haberkasten, used as a [[granary]], and adjacent to that is the workplace and residence of the monastery's chief baker. Finally, there are three half-timber buildings. The first is the Speisemeisterei, next to the sawmill, and the third is the Bursarium, built in 1742 as the cemetery office but used as a [[police station]] and [[notary]] as of 2019. The middle building, built in 1550, was a servant's quarters and is now an Italian restaurant.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterhof mit Wirtschaftsgeb\u00e4uden}}\n\n[[File:Kloster-Maulbronn-Schloss.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]]'s hunting lodge.]]\n\nThe Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg came to own Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} In 1588, [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]] built a ''[[lustschloss]]'' over the cellar of an earlier building, likely the abbot's residence. During the existence of the {{ill|Oberamt Maulbronn|de}}, Louis III's ''lustschloss'' was its administrative office. Nearby are the ruins of the Pfr\u00fcndhaus, where donors who had bought a life pension from the monastery resided. The building was erected in 1430 and used as a [[poorhouse]] in the 19th century until it was destroyed by fire in January 1892.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: \u00d6stlicher Hof}} In the southeast corner of the complex is the Faustturm, the tower where [[Faust]] is alleged to have lived while staying at the monastery in 1516.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Doktor Faustus}}\n\nTo operate their monasteries the Cistercian Order was allowed to own property such as bodies of water, vineyards, and forests. At the beginning of the 12th century, 17 [[monastic grange]]s surrounded Maulbronn, operated by [[lay brothers]]. Also nearby is a portion of the [[Eppingen lines]] built by [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] from 1695 to 1697.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Umgebung des Klosters}}\n\nThe gardens around the monastery, in its cloister and east of the church, grew fruits and medicinal herbs.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: G\u00e4rten}}\n\n===Abbey===\n[[File:08 Maulbronn 00.02 Lage 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map of the monastery engraved on a metal plaque|Plan of the monastery.

This was so even in the church,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}} which is divided into sections for the former and the latter by a choir wall. There are two [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciboriums]], decorated with toads, lizards, and [[Memento mori|skulls]] and a number of medieval works on both sides of the choir wall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterkirche}} In front of this wall on the lay brother's side is a large image of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ crucified]], carved around 1473 from a single block of stone.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kruzifix}} At the end of the lay brother's section is the organ, installed by {{ill|Gerhard Grenzing|de}} in 2013.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Grenzing-Orgel}} In the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is a [[Madonna and Child]], the ''Maulbronner Madonna'', crafted somewhere between 1307 and 1317.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Madonna}} In the [[chancel]] below is a set of 15th century of choir stalls and abbot's chair to seat 92 monks. They were carved by an unknown master, possibly [[Hans Multscher]], who covered them in biblical scenes and mythical creatures.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Choresgest\u00fchl}} The [[frescoes]] within the church depict the [[Adoration of the Magi]], the entrance of Maulbronn's founder [[Walter von Lomersheim]] into the monastery as a lay brother. Also present are the [[coats of arms]] of nobles who donated to the monastery's construction.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=81}} The donor chapels and vaulted Gothic roof, replacing the original flat and timber roof, were added when the church was renovated in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterkirche}} The [[altar]], likely of South German make, depicts the [[Passion of Jesus]] was once gilded and painted.

The portal into the lay brothers' church contain the oldest datable doors in Germany, fashioned from [[fir wood]] in 1178. The door was decorated with wrought iron and parchment that would have been glued onto the door and painted red.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Paradies}} Immediately north of the abbey church is the cloister, the southern portion of which was built by the Master of the Paradise's workshop from 1210 to 1220.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kreuzgang}} Lay brothers could enter or leave the cloister from a corridor on its west side.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}} This leads to a flight of stairs to the lay brothers' dormitory, and the lay refectory on the ground floor. The [[groin vaults]] are supported by seven slender double-column pillars installed in 1869.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} Opposite the corridor to the cloister from the lay refectory is the [[cellarium]], now a display of stonemasonry paraphernalia.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}}\n\nOn the north side of the cloister is the [[lavatorium]], where monks washed before meals and for [[Ablution in Christianity|ablution]]. The majority of the fountain within dates to 1878; only the base bowl is original. The five Gothic windows were added from 1340 to 1350 and the half-timber structure above the lavatorium was built around 1611 in a style similar to that of {{ill|Heinrich Schickhardt|de}}.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Brunnenhaus}} The vaults of the lavatorium were painted with a depiction of Maulbronn's founding myth.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Gr\u00fcndungslegende}} Across from the Brunnenhaus is the monks' refectory,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Brunnenhaus}} where the full brothers ate their meals and listened to a reading of the [[Bible]]. This building was possibly also built by the Master of the Paradise, as evidenced by the Early Gothic elements of its interior. The ribbing of the vaults was painted red in the 16th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} The kitchen that supplied the two refectories is located between them, but arranged such to keep smoke and odors away from the rest of the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: K\u00fcchenbereiche}}\n\nAlthough the Cistercian Order banned heated rooms,{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} Maulbronn has a [[calefactory]] that was heated by lighting a fire in a vaulted chamber underneath the calefactory. Smoke was funneled outside and the heat rose into the calefactory through the 20 holes in its floor.{{sfn|Kinder|2002|p=279}} It was the only heated room in the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}}\n\n[[File:Kloster Maulbronn - panoramio - Andy Mendyk (2).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Panoramic photograph of the chapter house, east wall|Chapter house, east wall]]\n\nAttached to the center of the eastern side of the cloister is the [[chapter house]]. Three pillars hold up the room's [[Lierne (vault)|star vault]], capped with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] depicting the [[Four Evangelists]], the [[Lamb of God]], and an [[Angels in Christianity|angel]] blowing a trumpet. Beneath these, and the frescoes painted in 1517, monks met and could break their vowed silence to discuss goings-on.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kapitelsaal}}\n\nA staircase on the east side of the cloister leads to the monks' dormitory.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kreuzgang}}\n\nA corridor on the eastern side of the cloister goes to a Late Gothic connecting building, built by lay brother Conrad von Schmie, leading to the monastery hospital, the Ephorat. The connecting building is decorated with a mural depicting [[Benedict of Nursia]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] kneeling before the [[Virgin Mary]]. From the symbolism, it is thought this space was used as a Marian chapel, a [[scriptorium]], or a [[library]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kreuzgang}} After Maulbronn's acquisition by the Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg, the hospital was renovated as the abbot's residence and gained its name from the abbot's title, \"Ephorus\".{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: \u00d6stlicher Hof}}\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Model of Maulbronn Monastery Complex - Maulbronn - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Pictured here is a scale model of the monastery complex|Scale model of the monastery complex in the monastery museum]]\n\nThe [[Cooper (profession)|cooperage]], near the gatehouse, is the visitor center. On the ground floor is a [[diorama]] of the monastery complex and on the second floor is a museum room detailing post-monastic life at Maulbronn. The nearby Fr\u00fchmesserhaus displays a three-panel display made by the monks of Maulbronn documenting its foundation and attached circumstances.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klostermuseum}}{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Stiftungstafel}} There is also an art museum displaying 300 pieces, located in the Schafhof, operated by art collectors Jutta and Manfred Heinrich.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Ausstellungen}}\n\nWithin the monastery complex is a three-part literary museum, \"Besuchen-Bilden-Schreiben\",{{sfn|City of Maulbronn: Besuchen-Bilden-Schreiben}} operated by the state of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The first of these, \"Visit\" exhibits Maulbronn's image in literature. Next is \"Learn\", dedicated to the monastery's use as a Protestant seminary and with a focus on notable alumni such as [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]], and [[Herman Hesse]]. Finally, \"Write\" showcases the works of the monks at Maulbronn and a library spanning 800 years and 50 writers.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Literaturmuseum}}\n\nThe cellarium, in the monastery proper, is a [[lapidarium]] and exhibit detailing the construction methods used at Maulbronn.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klostermuseum}}\n\n{{Panorama|image=File:MaulbronnPanorama.jpg|height=150px|caption=Panorama photograph of Maulbronn Monastery's western courtyard, facing the abbey}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commonscat|Maulbronn Monastery complex}}\n* [[Gothic architecture]]\n* [[Romanesque architecture]]\n* [[Salem Abbey]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Janet B.|last2=Kerr|first2=Julie|title=The Cistercians in the Middle Ages|volume=Volume 4|series=Monastic orders|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Boydell Press|date=2011|isbn=9781843836674|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adHIaVe-zBgC|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Gillich|first=Ante|title=Das Wassersystem des Klosters Maulbronn: Ein Projekt zur Bestandserfassung mit hochaufgel\u00f6sten Laserscandaten|language=de|url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/nbdpfbw/article/view/42796|journal={{ill|Journal for the Preservation of Monuments in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|de|Denkmalpflege in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg}}|year=2017|ref=harv|access-date=2019-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212015543/https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/nbdpfbw/article/view/42796|archive-date=2020-02-12|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780824076443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4uHav3mZLsC&|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Kinder|first=Terryl M.|title=Cistercian Europe: Architecture of Contemplation|year=2002|publisher=Wm.

The monastery's narthex, called \"the Paradise\", is the oldest example of [[Gothic architecture]] in [[Germany]].\n\nIt is part of the [[Northern Black Forest]] Monastery Route with [[Alpirsbach Abbey|Alpirsbach]], [[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]], and {{ill|Reuthin Abbey|de|Kloster Reuthin|lt=Reuthin}} monasteries.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterroute Nordschwarzwald}}\n\nThe complex, surrounded by turreted walls and a tower gate, today houses the Maulbronn town hall and other administrative offices, a police station, and several restaurants. The monastery itself contains an [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|Evangelical seminary]] in the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberger tradition]] and a boarding school.\n\nAn average of 235,000 persons visit the monastery per annum.{{sfn|City of Maulbronn: Stadtgeschichte Maulbronn}}\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name=''Reichskloster Maulbronn''\n|conventional_long_name=Imperial Monastery of Maulbronn\n|status=Imperial Abbey\n|empire=Holy Roman Empire\n|event_start=Founded as [[Imperial abbey]]\n|date_start=1147\n|event1=Placed under Imperial [[Vogt|protection]]\n|date_event1=1156\n|event2=Seized by [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_event2=1504\n|event3=Monastery alternates between Protestantism and [[Cistercians]]\n|date_event3=1534\u20131651\n|event4=[[Peace of Westphalia]] settles monastery to Protestantism\n|date_event4=1648\n|event_end=[[German Mediatisation|Secularized]] to [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_end=1806\n|event_post=Seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]]\n|date_post=1818\n|p1=Bishopric of Speyer\n|flag_p1=Coat of Arms of the Bishopric of Speyer.svg\n|s1=Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_s1=Flagge K\u00f6nigreich W\u00fcrttemberg.svg\n|image_coat=Wolleber Chorographia Mh6-1 0062 Wappen.jpg\n|image_map=KlosterMaulbronn.jpg\n}}\n\nAs early as 1138, the [[Cistercians]] had established a religious community in Eckenweihar (now [[Eckenweiler]]), a plot of land donated by a [[free knight]] named [[Walter von Lomersheim]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Meilensteine}} Twelve [[monks]] and an unspecified number of [[lay brothers]], from [[Neubourg Abbey]] in [[Alsace]],{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Eckenweiher}} arrived at Eckenweihar on 23 March 1138.{{sfn|Klunzinger|1854|p=12}} The site was soon abandoned, however, as it was found by the monks to have water and pasture space in poor quality and quantity.{{sfn|Gillich|2017|p=275}} {{ill|G\u00fcnther von Henneberg|de}}, [[Bishop of Speyer]], deeded the fiefdom of Mulinbrunn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] to the Eckenweihar community and moved the latter community there in 1147.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Maulbronn}}{{efn|While the move from Eckenweiler to [[Maulbronn]] occurred in 1147, the deed confirming the ceding of Maulbronn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] was crafted and confirmed a decade later.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}}} Local legend tells that the Cistercians decided to use a [[mule]] to locate water, and built the monastery at its present location when it found water. The [[etymology]] of the name \"Mulenbrunnen,\" the root of [[Maulbronn]] (\"Maul\" is [[German language|German]] for \"[[Mule]]\"), reveals that the monastery was likely founded at the site of a spring and a [[watermill]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Gr\u00fcndungslegende}}\n\n===Development===\nFrom 1156, the monastery was a [[Vogt#Holy Roman Empire|Vogtei]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was confirmed in 1332. However, the abbey continued chose to be under the protection of the [[List of bishops of Speyer|Bishop of Speyer]], who awarded the title as a sub-Vogt to his minister Heinrich von Enzberg, who would from 1236 appear in documentation as the protector of the abbey. Over the following decades, Maulbronn monastery would struggle, sometimes violently, with the {{ill|House of Enzberg|de|Enzberg (Adelsgeschlecht)|lt=von Enzbergs}} who tried to use their protection of the monastery to expand their own power base. From 1325 onward the [[Electoral Palatinate|Rhenish Palatine]] Counts were entrusted with the Vogt title.\n\nIn 1525, during the [[German Peasants' War]], the monastery was looted by rebel forces. Their leader, {{ill|J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach|de}}, stayed at Maulbronn for a time and complained to {{ill|Hans Wunderer|de}} of the disorganization of the peasant force who were unable to decide whether to demolish or ransom the abbey. Due to Rohrbach's intercession, Maulbronn Abbey still exists today.\n\nBecause the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg became Protestant, the monks of the abbey were no longer tolerated by the political authority of the state. The monastery was at first intended to be a collection monastery ({{lang-de|Sammelkloster}}) for retired monks from all the remaining monasteries in W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1537, the abbot and the convent moved to [[Pairis Abbey]] in [[Alsace]], the abbot died 1547 in [[Einsiedeln]]. After the defeat of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], Ulrich had to return the monastery to the Cistercians in 1546-47.\n\nThe [[Peace of Augsburg]] gave the Duke the right to decide on the faith of his subjects. In 1556 he issued the W\u00fcrttemberger Klosterordnung, a decree that would form the basis for a regulated education system in all the remaining monasteries for men in W\u00fcrttemberg. The conversion of the monastery into a school remained legally disputed for a long time, the Emperor trying twice to reverse this development. During the Interims from 1548\u20131555 and 1630\u20131649 due to the Imperial restitution edicts, monks could return to the monastery due to the temporary political situation of the time.\n\nThe possessions of the Abbey grew first and foremost through donations and endowments. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the abbey's possessions were realigned via purchase so as to make its boundaries more compact. At the end of this development, the monastery's possessions included 20 villages, called ''Klosterflecken''. Besides the income provided by the abbey's immediate surroundings, there were also [[cottage industries]] in [[Illingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Illingen]], [[Knittlingen]], and {{ill|Unter\u00f6wisheim|de}} and 6000 acres of forest, spread out over 25 villages, that were administered by the abbey. Land privileges were loaned out for additional income in addition to the tithe, giving the abbey enormous income as a result, illustrated by the size of the abbey's [[granary]]. To manage this income, the abbey had seven {{ill|Pfleghof|de|lt=Pflegh\u00f6fe}}, located in Illingen, [[Kirchheim am Neckar]], Knittlingen, [[\u00d6tisheim]], [[Speyer]], Unter\u00f6wisheim and [[Wiernsheim]].\n\n[[Ulrich, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] became the owner of Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] began in the year 1517, Ulrich built his hunting lodge and stables here. The monastery was pillaged repeatedly: first by the knights under [[Franz von Sickingen]] in 1519, then again during the [[German Peasants' War]] six years later. In 1534, Duke Ulrich secularized the monastery, but the Cistercians regained control \u2014 and Imperial recognition \u2014 under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s [[Augsburg Interim]].\n\nIn 1556, [[Christoph, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], established a [[Protestant]] [[seminary]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Geb\u00e4ude}} with {{ill|Valentin Vannius|de}} becoming its first [[abbot]] two years later although the Reformation banned religious orders and abbots; [[Johannes Kepler]] studied there 1586\u201389.\n\nIn 1630, the abbey was returned to the Cistercians by force of arms, with Christoph Schaller von Sennheim becoming abbot. This restoration was short-lived, however, as [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the monks to leave again two years later, with a Protestant abbot returning in 1633; the seminary reopened the following year, however the Cistercians under Schaller also returned in 1634. Under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], in 1648, the confession of the monastery was settled in favor of Protestantism; with abbot Buchinger withdrawing in process. A Protestant abbacy was re-established in 1651, with the seminary reopening five years later. In 1692, the seminarians were removed to safety when [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]], torched the school, which remained closed for a decade.\n\nThe monastery was secularized by King [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the course of the [[German Mediatisation]] in 1807, forever removing its political quasi-independence; the seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]] the following year, now known as the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren]].\n\nThe monastery, which features prominently in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s novel ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]'', was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1993. The justification for the inscription was as follows: \"The Maulbronn complex is the most complete survival of a Cistercian monastic establishment in Europe, in particular because of the survival of its extensive water-management system of reservoirs and channels\". Hesse himself attended the seminary before fleeing in 1891 after a suicide attempt, and a failed attempt to save Hesse from his personal religious crisis by a well-known theologian and faith healer.\n\nThe Paradise and the fountain in the lavatorium appear on the 2013 [[German euro coins#\u20ac2 commemorative coins|German Bundesl\u00e4nder series]] 2 euro coin.{{sfn|European Union Journal, 28 December 2013}} 30 million of these coins were minted in [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Karlsruhe]], and [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: 2-Euro-M\u00fcnze}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Lageplan Kloster Maulbronn.png|thumb|right|alt=This is a map of the monastery complex|Map of the monastery complex]]\n\nMaulbronn was constructed in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Stilgeschichte}} then native to Swabia. Motifs of the \"[[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]] style\" are uniform pillars and the rectangular frames around the Romanesque arches, as at Maulbronn. Near the end of the 12th century the architecture of the [[Cistercians]] became influenced by [[Gothic architecture]], which required less stone than the Romanesque style, and the order began disseminating it from northeastern [[France]]. An anonymous architect trained in [[Paris]] erected the first example of Gothic architecture in [[Germany]] at Maulbronn's [[narthex]], the southern portion of its [[cloister]], and the monks' [[refectory]].{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|pp=77, 78-79}}{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Weltkulturerbe Maulbronn}} The Late Gothic came to Maulbronn from the late 13th century to the mid-14th century, and again in the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] era of the late 19th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Stilgeschichte}}\n\nAlthough little of the 12th century work, such as the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] and its original doors, have been preserved,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Stilgeschichte}} the monastery as a whole survives due mostly to the [[Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who obtained ownership of it in the 16th century.{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} The architectural history of the complex is still not fully understood.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}}\n\n===Water system===\nAs was customary with Cistercian monasteries,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} Maulbronn stands on top of a sophisticated water management system.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Kloster Maulbronn}} By draining the wetlands around the monastery and digging a series of canals,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} the monks created some 20 ponds and lakes. A local stream, the Salzach, was diverted to flow under the monastery to form its [[sewerage]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Wasserwirtschaft}} The water levels in these lakes could be controlled, allowing Maulbronn's monks to power their [[Watermill|mill]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Umgebung des Klosters}} but also to raise fish and [[eels]] for consumption or [[commerce]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fischzucht}}{{efn|[[Cistercians]] were forbidden from eating meat, but consuming fish was allowable as they were classified as \"river vegetables.\" Maulbronn's monks raised fish, most notably the [[mirror carp]], in different bodies of water depending on their species, size, and age, then sold them to surrounding communities.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fischzucht}}}} In one of these ponds, the [[Aalkistensee]], the monks could raise up to 5000 carp.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kochbuch Bernhard Buchingers}} Much of the system remains in use and is part of Maulbronn's [[UNESCO]] inscription.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Wasserwirtschaft}}{{sfn|UNESCO: Maulbronn Monastery Complex}} The water system has been the subject of study for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's {{ill|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Office for the Preservation of Monuments|de|Landesamt f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|lt=Office for the Preservation of Monuments}} since 1989.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: UNESCO-Welterbest\u00e4tte Kloster Maulbronn}}\n\n==Monastery complex==\n[[File:Maulbronn Kloster - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of the gate (left of center, background) and flanking buildings. The closest, on the right, is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus.|Entrance area, western courtyard]]\n\nThe monastery was protected by stone wall, a [[drawbridge]] gate, and five towers.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=75}} The complex is still entered through the gatehouse, at its southwest corner, though the drawbridge is no longer present. The [[half-timber]] building on the back of the gatehouse was built around 1600, and the present roof is Baroque, built in 1751. Just behind the gatehouse is another the [[pharmacy]], originally an [[inn]] and also built in the Baroque style. Also attached to the old pharmacy is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus (Early morning house), residence of the monk responsible for early morning mass for monastery guests.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Westlicher Eingangsbereich}} The interior of the building is divided into a large, open fireplace and the entrance hall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: K\u00fcchenbereiche}} Also attached to the old pharmacy is a 19th century [[carriage house]], now a museum, standing on top of a chapel built around 1480. The foundation for the choir of this chapel are still extant behind the carriage house, as are the remains of a Romanesque gate demolished in 1813. The [[lead pipe]] in the locality suggests that there used to be a [[well]] in the area.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Westlicher Eingangsbereich}} East of the gate is the Fruchtkasten, today a concert hall. It was built in the 13th century and then totally rebuilt and enlarged in 1580 for the storage and use of wine-making equipment.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterhof mit Wirtschaftsgeb\u00e4uden}}\n\nTo the north of the gate is the monastery's administrative and economic buildings. Along the western wall of the monastery are what used to be the blacksmithy [[wheelwright]]'s workshop. East of the blacksmithy is the former [[mews]], which has been [[Maulbronn]]'s [[city hall]] since the early 19th century. The building was converted in 1600 from its original Gothic appearance into the present [[Renaissance style]] structure. Just north of the city hall is the Haberkasten, used as a [[granary]], and adjacent to that is the workplace and residence of the monastery's chief baker. Finally, there are three half-timber buildings. The first is the Speisemeisterei, next to the sawmill, and the third is the Bursarium, built in 1742 as the cemetery office but used as a [[police station]] and [[notary]] as of 2019. The middle building, built in 1550, was a servant's quarters and is now an Italian restaurant.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterhof mit Wirtschaftsgeb\u00e4uden}}\n\n[[File:Kloster-Maulbronn-Schloss.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]]'s hunting lodge.]]\n\nThe Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg came to own Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} In 1588, [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]] built a ''[[lustschloss]]'' over the cellar of an earlier building, likely the abbot's residence. During the existence of the {{ill|Oberamt Maulbronn|de}}, Louis III's ''lustschloss'' was its administrative office. Nearby are the ruins of the Pfr\u00fcndhaus, where donors who had bought a life pension from the monastery resided. The building was erected in 1430 and used as a [[poorhouse]] in the 19th century until it was destroyed by fire in January 1892.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: \u00d6stlicher Hof}} In the southeast corner of the complex is the Faustturm, the tower where [[Faust]] is alleged to have lived while staying at the monastery in 1516.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Doktor Faustus}}\n\nTo operate their monasteries the Cistercian Order was allowed to own property such as bodies of water, vineyards, and forests. At the beginning of the 12th century, 17 [[monastic grange]]s surrounded Maulbronn, operated by [[lay brothers]]. Also nearby is a portion of the [[Eppingen lines]] built by [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] from 1695 to 1697.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Umgebung des Klosters}}\n\nThe gardens around the monastery, in its cloister and east of the church, grew fruits and medicinal herbs.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: G\u00e4rten}}\n\n===Abbey===\n[[File:08 Maulbronn 00.02 Lage 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map of the monastery engraved on a metal plaque|Plan of the monastery.

This was so even in the church,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}} which is divided into sections for the former and the latter by a choir wall. There are two [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciboriums]], decorated with toads, lizards, and [[Memento mori|skulls]] and a number of medieval works on both sides of the choir wall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterkirche}} In front of this wall on the lay brother's side is a large image of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ crucified]], carved around 1473 from a single block of stone.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kruzifix}} At the end of the lay brother's section is the organ, installed by {{ill|Gerhard Grenzing|de}} in 2013.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Grenzing-Orgel}} In the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is a [[Madonna and Child]], the ''Maulbronner Madonna'', crafted somewhere between 1307 and 1317.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Madonna}} In the [[chancel]] below is a set of 15th century of choir stalls and abbot's chair to seat 92 monks. They were carved by an unknown master, possibly [[Hans Multscher]], who covered them in biblical scenes and mythical creatures.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Choresgest\u00fchl}} The [[frescoes]] within the church depict the [[Adoration of the Magi]], the entrance of Maulbronn's founder [[Walter von Lomersheim]] into the monastery as a lay brother. Also present are the [[coats of arms]] of nobles who donated to the monastery's construction.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=81}} The donor chapels and vaulted Gothic roof, replacing the original flat and timber roof, were added when the church was renovated in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterkirche}} The [[altar]], likely of South German make, depicts the [[Passion of Jesus]] was once gilded and painted. Those pieces of the set that remain have since 1978 sat on a standstone slab in the chapel.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Reliefs am Hochaltar}}\n\nThe church's narthex is Germany's oldest example of Gothic architecture \u2013 the \"Paradise\",{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=79}} built around 1220. The portal into the lay brothers' church contain the oldest datable doors in Germany, fashioned from [[fir wood]] in 1178. The door was decorated with wrought iron and parchment that would have been glued onto the door and painted red.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Paradies}} Immediately north of the abbey church is the cloister, the southern portion of which was built by the Master of the Paradise's workshop from 1210 to 1220.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kreuzgang}} Lay brothers could enter or leave the cloister from a corridor on its west side.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}} This leads to a flight of stairs to the lay brothers' dormitory, and the lay refectory on the ground floor. The [[groin vaults]] are supported by seven slender double-column pillars installed in 1869.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} Opposite the corridor to the cloister from the lay refectory is the [[cellarium]], now a display of stonemasonry paraphernalia.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}}\n\nOn the north side of the cloister is the [[lavatorium]], where monks washed before meals and for [[Ablution in Christianity|ablution]]. The majority of the fountain within dates to 1878; only the base bowl is original. The five Gothic windows were added from 1340 to 1350 and the half-timber structure above the lavatorium was built around 1611 in a style similar to that of {{ill|Heinrich Schickhardt|de}}.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Brunnenhaus}} The vaults of the lavatorium were painted with a depiction of Maulbronn's founding myth.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Gr\u00fcndungslegende}} Across from the Brunnenhaus is the monks' refectory,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Brunnenhaus}} where the full brothers ate their meals and listened to a reading of the [[Bible]]. This building was possibly also built by the Master of the Paradise, as evidenced by the Early Gothic elements of its interior. The ribbing of the vaults was painted red in the 16th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Herren- und Laienrefektorium}} The kitchen that supplied the two refectories is located between them, but arranged such to keep smoke and odors away from the rest of the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: K\u00fcchenbereiche}}\n\nAlthough the Cistercian Order banned heated rooms,{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} Maulbronn has a [[calefactory]] that was heated by lighting a fire in a vaulted chamber underneath the calefactory. Smoke was funneled outside and the heat rose into the calefactory through the 20 holes in its floor.{{sfn|Kinder|2002|p=279}} It was the only heated room in the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klausur und Kirche}}\n\n[[File:Kloster Maulbronn - panoramio - Andy Mendyk (2).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Panoramic photograph of the chapter house, east wall|Chapter house, east wall]]\n\nAttached to the center of the eastern side of the cloister is the [[chapter house]]. Three pillars hold up the room's [[Lierne (vault)|star vault]], capped with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] depicting the [[Four Evangelists]], the [[Lamb of God]], and an [[Angels in Christianity|angel]] blowing a trumpet. Beneath these, and the frescoes painted in 1517, monks met and could break their vowed silence to discuss goings-on.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kapitelsaal}}\n\nA staircase on the east side of the cloister leads to the monks' dormitory.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kreuzgang}}\n\nA corridor on the eastern side of the cloister goes to a Late Gothic connecting building, built by lay brother Conrad von Schmie, leading to the monastery hospital, the Ephorat. The connecting building is decorated with a mural depicting [[Benedict of Nursia]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] kneeling before the [[Virgin Mary]]. From the symbolism, it is thought this space was used as a Marian chapel, a [[scriptorium]], or a [[library]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kreuzgang}} After Maulbronn's acquisition by the Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg, the hospital was renovated as the abbot's residence and gained its name from the abbot's title, \"Ephorus\".{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: \u00d6stlicher Hof}}\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Model of Maulbronn Monastery Complex - Maulbronn - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Pictured here is a scale model of the monastery complex|Scale model of the monastery complex in the monastery museum]]\n\nThe [[Cooper (profession)|cooperage]], near the gatehouse, is the visitor center.

The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft is capable to dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020.

The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft is capable to dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

The vehicle used for this ground test will also be used for the following in-flight abort test.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/13/spacex-fires-up-crew-dragon-thrusters-in-key-test-after-april-explosion/</ref>\n\nSome of the modifications are:\n\n* Replacement of the valves with [[burst disc]]s: Unlike valves, burst discs are designed for single use. \n* Adding of flaps on each SuperDracos in order to reseal those thrusters prior to splashdown in the Ocean, preventing water intrusion and make Crew Dragon far easier to refurbish and reuse, also preventing Dragon from sinking.<ref>https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-fires-redesigned-crew-dragon-superdraco-flaps/</ref>\n\n===In-Flight Abort Test===\n[[File:KSC-20200119-PH-AWG04 0008.jpg|thumb|Liftoff of Crew Dragon In-Flight Abort Test.]]\n\nThe Crew Dragon In-flight abort test was launched on 19 January 2020 at 15:30 UTC from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39A]] on a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] trajectory to conduct a separation and abort scenario in the [[troposphere]] at [[transonic]] velocities shortly after passing through [[Max q|max Q]], where the vehicle experiences maximum aerodynamic pressure. The Dragon 2 used its [[SuperDraco]] abort engines to push itself away from the Falcon 9 after an intentional premature engine cutoff. The spacecraft followed its suborbital trajectory to apogee, at which point the spacecraft's trunk was jettisoned. The smaller [[SpaceX Draco|Draco]] engines were then used to orient the vehicle for the descent. All major functions were executed, including separation, engine firings, parachute deployment, and landing. Dragon 2 splashed down at 15:38:54 UTC just off the Florida coast in the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-complete-final-major-flight-test-of-crew-spacecraft</ref> The test objective was to demonstrate the ability to safely move away from the ascending rocket under the most challenging atmospheric conditions of the flight trajectory, imposing the worst structural stress of a real flight on the rocket and spacecraft.<ref name=nsf20140828/> The abort test was performed using a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket with a fully fueled second stage with a mass simulator replacing the [[SpaceX Merlin|Merlin]] engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/space-exploration-technologies/second-spacex-crew-flight-ordered-nasa/|title=Second SpaceX Crew Flight Ordered by NASA|work=Spaceflight Insider|first=Derek|last=Richardson|date=30 July 2016|access-date=9 August 2016|quote=Currently, the first uncrewed test of the spacecraft is expected to launch in May 2017.
