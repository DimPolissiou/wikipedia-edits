It is one mile long by 220 yards wide and extends along 59th and 60th streets, joining [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] at its west end and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] at its east end. It divides the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] to the north from the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] community area to the south, 6 miles (10&nbsp;km) south of the downtown \"[[Chicago Loop|Loop]]\", near [[Lake Michigan]]. Today, the Midway runs through the southern portion of the [[University of Chicago]] campus, with university and related buildings fronting it on both sides.\n\nIt early came to prominence when it hosted [[amusement park|amusements]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893, lending the name \"Midway\" to areas at [[county fair|county]] and [[state fair]]s with [[sideshow]]s.  Laid out with long vistas and [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of trees at the start of the 20th century, the Midway in part followed the vision of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], one of the creators of [[New York City]]'s famous [[Central Park]], but without his design of creating a [[Venice#Transport|Venetian canal]] linking the lagoon systems of Jackson and Washington parks.  Instead, the Midway is landscaped with a [[ha-ha|fosse]] or dry ditch where the canal would have been.\n\nLater designers and artists added (or sought to add) their vision to the Midway. A pet project of the University of Chicago and almost a part of its campus, it has remained essentially a green area.\n\n==Origin of the name==\n[[File:Masaryk EquChi1.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A view of the Memorial to [[Thomas Garrigue Masaryk]] by [[Albin Polasek]] on the Midway]]\n\nThe word \"plaisance\" is both the [[French language|French]] spelling of and a quaint obsolete spelling for \"pleasance\", itself an obscure word in this context meaning \"a pleasure ground laid out with shady walks, trees and shrubs, statuary, and ornamental water\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n==The South Park Commission plan==\n[[File:Woodlawn Streetmap Image.png|thumb|350px|Maps showing the Midway Plaisance (black rectangle) between [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] to the west (left) and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. ([[Chicago Park District]] is in green, [[University of Chicago]] in yellow background)]]\nThe Midway Plaisance began as a vision in the 1850s of [[Paul Cornell (Chicago)|Paul Cornell]], a land developer, to turn an undeveloped stretch of infertile land south of Chicago into an urban lakeside retreat for middle- and upper-class residents seeking to escape city life. The area was a lakefront [[marsh]] [[ecosystem]].\n\nIn 1869, Cornell and his South Park Commission were granted the right to set up a complex of parks and boulevards that would include Washington Park to the west, Jackson Park to the east on the lakeshore, and the Midway Plaisance as a system of paths and waterways connecting the two (see [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3309.html Encyclopedia of Chicago Map]). The firm of Olmsted, Vaux, and Co., famous for creating New York City's [[Central Park]], was hired to design the urban oasis. Part of their plan was that the Midway would function as \"a magnificent chain of lakes\", allowing boaters to go from the ponds to be built in Washington Park to the lagoons to be developed in Jackson Park and through the lagoons to Lake Michigan.\n\nThe South Park Commission office, where all the detailed plans were stored, was burned in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. The expense of rebuilding the city eliminated the funds to cover expenditures that the plans would have entailed, and the South Park area remained largely in its natural swampy state.\n\n==World's Columbian Exposition==\nThe [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 was held in the underdeveloped parts of the South Park. The worldwide celebration of  [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' transfer of \"the torch of civilization to the New World\" in 1492 was one of the most successful and influential of [[world's fair]]s.  It covered over 600 acres (2.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) and attracted exhibitors and visitors from all over the world.\n\nFor the Exposition, the mile-long Midway Plaisance, running from the eastern edge of Washington Park on [[Cottage Grove Avenue]] to the western edge of Jackson Park on [[Stony Island Avenue]], was turned over to the theatrical entrepreneur [[Sol Bloom]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Chicago mayor [[Carter Harrison, Sr.]] It became a grand mix of fakes, [[hokum]], and the genuinely educational and introduced the \"hootchy-cootchy\" version of the [[belly dance]] in the \"Street in Cairo\" amusement; it was the most popular, with 2.25 million admissions.

Over the ensuing decades, the Midway gradually came to be a part of the [[University of Chicago]], which expanded in 1926 to be located on either side of it. Later designers and artists, including [[Lorado Taft]], and [[Eero Saarinen]] added or sought to add their vision to the Midway. A statue of the father of modern [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[Carl Linnaeus]], and an [[equestrian statue]] by sculptor [[Albin Polasek]] of the Knight of Blanik, a legendary [[Czech Republic|Czech]] savior who emerges from [[Blan\u00edk]] mountain in his nation's hour of need, grace the Midway.\n\nIt has remained essentially a green area, a public resource subject to much speculation, and various periodic plans of redevelopment. The sunken panels, home now to [[soccer]] players and a new [[ice skating]] and sports facility, the cross-street \"bridges\", and the east\u2013west lines of trees, pay homage to Olmsted's vision.\n\nIn 1999, a new master plan for the Midway Plaisance done by [[OLIN]], a [[landscape architecture]] firm, was unveiled by the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Chicago Park District]].\n\nThe proximity of the Midway to the University gave the school's early [[American football|football]] teams, the Maroons, a second nickname, \"[[Monsters of the Midway]]\", a name later applied to the [[Chicago Bears]] when the University of Chicago dropped its football program. The program has since been reinstated, and the Maroons play at [[Stagg Field]] on 55th street, half a mile north of the midway.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\nThe Midway, Lorado Taft's Boulevard of Broken Dreams, O'Connor, Jerome, Chicago Tribune, October 25, 1965.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/Midway-Plaisance-Park/ Chicago Park District - Midway Plaisance Park official website]\n*[http://www.hydepark.org/parks/midway/midway.html Midway Plaisance Park  webpage]\n*[http://www.trishmorse.com/midway.htm Chicago's Midway Plaisance Walking Tour website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000604023750/http://www.uchicago.edu/docs/mp-site/construction/plaisance/plai-index.html Midway Plaisance Plan at the University of Chicago]\n\n{{Chicago Parks}}\n{{Chicago Landmark districts}}\n{{UChicago}}\n\n{{Coord|41.7869|N|87.5962|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Parks in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Historic districts in Chicago]]\n[[Category:World's Columbian Exposition]]\n[[Category:South Side, Chicago]]\n[[Category:Streets in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Urban public parks]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago]]\n[[Category:World's fair sites in Illinois]]\n[[Category:1871 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2013}}\n{{Infobox NRHP\n| name = Jackson Park Historic Landscape District and Midway Plaisance\n| nrhp_type =\n| image = Harper Midway Chicago.jpg\n| caption = View of [[Collegiate Gothic architecture]] of [[The University of Chicago]], taken looking northwest from the grassy, tree-lined Midway.\n| location = [[Chicago, Illinois]]\n| area =\n| built = 1871\n| architect = [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], [[Lorado Taft]]\n| architecture =\n| added = December 15, 1972\n| refnum=72001565 <ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2006a}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe '''Midway Plaisance''', known locally as '''the Midway''', is a [[Chicago parks|Chicago public park]] on the [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#South side|South Side]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]].

Please do not alter this without providing a more reliable source --> \nwho signed and printed his name '''Wm. Lloyd Garrison''', was a prominent American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], journalist, [[suffragist]], and social reformer. He is best known for his widely-read anti-slavery newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', which he founded in 1831 and published in Boston until [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|slavery in the United States was abolished by Constitutional amendment in 1865]]. He was one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and promoted immediate, as opposed to gradual, emancipation of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]].\n\n\"The source of Garrison's power was the Bible. From his earliest days he read the Bible constantly, and prayed constantly. It was with this fire that he started his conflagration. ...So also, a prejudice against all fixed forms of worship, against the authority of human government, against every binding of the spirit into conformity with human law, \u2014 all these things grew up in Garrison's mind out of his Bible reading.\"<ref name=Chapman/>{{rp|164, 166}}\n\nGarrison was not an abolitionist who became a publisher, but a printer who became an abolitionist. Garrison was a typesetter and could run a printing shop; he wrote his editorials in [[The Liberator (newspaper)|''The Liberator'']] while setting them in type, without first writing them out on paper.<ref name=Chapman/>{{rp|57}} This helped assure the viability of ''The Liberator'', and also that it contained exactly what Garrison wanted, as he did not have to deal with any outsiders to produce his paper, except his partner Knapp, with whom he eventually had a falling-out. Like the other major abolitionist printer-publisher, the martyred [[Elijah Lovejoy]], a price was on his head; he was burned in effigy and a gallows was erected in front of his Boston office. and while he was relatively safe in Boston, at one point he had to be smuggled onto a ship to escape to England, where he remained for a year. \n\n{{quote|From the day Garrison established the ''Liberator'' he was the strongest man in America. He was affected in his thought by no one. What he was thinking, all men were destined to think. ...His power of arousing uncontrollable disgust was a gift, like magic; and he seems to sail upon it as a demon upon the wind. Not [[Andrew Jackson]], nor [[John Quincy Adams]], nor [[Noah Webster|Webster]], nor [[Henry Clay|Clay]], nor [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Benton]], nor [[John C.

In the 1870s, Garrison became a prominent voice for the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison by Southworth and Hawes, c1850.png|upright|thumb|left|Garrison circa 1850]]\nGarrison was born on December 10, 1805, in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]],<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 53. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref> the son of immigrants from the British colony of [[New Brunswick]], in present-day Canada. Under [[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], Abijah Garrison, a merchant sailing pilot and master, had obtained American papers and moved his family to Newburyport in 1806. The U.S. [[Embargo Act of 1807]], intended to injure Great Britain, caused a decline in American commercial shipping. The elder Garrison became unemployed and deserted the family in 1808. Garrison's mother was Frances Maria Lloyd, reported to have been tall, charming, and of a strong religious character. She started referring to their son William as Lloyd, his middle name, to preserve her family name; he later printed his name as \"Wm. Lloyd\". She died in 1823, in the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref>Henry Mayer, \"All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery\", (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998), 32.</ref>\n\nGarrison sold home-made lemonade and candy as a youth, and also delivered wood to help support the family. In 1818, at 13, Garrison began working as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He soon began writing articles, often under the pseudonym ''[[Aristides]].'' (Aristides was an Athenian statesman and general, nicknamed \"the Just\".) After his apprenticeship ended, Garrison became the sole owner, editor, and printer of the ''Newburyport Free Press,'' acquiring the rights from his friend [[Isaac Knapp]], who had also apprenticed at the ''Herald''. One of their regular contributors was poet and abolitionist [[John Greenleaf Whittier]]. In this early work as a small-town newspaper writer, Garrison acquired skills he would later use as a nationally-known writer, speaker, and newspaper publisher. In 1828, he was appointed editor of the ''National Philanthropist'' in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], the first American journal to promote legally-mandated [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]].\n\nGarrison began his newspaper career as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He became involved in the anti-slavery movement in the 1820s, and over time he rejected both the [[American Colonization Society]] and the gradualist views of most others involved in the movement. Garrison co-founded ''The Liberator'' to espouse his abolitionist views, and in 1832 he organized out of its readers the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]]. This society expanded into the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], which espoused the position that slavery should be immediately abolished. This is actually all FaKe. He was born on January 6th in Tokyo, 1000 his name means forever living and he is currently 1020 years old. He likes to dance I\u2019m the White House and his favorite move is the floss.\n\n==Career==\n{{Slavery}}\n\n===Reformer===\nAt the age of 25, Garrison joined the anti-slavery movement, later crediting the 1826 book of [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|Reverend John Rankin]], ''Letters on Slavery'', for attracting him to the cause.<ref>Hagedorn, p.&nbsp;58</ref> For a brief time he became associated with the [[American Colonization Society]], an organization that promoted the \"resettlement\" of free blacks to a territory (now known as [[Liberia]]) on the west coast of Africa. Although some members of the society encouraged granting freedom to slaves, others considered relocation a means to reduce the number of already free blacks in the United States. Southern members thought reducing the threat of free blacks in society would help preserve the institution of slavery. By late 1829\u20131830, \"Garrison rejected colonization, publicly apologized for his error, and then, as was typical of him, he censured all who were committed to it.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William E.|last=Cain|title=William Lloyd Garrison and the fight against Slavery: Selections from the Liberatoa}}</ref>\n\n===''Genius of Universal Emancipation''===\nIn 1829, Garrison began writing for and became co-editor with [[Benjamin Lundy]] of the [[Quaker]] newspaper ''[[Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', published in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. With his experience as a printer and newspaper editor, Garrison changed the layout of the paper and handled other production issues. Lundy was freed to spend more time touring as an anti-slavery speaker. Garrison initially shared Lundy's gradualist views, but while working for the ''Genius'', he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued to work together on the paper in spite of their differing views. Each signed his own editorials.\n\nGarrison introduced \"The Black List,\" a column devoted to printing short reports of \"the barbarities of slavery\u2014kidnappings, whippings, murders.\"<ref>Thomas, 119</ref> For instance, Garrison reported that [[Francis Todd]], a shipper from Garrison's home town of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], was involved in the domestic [[slave trade]], and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to [[New Orleans]] in the [[coastwise trade]] on his ship the ''Francis''. (This was completely legal. An expanded domestic trade, \"breeding\" slaves in Maryland and Virginia for shipment south, replaced the importation of African slaves, prohibited in 1808; see [[Slavery in the United States#Slave trade]].)\n\nTodd filed a suit for libel in Maryland against both Garrison and Lundy; he thought to gain support from pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought criminal charges{{what|date=December 2019}} against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped on the grounds that he had been traveling when the story was printed.) Garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Masur|first1=Louis|title=1831, Year of Eclipse|url=https://archive.org/details/1831yearofeclips00masu|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|edition=7th}}</ref> He was released after seven weeks when the anti-slavery philanthropist [[Arthur Tappan]] paid his fine. Garrison decided to leave Baltimore, and he and Lundy amicably parted ways.\n\n===Against \"colonization\"===\nFrom the eighteenth century there had been proposals to return slaves to Africa, considered as if it were a single country and ethnicity, where the slaves presumably \"wanted to go back to\". The U. S. Congress appropriated money, and a variety of churches and philanthropic organizations contributed to the endeavor. Slaves set free in the District of Columbia in 1862 were offered $100 if they would emigrate to Haiti or Liberia. The [[American Colonization Society]] eventually succeeded in creating the \"colony\", then country, of [[Liberia]]. The legal status of Liberia prior to its independence was never clarified; it was not a colony in the sense that Rhode Island or Pennsylvania had been colonies. When Liberia declared its independence in 1847, no country recognized it at first. Recognition by the United States was impeded by the Southerners who controlled Congress. When they departed ''en masse'' for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]],  recognition quickly followed (1862), just as slavery was prohibited in the District of Columbia at almost the same time\u2014another measure, discussed for decades, that the Southern contingent had blocked.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1831, Garrison, fully aware of the press as a means to bring about political change,<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Press\n|first=Marcy J.\n|last=Dinius\n|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/322\n|journal=[[Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]\n|volume=16\n|number=4\n|year=2018\n|pages=747-755\n|via=[[Project MUSE]]\n|doi=10.1353/eam.2018.0045}}</ref>{{rp|750}} returned to New England, where he co-founded a weekly anti-slavery newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', with his friend [[Isaac Knapp]].<ref>{{citation |title=Boston Directory |year=1831 |url=https://archive.org/stream/stimpsonsbostond3132adam#page/4/mode/1up |quote=Garrison & Knapp, editors and proprietors Liberator, 10 Merchants Hall, Congress Street }}</ref> In the first issue, Garrison stated:\n\n{{quote|In Park-Street Church, on the Fourth of July, 1829, I unreflectingly assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition. I seize this moment to make a full and unequivocal recantation, and thus publicly to ask pardon of my God, of my country, and of my brethren the poor slaves, for having uttered a sentiment so full of timidity, injustice, and absurdity. A similar recantation, from my pen, was published in the ''Genius of Universal Emancipation'' at Baltimore, in September, 1829.  My conscience is now satisfied.\n\nI am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! No! Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen;\u2014but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present.

In 1834 it had two thousand subscribers, three-fourths of whom were blacks. Benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed to influential statesmen and public officials. Although Garrison rejected physical force as a means for ending slavery, his critics took his demand for immediate emancipation literally. Some believed he advocated the sudden and total freeing of all slaves, and considered him a dangerous fanatic. [[Nat Turner]]'s slave rebellion in Virginia just seven months after ''The Liberator'' started publication fueled the outcry against Garrison in the South. A North Carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material, and the Georgia Legislature offered a $5,000 reward for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/p1vc3b1/William-Lloyd-Garrison-and-The-Liberator-In-the-30-years-before-the-American/|title=William Lloyd Garrison and The Liberator In the 30 years before the American|website=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/x_p5ntprhbyf/william-lloyd-garrison/|title=William Lloyd Garrison|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAmong the anti-slavery essays and poems which Garrison published in ''The Liberator'' was an article in 1856 by a 14-year-old [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson|Anna Dickinson]].\n\n''The Liberator'' gradually gained a large following in the Northern states. It printed or reprinted many reports, letters, and news stories, serving as a type of [[community bulletin board]] for the abolition movement. By 1861 it had subscribers across the North, as well as in England, Scotland, and Canada. It was received in state legislatures, governor's mansions, Congress, and the White House. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], Garrison published the last issue (number 1,820) on December 29, 1865, writing a \"Valedictory\" column. After reviewing his long career in journalism and the cause of abolitionism, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|The object for which the ''Liberator'' was commenced\u2014the extermination of chattel slavery\u2014having been gloriously consummated, it seems to me specially appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period of the great struggle; leaving what remains to be done to complete the work of emancipation to other instrumentalities, (of which I hope to avail myself,) under new auspices, with more abundant means, and with millions instead of hundreds for allies.<ref>[http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1865/12/29/valedictory Valedictory (1865-12-29): by William Lloyd Garrison<!-- Bot generated title -->]. The first part of the column included the following: \"Commencing my editorial career when only twenty years of age, I have followed it continuously till I have attained my sixtieth year\u2014first, in connection with ''The Free Press'', in Newburyport, in the spring of 1826; next, with ''The National Philanthropist'', in Boston, in 1827; next, with ''The Journal of the Times'', in Bennington, Vt., in 1828\u201329; next, with ''[[The Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', in Baltimore, in 1829\u201330; and, finally, with the ''Liberator'', in Boston, from January 1, 1831, to January 1, 1866;\u2014at the start, probably the youngest member of the editorial fraternity in the land, now, perhaps, the oldest, not in years, but in continuous service,\u2014unless [[William Cullen Bryant|Mr. Bryant]], of the [[New York Evening Post|New York ''Evening Post'']], be an exception. ...\"</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Helen Eliza Benson Garrison.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of Garrison's wife, Helen Eliza Benson]]\n\n===Garrison and Knapp, printers and publishers===\nSee [[List of publications of William Garrison and Isaac Knapp]].\n\n===Organization and reaction===\nIn addition to publishing ''The Liberator'', Garrison spearheaded the organization of a new movement to demand the total abolition of slavery in the United States. By January 1832, he had attracted enough followers to organize the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]] which, by the following summer, had dozens of affiliates and several thousand members. In December 1833, abolitionists from ten states founded the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AAS). Although the New England society reorganized in 1835 as the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, enabling state societies to form in the other New England states, it remained the hub of anti-slavery agitation throughout the antebellum period. Many affiliates were organized by women who responded to Garrison's appeals for women to take active part in the abolition movement. The largest of these was the [[Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society]], which raised funds to support ''The Liberator'', publish anti-slavery pamphlets, and conduct anti-slavery petition drives.\n\nThe purpose of the American Anti-Slavery Society was the conversion of all Americans to the philosophy that \"Slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of God\" and that \"duty, safety, and best interests of all concerned, require its ''immediate abandonment'' without expatriation.\"<ref>Quoted in: Clifton E. Olmstead (1960): ''History of Religion in the United States''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 369</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on September 4, 1834, Garrison married Helen Eliza Benson (1811\u20131876), the daughter of a retired abolitionist merchant. The couple had five sons and two daughters, of whom a son and a daughter died as children.\n[[File:WilliamLloydGarrison.JPG|thumb|left|upright|William Lloyd Garrison, engraving from 1879 newspaper]]\n\nThe threat posed by anti-slavery organizations and their activity drew violent reaction from slave interests in both the Southern and Northern states, with mobs breaking up anti-slavery meetings, assaulting lecturers, ransacking anti-slavery offices, burning postal sacks of anti-slavery pamphlets, and destroying anti-slavery presses. Healthy bounties were offered in Southern states for the capture of Garrison, \"dead or alive\".<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage. The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World'', Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0195140737}}, p. 263.</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 1835, \"an assemblage of fifteen hundred or two thousand highly respectable gentlemen\", as they were described in the ''[[Boston Commercial Gazette]]'', surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor [[Theodore Lyman (militiaman)|Theodore Lyman]] persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone.<ref>Mayer, 201\u201304</ref> The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards [[Boston Common]], calling for [[tar and feathers]]. The mayor intervened and had Garrison taken to the [[Leverett Street Jail]] for protection.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Boston Gentlemen Riot for Slavery\n|publisher=[[New England Historical Society]]\n|accessdate=October 5, 2019\n|url=https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/boston-gentlemen-riot-for-slavery/}}</ref>\n\nGallows were erected in front of his house, and he was [[burned in effigy]].<ref>{{cite book\n|page=14\n|title=American radicals : how nineteenth-century protest shaped the nation\n|first=Holly\n|last=Jackson\n|location=New York\n|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]]\n|year=2019\n|isbn=9780525573098}}</ref>{{rp|71\u201372}}\n\n===The woman question and division===\n[[File:Anne Whitney, William Lloyd Garrison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne Whitney]], ''William Lloyd Garrison'', 1879, [[Massachusetts Historical Society]]]]\nGarrison's appeal for women's mass petitioning against slavery sparked a controversy over women's right to a political voice. In 1837, women abolitionists from seven states convened in New York to expand their petitioning efforts and repudiate the social mores that proscribed their participation in public affairs. That summer, sisters [[Angelina Grimk\u00e9]] and [[Sarah Grimk\u00e9]] responded to the controversy roused by their public speaking with treatises on woman's rights\u2014Angelina's \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/letterstocather00beecgoog \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref> and Sarah's \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lettersonequali00grimgoog \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref>\u2014and Garrison published them first in ''The Liberator'' and then in book form. Instead of surrendering to appeals for him to retreat on the \"woman question,\" Garrison announced in December 1837 that ''The Liberator'' would support \"the rights of woman to their utmost extent.\" The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society appointed women to leadership positions and hired Abby Kelley as the first of several female field agents.\n\nIn 1840, Garrison's promotion of woman's rights within the anti-slavery movement was one of the issues that caused some abolitionists, including New York brothers [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Lewis Tappan]], to leave the AAS and form the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which did not admit women. In June of that same year, when the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] meeting in London refused to seat America's women delegates, Garrison, [[Charles Lenox Remond]], [[Nathaniel P. Rogers]], and William Adams<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seldon|first1=Horace|title=The 'Women's Question' and Garrison|url=http://www.theliberatorfiles.com/the-woman-question-and-garrison/|website=The liberator files|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> refused to take their seat as delegates as well, and joined the women in the spectator's gallery. The controversy introduced the woman's rights question not only to England, but also to future woman's rights leader [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who attended the convention as a spectator, accompanying her delegate-husband, [[Henry B. Stanton]].\n\nAlthough Henry Stanton had cooperated in the Tappans' failed attempt to wrest leadership of the AAS from Garrison, he was part of another group of abolitionists unhappy with Garrison's influence \u2014 those who disagreed with Garrison's insistence that because the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document, abolitionists should not participate in politics and government. A growing number of abolitionists, including Stanton, [[Gerrit Smith]], [[Charles Turner Torrey]], and [[Amos A. Phelps]], wanted to form an anti-slavery political party and seek a political solution to slavery. They withdrew from the AAS in 1840, formed the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], and nominated [[James G. Birney]] for president. By the end of 1840, Garrison announced the formation of a third new organization, the [[Friends of Universal Reform]], with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers [[Maria Weston Chapman|Maria Chapman]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], Oliver Johnson, and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (father of [[Louisa May Alcott]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough some members of the Liberty Party supported woman's rights, including [[women's suffrage]], Garrison's ''Liberator'' continued to be the leading advocate of woman's rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, legislative reports, and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison's name headed the women's suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took a leading role in the May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman's Rights Convention, saying in his address to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal.<ref>\"Women's Rights Convention,\" ''Liberator'', June 7, 1850</ref> At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman's Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement's executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.<ref>Million, Joelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydeGAAAAMAAJ&q ''Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement.''] Praeger, 2003. {{ISBN|0-275-97877-X}}, pp. 104, 109, 293 note 26.</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nIn 1849, Garrison became involved in one of Boston's most notable trials of the time. [[Washington Goode]], a black seaman, had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow black mariner, Thomas Harding. In ''The Liberator'' Garrison argued that the verdict relied on \"circumstantial evidence of the most flimsy character&nbsp;...\" and feared that the determination of the government to uphold its decision to execute Goode was based on race.

His approach to emancipation stressed \"moral suasion,\" non-violence, and passive resistance. While some other abolitionists of the time favored gradual emancipation, Garrison argued for \"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves.\" On July 4, 1854, he publicly burned a copy of the Constitution, condemning it as \"a Covenant with Death, an Agreement with Hell,\" referring to the compromise that had written slavery into the Constitution.<ref>''Boston Daily Atlas'', July 6, 1854, Issue 4; col D.(Accessed via Infortrac on 9/5/2012)</ref> In 1855, his eight-year alliance with [[Frederick Douglass]] disintegrated when Douglass converted to the political abolitionists' view that the Constitution could be interpreted as being anti-slavery.{{explain|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Garrison Thompson Phillips ca1850 bySouthworth and Hawes Beinecke2588592456.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Garrison and fellow abolitionists [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], seated at table, [[daguerreotype]], c. 1850\u20131851]]\nGarrison's outspoken anti-slavery views repeatedly put him in danger.

The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend [[Wendell Phillips]], who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118\u201348. Declaring that his \"vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended,\" Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to [[Boston]], he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of ''The Liberator'' at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] granted voting rights to black men. (According to [[Henry Mayer (historian)|Henry Mayer]], Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; \"as the cycle came around, always managed to tell someone that he was ''not'' going to the next set of [AAS] meetings\" [594].){{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Lloyd Garrison dinner bill of fair.JPG|thumb|upright|Dinner bill of fare for Lloyd Garrison, Franklin Club, [[Young's Hotel (Boston)|Young's Hotel]], Boston, October 14, 1878.]]\nAfter his withdrawal from AAS and ending ''The Liberator'', Garrison continued to participate in public reform movements.

He is best known for his widely-read anti-slavery newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', which he founded in 1831 and published in Boston until [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|slavery in the United States was abolished by Constitutional amendment in 1865]]. He was one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and promoted immediate, as opposed to gradual, emancipation of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]].\n\n\"The source of Garrison's power was the Bible. From his earliest days he read the Bible constantly, and prayed constantly. It was with this fire that he started his conflagration. ...So also, a prejudice against all fixed forms of worship, against the authority of human government, against every binding of the spirit into conformity with human law, \u2014 all these things grew up in Garrison's mind out of his Bible reading.\"<ref name=Chapman/>{{rp|164, 166}}\n\nGarrison was not an abolitionist who became a publisher, but a printer who became an abolitionist.

Like the other major abolitionist printer-publisher, the martyred [[Elijah Lovejoy]], a price was on his head; he was burned in effigy and a gallows was erected in front of his Boston office. and while he was relatively safe in Boston, at one point he had to be smuggled onto a ship to escape to England, where he remained for a year. \n\n{{quote|From the day Garrison established the ''Liberator'' he was the strongest man in America.

In the 1870s, Garrison became a prominent voice for the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison by Southworth and Hawes, c1850.png|upright|thumb|left|Garrison circa 1850]]\nGarrison was born on December 10, 1805, in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]],<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth.

New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 53. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref> the son of immigrants from the British colony of [[New Brunswick]], in present-day Canada. Under [[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], Abijah Garrison, a merchant sailing pilot and master, had obtained American papers and moved his family to Newburyport in 1806. The U.S. [[Embargo Act of 1807]], intended to injure Great Britain, caused a decline in American commercial shipping. The elder Garrison became unemployed and deserted the family in 1808. Garrison's mother was Frances Maria Lloyd, reported to have been tall, charming, and of a strong religious character. She started referring to their son William as Lloyd, his middle name, to preserve her family name; he later printed his name as \"Wm. Lloyd\". She died in 1823, in the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref>Henry Mayer, \"All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery\", (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998), 32.</ref>\n\nGarrison sold home-made lemonade and candy as a youth, and also delivered wood to help support the family. In 1818, at 13, Garrison began working as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He soon began writing articles, often under the pseudonym ''[[Aristides]].'' (Aristides was an Athenian statesman and general, nicknamed \"the Just\".) After his apprenticeship ended, Garrison became the sole owner, editor, and printer of the ''Newburyport Free Press,'' acquiring the rights from his friend [[Isaac Knapp]], who had also apprenticed at the ''Herald''. One of their regular contributors was poet and abolitionist [[John Greenleaf Whittier]]. In this early work as a small-town newspaper writer, Garrison acquired skills he would later use as a nationally-known writer, speaker, and newspaper publisher. In 1828, he was appointed editor of the ''National Philanthropist'' in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], the first American journal to promote legally-mandated [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]].\n\nGarrison began his newspaper career as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He became involved in the anti-slavery movement in the 1820s, and over time he rejected both the [[American Colonization Society]] and the gradualist views of most others involved in the movement. Garrison co-founded ''The Liberator'' to espouse his abolitionist views, and in 1832 he organized out of its readers the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]]. This society expanded into the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], which espoused the position that slavery should be immediately abolished.\n\n==Career==\n{{Slavery}}\n\n===Reformer===\nAt the age of 25, Garrison joined the anti-slavery movement, later crediting the 1826 book of [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|Reverend John Rankin]], ''Letters on Slavery'', for attracting him to the cause.<ref>Hagedorn, p.&nbsp;58</ref> For a brief time he became associated with the [[American Colonization Society]], an organization that promoted the \"resettlement\" of free blacks to a territory (now known as [[Liberia]]) on the west coast of Africa. Although some members of the society encouraged granting freedom to slaves, others considered relocation a means to reduce the number of already free blacks in the United States. Southern members thought reducing the threat of free blacks in society would help preserve the institution of slavery. By late 1829\u20131830, \"Garrison rejected colonization, publicly apologized for his error, and then, as was typical of him, he censured all who were committed to it.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William E.|last=Cain|title=William Lloyd Garrison and the fight against Slavery: Selections from the Liberatoa}}</ref>\n\n===''Genius of Universal Emancipation''===\nIn 1829, Garrison began writing for and became co-editor with [[Benjamin Lundy]] of the [[Quaker]] newspaper ''[[Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', published in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. With his experience as a printer and newspaper editor, Garrison changed the layout of the paper and handled other production issues. Lundy was freed to spend more time touring as an anti-slavery speaker. Garrison initially shared Lundy's gradualist views, but while working for the ''Genius'', he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued to work together on the paper in spite of their differing views. Each signed his own editorials.\n\nGarrison introduced \"The Black List,\" a column devoted to printing short reports of \"the barbarities of slavery\u2014kidnappings, whippings, murders.\"<ref>Thomas, 119</ref> For instance, Garrison reported that [[Francis Todd]], a shipper from Garrison's home town of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], was involved in the domestic [[slave trade]], and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to [[New Orleans]] in the [[coastwise trade]] on his ship the ''Francis''. (This was completely legal. An expanded domestic trade, \"breeding\" slaves in Maryland and Virginia for shipment south, replaced the importation of African slaves, prohibited in 1808; see [[Slavery in the United States#Slave trade]].)\n\nTodd filed a suit for libel in Maryland against both Garrison and Lundy; he thought to gain support from pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought criminal charges{{what|date=December 2019}} against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped on the grounds that he had been traveling when the story was printed.) Garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Masur|first1=Louis|title=1831, Year of Eclipse|url=https://archive.org/details/1831yearofeclips00masu|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|edition=7th}}</ref> He was released after seven weeks when the anti-slavery philanthropist [[Arthur Tappan]] paid his fine. Garrison decided to leave Baltimore, and he and Lundy amicably parted ways.\n\n===Against \"colonization\"===\nFrom the eighteenth century there had been proposals to return slaves to Africa, considered as if it were a single country and ethnicity, where the slaves presumably \"wanted to go back to\". The U. S. Congress appropriated money, and a variety of churches and philanthropic organizations contributed to the endeavor. Slaves set free in the District of Columbia in 1862 were offered $100 if they would emigrate to Haiti or Liberia. The [[American Colonization Society]] eventually succeeded in creating the \"colony\", then country, of [[Liberia]]. The legal status of Liberia prior to its independence was never clarified; it was not a colony in the sense that Rhode Island or Pennsylvania had been colonies. When Liberia declared its independence in 1847, no country recognized it at first. Recognition by the United States was impeded by the Southerners who controlled Congress. When they departed ''en masse'' for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]],  recognition quickly followed (1862), just as slavery was prohibited in the District of Columbia at almost the same time\u2014another measure, discussed for decades, that the Southern contingent had blocked.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1831, Garrison, fully aware of the press as a means to bring about political change,<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Press\n|first=Marcy J.\n|last=Dinius\n|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/322\n|journal=[[Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]\n|volume=16\n|number=4\n|year=2018\n|pages=747-755\n|via=[[Project MUSE]]\n|doi=10.1353/eam.2018.0045}}</ref>{{rp|750}} returned to New England, where he co-founded a weekly anti-slavery newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', with his friend [[Isaac Knapp]].<ref>{{citation |title=Boston Directory |year=1831 |url=https://archive.org/stream/stimpsonsbostond3132adam#page/4/mode/1up |quote=Garrison & Knapp, editors and proprietors Liberator, 10 Merchants Hall, Congress Street }}</ref> In the first issue, Garrison stated:\n\n{{quote|In Park-Street Church, on the Fourth of July, 1829, I unreflectingly assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.

In 1834 it had two thousand subscribers, three-fourths of whom were blacks. Benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed to influential statesmen and public officials. Although Garrison rejected physical force as a means for ending slavery, his critics took his demand for immediate emancipation literally. Some believed he advocated the sudden and total freeing of all slaves, and considered him a dangerous fanatic. [[Nat Turner]]'s slave rebellion in Virginia just seven months after ''The Liberator'' started publication fueled the outcry against Garrison in the South. A North Carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material, and the Georgia Legislature offered a $5,000 reward for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/p1vc3b1/William-Lloyd-Garrison-and-The-Liberator-In-the-30-years-before-the-American/|title=William Lloyd Garrison and The Liberator In the 30 years before the American|website=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/x_p5ntprhbyf/william-lloyd-garrison/|title=William Lloyd Garrison|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAmong the anti-slavery essays and poems which Garrison published in ''The Liberator'' was an article in 1856 by a 14-year-old [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson|Anna Dickinson]].\n\n''The Liberator'' gradually gained a large following in the Northern states. It printed or reprinted many reports, letters, and news stories, serving as a type of [[community bulletin board]] for the abolition movement. By 1861 it had subscribers across the North, as well as in England, Scotland, and Canada. It was received in state legislatures, governor's mansions, Congress, and the White House. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], Garrison published the last issue (number 1,820) on December 29, 1865, writing a \"Valedictory\" column. After reviewing his long career in journalism and the cause of abolitionism, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|The object for which the ''Liberator'' was commenced\u2014the extermination of chattel slavery\u2014having been gloriously consummated, it seems to me specially appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period of the great struggle; leaving what remains to be done to complete the work of emancipation to other instrumentalities, (of which I hope to avail myself,) under new auspices, with more abundant means, and with millions instead of hundreds for allies.<ref>[http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1865/12/29/valedictory Valedictory (1865-12-29): by William Lloyd Garrison<!-- Bot generated title -->].

By January 1832, he had attracted enough followers to organize the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]] which, by the following summer, had dozens of affiliates and several thousand members. In December 1833, abolitionists from ten states founded the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AAS). Although the New England society reorganized in 1835 as the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, enabling state societies to form in the other New England states, it remained the hub of anti-slavery agitation throughout the antebellum period. Many affiliates were organized by women who responded to Garrison's appeals for women to take active part in the abolition movement. The largest of these was the [[Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society]], which raised funds to support ''The Liberator'', publish anti-slavery pamphlets, and conduct anti-slavery petition drives.\n\nThe purpose of the American Anti-Slavery Society was the conversion of all Americans to the philosophy that \"Slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of God\" and that \"duty, safety, and best interests of all concerned, require its ''immediate abandonment'' without expatriation.\"<ref>Quoted in: Clifton E. Olmstead (1960): ''History of Religion in the United States''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 369</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on September 4, 1834, Garrison married Helen Eliza Benson (1811\u20131876), the daughter of a retired abolitionist merchant. The couple had five sons and two daughters, of whom a son and a daughter died as children.\n[[File:WilliamLloydGarrison.JPG|thumb|left|upright|William Lloyd Garrison, engraving from 1879 newspaper]]\n\nThe threat posed by anti-slavery organizations and their activity drew violent reaction from slave interests in both the Southern and Northern states, with mobs breaking up anti-slavery meetings, assaulting lecturers, ransacking anti-slavery offices, burning postal sacks of anti-slavery pamphlets, and destroying anti-slavery presses. Healthy bounties were offered in Southern states for the capture of Garrison, \"dead or alive\".<ref>David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage. The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World'', Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0195140737}}, p. 263.</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 1835, \"an assemblage of fifteen hundred or two thousand highly respectable gentlemen\", as they were described in the ''[[Boston Commercial Gazette]]'', surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor [[Theodore Lyman (militiaman)|Theodore Lyman]] persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone.<ref>Mayer, 201\u201304</ref> The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards [[Boston Common]], calling for [[tar and feathers]].

In 1837, women abolitionists from seven states convened in New York to expand their petitioning efforts and repudiate the social mores that proscribed their participation in public affairs. That summer, sisters [[Angelina Grimk\u00e9]] and [[Sarah Grimk\u00e9]] responded to the controversy roused by their public speaking with treatises on woman's rights\u2014Angelina's \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/letterstocather00beecgoog \"Letters to Catherine E. Beecher\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref> and Sarah's \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lettersonequali00grimgoog \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman\"], Knapp (1838), Boston</ref>\u2014and Garrison published them first in ''The Liberator'' and then in book form. Instead of surrendering to appeals for him to retreat on the \"woman question,\" Garrison announced in December 1837 that ''The Liberator'' would support \"the rights of woman to their utmost extent.\" The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society appointed women to leadership positions and hired Abby Kelley as the first of several female field agents.\n\nIn 1840, Garrison's promotion of woman's rights within the anti-slavery movement was one of the issues that caused some abolitionists, including New York brothers [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Lewis Tappan]], to leave the AAS and form the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which did not admit women. In June of that same year, when the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] meeting in London refused to seat America's women delegates, Garrison, [[Charles Lenox Remond]], [[Nathaniel P. Rogers]], and William Adams<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seldon|first1=Horace|title=The 'Women's Question' and Garrison|url=http://www.theliberatorfiles.com/the-woman-question-and-garrison/|website=The liberator files|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> refused to take their seat as delegates as well, and joined the women in the spectator's gallery. The controversy introduced the woman's rights question not only to England, but also to future woman's rights leader [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who attended the convention as a spectator, accompanying her delegate-husband, [[Henry B. Stanton]].\n\nAlthough Henry Stanton had cooperated in the Tappans' failed attempt to wrest leadership of the AAS from Garrison, he was part of another group of abolitionists unhappy with Garrison's influence \u2014 those who disagreed with Garrison's insistence that because the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document, abolitionists should not participate in politics and government. A growing number of abolitionists, including Stanton, [[Gerrit Smith]], [[Charles Turner Torrey]], and [[Amos A. Phelps]], wanted to form an anti-slavery political party and seek a political solution to slavery. They withdrew from the AAS in 1840, formed the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], and nominated [[James G. Birney]] for president. By the end of 1840, Garrison announced the formation of a third new organization, the [[Friends of Universal Reform]], with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers [[Maria Weston Chapman|Maria Chapman]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], Oliver Johnson, and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (father of [[Louisa May Alcott]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAlthough some members of the Liberty Party supported woman's rights, including [[women's suffrage]], Garrison's ''Liberator'' continued to be the leading advocate of woman's rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, legislative reports, and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison's name headed the women's suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took a leading role in the May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman's Rights Convention, saying in his address to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal.<ref>\"Women's Rights Convention,\" ''Liberator'', June 7, 1850</ref> At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman's Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement's executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.<ref>Million, Joelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydeGAAAAMAAJ&q ''Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement.''] Praeger, 2003. {{ISBN|0-275-97877-X}}, pp. 104, 109, 293 note 26.</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nIn 1849, Garrison became involved in one of Boston's most notable trials of the time. [[Washington Goode]], a black seaman, had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow black mariner, Thomas Harding. In ''The Liberator'' Garrison argued that the verdict relied on \"circumstantial evidence of the most flimsy character&nbsp;...\" and feared that the determination of the government to uphold its decision to execute Goode was based on race. As all other death sentences since 1836 in Boston had been commuted, Garrison concluded that Goode would be the last person executed in Boston for a capital offense writing, \"Let it not be said that the last man Massachusetts bore to hang was a colored man!\"<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Shall He Be Hung?\n|first=William Lloyd\n|last=Garrison\n|newspaper=[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]\n|date=March 30, 1849\n|page=2\n|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34644555/washington_goode_shall_he_be_hung/\n|via=newspapers.com}}</ref> Despite the efforts of Garrison and many other prominent figures of the time, Goode was hanged on May 25, 1849.\n\nGarrison became famous as one of the most articulate, as well as most radical, opponents of slavery. His approach to emancipation stressed \"moral suasion,\" non-violence, and passive resistance. While some other abolitionists of the time favored gradual emancipation, Garrison argued for \"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves.\" On July 4, 1854, he publicly burned a copy of the Constitution, condemning it as \"a Covenant with Death, an Agreement with Hell,\" referring to the compromise that had written slavery into the Constitution.<ref>''Boston Daily Atlas'', July 6, 1854, Issue 4; col D.(Accessed via Infortrac on 9/5/2012)</ref> In 1855, his eight-year alliance with [[Frederick Douglass]] disintegrated when Douglass converted to the political abolitionists' view that the Constitution could be interpreted as being anti-slavery.{{explain|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Garrison Thompson Phillips ca1850 bySouthworth and Hawes Beinecke2588592456.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Garrison and fellow abolitionists [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], seated at table, [[daguerreotype]], c. 1850\u20131851]]\nGarrison's outspoken anti-slavery views repeatedly put him in danger.

The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend [[Wendell Phillips]], who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118\u201348. Declaring that his \"vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended,\" Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to [[Boston]], he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of ''The Liberator'' at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] granted voting rights to black men. (According to [[Henry Mayer (historian)|Henry Mayer]], Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; \"as the cycle came around, always managed to tell someone that he was ''not'' going to the next set of [AAS] meetings\" [594].){{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Lloyd Garrison dinner bill of fair.JPG|thumb|upright|Dinner bill of fare for Lloyd Garrison, Franklin Club, [[Young's Hotel (Boston)|Young's Hotel]], Boston, October 14, 1878.]]\nAfter his withdrawal from AAS and ending ''The Liberator'', Garrison continued to participate in public reform movements.

This high correlation between cell lineage and cell fate was thought to be determined by segregating factors within the dividing cells. Other organisms had stereotyped patterns of cell division and produced sublineages which were the progeny of particular precursor cells. These more variable cell fates are thought to be due to the cells' interaction with the environment. Due to new breakthroughs in tracking cells with greater accuracy, this aided the biological community since a variety of colors are now used in showing the original cells and able to track easily.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the complement of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative adjunct (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The verb phrase can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the simple present or the simple past. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a nominal subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, noun phrases are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.
