The CS Naval Academy was established by an act of the [[Congress of the Confederate States]] on April 21, 1862 and graduated a number of midshipmen before being disbanded on May 2, 1865 in [[Abbeville, South Carolina]] subsequent to the fall of the Confederate States.\n\n==Mission==\nShortly after the establishment of the Confederate States of America in 1861, the nation became involved in a large war with the [[United States of America]], and the nation's [[Confederate States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Stephen Mallory]] had the responsibility to quickly build the Confederate States Navy, starting with almost no ships or resources. Among his primary goals was the establishment of an academy. Confederate States officials saw no need for a Naval Academy early in the war, due to the number of southern military schools, and so midshipmen in the early Confederate Navy were trained by the traditional system of assigning them directly to ships and batteries.<ref>Conrad, p.ix</ref>\n\nPresident [[Jefferson Davis]], a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]], quickly recognized the need for a long term plan to form both army and navy academies for the nation, and gave his vision that \"to secure a thorough military education ... it is essential that officers should enter upon the study of their profession at an early period of life and have elementary instruction in a military school.\"<ref>Conrad, p.4</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n[[Image:Csspatrickhenry.JPG|175px|right|thumb|CSS ''Patrick Hentry'', CS Naval Academy school ship]]\nThe naval college was housed on board the [[CSS Patrick Henry|CSS ''Patrick Henry'']], a seagoing sidewheel steamer with a walking-beam engine and brigantine rigged,<ref>Morgan, p.204</ref> armed with ten guns, and a veteran of the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]]. Anchored seven miles south of [[Richmond, Virginia]] at [[Drewry's Bluff]], near the [[Confederate States Marine Corps]] Camp Beall, \"she had now become the most realistic war college that ever existed.\"<ref>Morgan, p.204</ref>  Located there, ''Patrick Henry'' served the additional purpose of potentially being sunk as an obstruction in the [[James River]] channel. The CSS ''Patrick Henry'' could only accommodate 52 Midshipmen, 20 officers, professors and crew, which limited and helped dictate the size of the naval college.\n\nThe ship also functioned as a [[receiving ship]] for receiving other steamers under flags of truce, taking captured United States [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] to Harrison's Landing for exchange. Steamers under flags of truce would stop at the ''Patrick Henry'' to get their permit to continue downriver, and then return and discharge liberated former Confederate States prisoners.<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>\n[[Image:Drewry's Bluff.gif|175px|right|thumb|Drewry's Bluff, south of Richmond, Virginia on the James River]]\nThe ''Patrick Henry'' was specially modified to serve as the school ship in May 1862 when she was sent to the Rockets Navy Yard in Richmond. All but four of her guns had been mounted at the naval battery at Drewry's Bluff on the James River. The four remaining guns were used for gunnery drills and training of the midshipmen, and served to assist, when necessary, in the defense of that river location. Two class rooms made of pine boards were mounted amidships on the gun deck between the paddlewheel boxes, and an oversized fully rigged mast was placed forward for sail handling and training. Finally a small launch armed with a twelve-pound howitzer was kept on davits for training.<ref>Conrad, p.8</ref>\n\nToward the end of the war the demand for midshipman to assist with shoreside combat duty greatly increased, requiring the students to be housed in huts built inside the Drewry's Bluff batteries.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>\n\n==Supervision of the Academy==\n[[image:WilliamHParkerCSN.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Lieutenant William H. Parker, CSN: Superintendent of the CS Naval Academy]]\nThe superintendent, LT Parker, had been an instructor of seamanship at the U.S. Naval Academy, and was assisted by six CS Navy lieutenants and three CS Navy masters along with several civilian professors. The faculty worked on the hurricane deck between the paddlewheel boxes in two small recitation rooms.<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>  While serving as the superintendent Parker wrote the textbook ''Elements of Seamanship'' for the school.<ref>Conrad, p.12</ref>\n\n===Faculty and staff===\nThe following academic faculty served at CSNA:<ref>Scharf, p.774, Conrad, pp.12-14</ref>\n\n====Military Faculty====\n*Lieutenant Wiburn B.

The jackets were coarse gray cloth material,<ref>Morgan, p.205</ref> and made of wool. The sleeves of midshipmen, like all officers, had three sleeve buttons mounted vertically. In lieu of stripe, mishipman had three small buttons with fouled anchors, and passed midshipmen had three large buttons with fouled anchors mounted horizontally. A midshipman had no shoulder strap, while a passed midshipman had a strip of gold lace four inches long and half an inch wide. The covers of both ranks of midshipman were also steel gray and contained only a horizontal gold officers band with a fouled anchor, and a black leather visor.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; color:black\"\n|+ Confederate States Navy Midshipman Rank Insignia\n!

Breakfast was hard-tack and a [[decoction]] of coffee made from either sweet potatoes or beans.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>  Typically a meal was a lump of fat pork (salt-junk) or fresh meat shaving, a piece of hardtack, and a tin cup of coffee made from either chicory or burned corn.<ref>Morgan, p.205</ref>  Occasionally vegetables were served, and corn-meal.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>\n\n===Daily routine===\nThe daily life of a midshipman was centered around three activities: academic recitations and drills, work and maintenance of the school ship, and occasional help and support to actual combat operations with onshore batteries.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>  The daily schedule was composed of:\n*0700 - the morning gun\n*0800 - breakfast\n*0900\u20131200 - studies, recitations or sick call\n*1200 - dinner\n*afternoon - school exercises or dress parade\n*2130 - tattoo\n*2200 - taps\n\n===Extra-curricular activities===\nOn top of the recitation classrooms signalmen were posted who would relay wig-wag messages to the local batteries onshore. Occasionally, when the guns opened up for combat engagement they would be short of officers and a message was sent down to the school to request some midshipmen to help out. Every midshipman was eager to volunteer, and so these details to the shore batteries were given as a reward from the classroom instructors.<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>\n\n==Appointment process==\nMidshipmen were generally appointed by their representatives to the [[Congress of the Confederate States|CS Congress]] from their districts, while some appointments at large were made directly by the [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederate States]].<ref>Scharf, p.774</ref>  Candidates were required to be between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, to pass a physical examination, and an academic examination on reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic,<ref>Scharf, p. 775</ref> and to be of \"good moral character\".<ref>Conrad, p.15</ref>\n\n==Curricula==\nAcademic subjects included seamanship, gunnery, mathematics, steam engineering, navigation, English studies, French, drawing and drafting.<ref>Scharf, p.773</ref>  The basic organization, studies and regulations of the school were modeled after the curriculum and format of the U. S. Naval Academy.<ref>Scharf, p.774</ref>\n\n===Studies===\nStudies were divided into six departments and twenty-two branches, distributed in four annual courses of learning, with one course of learning assigned to each year of the four years of planned study, as follows:<ref>Scharf, p. 775</ref>\n\n*Fourth Class year &ndash; practical seamanship, naval gunnery, artillery, infantry tactics, arithmetic, algebra (to first degree equations), English grammar, descriptive geography\n*Third Class year &ndash; practical seamanship, gunnery, artillery, infantry tactics, algebra, geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, physical geography, history, French\n*Second Class year &ndash; seamanship, steam, gunnery, field artillery, astronomy, navigation, application of algebra and trigonometry to measuration of planes and solids, political science, French\n*First Class year &ndash; seamanship, naval tactics, gunnery, infantry tactics, navigation, surveying, French, Spanish\n\n===Academic board===\nSecretary Mallory provided an order for examination by a board of officers. Captain Sidney S. Lee, CSN and Captain Samuel Barron, CSN led an appointed board of examiners. The academic board held examinations of midshipmen twice a year in June and December, and as soon as a midshipman passed his examinations and was ready for sea duty, he was promoted to the rank of \"passed\" midshipman, and given orders to either a ship, battery or other duties.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>  The Academic board was composed of three captains and two commanders.\n\n==History==\n\n===1861===\nThe provisional government of the newly formed Confederate States of America established the Confederate States Navy and formed a structure for it on March 16 which \"amply authorized\" the creation of a Confederate States Naval Academy. By December of that year, the [[Congress of the Confederate States]] instructed Secretary Mallory to establish \"some form of education for midshipmen.\"<ref>Conrad, p.4</ref>\n\n===1862===\nSecretary Mallory, overwhelmed with the duties of standing up the CS Navy in the midst of a war, finally responded to the dictate from Congress in a letter to President Davis on February 27, 1862, in which he recommended the creation and establishment of a naval academy as the best form and means of educating midshipmen.<ref>Conrad, p.5</ref>  On April 21, 1862, by an act of Congress, the naval academy was approved with a total manpower level for midshipmen at 106 and that of passed midshipmen 20.<ref>Scharf, p.773, Conrad, p.6</ref>  In that same month, the CS Naval Academy started taking appointments for the school.\n\nOn May 5, 1862 five Union gunboats, including the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and the [[USS Galena (1862)|USS ''Galena'']], sailed up the James to test the Richmond defenses at [[Fort Darling]] on [[Drewry's Bluff]] which commanded a strategically powerful location on the cliffs overlooking the James River. Engaging in battle with Fort Darling's guns the ships received heavy damage and were forced to withdraw on May 15. The crew of the [[CSS Patrick Henry|CSS ''Patrick Henry'']], flagship of the [[James River Squadron]] were commended for their service during this battle, and the same day the flagship was selected to be withdrawn from combat service for conversion to house the new naval academy \"without interfering with her effciency as a vessel of war.\".<ref>Conrad, p.7</ref> The CSS ''Patrick Henry'', a 1,300&nbsp;ton sidewheel steamer, partially and lightly ironclad amidships, was pulled into Rockets Navy Yard in Richmond for refitting as a school ship, and then stationed near Drewry's Bluff where cabins were constructed ashore for the mishipmen, when they were needed to man the naval batteries there.<ref>Conrad, p.9</ref>  Drewry's Bluff also became an important training ground for the [[Confederate States Marine Corps]] Camp of Instruction.\n\nThe organization and stand up of the school was performed by LT Parker and Commander [[John Mercer Brooke]], CSN. CDR Brooke was serving as the head of the Office of Ordnance and Hydrography for the CS Navy department in Richmond and both Parker and Brooke were graduates from among the first classes of the [[United States Naval Academy]]. They were well qualified for the organization of the school and Parker had, in fact, been an instructor at the US Naval Academy for six years. LT Parker was appointed as the superintendent of the school and its midshipman, and was instructed to create the regulations for its government and submitted his regulations to CDR Brooke.\n\n===1863===\nCDR Brooke had responsibility for supervision of the school, and on July 23, 1863 the final organizational proposals and regulations that he and LT Parker had put together were approved by Secretary Mallory and the Naval Academy officially went into operation.<ref>Scharf, p.774, Conrad, p.9</ref>  Throughout the spring of 1863 materials, supplies and textbooks had been purchased and obtained for the school, including arithmetic, algebra, grammar, English and astronomy texts, and various special equipments such as azimuth compasses. The first of the midshipmen arrived onboard ''Patrick Henry''<ref>Conrad, p.10</ref> and on July 23, 1863 the Confederate Naval Academy started its first class of midshipman. Only 52 of the 106 authorized level of midshipmen reported to the Naval Academy, partly due to the limitations of boarding space on the school ship. The midshipmen were \"active\" Navy and received $500.00 annually plus room, board and uniforms.\n\nIn October 1863, [[William Harwar Parker]] became superintendent. His brother, Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, became Superintendent of USNA on July 1, 1878.\n\nDuring October, instruction and classes began for 52 midshipmen at the Confederate States Naval Academy on board [[CSS Patrick Henry]] in the James River. Numbers later increased to sixty, with thirteen teachers in attendance.\n\nHubbard T. Minor (was from the 42nd Tennessee Regiment). Hubbard's diary was a requirement to be kept at school.\n\n===1864===\nIn May 1864 Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] landed southeast of the school near [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia]] during the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign]]. Only 3,000 Confederate forces were between the [[Appomattox River]] and Richmond, forcing Commander J. K. Mitchell to employ the [[James River Squadron]] in fortifications south of the capital. LT William Parker took one detachment of midshipman on board the [[CSS Fredericksburg|CSS ''Fredericksburg'']], and LT Hall and LT Johnson took another detachment of midshipman on board the [[CSS Virginia II|CSS ''Virginia II'']]. The ships were used to defend the left flank of General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]'s army at the Howlett House battery. The midshipman were landed under the command of LT Hall and participated in several skirmishes with forces from the Union's [[Army of the James]], as the Confederate forces successfully \"bottled\" that army.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>\n\nJune 1864 raid on the {{USS|Water Witch|1851|6}}, evacuation of CSS Savannah, Confederate retreat to Richmond.\n\nBy September 1864 a lull in fighting allowed LT Parker to be relieved of command of the CSS ''Fredericksburg'' and return to the school on board the CSS ''Patrick Henry''. The school ship was moved upriver to the water front in Richmond.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>\n\nDecember 1864 \u2013 29 former U.S. Midshipmen and 30 others were passed.\n\n===1865===\nIn the spring of 1865, as the fall of Richmond became inevitable, Secretary Mallory made a decision to relocate the school further into the interior of the Condederate States, in some location possibly in North or South Carolina or Georgia. Lieutenant Graves was sent to examine locations and buildings which could be used for the move.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>  But no good location was found for the move, and the superintendent, LT Parker, rented a warehouse at the corner of Franklin and 24th Street in Richmond in March. Preparations were made for the midshipman to sink their beloved school ship as an obstruction in the [[James River]].<ref>Scharf, p.777</ref>\n\nOn the afternoon of April 2, 1865 as Richmond was being evacuated, LT Parker received the order to have the midshipman and faculty assembled at the Danville Depot by 6pm and to report to the Quartermaster General of the CS Army. LT Parker and his midshipmen were ordered to escort Jefferson Davis, his party, and the Confederate archives and treasury south. The Lieutenant took 50 of his students for that mission leaving the remaining 10 students under the command of LT Billups with the task of destroying the ship that had been their school, and the CSS Patrick Henry was set on fire and destroyed. LT Billups and the rear party never caught up with LT Parker and his main body of 50 midshipman. LT Parker and the main body guarded the train containing the public treasure of $500,000 which was destined for the new government seat of Danville. The following day, April 3, they escorted the archives of the government and the bullion of the treasury from Richmond to Danville and southward. Midshipman Raphael Semmes, Jr. was detailed to the staff of his father, Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]] and Midshipman Breckinridge was detailed as an aide to his father the [[Confederate States Secretary of War]], [[John C. Breckinridge]]<ref>Scharf, p.777</ref>\n\nFrom April 3 through April 9, LT Parker and the midshipman remained in [[Danville, Virginia]] and then moved south to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] on April 10, and to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] by April 13. Here the treasury was temporarily held in the Charlotte mint, but taken out as the contingent moved to [[Chester, South Carolina]]. The use of the train was abandoned, and the treasury was put in a wagon train, with the gold packed in small boxes and the silver in kegs. Together, with the first lady, Mrs. Jefferson Davis, they travelled to [[Abbeville, South Carolina]] by the 15th of April, and then the 17th they moved by wagon train again on to [[Washington, Georgia]], arriving on the 19th, and then in [[Augusta, Georgia]] on the 20th.<ref>Scharf, p.777</ref>\n\nBy this time, LT Parker was unable to locate either [[President Jefferson Davis]] or any member of the Confederate Treasury Department. He had, however, joined forces with a company of men under Captain Tabb back in Charlotte. LT Parker and the CSNA midshipmen were now in a dangerous situation guarding the Confederate treasury as the countryside was filled with bummers and looters tailing along behind Major General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]]'s army. LT Parker was finally able to secure the treasury, composed of coin and bullion, in the vaults of a bank in Augusta, and they remained in Augusta guarding the treasure until the armistice was signed between General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and Major General Sherman. LT Parker declined to disband the midshipman guarding the treasury, and so removed it out of the vaults and returned to Washington, Georgia while searching for President Davis, finally arriving back in Abbeville, South Carolina by the 29th of April. There they stored the treasury in a warehouse, and President Davis and his escort arrived the following day on April 30, accompanied by Secretary Mallory. LT Parker and the midshipmen turned over the treasury to the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, who had them deliver it to Brigadier General [[Basil W. Duke]], commander of the cavalry detachment escorting the President.<ref>Scharf, p.778</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1865 after approximately two years of existence, the Confederate Naval Academy ceased to exist when the school members disbanded at Abbeville, South Carolina. LT Parker issued a written order to each midshipman detaching them from the Naval Academy, and after this they were each given $40 in gold to help them reach their homes.<ref>Scharf, pp.778-779</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n\"This Patrick Henry may have been a unique institution of learning, but the \"Confederate States Naval Academy\" turned out men who afterwards became [[United States Senators]], members of Congress, judges, successful bankers, and successful business men as well as sailors.\"<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>\n\n===List of prominent alumni===\n[[File:Recollections of a Rebel Reefer.pdf|thumb|''Recollections of a Rebel Reefer'' (1917) by Colonel [[James Morris Morgan]].<ref>http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/morganjames/morgan.html</ref>]]\n\n*[[Clifton R.

The CS Naval Academy was established by an act of the [[Congress of the Confederate States]] on April 21, 1862 and graduated a number of midshipmen before being disbanded on May 2, 1865 in [[Abbeville, South Carolina]] subsequent to the fall of the Confederate States.\n\n==Mission==\nShortly after the establishment of the Confederate States of America in 1861, the nation became involved in a large war with the [[United States of America]], and the nation's [[Confederate States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Stephen Mallory]] had the responsibility to quickly build the Confederate States Navy, starting with almost no ships or resources. Among his primary goals was the establishment of an academy. Confederate States officials saw no need for a Naval Academy early in the war, due to the number of southern military schools, and so midshipmen in the early Confederate Navy were trained by the traditional system of assigning them directly to ships and batteries.<ref>Conrad, p.ix</ref>\n\nPresident [[Jefferson Davis]], a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]], quickly recognized the need for a long term plan to form both army and navy academies for the nation, and gave his vision that \"to secure a thorough military education ... it is essential that officers should enter upon the study of their profession at an early period of life and have elementary instruction in a military school.\"<ref>Conrad, p.4</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n[[Image:Csspatrickhenry.JPG|175px|right|thumb|CSS ''Patrick Hentry'', CS Naval Academy school ship]]\nThe naval college was housed on board the [[CSS Patrick Henry|CSS ''Patrick Henry'']], a seagoing sidewheel steamer with a walking-beam engine and brigantine rigged,<ref>Morgan, p.204</ref> armed with ten guns, and a veteran of the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]]. Anchored seven miles south of [[Richmond, Virginia]] at [[Drewry's Bluff]], near the [[Confederate States Marine Corps]] Camp Beall, \"she had now become the most realistic war college that ever existed.\"<ref>Morgan, p.204</ref>  Located there, ''Patrick Henry'' served the additional purpose of potentially being sunk as an obstruction in the [[James River]] channel. The CSS ''Patrick Henry'' could only accommodate 52 Midshipmen, 20 officers, professors and crew, which limited and helped dictate the size of the naval college.\n\nThe ship also functioned as a [[receiving ship]] for receiving other steamers under flags of truce, taking captured United States [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] to Harrison's Landing for exchange. Steamers under flags of truce would stop at the ''Patrick Henry'' to get their permit to continue downriver, and then return and discharge liberated former Confederate States prisoners.<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>\n[[Image:Drewry's Bluff.gif|175px|right|thumb|Drewry's Bluff, south of Richmond, Virginia on the James River]]\nThe ''Patrick Henry'' was specially modified to serve as the school ship in May 1862 when she was sent to the Rockets Navy Yard in Richmond. All but four of her guns had been mounted at the naval battery at Drewry's Bluff on the James River. The four remaining guns were used for gunnery drills and training of the midshipmen, and served to assist, when necessary, in the defense of that river location. Two class rooms made of pine boards were mounted amidships on the gun deck between the paddlewheel boxes, and an oversized fully rigged mast was placed forward for sail handling and training. Finally a small launch armed with a twelve-pound howitzer was kept on davits for training.<ref>Conrad, p.8</ref>\n\nToward the end of the war the demand for midshipman to assist with shoreside combat duty greatly increased, requiring the students to be housed in huts built inside the Drewry's Bluff batteries.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>\n\n==Supervision of the Academy==\n[[image:WilliamHParkerCSN.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Lieutenant William H. Parker, CSN: Superintendent of the CS Naval Academy]]\nThe superintendent, LT Parker, had been an instructor of seamanship at the U.S. Naval Academy, and was assisted by six CS Navy lieutenants and three CS Navy masters along with several civilian professors. The faculty worked on the hurricane deck between the paddlewheel boxes in two small recitation rooms.<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>  While serving as the superintendent Parker wrote the textbook ''Elements of Seamanship'' for the school.<ref>Conrad, p.12</ref>\n\n===Faculty and staff===\nThe following academic faculty served at CSNA:<ref>Scharf, p.774, Conrad, pp.12-14</ref>\n\n====Military Faculty====\n*Lieutenant Wiburn B.

Breafast was hard-tack and a [[decoction]] of coffee made from either sweet potatoes or beans.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>  Typically a meal was a lump of fat pork (salt-junk) or fresh meat shaving, a piece of hardtack, and a tin cup of coffee made from either chicory or burned corn.<ref>Morgan, p.205</ref>  Occasionally vegetables were served, and corn-meal.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>\n\n===Daily routine===\nThe daily life of a midshipman was centered around three activities: academic recitations and drills, work and maintenance of the school ship, and occasional help and support to actual combat operations with onshore batteries.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>  The daily schedule was composed of:\n*0700 - the morning gun\n*0800 - breakfast\n*0900\u20131200 - studies, recitations or sick call\n*1200 - dinner\n*afternoon - school exercises or dress parade\n*2130 - tattoo\n*2200 - taps\n\n===Extra-curricular activities===\nOn top of the recitation classrooms signalmen were posted who would relay wig-wag messages to the local batteries onshore. Occasionally, when the guns opened up for combat engagement they would be short of officers and a message was sent down to the school to request some midshipmen to help out. Every midshipman was eager to volunteer, and so these details to the shore batteries were given as a reward from the classroom instructors.<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>\n\n==Appointment process==\nMidshipmen were generally appointed by their representatives to the [[Congress of the Confederate States|CS Congress]] from their districts, while some appointments at large were made directly by the [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederate States]].<ref>Scharf, p.774</ref>  Candidates were required to be between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, to pass a physical examination, and an academic examination on reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic,<ref>Scharf, p. 775</ref> and to be of \"good moral character\".<ref>Conrad, p.15</ref>\n\n==Curricula==\nAcademic subjects included seamanship, gunnery, mathematics, steam engineering, navigation, English studies, French, drawing and drafting.<ref>Scharf, p.773</ref>  The basic organization, studies and regulations of the school were modeled after the curriculum and format of the U. S. Naval Academy.<ref>Scharf, p.774</ref>\n\n===Studies===\nStudies were divided into six departments and twenty-two branches, distributed in four annual courses of learning, with one course of learning assigned to each year of the four years of planned study, as follows:<ref>Scharf, p. 775</ref>\n\n*Fourth Class year &ndash; practical seamanship, naval gunnery, artillery, infantry tactics, arithmetic, algebra (to first degree equations), English grammar, descriptive geography\n*Third Class year &ndash; practical seamanship, gunnery, artillery, infantry tactics, algebra, geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, physical geography, history, French\n*Second Class year &ndash; seamanship, steam, gunnery, field artillery, astronomy, navigation, application of algebra and trigonometry to measuration of planes and solids, political science, French\n*First Class year &ndash; seamanship, naval tactics, gunnery, infantry tactics, navigation, surveying, French, Spanish\n\n===Academic board===\nSecretary Mallory provided an order for examination by a board of officers. Captain Sidney S. Lee, CSN and Captain Samuel Barron, CSN led an appointed board of examiners. The academic board held examinations of midshipmen twice a year in June and December, and as soon as a midshipman passed his examinations and was ready for sea duty, he was promoted to the rank of \"passed\" midshipman, and given orders to either a ship, battery or other duties.<ref>Scharf, p.775</ref>  The Academic board was composed of three captains and two commanders.\n\n==History==\n\n===1861===\nThe provisional government of the newly formed Confederate States of America established the Confederate States Navy and formed a structure for it on March 16 which \"amply authorized\" the creation of a Confederate States Naval Academy. By December of that year, the [[Congress of the Confederate States]] instructed Secretary Mallory to establish \"some form of education for midshipmen.\"<ref>Conrad, p.4</ref>\n\n===1862===\nSecretary Mallory, overwhelmed with the duties of standing up the CS Navy in the midst of a war, finally responded to the dictate from Congress in a letter to President Davis on February 27, 1862, in which he recommended the creation and establishment of a naval academy as the best form and means of educating midshipmen.<ref>Conrad, p.5</ref>  On April 21, 1862, by an act of Congress, the naval academy was approved with a total manpower level for midshipmen at 106 and that of passed midshipmen 20.<ref>Scharf, p.773, Conrad, p.6</ref>  In that same month, the CS Naval Academy started taking appointments for the school.\n\nOn May 5, 1862 five Union gunboats, including the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and the [[USS Galena (1862)|USS ''Galena'']], sailed up the James to test the Richmond defenses at [[Fort Darling]] on [[Drewry's Bluff]] which commanded a strategically powerful location on the cliffs overlooking the James River. Engaging in battle with Fort Darling's guns the ships received heavy damage and were forced to withdraw on May 15. The crew of the [[CSS Patrick Henry|CSS ''Patrick Henry'']], flagship of the [[James River Squadron]] were commended for their service during this battle, and the same day the flagship was selected to be withdrawn from combat service for conversion to house the new naval academy \"without interfering with her effciency as a vessel of war.\".<ref>Conrad, p.7</ref> The CSS ''Patrick Henry'', a 1,300&nbsp;ton sidewheel steamer, partially and lightly ironclad amidships, was pulled into Rockets Navy Yard in Richmond for refitting as a school ship, and then stationed near Drewry's Bluff where cabins were constructed ashore for the mishipmen, when they were needed to man the naval batteries there.<ref>Conrad, p.9</ref>  Drewry's Bluff also became an important training ground for the [[Confederate States Marine Corps]] Camp of Instruction.\n\nThe organization and stand up of the school was performed by LT Parker and Commander [[John Mercer Brooke]], CSN. CDR Brooke was serving as the head of the Office of Ordnance and Hydrography for the CS Navy department in Richmond and both Parker and Brooke were graduates from among the first classes of the [[United States Naval Academy]]. They were well qualified for the organization of the school and Parker had, in fact, been an instructor at the US Naval Academy for six years. LT Parker was appointed as the superintendent of the school and its midshipman, and was instructed to create the regulations for its government and submitted his regulations to CDR Brooke.\n\n===1863===\nCDR Brooke had responsibility for supervision of the school, and on July 23, 1863 the final organizational proposals and regulations that he and LT Parker had put together were approved by Secretary Mallory and the Naval Academy officially went into operation.<ref>Scharf, p.774, Conrad, p.9</ref>  Throughout the spring of 1863 materials, supplies and textbooks had been purchased and obtained for the school, including arithmetic, algebra, grammar, English and astronomy texts, and various special equipments such as azimuth compasses. The first of the midshipmen arrived onboard ''Patrick Henry''<ref>Conrad, p.10</ref> and on July 23, 1863 the Confederate Naval Academy started its first class of midshipman. Only 52 of the 106 authorized level of midshipmen reported to the Naval Academy, partly due to the limitations of boarding space on the school ship. The midshipmen were \"active\" Navy and received $500.00 annually plus room, board and uniforms.\n\nIn October 1863, [[William Harwar Parker]] became superintendent. His brother, Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, became Superintendent of USNA on July 1, 1878.\n\nDuring October, instruction and classes began for 52 midshipmen at the Confederate States Naval Academy on board [[CSS Patrick Henry]] in the James River. Numbers later increased to sixty, with thirteen teachers in attendance.\n\nHubbard T. Minor (was from the 42nd Tennessee Regiment). Hubbard's diary was a requirement to be kept at school.\n\n===1864===\nIn May 1864 Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] landed southeast of the school near [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia]] during the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign]]. Only 3,000 Confederate forces were between the [[Appomattox River]] and Richmond, forcing Commander J. K. Mitchell to employ the [[James River Squadron]] in fortifications south of the capital. LT William Parker took one detachment of midshipman on board the [[CSS Fredericksburg|CSS ''Fredericksburg'']], and LT Hall and LT Johnson took another detachment of midshipman on board the [[CSS Virginia II|CSS ''Virginia II'']]. The ships were used to defend the left flank of General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]'s army at the Howlett House battery. The midshipman were landed under the command of LT Hall and participated in several skirmishes with forces from the Union's [[Army of the James]], as the Confederate forces successfully \"bottled\" that army.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>\n\nJune 1864 raid on the {{USS|Water Witch|1851|6}}, evacuation of CSS Savannah, Confederate retreat to Richmond.\n\nBy September 1864 a lull in fighting allowed LT Parker to be relieved of command of the CSS ''Fredericksburg'' and return to the school on board the CSS ''Patrick Henry''. The school ship was moved upriver to the water front in Richmond.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>\n\nDecember 1864 \u2013 29 former U.S. Midshipmen and 30 others were passed.\n\n===1865===\nIn the spring of 1865, as the fall of Richmond became inevitable, Secretary Mallory made a decision to relocate the school further into the interior of the Condederate States, in some location possibly in North or South Carolina or Georgia. Lieutenant Graves was sent to examine locations and buildings which could be used for the move.<ref>Scharf, p.776</ref>  But no good location was found for the move, and the superintendent, LT Parker, rented a warehouse at the corner of Franklin and 24th Street in Richmond in March. Preparations were made for the midshipman to sink their beloved school ship as an obstruction in the [[James River]].<ref>Scharf, p.777</ref>\n\nOn the afternoon of April 2, 1865 as Richmond was being evacuated, LT Parker received the order to have the midshipman and faculty assembled at the Danville Depot by 6pm and to report to the Quartermaster General of the CS Army. LT Parker and his midshipmen were ordered to escort Jefferson Davis, his party, and the Confederate archives and treasury south. The Lieutenant took 50 of his students for that mission leaving the remaining 10 students under the command of LT Billups with the task of destroying the ship that had been their school, and the CSS Patrick Henry was set on fire and destroyed. LT Billups and the rear party never caught up with LT Parker and his main body of 50 midshipman. LT Parker and the main body guarded the train containing the public treasure of $500,000 which was destined for the new government seat of Danville. The following day, April 3, they escorted the archives of the government and the bullion of the treasury from Richmond to Danville and southward. Midshipman Raphael Semmes, Jr. was detailed to the staff of his father, Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]] and Midshipman Breckinridge was detailed as an aide to his father the [[Confederate States Secretary of War]], [[John C. Breckinridge]]<ref>Scharf, p.777</ref>\n\nFrom April 3 through April 9, LT Parker and the midshipman remained in [[Danville, Virginia]] and then moved south to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] on April 10, and to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] by April 13. Here the treasury was temporarily held in the Charlotte mint, but taken out as the contingent moved to [[Chester, South Carolina]]. The use of the train was abandoned, and the treasury was put in a wagon train, with the gold packed in small boxes and the silver in kegs. Together, with the first lady, Mrs. Jefferson Davis, they travelled to [[Abbeville, South Carolina]] by the 15th of April, and then the 17th they moved by wagon train again on to [[Washington, Georgia]], arriving on the 19th, and then in [[Augusta, Georgia]] on the 20th.<ref>Scharf, p.777</ref>\n\nBy this time, LT Parker was unable to locate either [[President Jefferson Davis]] or any member of the Confederate Treasury Department. He had, however, joined forces with a company of men under Captain Tabb back in Charlotte. LT Parker and the CSNA midshipmen were now in a dangerous situation guarding the Confederate treasury as the countryside was filled with bummers and looters tailing along behind Major General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]]'s army. LT Parker was finally able to secure the treasury, composed of coin and bullion, in the vaults of a bank in Augusta, and they remained in Augusta guarding the treasure until the armistice was signed between General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and Major General Sherman. LT Parker declined to disband the midshipman guarding the treasury, and so removed it out of the vaults and returned to Washington, Georgia while searching for President Davis, finally arriving back in Abbeville, South Carolina by the 29th of April. There they stored the treasury in a warehouse, and President Davis and his escort arrived the following day on April 30, accompanied by Secretary Mallory. LT Parker and the midshipmen turned over the treasury to the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, who had them deliver it to Brigadier General [[Basil W. Duke]], commander of the cavalry detachment escorting the President.<ref>Scharf, p.778</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1865 after approximately two years of existence, the Confederate Naval Academy ceased to exist when the school members disbanded at Abbeville, South Carolina. LT Parker issued a written order to each midshipman detaching them from the Naval Academy, and after this they were each given $40 in gold to help them reach their homes.<ref>Scharf, pp.778-779</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n\"This Patrick Henry may have been a unique institution of learning, but the \"Confederate States Naval Academy\" turned out men who afterwards became [[United States Senators]], members of Congress, judges, successful bankers, and successful business men as well as sailors.\"<ref>Morgan, p.206</ref>\n\n===List of prominent alumni===\n[[File:Recollections of a Rebel Reefer.pdf|thumb|''Recollections of a Rebel Reefer'' (1917) by Colonel [[James Morris Morgan]].<ref>http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/morganjames/morgan.html</ref>]]\n\n*[[Clifton R.

{"title_page": "Differential entropy", "text_new": "{{Short description|Concept in information theory}}\n{{Information theory}}\n\n'''Differential entropy''' (also referred to as '''continuous entropy''') is a concept in [[information theory]] that began as an attempt by Shannon to extend the idea of (Shannon) [[information entropy|entropy]], a measure of average [[surprisal]] of a [[random variable]], to continuous [[probability distribution]]s. Unfortunately, Shannon did not derive this formula, and rather just assumed it was the correct continuous analogue of discrete entropy, but it is not.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The actual continuous version of discrete entropy is the  [[limiting density of discrete points]] (LDDP). Differential entropy (described here) is commonly encountered in the literature, but it is a limiting case of the LDDP, and one that loses its fundamental association with discrete [[information entropy|entropy]].\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>X</math> be a random variable with a [[probability density function]] <math>f</math> whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a set <math>\\mathcal X</math>.

See [[logarithmic units]] for logarithms taken in different bases. Related concepts such as [[joint entropy|joint]], [[conditional entropy|conditional]] differential entropy, and [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence|relative entropy]] are defined in a similar fashion.

A Gaussian random variable has the largest entropy amongst all random variables of equal variance, or, alternatively, the maximum entropy distribution under constraints of mean and variance is the Gaussian.<ref name=\"cover_thomas\" />{{rp|255}}\n\n===Proof===\nLet <math>g(x)</math> be a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] [[Probability density function|PDF]] with mean \u03bc and variance <math>\\sigma^2</math> and <math>f(x)</math> an arbitrary [[Probability density function|PDF]] with the same variance. Since differential entropy is translation invariant we can assume that <math>f(x)</math> has the same mean of <math>\\mu</math> as <math>g(x)</math>.\n\nConsider the [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]] between the two distributions\n:<math> 0 \\leq D_{KL}(f || g) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\log \\left( \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right) dx = -h(f) - \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\log(g(x)) dx.</math>\nNow note that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\log(g(x)) dx &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\log\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\right) dx \\\\\n &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\log\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} dx + \\log(e)\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\left( -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) dx \\\\\n &= -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\log(e)\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\\\\n &= -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) + \\log(e)\\right) \\\\\n &= -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi e \\sigma^2)  \\\\\n &= -h(g)\n\\end{align}</math>\nbecause the result does not depend on <math>f(x)</math> other than through the variance.  Combining the two results yields\n:<math> h(g) - h(f) \\geq 0 \\!</math>\nwith equality when <math>f(x)=g(x)</math> following from the properties of Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence.\n\n===Alternative proof===\nThis result may also be demonstrated using the [[variational calculus]]. A Lagrangian function with two [[Lagrangian multiplier]]s may be defined as:\n\n:<math>L=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x)\\ln(g(x))\\,dx-\\lambda_0\\left(1-\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x)\\,dx\\right)-\\lambda\\left(\\sigma^2-\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x)(x-\\mu)^2\\,dx\\right)</math>\n\nwhere ''g(x)'' is some function with mean \u03bc. When the entropy of ''g(x)'' is at a maximum and the constraint equations, which consist of the normalization condition <math>\\left(1=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x)\\,dx\\right)</math> and the requirement of fixed variance <math>\\left(\\sigma^2=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x)(x-\\mu)^2\\,dx\\right)</math>, are both satisfied, then a small variation \u03b4''g''(''x'') about ''g(x)'' will produce a variation \u03b4''L'' about ''L'' which is equal to zero:\n\n:<math>0=\\delta L=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\delta g(x)\\left (\\ln(g(x))+1+\\lambda_0+\\lambda(x-\\mu)^2\\right )\\,dx</math>\n\nSince this must hold for any small \u03b4''g''(''x''), the term in brackets must be zero, and solving for ''g(x)'' yields:\n\n:<math>g(x)=e^{-\\lambda_0-1-\\lambda(x-\\mu)^2}</math>\n\nUsing the constraint equations to solve for \u03bb<sub>0</sub> and \u03bb yields the normal distribution:\n\n:<math>g(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}</math>\n\n==Example: Exponential distribution==\nLet <math>X</math> be an [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] random variable with parameter <math>\\lambda</math>, that is, with probability density function\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} \\mbox{ for } x \\geq 0.</math>\n\nIts differential entropy is then\n{|\n|-\n| <math>h_e(X)\\,</math>\n| <math>=-\\int_0^\\infty \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} \\log (\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x})\\,dx</math>\n|-\n|\n| <math>=  -\\left(\\int_0^\\infty (\\log \\lambda)\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}\\,dx + \\int_0^\\infty (-\\lambda x) \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}\\,dx\\right) </math>\n|-\n|\n| <math>= -\\log \\lambda \\int_0^\\infty f(x)\\,dx + \\lambda E[X]</math>\n|-\n|\n| <math>= -\\log\\lambda + 1\\,.</math>\n|}\n\nHere, <math>h_e(X)</math> was used rather than <math>h(X)</math> to make it explicit that the logarithm was taken to base ''e'', to simplify the calculation.\n\n==Relation to estimator error==\nThe differential entropy yields a lower bound on the expected squared error of an [[estimator]].

This creates a rumbling noise perceived as coming from within the head; however, the noise is due to mechanical disturbance of the hearing apparatus and is not generated by the motion of air.

These chemicals include [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[glutamic acid]], and [[nitric oxide]]. As more (or fewer) of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of [[opioid]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[endorphin]]s, reduces the frequency of yawning. Individuals in [[Drug withdrawal|opioid withdrawal]] exhibit a greatly increased frequency of yawning, and patients taking the selective [[serotonin]] reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Paxil ([[paroxetine]] HCl) or Celexa ([[citalopram]]) have been observed yawning more often.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Excessive yawning is more common during the first three months of taking SSRIs. Anecdotal reports by users of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] often describe a marked stimulation of yawning while inebriated, often associated with excess [[tears|lacrimation]] (eyes producing tears) and nasal mucosal stimulation, especially while \"peaking\" (undergoing the most intense portion of the [[psilocybin]] experience). While [[opioid]]s have been demonstrated to reduce this yawning and lacrimation provoked by psilocybin,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} it is not clear that the same pathways that induce yawning as a symptom of opioid abstinence in habituated users are the mode of action in yawning in mushroom users.

These chemicals include [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[glutamic acid]], and [[nitric oxide]]. As more (or fewer) of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of [[opioid]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[endorphin]]s, reduces the frequency of yawning. Individuals in [[Drug withdrawal|opioid withdrawal]] exhibit a greatly increased frequency of yawning, and patients taking the selective [[serotonin]] reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Paxil ([[paroxetine]] HCl) or Celexa ([[citalopram]]) have been observed yawning more often.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Excessive yawning is more common during the first three months of taking SSRIs. Anecdotal reports by users of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] often describe a marked stimulation of yawning while inebriated, often associated with excess [[tears|lacrimation]] (eyes producing tears) and nasal mucosal stimulation, especially while \"peaking\" (undergoing the most intense portion of the [[psilocybin]] experience). While [[opioid]]s have been demonstrated to reduce this yawning and lacrimation provoked by psilocybin,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} it is not clear that the same pathways that induce yawning as a symptom of opioid abstinence in habituated users are the mode of action in yawning in mushroom users.

It has been studied in [[Canidae]] species, such as the domestic dog and wolf. Domestic dogs have shown the ability to yawn contagiously in response to human yawns. Domestic dogs have demonstrated they are skilled at reading human communication behaviours. This ability makes it difficult to ascertain whether yawn contagion among domestic dogs is deeply rooted in their evolutionary history or is a result of domestication. \nIn a 2014 study, wolves were observed in an effort to answer this question. The results of the study showed that wolves are capable of yawn contagion.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Romero T. |author2=Ito M. |author3=Saito A. |author4=Hasegawa T. | year = 2014 | title = Social Modulation of Contagious Yawning in Wolves | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 8| page = e105963 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0105963|pmid=25162677 |pmc=4146576 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...9j5963R }}</ref> This study also found that the social bond strength between individuals affected the frequency of contagious yawning in wolves, supporting previous research which ties contagious yawning to emotional proximity.\n\nSome evidence for contagious yawning has also been found in budgerigars (''Melopsittacus undulatus''), a species of social parrots.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gallup |first1=A |last2=Swartwood |first2=L |last3=Militello |first3=J |last4=Sackett |first4=S |title=Experimental evidence of contagious yawning in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). |journal=Animal Cognition |date=2015 |volume=18}}</ref> This indicates that contagious yawning may have evolved several times in different lineages.

In such cases, yawn contagion can be used to evaluate their ability to infer or empathize with others. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder which severely affects social and communicative development, including empathy. The results of various studies have showed a diminished susceptibility to contagious yawn compared to the control group of typically-developing children.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Helt M.

However, she saw \"absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe.

Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant.\" She added, \"I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what [[patriarchy]] has done over centuries.

Teasing <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Eve teasing]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and [[catcall]]ing or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant.\" She added, \"I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what [[patriarchy]] has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure\".<ref name=\"India News\">{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shelitaflame/law-is-impotent-in-the-face-of-patriarchy/article1-1162845.aspx | title=Law is impotent in the face of patriarchy | work=Hindustan Times| date=15 December 2013 | accessdate=31 December 2014 | author=Joshi, Mallica | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315083159/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shelitaflame/law-is-impotent-in-the-face-of-patriarchy/article1-1162845.aspx | archive-date=15 March 2014 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA poll in October 2017, the first of its kind in the world, which was published by Thomson Reuters Foundation, found that Delhi was the fourth most dangerous city in the world for women and it was also the worst city in the world for women when it came to sexual violence, rape and harassment.<ref>{{cite news | last = Canton | first = Naomi | title = Sexual attacks: Delhi worst in world, says poll | url = https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-attacks-Delhi-worst-in-world-says-poll/articleshow/61095531.cms | work = [[The Times of India]] | date = 16 October 2017 | access-date = 16 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171017004111/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-attacks-Delhi-worst-in-world-says-poll/articleshow/61095531.cms | archive-date = 17 October 2017 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n===Nirbhaya Trust===\n\nIn December 2013, the family of the victim along with social entrepreneur [[Sarvesh Kumar Tiwari]] established the Nirbhaya Trust,<ref name=\"nirbhayatr\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-16/india/45254541_1_prayer-meeting-juvenile-justice-board-juvenile-home |title=Trust to be set up to help rape victims: Nirbhaya's mother |date=16 December 2013 |accessdate=21 January 2014 |work=Times of India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202120907/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-16/india/45254541_1_prayer-meeting-juvenile-justice-board-juvenile-home |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> an institute formed to assist women who have experienced violence to find shelter and legal assistance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/300818/nirbhaya-jyoti-trust-honours-women-for-inspiration-and-excellence-in-w.html|title=Nirbhaya Jyoti Trust honours women for inspiration and excellence in work|date=30 August 2018|website=Deccan Chronicle|language=en|access-date=11 November 2019}}</ref> Due to the fact that Indian laws do not allow the publishing of a rape victim's name, it was named ''Nirbhaya'' which means ''fearless'' in Hindi, after the name used by the media.
