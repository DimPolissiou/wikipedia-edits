The [[radio format|format]] focuses on [[contemporary hit radio]], specialising [[pop music]] and chart hits from the 1980s to the present. \u00d63 has the biggest [[Audience measurement|audience share]] by far (averaging 31%) of all Austrian radio stations.\n\n==History==\n\u00d63 was launched by the [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF broadcaster]] in 1967 when the new broadcasting law came into force in Austria. This was enforced by the Austrian population in 1964 with a referendum against the Proporzfunk. \n\nORF General Director Gerd Bacher brought Ernst Grissemann to Vienna and entrusted him with building the entertainment radio in the reformed [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. Frank Elstner acted as advisor. Hermann Egger, head of the entertainment department at the ORF regional studio in Tyrol, was originally \u00d63 boss; but he returned to his old position after a few weeks. The first broadcast of \u00d63 went on the ether on October 1, 1967. The team from the very beginning included Dieter Dorner, Walter Richard Langer (Vocal Instrumental International), Reinhard Mildner, Alfred Komarek (exclusive melody, texts with Ernst Grissemann), Andr\u00e9 Heller (''Die Musicbox''), Rudi Klausnitzer (''\u00d63 Wecker''). With Gerd Bacher's \"Schnulzenerlass\" in 1968, the quota of German-language music was reduced to \u00d63 in favor of music of Anglo-Saxon origin. \n\nIn 1977, \u00d63 started its 24-hour round-the-clock program. In 1984, due to technical developments, all 250,000 music tracks were digitally saved. \u00d63 formats, which were exclusively dedicated to Austrian pop music (''Austropop''), were the \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" from 1982 to 1985 and the ''Austroparade'' from 1985 to 1990. The \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" was founded in 1992 reintroduced. \n\nIn preparation for the liberalization of the broadcasting market in 1998, \u00d63 was converted into a pure format radio in 1996, the \"red-white-red radio\" was no longer authorized, and further cultural programs and alternative programs were largely handed over to [[\u00d61]] or [[FM4]] .The radio quota propagated by the public [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] radio stations in December 2009 based on self-regulation to play a 30 percent share of Austrian music has so far not been implemented by \u00d63 or the other stations (as of June 2016).\n\n\n'''\u00d63 Program Manager since 1967'''\n\n* 1967 Hermann Egger & Ernst Grissemann\n* 1979 Rudi Klausnitzer\n* 1987 Dieter Dorner\n* 1991 Edgar B\u00f6hm\n* 1994 Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107\n* since 2002 Georg Spatt\n\n== General ==\nHitradio \u00d63 is one of the three ORF radio programs broadcast nationwide and the radio with the largest reach in Austria. In South Tyrol, \u00d63 is broadcast by the South Tyrol Broadcasting Corporation. Pop and rock hits from the 1980s, 1990s and today can be found in the radio station's playlist under the motto \"Life is a hit\". The radio is assigned to the Hot AC radio format.\n\n== Broadcasting studio ==\nHitradio \u00d63 is based in the capital city of Vienna. In 1997, the editorial office and broadcast studio moved from the ORF broadcasting center on Argentinerstrasse in Vienna to two open-plan office floors in Heiligenstadt. These offer space for more than 100 employees. The spatial arrangement of the editorial workplaces is intended to achieve maximum cooperation at work. The center of the upper floor is the spacious digital broadcasting studio. It is one of the most modern in Europe.\n[[File:Wien \u00d63 Zentrum (2476992811).jpg|alt=\u00d63-Studio in Vienna (fail.loading)|thumb|\u00d63-Studio in Vienna]]\n\n== Internet Presence ==\nAn information platform is offered to the listener on the website of the radio station.

The [[radio format|format]] focuses on [[contemporary hit radio]], specialising [[pop music]] and chart hits from the 1980s to the present. \u00d63 has the biggest [[Audience measurement|audience share]] by far (averaging 31%) of all Austrian radio stations.\n\n==History==\n\u00d63 was launched by the [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF broadcaster]] in 1967 when the new broadcasting law came into force in Austria. This was enforced by the Austrian population in 1964 with a referendum against the Proporzfunk. \n\nORF General Director Gerd Bacher brought Ernst Grissemann to Vienna and entrusted him with building the entertainment radio in the reformed [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. Frank Elstner acted as advisor. Hermann Egger, head of the entertainment department at the ORF regional studio in Tyrol, was originally \u00d63 boss; but he returned to his old position after a few weeks. The first broadcast of \u00d63 went on the ether on October 1, 1967. The team from the very beginning included Dieter Dorner, Walter Richard Langer (Vocal Instrumental International), Reinhard Mildner, Alfred Komarek (exclusive melody, texts with Ernst Grissemann), Andr\u00e9 Heller (''Die Musicbox''), Rudi Klausnitzer (''\u00d63 Wecker''). With Gerd Bacher's \"Schnulzenerlass\" in 1968, the quota of German-language music was reduced to \u00d63 in favor of music of Anglo-Saxon origin. \n\nIn 1977, \u00d63 started its 24-hour round-the-clock program. In 1984, due to technical developments, all 250,000 music tracks were digitally saved. \u00d63 formats, which were exclusively dedicated to Austrian pop music (''Austropop''), were the \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" from 1982 to 1985 and the ''Austroparade'' from 1985 to 1990. The \"''Rot-Wei\u00df-Rote Radio''\" was founded in 1992 reintroduced. \n\nIn preparation for the liberalization of the broadcasting market in 1998, \u00d63 was converted into a pure format radio in 1996, the \"red-white-red radio\" was no longer authorized, and further cultural programs and alternative programs were largely handed over to [[\u00d61]] or [[FM4]] .The radio quota propagated by the public [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] radio stations in December 2009 based on self-regulation to play a 30 percent share of Austrian music has so far not been implemented by \u00d63 or the other stations (as of June 2016).\n\n\n'''\u00d63 Program Manager since 1967'''\n\n* 1967 Hermann Egger & Ernst Grissemann\n* 1979 Rudi Klausnitzer\n* 1987 Dieter Dorner\n* 1991 Edgar B\u00f6hm\n* 1994 Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107\n* since 2002 Georg Spatt\n\n== General ==\nHitradio \u00d63 is one of the three ORF radio programs broadcast nationwide and the radio with the largest reach in Austria.

Likewise, the ''\"[[\u00d63 Austria Top 40]]''\" could still be heard on Friday evening until the end of September 2019, before they were given the new slot on Sunday afternoon.\n\n==Operation==\nSince 1997, \u00d63 broadcasts from a large office floor in the [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]] district of [[Vienna]]. Transmissions include the survey of the Austrian [[record charts]], since 1967 presented by the weekly [[Austria Top 40]] programme. Current renowned presenters include [[Andi Knoll]] and [[Katharina Bellowitsch]]. Band contests like ''\u00d63-Soundcheck'' promoted the career of Austrian music groups such as [[SheSays]], [[Luttenberger*Klug]], [[Mondscheiner]], and [[Excuse Me Moses]]. The station participates in the annual [[Donauinselfest]] music festival, the ''[[Licht ins Dunkel]]'' telethon and co-operates with the [[Austrian Red Cross]].\n[[File:OE3osd.png|thumb|left|\u00d63 On-Screen-Design 2008]]\nThe station also broadcasts via [[satellite television]], with a display showing the previous, current and upcoming tracks, the time and other information such as traffic reports.\nThe station's website provides latest reports and information, record charts, a studio [[webcam]], [[streaming media|streaming audio]], and a daily [[playlist]] reaching back to 2009. Several broadcasts are available as [[podcast]]s.\n\n\u00d63 was for a long time the only ORF station permitted to broadcast [[advertising|commercial]]s, and it remains the station with the largest [[Reach (advertising)|reach]] and amount of advertising time per day, more than all private radio stations together. For this reason it is often called \"ORF's [[cash cow]]\". \n{{-}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://oe3.orf.at/}}\n\n{{ORF}}\n{{coord missing|Austria}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hitradio O3}}\n[[Category:Radio stations in Austria]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1967]]\n[[Category:1967 establishments in Austria]]\n[[Category:ORF (broadcaster)]]\n", "name_user": "Wr24AT", "label": "safe", "comment": "+ pictures", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitradio_%C3%963"}

Some time after that the Kai\u01c0khauan, now under the leadership of Amraal's grandson [[Andreas Lambert|Andreas]], moved back to Naosanabis. From here they controlled important trade routes. Using their technological advantage of commanding  firearms and horses they were waylaying and robbing merchants.

In [[mammal]]s and most other [[vertebrate]]s, two lungs are located near the [[vertebral column|backbone]] on either side of the [[heart]]. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract [[oxygen]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and transfer it into the [[bloodstream]], and to release [[carbon dioxide]] from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of [[gas exchange]]. [[Respiration (physiology)|Respiration]] is driven by different [[muscle|muscular systems]] in different species. Mammals, [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s use their different [[muscle]]s to support and foster [[breathing]]. In early [[tetrapod]]s, air was driven into the lungs by the [[pharyngeal muscles]] via [[buccal pumping]], a mechanism still seen in [[amphibian]]s. In humans, the main [[muscles of respiration|muscle of respiration]] that drives breathing is the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human [[speech]] possible.\n\nHumans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung. They are situated within the [[thoracic cavity]] of the [[chest]]. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the [[heart]]. The lungs together weigh approximately {{convert|1.3|kg|lbs}}, and the right is heavier. The lungs are part of the [[lower respiratory tract]] that begins at the [[trachea]] and branches into the [[bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s, and which receive [[air]] [[inhalation|breathed in]] via the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|conducting zone]]. The conducting zone ends at the [[Bronchiole#Terminal bronchioles|terminal bronchioles]]. These divide into the [[Bronchiole#Respiratory bronchioles|respiratory bronchioles]] of the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|respiratory zone]] which divide into [[alveolar duct]]s that give rise to the [[alveolar sac]]s that contain the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], where gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts. Together, the lungs contain approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi}} of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a [[pleural sac]] that contains pleural fluid, which allows the [[pulmonary pleurae|inner and outer walls]] to slide over each other whilst [[breathing]] takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called [[lobe (anatomy)|lobes]]. The right lung has three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into  [[bronchopulmonary segment]]s and  [[Lung#Microanatomy|pulmonary lobules]]. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the [[pulmonary circulation]] for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the [[bronchial circulation]].\n\nThe [[Parenchyma#Lung parenchyma|tissue of the lungs]] can be affected by a number of [[respiratory disease]]s, including [[pneumonia]] and [[lung cancer]]. [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] includes [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], and can be related to [[smoking]] or exposure to [[Toxicity|harmful substances]].  A number of [[occupational lung disease]]s can be caused by substances such as [[coal dust]], [[Asbestos|asbestos fibres]], and [[crystal]]line [[silicon dioxide|silica]] dust. Diseases such as [[bronchitis]] can also affect the [[respiratory tract]]. Medical terms related to the lung often begin with ''pulmo-'', from the [[Latin]] ''pulmonarius'' (of the lungs) as in [[pulmonology]], or with ''pneumo-'' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \"lung\") as in [[pneumonia]].\n\nIn [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]], the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the [[foregut]], a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. When the lungs are formed the [[fetus]] is held in the [[amniotic fluid|fluid-filled]] [[amniotic sac]] and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the [[ductus arteriosus]]. [[Adaptation to extrauterine life#Breathing and circulation|At birth]] however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n== Structure of the human lungs ==\n[[File:Meet the lungs.webm|thumb|\"Meet the lungs\" from the [[Khan Academy]]]]\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left]]\nThe lungs are located in the [[thoracic cavity|chest]] on either side of the [[heart]] in the [[rib cage]].

Between the pleurae is a [[potential space]] called the [[pleural cavity]] containing a thin layer of lubricating [[pleural fluid]].\n\n====Lobes and segments====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;margin-left:10px\"\n|+ Lobes and bronchopulmonary segments <ref name=\"pmid1\" />\n|-\n!

This limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with [[pulmonary function tests]] such as [[spirometry]]. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as [[dust mite]]s or [[smoking]]), with symptom control such as [[bronchodilator]]s, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through [[corticosteroid]]s) in severe cases. A common cause of chronic bronchitis, and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], is smoking; and common causes of [[bronchiectasis]] include severe infections and [[cystic fibrosis]]. The definitive cause of [[asthma]] is not yet known.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2014 />\n\nThe breakdown of alveolar tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become severe enough to develop into COPD. [[Elastase]] breaks down the [[elastin]] in the lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. Elastase is inhibited by the [[acute-phase protein]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin]], and when there is a [[Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency|deficiency]] in this, emphysema can develop. With persistent stress from smoking, the [[airway basal cell]]s become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed to repair the epithelial barrier. The disorganised basal cells are seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of [[COPD]], and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation.

On inhalation, air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. Air then travels continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. From here, the air is exhaled.

These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture.

In the [[Australian lungfish]], there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes.

In [[mammal]]s and most other [[vertebrate]]s, two lungs are located near the [[vertebral column|backbone]] on either side of the [[heart]]. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract [[oxygen]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and transfer it into the [[bloodstream]], and to release [[carbon dioxide]] from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of [[gas exchange]]. [[Respiration (physiology)|Respiration]] is driven by different [[muscle|muscular systems]] in different species. Mammals, [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s use their different [[muscle]]s to support and foster [[breathing]]. In early [[tetrapod]]s, air was driven into the lungs by the [[pharyngeal muscles]] via [[buccal pumping]], a mechanism still seen in [[amphibian]]s. In humans, the main [[muscles of respiration|muscle of respiration]] that drives breathing is the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human [[speech]] possible.\n\nHumans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung. They are situated within the [[thoracic cavity]] of the [[chest]]. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the [[heart]]. The lungs together weigh approximately {{convert|1.3|kg|lbs}}, and the right is heavier. The lungs are part of the [[lower respiratory tract]] that begins at the [[trachea]] and branches into the [[bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s, and which receive [[air]] [[inhalation|breathed in]] via the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|conducting zone]]. The conducting zone ends at the [[Bronchiole#Terminal bronchioles|terminal bronchioles]]. These divide into the [[Bronchiole#Respiratory bronchioles|respiratory bronchioles]] of the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|respiratory zone]] which divide into [[alveolar duct]]s that give rise to the [[alveolar sac]]s that contain the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], where gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts. Together, the lungs contain approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi}} of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a [[pleural sac]] that contains pleural fluid, which allows the [[pulmonary pleurae|inner and outer walls]] to slide over each other whilst [[breathing]] takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called [[lobe (anatomy)|lobes]]. The right lung has three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into  [[bronchopulmonary segment]]s and  [[Lung#Microanatomy|pulmonary lobules]]. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the [[pulmonary circulation]] for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the [[bronchial circulation]].\n\nThe [[Parenchyma#Lung parenchyma|tissue of the lungs]] can be affected by a number of [[respiratory disease]]s, including [[pneumonia]] and [[lung cancer]]. [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] includes [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], and can be related to [[smoking]] or exposure to [[Toxicity|harmful substances]].  A number of [[occupational lung disease]]s can be caused by substances such as [[coal dust]], [[Asbestos|asbestos fibres]], and [[crystal]]line [[silicon dioxide|silica]] dust. Diseases such as [[bronchitis]] can also affect the [[respiratory tract]]. Medical terms related to the lung often begin with ''pulmo-'', from the [[Latin]] ''pulmonarius'' (of the lungs) as in [[pulmonology]], or with ''pneumo-'' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \"lung\") as in [[pneumonia]].\n\nIn [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]], the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the [[foregut]], a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. When the lungs are formed the [[fetus]] is held in the [[amniotic fluid|fluid-filled]] [[amniotic sac]] and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the [[ductus arteriosus]]. [[Adaptation to extrauterine life#Breathing and circulation|At birth]] however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n== Structure of the human lungs ==\n[[File:Meet the lungs.webm|thumb|\"Meet the lungs\" from the [[Khan Academy]]]]\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left]]\nThe lungs are located in the [[thoracic cavity|chest]] on either side of the [[heart]] in the [[rib cage]].

[[Vitamin A deficiency]] has been linked to changes in the epithelial lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma.

Severe nutritional deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement membrane. The extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air barrier. The deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease states.

This limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with [[pulmonary function tests]] such as [[spirometry]]. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as [[dust mite]]s or [[smoking]]), with symptom control such as [[bronchodilator]]s, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through [[corticosteroid]]s) in severe cases. A common cause of chronic bronchitis, and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], is smoking; and common causes of [[bronchiectasis]] include severe infections and [[cystic fibrosis]]. The definitive cause of [[asthma]] is not yet known.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2014 />\n\nThe breakdown of alveolar tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become severe enough to develop into COPD. [[Elastase]] breaks down the [[elastin]] in the lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. Elastase is inhibited by the [[acute-phase protein]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin]], and when there is a [[Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency|deficiency]] in this, emphysema can develop. With persistent stress from smoking, the [[airway basal cell]]s become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed to repair the epithelial barrier. The disorganised basal cells are seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of [[COPD]], and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. Studies have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Basal cells become further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.<ref name=\"Crystal\">{{cite journal |last1=Crystal |first1=RG |title=Airway basal cells.

On inhalation, air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. Air then travels continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. From here, the air is exhaled. These fixed size lungs are called \"circulatory lungs\", as distinct from the \"bellows-type lungs\" found in most other animals.<ref name=\"AvResp\"/><ref name=\"Maina2005\">{{cite book|last1=Maina|first1=John N.|title=The lung air sac system of birds development, structure, and function; with 6 tables|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-25595-6|pages=3.2\u20133.3 \"Lung\", \"Airway (Bronchiol) System\" 66\u201382|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-wtoEg7fcjkC&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=neopulmonic+parabronchi#v=onepage&q=neopulmonic%20parabronchi&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe lungs of birds contain millions of tiny parallel passages called [[parabronchi]]. Small sacs called ''atria'' radiate from the walls of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in other lungs, are the site of [[gas exchange]] by simple diffusion.<ref name=Maina2005 /> The blood flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of gas exchange (see diagram on the right).<ref name=AvResp /><ref name= graham />\n\nThe air sacs, which hold air, do not contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume in the thorax and abdomen.

These are termed ''neopulmonic parabronchi''.<ref name=Maina2005 />\n\n=== Reptiles ===\n{{Main|Reptile anatomy#Respiratory system}}\nThe lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In [[tuatara]]s, [[snake]]s, and some [[lizard]]s, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical amphibians.<ref name=VB />\n\nSnakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent. [[Amphisbaenian]]s, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.<ref name=VB />\n\nBoth [[Crocodylia|crocodilians]] and [[Monitor Lizard|monitor lizards]] have developed lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow and even possessing air sacs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unidirectional airflow in the lungs of birds, crocs\u2026and now monitor lizards!?|url=http://svpow.com/2013/12/11/unidirectional-airflow-in-the-lungs-of-birds-crocs-and-now-monitor-lizards/|website=Sauropod Vertebra picture of the week|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=2013-12-11}}</ref> The now extinct [[Pterosauria|pterosaurs]] have seemingly even further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes and, in the case of [[Lonchodectidae|lonchodectids]], [[tupuxuara]], and [[Azhdarchoidea|azhdarchoids]], the hindlimbs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Claessens|first1=Leon P.A.M.|last2=O'Connor|first2=Patrick M.|last3=Unwin|first3=David M.|last4=Sereno|first4=Paul|title=Respiratory Evolution Facilitated the Origin of Pterosaur Flight and Aerial Gigantism|journal=PLOS ONE|date=18 February 2009|volume=4|issue=2|pages=e4497|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004497|pmid=19223979|pmc=2637988|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4497C}}</ref>\n\n[[Reptile|Reptilian]] lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven by [[axial skeleton|axial muscles]] and buccal pumping.

This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a [[positive pressure]] system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by [[buccal pumping]].

In caecilians, as in snakes, only the right lung attains any size or development.<ref name=VB />\n\n=== Lungfish ===\nThe lungs of [[lungfish]] are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the [[Australian lungfish]], there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and ''[[Polypterus]]'', however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the [[esophagus]].

In 1986, Doug Perry, Macon Brock, and Ray Compton started another [[chain store]] called ''Only $1.00'' with five stores, one in Georgia, one in Tennessee, and three in Virginia. The expansion of dollar stores was continued alongside K&K Toys stores, mostly in enclosed malls.
