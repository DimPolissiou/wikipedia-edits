He became GM of Kiwi Co-operative Dairies Ltd in 1991 and CEO at the age of 29 in 1994. In his time at the helm, Kiwi grew from a turnover of $285 million to $4.4b.  In 1996 Kiwi Co-op took control of [[Mainland (cheese)|Mainland Products]] with a 66% share and lifted that share to 83% in a merger with Otago Co-op in 1998. Kiwi Co-op merged with New Zealand Dairy Group to form Fonterra, one of New Zealand's largest companies, in 2001 and Norgate was chosen as inaugural CEO of Fonterra for two years.<ref name=rpi_collapse/> He was New Zealand's first CEO on a million dollar salary.<ref name=rise-and-fall/> Fonterra bought the remaining 17 percent of Mainland from the McConnon family.<ref name=rpi_collapse>{{cite news |title=Collapse of partnership a loss for all |first=Brian |last=Gaynor |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10643428 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nNorgate's two-year contract with Fonterra was not renewed in 2003 and a few weeks later in August he and the McConnon family formed Rural Portfolio Investments (RPI), with Norgate as managing director. Norgate was to receive a [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500,000 per annum management fee, plus expenses, for five years. In September, RPI bid for shares in Wrightson and built their stake up to 50.01 percent following a hostile takeover in 2004. Wrightson took over the number 3 player [[Williams & Kettle]] a few months later and then merged with Pyne Gould Guinness in 2005 to form PGG Wrightson, with RPI's stake at 30 percent. Norgate became deputy chairman of PGG Wrightson in 2006, shortly after it had established NZ Farming Systems Uruguay, and became chairman in 2007.<ref name=rpi_collapse/>\n\nIn June 2008, PGG Wrightson made an unconditional offer to buy half of [[Silver Fern Farms]] for NZ$220 million, but in September was unable to complete the equity raising required to finance the offer and defaulted.<ref name=steps-down/><ref name=rise-and-fall/> It had to pay $42 million in compensation to Silver Fern and wrote off a total of $50 million for the compensation and due diligence costs.<ref name=rise-and-fall/> Norgate resigned as chairman of PGG Wrightson in 2009.<ref name=steps-down>{{cite news |url=http://www.guide2.co.nz/money/news/business/craig-norgate-steps-down-as-chairman-of-pgg-wrightson/11/9646 |title=Craig Norgate steps down as chairman of PGG Wrightson |date=23 July 2009}}</ref> In 2010 Rural Portfolio Investments went into receivership.<ref name=rise-and-fall>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10643472&pnum=0 |title=The rise and fall, and rise and fall of Norgate |last1=Hembry |first1=Owen |date=8 May 2010 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nNorgate was a director of [[Port Taranaki]], Sealord Group, the Taranaki Rugby Union and the currently the CEO of New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants.

As well as seven boroughs north of the river, the \u2018East\u2019 sub-region also includes three boroughs to the south of it: [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]], [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] and [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]]. These boroughs are seldom called 'east London' as they are south of the river and are poorly connected to the north.\n\n===Physical geography ===\nEast London is located in the lower Thames valley. The major rivers of East London are the [[River Thames|Thames]] that forms the southern boundary; the [[River Lea|Lea]] which forms the boundary of Tower Hamlets/Hackney with Newham/Waltham Forest; the [[River Roding|Roding]] which forms the boundary of Newham with Barking and Dagenham/Redbridge; and the [[River Rom|Beam]] which forms the boundary of Barking and Dagenham with Havering. The marshes along the Thames which once stretched from Wapping to Rainham are almost completely gone.<ref name=\"Pevsner\">{{ cite book | title=London 5: East | author=Nikolaus Pevsner | date=2005 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Emergence===\nThe [[East End of London|East End]], the old core of modern East London, began with the medieval growth of London beyond the [[London Wall|city walls]], along the Roman roads leading from [[Bishopsgate]] and [[Aldgate]], and also along the river.\n\nGrowth was much slower in the east, and the modest extensions there were separated from the much larger suburbs in the west by the marshy open area of [[Moorfields]] adjacent to the wall on the north side, which discouraged development in that direction. Urbanisation accelerated in the 16th century and the area that would later become known as the [[East End of London|East End]] began to take shape.\n\nThe first known written record of the East End as a distinct entity, as opposed to its component parts, comes from [[John Strype]]'s 1720 'Survey of London', where he describes London as consisting of four parts: the [[City of London]], [[City and Liberty of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Southwark]], and '''That Part beyond the Tower'''.\n\nThe relevance of Strype's reference to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] was more than geographical. The East End was the urbanised part of an area called the [[Tower division|Tower Division]], which had owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] since time immemorial. Later, as London grew further, the fully urbanised [[Tower division|Tower Division]] became a byword for wider East London, before East London grew further still, east of the Lea and into [[Essex]].\n\nThe westernmost component of the Tower Division was the [[Shoreditch (parish)|ancient parish of Shoreditch]] which would become fully urbanised as part of the East End/East London. Shoreditch's boundary with the parish of [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] (and its predecessor [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]]) ran through the [[Moorfields]] countryside, and became, on urbanisation, the boundary between east and north London.{{fact|date=August 2018}} That line, with very slight modifications, has also become the boundary between the modern London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]].\n\n[[Moorfields]] remained largely open until 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space separating the emerging [[East End of London|East End]] from the western urban expansion of London must have helped shape the varying economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).\n\n[[File:City of London Ogilby and Morgan's Map of 1677.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Ogilby & Morgan's map of the City of London (1673). \"A Large and Accurate Map of the City of London. Ichnographically describing all the Streets, Lanes, Alleys, Courts, Yards, Churches, Halls, & Houses &c. Actually Surveyed and Delineated by [[John Ogilby]], His Majesties Cosmographer.\"|Ogilby & Morgan's 1673 map of London. The East End is developing outside [[Bishopsgate]], [[Aldgate]] and along the river - it is separated from the western growth of the city by [[Moorfields]]]]\n\n===Growth===\nUntil about 1700, London did not extend far beyond the walled boundaries of the [[City of London]]. However, the population in the parishes to the east of the City was rising and this led to a need to break up the large ancient parish of [[Stepney]] into smaller units to provide adequate religious and civil administration. It was the industries associated with the [[River Thames]], such as shipbuilding and the docks, that encouraged growth in the east, and by 1650, [[Shadwell]] was a developed maritime settlement.<ref name=\"Beyond\">{{cite book | title=Beyond the Tower: A History of East London | author=John Marriott | date= 2011 }}</ref> The docks in Tower Hamlets started to reach capacity in the early 19th century, and in 1855 the [[Royal Victoria Dock]] was opened in Newham.\n\nThese industries declined in the later part of the 20th century (and earlier), but East London is now an area of regeneration. In the [[London Docklands]], this has reached an advanced stage, but in the sections of East London that are within the [[Thames Gateway]] it is continuing, such as the redevelopment in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] associated with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\nAreas further east developed in the Victorian and Edwardian eras after the expansion of the railways in the 19th century. Development of suburban houses for private sale was later matched by the provision of large-scale social housing at [[Becontree]] in the 1920s and [[Harold Hill]] after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. However, the urban footprint was constrained in 1878 by the protection of [[Epping Forest]] and later the implementation of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. The density of development increased during the [[interwar period]], and [[new industries]] developed, such as [[Ford Dagenham|Ford at Dagenham]]. In Tower Hamlets, the population peaked in 1891 and growth was restricted to the outer boroughs. By 1971, the population had peaked in every borough and the population was declining throughout the entire area. By the time of the 2011 UK Census, this had reversed and every borough had undergone some growth in population.\n\nThe population change between 1801 and 2001 was as follows:<ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Barking and Dagenham | url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056780&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Hackney | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056858&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Havering | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10213332&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Newham | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10064028&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Redbridge | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056883&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Tower Hamlets | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10057346&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Waltham Forest | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056720&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

[[John Strype]]'s map of 1720 describes London as consisting of four parts: The City of London, Westminster, Southwark and \"That Part Beyond the Tower\".<ref name=\"Beyond\"/> From the late 19th century the term [[East End of London]] was used to describe areas immediately adjacent to the City<ref name=ADMills/> in the Tower division of Middlesex. [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] in 1889 defined East London as the [[County of London]] between the City and the [[River Lea]].<ref name=\"Booth 1889\">Descriptive Map of London Poverty, Charles Booth, 1889</ref> In 1902 he now considered this area to be the \"true East End\", and his attention had been drawn eastward over the Lea into the [[County Borough of West Ham|Borough of West Ham]], which was then outside London, and geographically in Essex, but under the authority of neither; in 1857 Charles Dickens termed it \"London-over-the-Border\". [[Walter Besant]] described East London as an area north of the Thames and east of the City that stretched as far as Chingford and Epping Forest,<ref>East London, Sir Walter Besant, Century Company, 1901</ref> which was similar to the definition used by Robert Sinclair in 1950 that stretched east to include Barking and Dagenham.<ref>East London: The east and north-east boroughs of London and Greater London (County book series), Robert Sinclair, 1950</ref> This broadly matched the [[Metropolitan Police District]] east of the city and north of the Thames at that time, and now corresponds to the boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest in [[Greater London]].\n\nThe area adjacent to the City of London is known as the [[East End of London]]. It does not have clearly defined boundaries, but is usually taken to be north of the River Thames, east of the City and west of the River Lea.\n\n==Economy==\n===River crossings===\nThe [[City of London|City]] and West London are connected to [[South London]] by more than thirty bridges, but East London is only connected by [[Tower Bridge]] at its innermost edge. The reasons for this include the widening of the [[River Thames|Thames]] as it gets further east, and also the need, until relatively recently, to avoid impediments to the river traffic of the strategic [[London Docklands]].\n\nUntil the end of the 20th century the East was connected to the [[South London|South]] by just one railway line, the [[East London Line]]. The [[Jubilee Line Extension]] opened in 1999, was supplemented by a [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]] extension and will be joined by [[Crossrail]] in 2019; however the last two of these lines connect to just one station in the [[South London|south]].\n\nThere are road tunnels at [[Rotherhithe Tunnel|Rotherhithe]] and [[Blackwall Tunnel|Blackwall]], with the [[Woolwich Ferry]] further east.\n\n===Railways===\nThe majority of the rail network in East London was built within fifty years from 1839.

The [[East End of London]] is a subset of East London, consisting of areas close to the ancient City of London. The Eastern (E) Postal District is a different subset of East London; and there is also an \"East\" sub-region used in the London Plan for planning policy reporting purposes. The most recent (2011) iteration includes seven boroughs north of the Thames, with the addition of three boroughs south of the river.\n\n==Geography==\n===Limits and extent===\nThe [[East End of London|East End]] is the inner core of East London.

The postcode area is a sub-set of East London, with notable exclusions:\n* Central areas covered by central London EC postcodes.\n* [[Hoxton]] in [[Shoreditch]] which is part of the N postcode area.\n* The [[West Hackney]], [[De Beauvoir Town]] and [[Stamford Hill]] areas of [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney proper]].

As well as seven boroughs north of the river, the \u2018East\u2019 sub-region also includes three boroughs to the south of it: [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]], [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] and [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]]. These boroughs are seldom called 'east London' as they are south of the river and are poorly connected to the north.\n\n===Physical geography ===\nEast London is located in the lower Thames valley. The major rivers of East London are the [[River Thames|Thames]] that forms the southern boundary; the [[River Lea|Lea]] which forms the boundary of Tower Hamlets/Hackney with Newham/Waltham Forest; the [[River Roding|Roding]] which forms the boundary of Newham with Barking and Dagenham/Redbridge; and the [[River Rom|Beam]] which forms the boundary of Barking and Dagenham with Havering. The marshes along the Thames which once stretched from Wapping to Rainham are almost completely gone.<ref name=\"Pevsner\">{{ cite book | title=London 5: East | author=Nikolaus Pevsner | date=2005 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Emergence===\nThe [[East End of London|East End]], the old core of modern East London, began with the medieval growth of London beyond the [[London Wall|city walls]], along the Roman roads leading from [[Bishopsgate]] and [[Aldgate]], and also along the river.\n\nGrowth was much slower in the east, and the modest extensions there were separated from the much larger suburbs in the west by the marshy open area of [[Moorfields]] adjacent to the wall on the north side, which discouraged development in that direction. Urbanisation accelerated in the 16th century and the area that would later become known as the [[East End of London|East End]] began to take shape.\n\nThe first known written record of the East End as a distinct entity, as opposed to its component parts, comes from [[John Strype]]'s 1720 'Survey of London', where he describes London as consisting of four parts: the [[City of London]], [[City and Liberty of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Southwark]], and '''That Part beyond the Tower'''.\n\nThe relevance of Strype's reference to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] was more than geographical. The East End was the urbanised part of an area called the [[Tower division|Tower Division]], which had owed military service to the [[Tower of London]] since time immemorial. Later, as London grew further, the fully urbanised [[Tower division|Tower Division]] became a byword for wider East London, before East London grew further still, east of the Lea and into [[Essex]].\n\nThe westernmost component of the Tower Division was the [[Shoreditch (parish)|ancient parish of Shoreditch]] which would become fully urbanised as part of the East End/East London. Shoreditch's boundary with the parish of [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] (and its predecessor [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]]) ran through the [[Moorfields]] countryside, and became, on urbanisation, the boundary between east and north London.{{fact|date=August 2018}} That line, with very slight modifications, has also become the boundary between the modern London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]].\n\n[[Moorfields]] remained largely open until 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space separating the emerging [[East End of London|East End]] from the western urban expansion of London must have helped shape the varying economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).\n\n[[File:City of London Ogilby and Morgan's Map of 1677.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Ogilby & Morgan's map of the City of London (1673). \"A Large and Accurate Map of the City of London. Ichnographically describing all the Streets, Lanes, Alleys, Courts, Yards, Churches, Halls, & Houses &c. Actually Surveyed and Delineated by [[John Ogilby]], His Majesties Cosmographer.\"|Ogilby & Morgan's 1673 map of London. The East End is developing outside [[Bishopsgate]], [[Aldgate]] and along the river - it is separated from the western growth of the city by [[Moorfields]]]]\n\n===Growth===\nUntil about 1700, London did not extend far beyond the walled boundaries of the [[City of London]]. However, the population in the parishes to the east of the City was rising and this led to a need to break up the large ancient parish of [[Stepney]] into smaller units to provide adequate religious and civil administration. It was the industries associated with the [[River Thames]], such as shipbuilding and the docks, that encouraged growth in the east, and by 1650, [[Shadwell]] was a developed maritime settlement.<ref name=\"Beyond\">{{cite book | title=Beyond the Tower: A History of East London | author=John Marriott | date= 2011 }}</ref> The docks in Tower Hamlets started to reach capacity in the early 19th century, and in 1855 the [[Royal Victoria Dock]] was opened in Newham.\n\nThese industries declined in the later part of the 20th century (and earlier), but East London is now an area of regeneration. In the [[London Docklands]], this has reached an advanced stage, but in the sections of East London that are within the [[Thames Gateway]] it is continuing, such as the redevelopment in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] associated with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\nAreas further east developed in the Victorian and Edwardian eras after the expansion of the railways in the 19th century. Development of suburban houses for private sale was later matched by the provision of large-scale social housing at [[Becontree]] in the 1920s and [[Harold Hill]] after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. However, the urban footprint was constrained in 1878 by the protection of [[Epping Forest]] and later the implementation of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. The density of development increased during the [[interwar period]], and [[new industries]] developed, such as [[Ford Dagenham|Ford at Dagenham]]. In Tower Hamlets, the population peaked in 1891 and growth was restricted to the outer boroughs. By 1971, the population had peaked in every borough and the population was declining throughout the entire area. By the time of the 2011 UK Census, this had reversed and every borough had undergone some growth in population.\n\nThe population change between 1801 and 2001 was as follows:<ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Barking and Dagenham | url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056780&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Hackney | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056858&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Havering | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10213332&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Newham | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10064028&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Redbridge | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056883&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Tower Hamlets | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10057346&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | accessdate= 6 October 2012 | title=Waltham Forest | url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056720&c_id=10001043&add=N }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

[[John Strype]]'s map of 1720 describes London as consisting of four parts: The City of London, Westminster, Southwark and \"That Part Beyond the Tower\".<ref name=\"Beyond\"/> From the late 19th century the term [[East End of London]] was used to describe areas immediately adjacent to the City<ref name=ADMills/> in the Tower division of Middlesex. [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] in 1889 defined East London as the [[County of London]] between the City and the [[River Lea]].<ref name=\"Booth 1889\">Descriptive Map of London Poverty, Charles Booth, 1889</ref> In 1902 he now considered this area to be the \"true East End\", and his attention had been drawn eastward over the Lea into the [[County Borough of West Ham|Borough of West Ham]], which was then outside London, and geographically in Essex, but under the authority of neither; in 1857 Charles Dickens termed it \"London-over-the-Border\". [[Walter Besant]] described East London as an area north of the Thames and east of the City that stretched as far as Chingford and Epping Forest,<ref>East London, Sir Walter Besant, Century Company, 1901</ref> which was similar to the definition used by Robert Sinclair in 1950 that stretched east to include Barking and Dagenham.<ref>East London: The east and north-east boroughs of London and Greater London (County book series), Robert Sinclair, 1950</ref> This broadly matched the [[Metropolitan Police District]] east of the city and north of the Thames at that time, and now corresponds to the boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest in [[Greater London]].\n\nThe area adjacent to the City of London is known as the [[East End of London]]. It does not have clearly defined boundaries, but is usually taken to be north of the River Thames, east of the City and west of the River Lea.\n\n==Economy==\n===River crossings===\nThe [[City of London|City]] and West London are connected to [[South London]] by more than thirty bridges, but East London is only connected by [[Tower Bridge]] at its innermost edge. The reasons for this include the widening of the [[River Thames|Thames]] as it gets further east, and also the need, until relatively recently, to avoid impediments to the river traffic of the strategic [[London Docklands]].\n\nUntil the end of the 20th century the East was connected to the [[South London|South]] by just one railway line, the [[East London Line]]. The [[Jubilee Line Extension]] opened in 1999, was supplemented by a [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]] extension and will be joined by [[Crossrail]] in 2019; however the last two of these lines connect to just one station in the [[South London|south]].\n\nThere are road tunnels at [[Rotherhithe Tunnel|Rotherhithe]] and [[Blackwall Tunnel|Blackwall]], with the [[Woolwich Ferry]] further east.\n\n===Railways===\nThe majority of the rail network in East London was built within fifty years from 1839.

Fring maintains a positive public image; he is a [[boosterism|booster]] for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), befriending the special agent in charge and making large donations to the [[Albuquerque]] office's civic and charitable events. However, he is ruthless and Machiavellian in managing his vast drug empire. He employs a number of enforcers and has personally killed rivals and associates.<ref name=\"AMC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/gustavo-fring |title=Gustavo Fring |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |access-date=October 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nGustavo has a mysterious background, but is supposedly a native of [[Chile]]; he is sometimes referred to by cartel members as \"The Chilean\".

In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Magic Man (Better Call Saul)|Magic Man]]\", Lalo Salamanca refers to a mysterious incident involving Gus which took place in [[Santiago]].

Seeking to expand their drug trade, they met with Mexican cartel leader [[Don Eladio Vuente]]. Eladio rejected their offer, preferring to continue to distribute cocaine, and accused them of disrespect for producing meth in his territory without his permission. [[Hector Salamanca]], one of Eladio's right-hand men, shot Max in the head and forced Gus to watch as Max bled into Eladio's swimming pool. Eladio spared Gus because of his unknown but apparently powerful connection to Chile, but forced him to cooperate with the cartel under Eladio's terms. Gus then moved to Albuquerque and began operating Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants throughout the southwestern United States, which he used to facilitate distribution of the cartel's drugs. While he remains outwardly loyal to the cartel, he spends the next 20 years nursing a grudge against Eladio and Hector and waiting for his chance at revenge. As shown in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Dedicado a Max]]\", at some point before or during the events of ''Better Call Saul'', Gus acquires a small villa just inside the Mexican border.  The villa serves as the residence for [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry_Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]], and Gus installs a fountain there which is dedicated to Max.\n\nGustavo Fring is established as an alias, as neither the DEA nor Gus' enforcer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] can find any records about him prior to his arrival in Mexico.

Instead of killing Tuco, Mike arranges for Tuco to assault him in view of the police, leading to Tuco's arrest. Mike fears Hector will learn that Mike arranged for Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned that Hector will retaliate against Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike acts preemptively by preparing to assassinate Hector, but is interrupted at the last moment. Mike tracks this interruption to Gus, who explains that he wants to be the one to determine when Hector will die. However, Gus encourages Mike to continue to disrupt the trucks Hector uses to bring ice cream store supplies and drugs from Mexico and send cash back to the cartel.  After Mike disrupts two shipments without revealing his identity, Hector demands that Gus temporarily use his Los Pollos Hermanos trucks to ship both Hector's and Gus' drugs. Gus, who had wanted this result from the start, appears to reluctantly agree.  He later attempts to pay Mike, but Mike refuses the money.  Instead, he asks for assistance laundering the $250,000 he stole from one of Hector's trucks, which Gus provides by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive to hire Mike as a contracted security expert and pay him monthly consulting fees.\n\nWith the new transport agreement in place, Nacho and Arturo Colon arrive at the Los Pollos Hermanos warehouse and farm to pick up a drug shipment, and Nacho attempts to strong-arm his way into taking six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five.  When Gus' subordinate [[Tyrus Kitt]] calls Gus for guidance, Gus recognizes an opportunity to infiltrate the Salamanca organization and tells Tyrus to give Nacho the extra kilo.  Nacho fears that Hector will learn of his role in Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned about Hector's intent to take over Nacho's father's upholstery store for use as a front business.  He secretly swaps Hector's angina medication for a [[placebo]], hoping to induce a fatal heart attack.  At a meeting between Juan Bolsa, Gus, Hector and Nacho, Bolsa informs them that the use of Gus' trucks to move the drugs and cash for both organizations will be a permanent arrangement.  Hector's angry outburst leads to a stroke, and Gus calls for an ambulance while administering first aid that saves Hector's life, though he is comatose.  Nacho follows Mike's previous advice to switch the placebos for Hector's real medication so that foul play will not be suspected.  Gus appears to notice Nacho's actions, but says nothing.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nHector is rushed to the hospital, while Gus is summoned along with Nacho and Arturo to a meeting with Bolsa at the Los Pollos distribution plant, where Bolsa declares that until further notice, the Salamanca operation will continue with Nacho and Arturo in charge until Hector recovers. Suspicious of Nacho's behavior following Hector's stroke, Gus has Victor surveil Nacho, and Victor observes Nacho disposing of the placebo pills he switched with Hector's real medication.\n\nNot wanting to lose his revenge opportunity, Gus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Medical Center]] in Baltimore to oversee Hector's treatment. Upon reviewing Hector's medical records, Gus realizes there is no nitroglycerin in Hector's system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo make their next scheduled drug pickup, Arturo strong arms his way into taking an extra kilo, as Nacho did previously.  Arturo brags about his success as they leave, but Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo to death with a plastic bag, then uses his knowledge of Nacho's activities to blackmail Nacho into becoming a double agent.\n\nTyrus and [[Victor (Breaking Bad)|Victor]] stage a roadside shooting and car fire to make it appear as though Nacho and Arturo were attacked and the drugs they picked up stolen by a rival gang, the Espinosas, which also frames the Espinosas for the truck Mike hijacked while concealing his identity and covers up Nacho's new role as Gus' spy in the Salamanca organization. As part of the scheme, Victor shoots Nacho twice and leaves him on the side of the road near the car.  Nacho calls the Cousins for help and they burn the car, then take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera for emergency surgery that saves his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho's car to the Espinosas.  Nacho then falsely identifies the Espinosas as his attackers.  The Cousins kill everyone in the Espinosa compound and retrieve the \"stolen\" drugs, then leave for Mexico to escape police scrutiny.  Nacho sees that by getting the Salamancas to wipe out the Espinosas, Gus has expanded his drug territory, but he does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.\n\nA year later, Hector has recovered to the point where his mental faculties are sound, but his mobility is limited to the index finger of his right hand. Gus ends his specialized care, in effect trapping Hector's healed mind inside his unhealed body.  Hector's nephew Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in managing the family business. While he privately thanks Gus for coming to Hector's aid, he begins to surveil Gus' activities.\n\nGus plans for a secret \"superlab\" to be constructed under an industrial laundry Gus has purchased for the purpose, which will enable him to produce methamphetamine on the U.S. side of the border rather than relying on cartel cocaine from Mexico. Mike arranges for engineers to be interviewed for the job while Gus secretly looks on. The first candidate is rejected after he glibly assures Mike that the job will be easy and can be done without difficulty even under the constraints Gus requires.  The second candidate, [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], impresses Gus with his forthright analysis of the time, expense, and risk associated with the project, which he calls difficult but not impossible. Gus hires Werner to oversee construction of the lab.\n\nTo accomplish the project in secret, Gus buys a warehouse on the outskirts of the city in which he has long-term living quarters built for Werner and his German crew, who maintain secrecy by travelling from their quarters to the job site unseen, work only at night, and do no work above ground. When construction falls behind schedule, Werner effects an escape and plans to rendezvous with his wife.  Mike catches up to him and realizes that Werner inadvertently revealed some construction details to Lalo.  Gus informs Mike that Werner will have to be killed in order to protect the secret of the lab, and plans to send men to do it.  Mike says that since supervising Werner was his responsibility, he will carry out the execution, which he does by shooting Werner in the head.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to take cocaine of inferior quality when picking up the Salamanca's drugs at Los Pollos Hermanos.  Rumors of the \"stepped on\" product reach Nacho and Domingo, who report them to Lalo. Lalo confirms the impurity of the cocaine in a visit to Salamanca street dealers.  In a meeting with Lalo and Juan Bolsa, Gus falsely claims that Werner Ziegler was working under Mike's supervision to construct a chilling system for Gus's chicken farm, and that Werner fled after stealing cocaine.  Gus goes on to claim that in an effort to hide the loss, he replaced the stolen cocaine with locally produced methamphetamine.  The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's departure from Albuquerque, pursuit by Mike, and subsequent death.  Lalo accepts Gus's cover story and apology, but remains suspicious.  Juan reminds Lalo that Gus enjoys the trust of Don Eladio, and indicates that Lalo should let the matter drop.  Because Lalo remains suspicious, Gus shuts down construction of the underground meth lab and has Mike send Werner's workers home.  Gus offers to continue paying Mike during the delay, but Mike declines out of frustration over Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner.\n\nGus coerces Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho gains Lalo's trust, and after Domingo is arrested, Nacho and Lalo use Jimmy/Saul to secure Domingo's release from jail in exchange for the location of several of Gus' dead drops. Nacho reports the plan to Gus, who plans to cancel the drops, but Nacho advises that this will reveal a mole within the Salamanca organization. Gus agrees and on the night of the transfer he tensely waits as Victor and Diego make sure that the DEA and local police seize nearly a million dollars but find no leads to Gus.\n\nMike spends several weeks feeling depressed over Werner's death and drinks to excess. After he is injured by a local gang, Gus has him taken to a pueblo Gus owns just inside the Mexican border, which includes a fountain dedicated to Max. Dr. Barry Goodman tends to Mike's wounds and Mike stays to heal. Gus visits and asks Mike to join his organization, saying that he wants Mike with him because Mike understands his need for revenge.\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to report to Mike about his activities to undermine the Salamanca organization. Mike works under an assumed name to secretly point the police towards Lalo for the murder of Fred the money wire store clerk. Lalo is surrounded by police and arrested. In jail under an assumed name, Lalo contacts Nacho from jail and says he wants Nacho to burn down Gus's flagship Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide status reports to Peter Schuler, Madrigal's CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the status of the meth lab and Gus assures Peter he will get the plan back on track. When Gus returns home, he and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as the mole in the Salamanca organization by destroying Gus's restaurant. Gus wants Lalo released, so he has Mike provide Jimmy the details of his investigation into Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling him to win a motion to release Lalo on bail.\n\nJimmy drives to a remote desert location to pick up the bail money from The Cousins. As he starts his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen who take the money and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed, and the survivor gets away in the only attacker's vehicle that is still drivable. The unseen shooter was Mike, who was tracking Jimmy for Gus. Mike's truck was also damaged, so Jimmy and he recover the money and begin the drive back to Albuquerque in Jimmy's car. When the car breaks down, Jimmy and Mike take the money and walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. After a night in the desert, Mike kills the surviving gunman and Jimmy and he resume walking.\n\nJimmy and Mike eventually make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. Mike and Jimmy agree on a cover story for Jimmy to tell Lalo after Jimmy posts his bail. Jimmy tells Lalo he was alone and walked after his car broke down so that he would not put the money at risk. Lalo says he intends to return to Mexico in order to avoid the scrutiny of police and prosecutors. Mike briefs Gus on the events in the desert, and Gus realizes the attack was ordered by Juan Bolsa to protect Gus's business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to end his work as an informant on the Salamancas, but Gus refuses to part with a valuable asset.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWhen [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] seeks a buyer for his high-quality meth, [[Saul Goodman]] arranges a meeting with the unknown purchaser. Walt and his partner, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]), arrive at a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in the South Valley, but the buyer seemingly never shows up, with Jesse and Walt unaware that Gus, the restaurant manager, had been silently watching them. Walt realizes this later, and arranges a second meeting with only himself and Gus. Gus tells him that he is not interested in conducting business since Jesse was late and [[substance intoxication|high]] for the first meeting, and is thus potentially unreliable. Walt persuades Gus to reconsider his decision, promising that he will never have to deal with Jesse and that their product will earn him enormous returns.\n\nGus eventually agrees to purchase 38 pounds of Walt's meth for $1.2 million but only if it can be delivered within a limited time at a remote location. With Jesse unconscious after taking [[heroin]] with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]], Walt is forced to miss the birth of his daughter Holly to make the delivery. Shortly afterward, Gus is given a tour of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s [[Albuquerque]] field office, along with other local [[boosterism|boosters]]. While there, he discovers that Walt has [[lung cancer]] and that his brother-in-law, [[Hank Schrader]], is a DEA agent.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nGus is pleased with the quality of Walt's blue meth, and offers him $3 million for three months of his time to cook more in a high-tech \"superlab\" hidden under an industrial laundry that Gus owns. Walt initially refuses, but Gus eventually convinces Walt that he should cook for his family's financial security. Gus provides him [[Gale Boetticher]], the talented chemist who set up the superlab, to help cook, but Walt needs to placate Jesse after Hank assaults him, so he convinces Gus to bring Jesse back as his assistant. Gus informs the cartel that once Walt is done with his three months, they will be free to kill him. [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] are impatient and travel from Mexico to the US to carry out the murder, but Gus intervenes and points them to Hank, who actually killed Tuco. Gus anonymously warns Hank about the pending attack, enabling Hank to kill Marco and critically injure Leonel, despite becoming nearly paralyzed from the waist down. Gus uses his influence with the police to distract them at the hospital so Mike can fatally inject Leonel.\n\nThe attempt on Hank's life leads to a large-scale crackdown on the cartel, and Juan Bolsa is killed. Realizing his own life was at stake, Walt agrees to continue cooking in the superlab for an extended period for $15 million with Jesse aiding him, but Gus is still concerned about Jesse's loyalties. Jesse learns that drug dealers who work for Gus were responsible for the death of Tom\u00e1s, the young brother of Jesse's girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]. Before Jesse can kill them himself, Walt runs them over with his car and tells Jesse to flee. Walt explains to Gus that this was just a \"hiccup\" in their agreement. Gus agrees to overlook the matter but reinstates Gale as Walt's assistant, and privately tells Gale to learn all of Walt's methods so that he can take over from Walt. Walt realizes that Gus is trying to groom Gale as his replacement, meaning his life is at risk, so he secretly meets with Jesse and asks him to find out where Gale lives. Once Jesse finds Gale's apartment, Walt sets out to kill him, but Victor stops him and brings him to the lab, where Mike is waiting. Walt asks Mike to let him call Jesse and convince him to come to the lab, but instead Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale. Victor rushes to Gale's apartment, but Jesse arrives first and fatally shoots Gale.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nGus arrives at the lab, where Walt and Jesse have been secured by Victor and Mike.  Knowing he was recognized at Gale's apartment, Victor fears for his life and attempts to show his continued usefulness to Gus by beginning to cook meth, which he learned how to do while guarding Walt and Jesse.  Walt begs for Gus to spare them, but they are shocked when Gus slices open Victor's neck and lets him bleed to death in front of them. Gus calmly tells Walt and Jesse to get back to work, and increases oversight in the lab by installing security cameras and having Mike and Tyrus watch them while they work. Mike suggests to Gus that they may be able to drive a wedge between Walt and Jesse. Mike takes Jesse out of the lab to help pick up dead drops and carry out other tasks, and arranges for Jesse to foil a pre-planned attack on him, which boosts Jesse's confidence and increases his sense of loyalty to Mike and Gus. Gus is impressed by Jesse's mettle, and has Mike involve him in more work outside the lab. Worried about their safety, Walt gives Jesse a cigarette with a capsule of [[ricin]] hidden inside and tells him to poison Gus when he gets the chance, but Jesse does not follow through.\n\nGus arranges to meet with Don Eladio and the other cartel leaders to work out the differences that have caused the cartel to disrupt Gus' business and he brings Mike and Jesse with him. Jesse cooks a superior batch of meth and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico and work for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse.  During the party at Eladio's house to celebrate their rapprochement, Gus tricks Eladio and most of the other cartel leaders into drinking from a poisoned bottle of tequila. Gus takes the first drink to alleviate suspicion, but forces himself to vomit afterwards. During the fight that ensues after cartel leaders begin dying from the poison's effects, Jesse helps the ill Gus and wounded Mike escape, killing Hector's last living grandson, Joaquin Salamanca, in the process.  He brings them to Dr. Goodman's makeshift hospital Gus had previously arranged at his villa, where both receive treatment.  After recovering, Gus returns to Albuquerque and taunts Hector, telling him the cartel leaders are all dead, and that because of Joaquin's death, the Salamanca family line ends with Hector.  Jesse is no longer loyal to Walt and refuses to serve as his protector.  With the DEA beginning to connect Gale's death to Gus, Gus fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's family if he retaliates or informs.\n\nConsidering his life at risk, Walt attempts to kill Gus with a [[pipe bomb]] attached to his car, but Gus senses something amiss and walks away from the vehicle. Panicked, Walt recovers the bomb and hides at his home.  After unsuccessfully attempting to enlist Jesse in aiding him to kill Gus, Walt poisons Andrea's son Brock and convinces Jesse Gus is responsible.  Jesse agrees to help Walt and tells him about Gus' routine, including his visits to Hector at the nursing home.  Walt convinces Hector to help him by promising him final revenge on Gus. Hector pretends to have turned informant to the DEA.  Gus visits Hector to find out why he was at the DEA office.  Hector refuses to acknowledge Gus as Gus prepares to kill him with a lethal injection.  Before Gus administers the shot, Hector suddenly turns to face him, stares at him intently and repeatedly rings the bell on his wheelchair. Too late, Gus sees that the bell is attached to the detonator of Walt's pipe bomb, which Walt had installed on the underside of Hector's wheelchair. The resulting explosion kills Hector and Tyrus immediately. Gus appears uninjured as he calmly walks out of the room and adjusts his tie, but the scene slowly reveals that the explosion removed the right side of his face and head, and Gus falls to the floor and dies.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nThough Gus doesn't appear his death has numerous consequences. The continuing investigation into Gus' death reaches his restaurant business and the destroyed superlab, which Walt and Jesse burned after Gus died. Knowing that the security camera recordings stored on Gus' laptop can incriminate them, Walt, Jesse, and Mike use an electromagnet outside the police station to erase the laptop's hard drive while it is in the police evidence room.  The police recover the account numbers and access codes for the offshore accounts Gus previously set up to pay his employees for their silence and seize the accounts.  Mike, Walt, and Jesse partner in a new meth business, with Mike continuing to pay Gus' former employees out of his share of the profits in order to assure their continued silence.  When police successfully interdict these payments, Walt fears his identity will be exposed and attempts to obtain the employees' names from Mike so he can have them killed. When Mike refuses, Walt kills him. Walt then obtains the names from Lydia Rodart-Quayle and has Gus' former employees killed in prison before they can reveal his identity, effectively bringing an end to Gus' drug distribution empire.\n\n== Character development ==\n[[File:Giancarlo Esposito cropped retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Giancarlo Esposito]] portrays Gus Fring in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe character Gustavo Fring is named after the former [[Germany national football team|German International]] [[Torsten Frings]].<ref name=\"DieWelt\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article161675759/Breaking-Bad-Schurke-nach-deutschem-Trainer-benannt.html |title=Breaking-Bad-Schurke nach deutschem Trainer benannt |date=January 31, 2017 |work=[[Die Welt]] |access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> Initially, [[Giancarlo Esposito]] was offered a character that was described to him as \"very admirable, very polite\", and he decided to play that character as if he had \"some kind of a secret\".

Fring maintains a positive public image; he is a [[boosterism|booster]] for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), befriending the special agent in charge and making large donations to the [[Albuquerque]] office's civic and charitable events. However, he is ruthless and Machiavellian in managing his vast drug empire. He employs a number of enforcers and has personally killed rivals and associates.<ref name=\"AMC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/gustavo-fring |title=Gustavo Fring |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |access-date=October 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nGustavo has a mysterious background, but is supposedly a native of [[Chile]]; he is sometimes referred to by cartel members as \"The Chilean\".

Seeking to expand their drug trade, they met with Mexican cartel leader [[Don Eladio Vuente]]. Eladio rejected their offer, preferring to continue to distribute cocaine, and accused them of disrespect for producing meth in his territory without his permission. [[Hector Salamanca]], one of Eladio's right-hand men, shot Max in the head and forced Gus to watch as Max bled into Eladio's swimming pool. Eladio spared Gus because of his unknown but apparently powerful connection to Chile, but forced him to cooperate with the cartel under Eladio's terms. Gus then moved to Albuquerque and began operating Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants throughout the southwestern United States, which he used to facilitate distribution of the cartel's drugs. While he remains outwardly loyal to the cartel, he spends the next 20 years nursing a grudge against Eladio and Hector and waiting for his chance at revenge. As shown in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Dedicado a Max]]\", at some point before or during the events of ''Better Call Saul'', Gus acquires a small villa just inside the Mexican border.  The villa serves as the residence for [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry_Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]], and Gus installs a fountain there which is dedicated to Max.\n\nGustavo Fring is established as an alias, as neither the DEA nor Gus' enforcer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] can find any records about him prior to his arrival in Mexico. In a flashback during the ''Breaking Bad'' episode \"[[One Minute (Breaking Bad)|One Minute]]\", Hector mockingly refers to him as \"Grand [[Generalissimo]]\", implying that Gus had a connection to the Pinochet regime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guffey |first1=Ensley F. |last2=Koontz |first2= K.

Instead of killing Tuco, Mike arranges for Tuco to assault him in view of the police, leading to Tuco's arrest. Mike fears Hector will learn that Mike arranged for Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned that Hector will retaliate against Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike acts preemptively by preparing to assassinate Hector, but is interrupted at the last moment. Mike tracks this interruption to Gus, who explains that he wants to be the one to determine when Hector will die. However, Gus encourages Mike to continue to disrupt the trucks Hector uses to bring ice cream store supplies and drugs from Mexico and send cash back to the cartel.  After Mike disrupts two shipments without revealing his identity, Hector demands that Gus temporarily use his Los Pollos Hermanos trucks to ship both Hector's and Gus' drugs. Gus, who had wanted this result from the start, appears to reluctantly agree.  He later attempts to pay Mike, but Mike refuses the money.  Instead, he asks for assistance laundering the $250,000 he stole from one of Hector's trucks, which Gus provides by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive to hire Mike as a contracted security expert and pay him monthly consulting fees.\n\nWith the new transport agreement in place, Nacho and Arturo Colon arrive at the Los Pollos Hermanos warehouse and farm to pick up a drug shipment, and Nacho attempts to strong-arm his way into taking six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five.  When Gus' subordinate [[Tyrus Kitt]] calls Gus for guidance, Gus recognizes an opportunity to infiltrate the Salamanca organization and tells Tyrus to give Nacho the extra kilo.  Nacho fears that Hector will learn of his role in Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned about Hector's intent to take over Nacho's father's upholstery store for use as a front business.  He secretly swaps Hector's angina medication for a [[placebo]], hoping to induce a fatal heart attack.  At a meeting between Juan Bolsa, Gus, Hector and Nacho, Bolsa informs them that the use of Gus' trucks to move the drugs and cash for both organizations will be a permanent arrangement.  Hector's angry outburst leads to a stroke, and Gus calls for an ambulance while administering first aid that saves Hector's life, though he is comatose.  Nacho follows Mike's previous advice to switch the placebos for Hector's real medication so that foul play will not be suspected.  Gus appears to notice Nacho's actions, but says nothing.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nHector is rushed to the hospital, while Gus is summoned along with Nacho and Arturo to a meeting with Bolsa at the Los Pollos distribution plant, where Bolsa declares that until further notice, the Salamanca operation will continue with Nacho and Arturo in charge until Hector recovers. Suspicious of Nacho's behavior following Hector's stroke, Gus has Victor surveil Nacho, and Victor observes Nacho disposing of the placebo pills he switched with Hector's real medication.\n\nNot wanting to lose his revenge opportunity, Gus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Medical Center]] in Baltimore to oversee Hector's treatment. Upon reviewing Hector's medical records, Gus realizes there is no nitroglycerin in Hector's system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo make their next scheduled drug pickup, Arturo strong arms his way into taking an extra kilo, as Nacho did previously.  Arturo brags about his success as they leave, but Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo to death with a plastic bag, then uses his knowledge of Nacho's activities to blackmail Nacho into becoming a double agent.\n\nTyrus and [[Victor (Breaking Bad)|Victor]] stage a roadside shooting and car fire to make it appear as though Nacho and Arturo were attacked and the drugs they picked up stolen by a rival gang, the Espinosas, which also frames the Espionsas for the truck Mike hijacked while concealing his identity and covers up Nacho's new role as Gus' spy in the Salamanca organization. As part of the scheme, Victor shoots Nacho twice and leaves him on the side of the road near the car.  Nacho calls the Cousins for help and they burn the car, then take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera for emergency surgery that saves his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho's car to the Espinosas.  Nacho then falsely identifies the Espinosas as his attackers.  The Cousins kill everyone in the Espinosa compound and retrieve the \"stolen\" drugs, then leave for Mexico to escape police scrutiny.  Nacho sees that by getting the Salamancas to wipe out the Espinosas, Gus has expanded his drug territory, but he does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.\n\nA year later, Hector has recovered to the point where his mental faculties are sound, but his mobility is limited to the index finger of his right hand. Gus ends his specialized care, in effect trapping Hector's healed mind inside his unhealed body.  Hector's nephew Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in managing the family business. While he privately thanks Gus for coming to Hector's aid, he begins to surveil Gus' activities.\n\nGus plans for a secret \"superlab\" to be constructed under an industrial laundry Gus has purchased for the purpose, which will enable him to produce methamphetamine on the U.S. side of the border rather than relying on cartel cocaine from Mexico. Mike arranges for engineers to be interviewed for the job while Gus secretly looks on. The first candidate is rejected after he glibly assures Mike that the job will be easy and can be done without difficulty even under the constraints Gus requires.  The second candidate, [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], impresses Gus with his forthright analysis of the time, expense, and risk associated with the project, which he calls difficult but not impossible. Gus hires Werner to oversee construction of the lab.\n\nTo accomplish the project in secret, Gus buys a warehouse on the outskirts of the city in which he has long-term living quarters built for Werner and his German crew, who maintain secrecy by travelling from their quarters to the job site unseen, work only at night, and do no work above ground. When construction falls behind schedule, Werner effects an escape and plans to rendezvous with his wife.  Mike catches up to him and realizes that Werner inadvertently revealed some construction details to Lalo.  Gus informs Mike that Werner will have to be killed in order to protect the secret of the lab, and plans to send men to do it.  Mike says that since supervising Werner was his responsibility, he will carry out the execution, which he does by shooting Werner in the head.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to take cocaine of inferior quality when picking up the Salamanca's drugs at Los Pollos Hermanos.  Rumors of the \"stepped on\" product reach Nacho and Domingo, who report them to Lalo. Lalo confirms the impurity of the cocaine in a visit to Salamanca street dealers.  In a meeting with Lalo and Juan Bolsa, Gus falsely claims that Werner Ziegler was working under Mike's supervision to construct a chilling system for Gus's chicken farm, and that Werner fled after stealing cocaine.  Gus goes on to claim that in an effort to hide the loss, he replaced the stolen cocaine with locally produced methamphetamine.  The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's departure from Albuquerque, pursuit by Mike, and subsequent death.  Lalo accepts Gus's cover story and apology, but remains suspicious.  Juan reminds Lalo that Gus enjoys the trust of Don Eladio, and indicates that Lalo should let the matter drop.  Because Lalo remains suspicious, Gus shuts down construction of the underground meth lab and has Mike send Werner's workers home.  Gus offers to continue paying Mike during the delay, but Mike declines out of frustration over Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner.\n\nGus coerces Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho gains Lalo's trust, and after Domingo is arrested, Nacho and Lalo use Jimmy/Saul to secure Domingo's release from jail in exchange for the location of several of Gus' dead drops. Nacho reports the plan to Gus, who plans to cancel the drops, but Nacho advises that this will reveal a mole within the Salamanca organization. Gus agrees and on the night of the transfer he tensely waits as Victor and Diego make sure that the DEA and local police seize nearly a million dollars but find no leads to Gus.\n\nMike spends several weeks feeling depressed over Werner's death and drinks to excess. After he is injured by a local gang, Gus has him taken to a pueblo Gus owns just inside the Mexican border, which includes a fountain dedicated to Max. Dr. Barry Goodman tends to Mike's wounds and Mike stays to heal. Gus visits and asks Mike to join his organization, saying that he wants Mike with him because Mike understands his need for revenge.\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to report to Mike about his activities to undermine the Salamanca organization. Mike works under an assumed name to secretly point the police towards Lalo for the murder of Fred the money wire store clerk. Lalo is surrounded by police and arrested. In jail under an assumed name, Lalo contacts Nacho from jail and says he wants Nacho to burn down Gus's flagship Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide status reports to Peter Schuler, Madrigal's CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the status of the meth lab and Gus assures Peter he will get the plan back on track. When Gus returns home, he and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as the mole in the Salamanca organization by destroying Gus's restaurant. Gus wants Lalo released, so he has Mike provide Jimmy the details of his investigation into Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling him to win a motion to release Lalo on bail.\n\nJimmy drives to a remote desert location to pick up the bail money from The Cousins. As he starts his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen who take the money and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked by an unknown shooter. All but one are killed, and the survivor gets away in the only attacker's vehicle that is still drivable. The unseen shooter was Mike, who was tracking Jimmy for Gus. Mike's truck was also damaged, so Jimmy and he recover the money and begin the drive back to Albuquerque in Jimmy's car. When the car breaks down, Jimmy and Mike take the money and walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. After a night in the desert, Mike kills the surviving gunman and Jimmy and he resume walking.\n\nJimmy and Mike eventually make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. Mike and Jimmy agree on a cover story for Jimmy to tell Lalo after Jimmy posts his bail. Jimmy tells Lalo he was alone and walked after his car broke down so that he would not put the money at risk. Lalo says he intends to return to Mexico in order to avoid the scrutiny of police and prosecutors. Mike briefs Gus on the events in the desert, and Gus realizes the attack was ordered by Juan Bolsa to protect Gus's business. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to end his work as an informant on the Salamancas, but Gus refuses to part with a valuable asset.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWhen [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] seeks a buyer for his high-quality meth, [[Saul Goodman]] arranges a meeting with the unknown purchaser. Walt and his partner, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]), arrive at a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in the South Valley, but the buyer seemingly never shows up, with Jesse and Walt unaware that Gus, the restaurant manager, had been silently watching them. Walt realizes this later, and arranges a second meeting with only himself and Gus. Gus tells him that he is not interested in conducting business since Jesse was late and [[substance intoxication|high]] for the first meeting, and is thus potentially unreliable. Walt persuades Gus to reconsider his decision, promising that he will never have to deal with Jesse and that their product will earn him enormous returns.\n\nGus eventually agrees to purchase 38 pounds of Walt's meth for $1.2 million but only if it can be delivered within a limited time at a remote location. With Jesse unconscious after taking [[heroin]] with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]], Walt is forced to miss the birth of his daughter Holly to make the delivery. Shortly afterward, Gus is given a tour of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s [[Albuquerque]] field office, along with other local [[boosterism|boosters]]. While there, he discovers that Walt has [[lung cancer]] and that his brother-in-law, [[Hank Schrader]], is a DEA agent.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nGus is pleased with the quality of Walt's blue meth, and offers him $3 million for three months of his time to cook more in a high-tech \"superlab\" hidden under an industrial laundry that Gus owns. Walt initially refuses, but Gus eventually convinces Walt that he should cook for his family's financial security. Gus provides him [[Gale Boetticher]], the talented chemist who set up the superlab, to help cook, but Walt needs to placate Jesse after Hank assaults him, so he convinces Gus to bring Jesse back as his assistant. Gus informs the cartel that once Walt is done with his three months, they will be free to kill him. [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] are impatient and travel from Mexico to the US to carry out the murder, but Gus intervenes and points them to Hank, who actually killed Tuco. Gus anonymously warns Hank about the pending attack, enabling Hank to kill Marco and critically injure Leonel, despite becoming nearly paralyzed from the waist down. Gus uses his influence with the police to distract them at the hospital so Mike can fatally inject Leonel.\n\nThe attempt on Hank's life leads to a large-scale crackdown on the cartel, and Juan Bolsa is killed. Realizing his own life was at stake, Walt agrees to continue cooking in the superlab for an extended period for $15 million with Jesse aiding him, but Gus is still concerned about Jesse's loyalties. Jesse learns that drug dealers who work for Gus were responsible for the death of Tom\u00e1s, the young brother of Jesse's girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]. Before Jesse can kill them himself, Walt runs them over with his car and tells Jesse to flee. Walt explains to Gus that this was just a \"hiccup\" in their agreement. Gus agrees to overlook the matter but reinstates Gale as Walt's assistant, and privately tells Gale to learn all of Walt's methods so that he can take over from Walt. Walt realizes that Gus is trying to groom Gale as his replacement, meaning his life is at risk, so he secretly meets with Jesse and asks him to find out where Gale lives. Once Jesse finds Gale's apartment, Walt sets out to kill him, but Victor stops him and brings him to the lab, where Mike is waiting. Walt asks Mike to let him call Jesse and convince him to come to the lab, but instead Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale. Victor rushes to Gale's apartment, but Jesse arrives first and fatally shoots Gale.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nGus arrives at the lab, where Walt and Jesse have been secured by Victor and Mike.  Knowing he was recognized at Gale's apartment, Victor fears for his life and attempts to show his continued usefulness to Gus by beginning to cook meth, which he learned how to do while guarding Walt and Jesse.  Walt begs for Gus to spare them, but they are shocked when Gus slices open Victor's neck and lets him bleed to death in front of them. Gus calmly tells Walt and Jesse to get back to work, and increases oversight in the lab by installing security cameras and having Mike and Tyrus watch them while they work. Mike suggests to Gus that they may be able to drive a wedge between Walt and Jesse. Mike takes Jesse out of the lab to help pick up dead drops and carry out other tasks, and arranges for Jesse to foil a pre-planned attack on him, which boosts Jesse's confidence and increases his sense of loyalty to Mike and Gus. Gus is impressed by Jesse's mettle, and has Mike involve him in more work outside the lab. Worried about their safety, Walt gives Jesse a cigarette with a capsule of [[ricin]] hidden inside and tells him to poison Gus when he gets the chance, but Jesse does not follow through.\n\nGus arranges to meet with Don Eladio and the other cartel leaders to work out the differences that have caused the cartel to disrupt Gus' business and he brings Mike and Jesse with him. Jesse cooks a superior batch of meth and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico and work for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse.  During the party at Eladio's house to celebrate their rapprochement, Gus tricks Eladio and most of the other cartel leaders into drinking from a poisoned bottle of tequila. Gus takes the first drink to alleviate suspicion, but forces himself to vomit afterwards. During the fight that ensues after cartel leaders begin dying from the poison's effects, Jesse helps the ill Gus and wounded Mike escape, killing Hector's last living grandson, Joaquin Salamanca, in the process.  He brings them to Dr. Goodman's makeshift hospital Gus had previously arranged at his villa, where both receive treatment.  After recovering, Gus returns to Albuquerque and taunts Hector, telling him the cartel leaders are all dead, and that because of Joaquin's death, the Salamanca family line ends with Hector.  Jesse is no longer loyal to Walt and refuses to serve as his protector.  With the DEA beginning to connect Gale's death to Gus, Gus fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's family if he retaliates or informs.\n\nConsidering his life at risk, Walt attempts to kill Gus with a [[pipe bomb]] attached to his car, but Gus senses something amiss and walks away from the vehicle. Panicked, Walt recovers the bomb and hides at his home.  After unsuccessfully attempting to enlist Jesse in aiding him to kill Gus, Walt poisons Andrea's son Brock and convinces Jesse Gus is responsible.  Jesse agrees to help Walt and tells him about Gus' routine, including his visits to Hector at the nursing home.  Walt convinces Hector to help him by promising him final revenge on Gus. Hector pretends to have turned informant to the DEA.  Gus visits Hector to find out why he was at the DEA office.  Hector refuses to acknowledge Gus as Gus prepares to kill him with a lethal injection.  Before Gus administers the shot, Hector suddenly turns to face him, stares at him intently and repeatedly rings the bell on his wheelchair. Too late, Gus sees that the bell is attached to the detonator of Walt's pipe bomb, which Walt had installed on the underside of Hector's wheelchair. The resulting explosion kills Hector and Tyrus immediately. Gus appears uninjured as he calmly walks out of the room and adjusts his tie, but the scene slowly reveals that the explosion removed the right side of his face and head, and Gus falls to the floor and dies.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nThough Gus doesn't appear his death has numerous consequences. The continuing investigation into Gus' death reaches his restaurant business and the destroyed superlab, which Walt and Jesse burned after Gus died. Knowing that the security camera recordings stored on Gus' laptop can incriminate them, Walt, Jesse, and Mike use an electromagnet outside the police station to erase the laptop's hard drive while it is in the police evidence room.  The police recover the account numbers and access codes for the offshore accounts Gus previously set up to pay his employees for their silence and seize the accounts.  Mike, Walt, and Jesse partner in a new meth business, with Mike continuing to pay Gus' former employees out of his share of the profits in order to assure their continued silence.  When police successfully interdict these payments, Walt fears his identity will be exposed and attempts to obtain the employees' names from Mike so he can have them killed. When Mike refuses, Walt kills him. Walt then obtains the names from Lydia Rodart-Quayle and has Gus' former employees killed in prison before they can reveal his identity, effectively bringing an end to Gus' drug distribution empire.\n\n== Character development ==\n[[File:Giancarlo Esposito cropped retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Giancarlo Esposito]] portrays Gus Fring in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe character Gustavo Fring is named after the former [[Germany national football team|German International]] [[Torsten Frings]].<ref name=\"DieWelt\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article161675759/Breaking-Bad-Schurke-nach-deutschem-Trainer-benannt.html |title=Breaking-Bad-Schurke nach deutschem Trainer benannt |date=January 31, 2017 |work=[[Die Welt]] |access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> Initially, [[Giancarlo Esposito]] was offered a character that was described to him as \"very admirable, very polite\", and he decided to play that character as if he had \"some kind of a secret\".

Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark.

This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Charles Montesquieu.jpg|[[Montesquieu]]\nFile:Rosa Bonheur, 1865, wearing the Legion of Honour.jpg|[[Rosa Bonheur]]\nFile:095 Odilon Redon Mon portrait.jpg|[[Odilon Redon]]\nFile:Self-Portrait Albert Marquet (1904).jpg|[[Albert Marquet]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*[[Ausonius]] (310-395), Roman poet and teacher of rhetoric\n*[[Jean Alaux]] (1786\u20131864), painter\n*[[Bertrand Andrieu]] (1761\u20131822), engraver\n*[[Jean Anouilh]] (1910\u20131987), dramatist\n*[[Lucien Arman]] (1811-1873), shipbuilder and politician\n*[[Yvonne Arnaud]] (1892\u20131958), pianist, singer and actress\n*[[Floyd Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1988), Togolese footballer\n*[[Jonathan Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1985), Togolese footballer\n*[[Christine Barbe]], winemaker\n*[[G\u00e9rard Bayo]] (born 1936), writer and poet,\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]] (1703\u20131778), last \"Intendant\" of New France\n*[[Rosa Bonheur]] (1822-1899), animal painter and sculptor\n*[[Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy]] (born 1982), golfer\n*[[Samuel Boutal]] (born 1969), footballer\n*[[Edmond de Caillou]] (died c.

France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament.

The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]].

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Charles Montesquieu.jpg|[[Montesquieu]]\nFile:Rosa Bonheur, 1865, wearing the Legion of Honour.jpg|[[Rosa Bonheur]]\nFile:095 Odilon Redon Mon portrait.jpg|[[Odilon Redon]]\nFile:Self-Portrait Albert Marquet (1904).jpg|[[Albert Marquet]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*[[Ausonius]] (310-395), Roman poet and teacher of rhetoric\n*[[Jean Alaux]] (1786\u20131864), painter\n*[[Bertrand Andrieu]] (1761\u20131822), engraver\n*[[Jean Anouilh]] (1910\u20131987), dramatist\n*[[Lucien Arman]] (1811-1873), shipbuilder and politician\n*[[Yvonne Arnaud]] (1892\u20131958), pianist, singer and actress\n*[[Floyd Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1988), Togolese footballer\n*[[Jonathan Ayit\u00e9]] (born 1985), Togolese footballer\n*[[Christine Barbe]], winemaker\n*[[G\u00e9rard Bayo]] (born 1936), writer and poet,\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]] (1703\u20131778), last \"Intendant\" of New France\n*[[Rosa Bonheur]] (1822-1899), animal painter and sculptor\n*[[Gr\u00e9gory Bourdy]] (born 1982), golfer\n*[[Samuel Boutal]] (born 1969), footballer\n*[[Edmond de Caillou]] (died c.

stations consist of five gas turbine facilities, in Auckland, Hamilton, Hawkes Bay and Taranaki; five geothermal stations north of Taupo; and two hydroelectric dams on the Clutha River.\n\nContact originated with the partitioning of the [[Electricity Corporation of New Zealand]] in 1996, and publicly [[Listing (finance)|listed]] in 1999.\n\n== History ==\nContact was incorporated on 8 November 1995 and became a state owned enterprise on 18 November 1995.<ref name=\"AR1996\">{{cite book| title=Annual Report 1996| url=http://www.contactenergy.co.nz/web/pdf/financial/1996_annualreport_full.pdf| publisher=Contact Energy| date=11 December 1996}}</ref>  Contact commenced operations on 1 February 1996, acquiring assets from [[Electricity Corporation of New Zealand|ECNZ]] with a payment of $1.6 billion.<ref name=\"AR1996\" />  As the founding chief executive, [[Paul Anthony]] was instrumental in establishing the corporation distinct from ECNZ.\n\nIn 1999, the company was sold, with 40% purchased by [[Edison Mission Energy]] (EME) as cornerstone shareholder for $5 per share.  The remaining 60% was sold in a public offering of shares for $3.10 per share.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.converge.org.nz/watchdog/08/06.htm| title=Electricity Reforms and Contact Energy Ltd| first=Sue| last=Newberry| date=April 2005| publisher=Converge}}</ref>  EME subsequently increased its shareholding to 51%.\n\nAs part of the 1999 electricity sector reforms, local electricity companies were split into lines and retail, with most selling the retail part off. Contact Energy acquired the retail bases of [[Top Energy]], Counties Power, Eastland Network (Gisborne area), Unison (Hawke's Bay area), Electra, Network Tasman, [[MainPower]], Alpine Energy, [[Aurora Energy (New Zealand)|Aurora Energy]] (Dunedin area), The Power Company and Electricity Invercargill.\n\nFollowing financial difficulties elsewhere in its business, EME sold its shareholding to [[Origin Energy]] in 2004.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, Contact decided to increase prices by up to 12% while doubling its directors' fees. As a result, it lost more than 40,000 customers in six months \u2212 10% of the total. Its profit was halved. Contact calls this the worst blow to its reputation in the company's history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/droughts/news/article.cfm?c_id=180&objectid=10590906&pnum=0|title=Director-fee fallout hurts Contact|first=Grant|last=Bradley|date=15 August 2009|publisher=NZ Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nzenergy-environment.co.nz/home/free-articles/the-market-teaches-contact-a-lesson-after-directors-fees-fiasco.html|title=The Market Teaches Contact A Lesson After Director\u2019s Fees Fiasco|date=29 April 2009|publisher=NZ Energy & Environment Business Week|access-date=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521223957/http://nzenergy-environment.co.nz/home/free-articles/the-market-teaches-contact-a-lesson-after-directors-fees-fiasco.html|archive-date=21 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing financial difficulties elsewhere in its business, Origin sold its 53% shareholding to the market in 2015.<ref>{{cite press release| url=https://www.contact.co.nz/cenergymedia/contactenergy/files/pdfs/corporate/cen-origin-energy-sale-of-contact-completed.pdf| title=Origin Energy sale of Contact completed| date=5 August 2015| publisher=Contact Energy| access-date=5 August 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015441/https://contact.co.nz/cenergymedia/contactenergy/files/pdfs/corporate/cen-origin-energy-sale-of-contact-completed.pdf| archive-date=23 January 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Power stations ==\nContact owns and operates (unless otherwise stated) the following power stations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! width=10%| Name !!

Smith was the only member of the group to wear dreads and use Jamaican slang, or Jamaican Patois, in his raps. Smith's unique style added an element to the group that allowed for rapid success. Soon after, however, internal problems arose because of Busta Rhymes's increasing popularity, and the group broke up on the set of ''[[Yo!

Smith was the only member of the group to wear dreads and use Jamaican slang, or Jamaican Patois, in his raps. Smith's unique style added an element to the group that allowed for rapid success. Soon after, however, internal problems arose because of Busta Rhymes's increasing popularity, and the group broke up on the set of ''[[Yo!

The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded. In 1977, its name was changed to Jefferson Technical College. In 1995, it became a community college and was renamed Jefferson Community College. In 2009, the college expanded its service district by three Ohio counties, and was renamed again: [[Eastern Gateway Community College]].\n\nThe city gained international attention in late 2012 from the events surrounding the [[Steubenville High School rape case]], which occurred in August 2012. The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013. The case was significant in the extensive use of social media as evidence and in opening a national discussion on the concept of [[rape culture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/fox-news-steubenville-rape-victim_n_2901635.html|title=CNN, Fox News, MSNBC Air Name of Steubenville Rape Victim|date=March 18, 2013|last=Fung|first=Katherine|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=nyt20121217>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |title=Rape Case Unfolds on Web and Splits City |work=The New York Times |date=December 16, 2012|last1=Schweber|first1=Nate|last2=Macur|first2=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSteubenville is located at {{coord|40|21|30|N|80|37|0|W|type:city}} (40.359, \u221280.614).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|10.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> The city lies along the [[Ohio River]], with the city spreading west from the floodplains to the hills that surround the city.

The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.\n\n====Political corruption====\nSteubenville has had a reputation for [[political corruption]]. Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations.

Corporations such as [[Weirton Steel]] have had to reduce their workforce in order to become more efficient and competitive against other steel producers and lower steel prices worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe new Findlay Connector has been built in western [[Pennsylvania]] as a toll-access highway between [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] at [[Interstate 376]] and U.S. Route 22 in northwestern [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]. Travel time between the Pittsburgh International Airport and the city of Steubenville is now approximately 25 minutes.\n\nSteubenville is located near two large [[shale]] formations - the [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus]] and Utica formations.\n\n==Culture==\n===Historic sites===\nFort Steuben, located downtown on South Third Street, is a reconstructed 18th century fort on its original location overlooking the Ohio River. Built in 1787 to protect the government surveyors of the [[Seven Ranges]] of the Northwest Territory, Fort Steuben housed 150 men of the 1st American Regiment. The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater. The Fort Steuben Visitors center is home to the Museum Shop and the Steubenville Convention & Visitors Bureau and is an official site on the Ohio River Scenic Byway.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAdjacent to the fort is the First Federal Land Office with its original logs from 1801. After the Ohio country was surveyed, it could be sold or given away as land grants; the settlers brought their deeds to be registered at the Land Office to David Hoge, the Registrar of Lands and Titles for the Northwest Territory.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n\"Ohio Valley Steelworker\" Statue was created by artist Dimitri Akis as a tribute to the [[Ohio Valley]] [[Steelworkers]].  The life-size figure carries a long-handled dipping ladle and is wearing the hooded fire-proof suit worn in the steel mills. The statue was located at the junction of Hwy 22 (University Blvd) and Hwy 7 (Dean Martin Blvd).  In the fall of 2014, the statue was moved to its new home, displayed on South Fourth Street at the site of the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|title=Steelworker on the Move|first=Dave|last=Gossett|date=13 November 2014|newspaper=Herald-Star|access-date=2014-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220062105/http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|archive-date=2014-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere is a statue downtown commemorating [[Edwin Stanton]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[secretary of war]].

The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.\n\n====Political corruption====\nSteubenville has had a reputation for [[political corruption]]. Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue.
