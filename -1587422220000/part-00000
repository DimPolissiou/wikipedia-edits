They were to be shown between ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' pro wrestling matches, but [[Eric Bischoff|the C.E.O. of WCW]] who had green-lit the project was fired the weekend before they were to air, so they were finished but never actually broadcast.

Roth, feeling their film was so powerful he had to do whatever he could to make sure fans saw it, introduced it at its premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in May 2008, five and a half years after he first gave the tape to Knowles.

He had had a copy in his video collection for years, and showed it at Knowles' [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]] film festival in December. The response was so great that Roth took the tape to his first meeting at [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] to give to Spielberg. An executive called the next week saying Spielberg loved it and wanted to contact the filmmakers. Roth had never met them, but Google-searched every name in the credits until he found Jayson Lamb, the cinematographer. The three filmmakers\u2014Lamb, Chris Strompolis and Eric Zala (a former [[Activision]] employee) had not spoken to each other in years when Roth contacted them. Roth, feeling their film was so powerful he had to do whatever he could to make sure fans saw it, introduced it at its premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in May 2008, five and a half years after he first gave the tape to Knowles. Soon, the three reunited friends were touring the world, doing charity screenings.\n\n[[File:Eli Roth 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Roth at the Spike TV [[Scream Awards]], 2007]]\nIn March 2006, [[Ain't It Cool News]] announced that [[Dimension Films]] had bought the rights to the ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' by [[Stephen King]] and would produce a film to be directed by Roth.
