The Parthian armies included two types of [[cavalry]]: the heavily armed and armoured [[cataphract]]s and the lightly-armed but highly-mobile [[mounted archery|mounted archers]].\n\nFor the Romans, who relied on heavy [[infantry]], the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. The [[Parthian shot]] used by the Parthian cavalry was most notably feared by the Roman soldiers, which proved pivotal in the crushing Roman defeat at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in [[siege]] warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able completely to [[annexation|annex]] each other's territory.\n\nThe Parthian empire subsisted for five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires. The end of this empire came at last in 224 AD, when the empire's organization had loosened and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassal peoples, the Persians under the Sasanians.

The Sassanians called their empire ''Er\u00e2nshahr'' (\"Dominion of the Aryans\", i.e., of [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]]).<ref>Garthwaite, Gene R., ''The Persians'', p. 2</ref>\n\nA chapter of Iran's history followed after roughly six hundred years of conflict with the Roman Empire. During this time, the Sassanian and Romano-Byzantine armies clashed for influence in [[Anatolia]], the western [[Caucasus]] (mainly [[Lazica]] and the [[Kingdom of Iberia]]; modern-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Abkhazia]]), [[Mesopotamia]], Armenia and the Levant. Under Justinian I, the war came to an uneasy peace with payment of tribute to the Sassanians.\n\nHowever, the Sasanians used the deposition of the Byzantine emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] as a ''casus belli'' to attack the Empire. After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople, and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace. With the conclusion of the over 700 years lasting Roman\u2013Persian Wars through the climactic [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], which included the very [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]], the war-exhausted Persians lost the [[Battle of al-Q\u0101disiyyah]] (632) in [[Hilla]] (present day [[Iraq]]) to the invading Muslim forces.\n\nThe Sasanian era, encompassing the length of [[Late Antiquity]], is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran, and had a major impact on the world. In many ways the Sassanian period witnessed the highest achievement of Persian civilization, and constitutes the last great Iranian Empire before the adoption of Islam.

Several Iranian nobles and families such as king Dinar of the [[House of Karen]], and later [[Kanarang]]iyans of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], mutinied against their Sasanian overlords. Although the [[House of Mihran]] had claimed the Sasanian throne under the two prominent generals [[Bahr\u0101m Ch\u014dbin]] and [[Shahrbaraz]], it remained loyal to the Sasanians during their struggle against the Arabs, but the Mihrans were eventually betrayed and defeated by their own kinsmen, the [[House of Ispahbudhan]], under their leader [[Farrukhzad]], who had mutinied against Yazdegerd III.\n\nYazdegerd III, fled from one district to another until a local miller killed him for his purse at [[Merv]] in 651.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&fullArticle=true&tocId=9106324 | title=Iran | encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref> By 674, Muslims had conquered [[Greater Khorasan]] (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan and parts of [[Transoxiana]]).\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] ended the Sasanian Empire and led to the eventual decline of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion in Persia. Over time, the majority of Iranians converted to Islam. Most of the aspects of the previous Persian civilizations were not discarded, but were absorbed by the new [[Islam]]ic polity. As [[Bernard Lewis]] has commented:\n{{quote|These events have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders.

During this era, Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of ''mawali''.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shias had failed to quell unrest among these minorities.\n\nHowever, all of Iran was still not under Arab control, and the region of [[Daylam]] was under the control of the [[Daylamites]], while [[Tabaristan]] was under [[Dabuyid dynasty|Dabuyid]] and [[Paduspanids|Paduspanid]] control, and the [[Mount Damavand]] region under [[Masmughans of Damavand]].

[[Abu Muslim]] was sent to Khorasan by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] initially as a propagandist and then to revolt on their behalf. He took [[Merv]] defeating the Umayyad governor there [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]]. He became the [[de facto]] Abbasid governor of Khurasan. During the same period, the Dabuyid ruler [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]] declared independence from the Umayyads, but was shortly forced to recognize Abbasid authority. In 750, Abu Muslim became leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at the [[Battle of the Zab]].

Eventually, this change meant that many caliphs under the Abbasids ended up in a much more ceremonial role than ever before, with the vizier in real power. A new Persian bureaucracy began to replace the old Arab aristocracy, and the entire administration reflected these changes, demonstrating that the new dynasty was different in many ways to the Umayyads.<ref name=\"AHGC\"/>\n\nBy the 9th century, Abbasid control began to wane as regional leaders sprang up in the far corners of the empire to challenge the central authority of the Abbasid caliphate.<ref name=\"AHGC\"/> The Abbasid caliphs began enlisting ''mamluks'', Turkic-speaking warriors, who had been moving out of Central Asia into [[Transoxiana]] as slave warriors as early as the 9th century.

Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the [[Tahirids]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (821\u2013873); the [[Saffarids]] in [[Sistan]] (861\u20131003, their rule lasted as maliks of Sistan until 1537); and the [[Samanids]] (819\u20131005), originally at [[Bukhara]]. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan.<ref name=\"Islamic Conquest\"/>\n\nBy the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the [[Buyid dynasty]] (934\u20131062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Turks, who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids, while publicly pledging allegiance to them.

[[Richard Bulliet]]'s \"conversion curve\" indicates that only about 10% of Iran converted to Islam during the relatively Arab-centric [[Umayyad]] period. Beginning in the [[Abassid]] period, with its mix of Persian as well as Arab rulers, the Muslim percentage of the population rose. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule of the country, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.<ref>Nasr, Hoseyn; Islam and the pliqht of modern man</ref>\n\nAlthough Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as [[Persianization]].

The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals.  Their successor, the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznawids]], who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/samanids/samanids.php|title=History of Iran: Samanid Dynasty|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A treatise on chess 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Persian manuscript describing how an ambassador from India brought [[Shatranj|chess]] to the Persian court]]\n\nThe culmination of the [[Persianization]] movement was the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the national epic of Iran, written almost entirely in Persian.

According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:<ref name=\"lewis\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\"Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India.

Under Tughril Beg's successor, [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]] (1072\u20131092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, [[Nizam al Mulk]]. These leaders established the observatory where [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]] did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built [[Nizamiyya|religious schools]] in all the major towns.

In Anatolia, Malik Shah I was succeeded by [[Kilij Arslan I]] who founded the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] and in [[Syria]] by his brother [[Tutush I]]. In [[Persia]] he was succeeded by his son [[Mahmud I of Great Seljuq|Mahmud I]] whose reign was contested by his other three brothers [[Barkiyaruq]] in [[Iraq]], [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]] in [[Baghdad]] and [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. As Seljuq power in Iran weakened, other dynasties began to step up in its place, including a resurgent Abbasid caliphate and the [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmshahs]]. The Khwarezmid Empire was a Sunni Muslim Persianate dynasty, of East Turkic origin, that ruled in Central Asia. Originally vassals of the Seljuqs, they took advantage of the decline of the Seljuqs to expand into Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9045365|title=Academic Home|publisher=}}</ref> In 1194 the Khwarezmshah [[Ala ad-Din Tekish]] defeated the Seljuq sultan [[Toghrul III of Seljuq|Toghrul III]] in battle and the Seljuq empire in Iran collapsed.

Although the Mongol invaders were eventually converted to Islam and accepted the culture of Iran, the Mongol destruction of the Islamic heartland marked a major change of direction for the region.

Genghis' grandson, [[Hulagu Khan]], was tasked with the westward expansion of Mongol dominion. However, by time he ascended to power, the Mongol Empire had already dissolved, dividing into different factions. Arriving with an army, he established himself in the region and founded the [[Ilkhanate]], a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, which would rule Iran for the next eighty years and become Persianate in the process.\n\nHulagu Khan seized Baghdad in 1258 and put the last Abbasid caliph to death. The westward advance of his forces was stopped by the [[Bahri dynasty|Mamelukes]], however, at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1260. Hulagu's campaigns against the Muslims also enraged [[Berke]], khan of the [[Golden Horde]] and a convert to Islam. Hulagu and Berke fought against each other, demonstrating the weakening unity of the Mongol empire.\n\nThe rule of Hulagu's great-grandson, [[Ghazan]] (1295\u20131304) saw the establishment of Islam as the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Ghazan and his famous Iranian vizier, [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], brought Iran a partial and brief economic revival. The Mongols lowered taxes for artisans, encouraged agriculture, rebuilt and extended irrigation works, and improved the safety of the trade routes. As a result, commerce increased dramatically.\n\nItems from India, China, and Iran passed easily across the Asian steppes, and these contacts culturally enriched Iran. For example, Iranians developed a new style of painting based on a unique fusion of solid, two-dimensional Mesopotamian painting with the feathery, light brush strokes and other motifs characteristic of China. After Ghazan's nephew [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Said]] died in 1335, however, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties \u2013 most prominently the [[Jalayirids]], [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Sarbadars]] and [[Kartids]].\n\nThe mid-14th-century [[Black Death]] killed about 30% of the country's population.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/interrogatory/kelly200509140843.asp Q&A with John Kelly on The Great Mortality on National Review Online].</ref>\n\n==== Sunnism and Shiism in pre-Safavid Iran ====\n{{Main|Islam in Iran}}\n[[File:Imam reza shrine in Mashhad.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Imam Reza shrine]], the tomb of the eighth Imam of the twelver Shiites]]\n\nPrior to the rise of the Safavid Empire, Sunni Islam was the dominant religion, accounting for around 90% of the population at the time. According to [[Mortaza Motahhari]] the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni until the time of the Safavids.<ref name=\"Motahhari\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/iran/mutual.htm|title=Islam and Iran: A Historical Study of Mutual Services|publisher=|date=2013-03-13}}</ref> The domination of Sunnis did not mean Shia were rootless in Iran. The writers of [[The Four Books]] of Shia were Iranian, as well as many other great Shia scholars.\n\nThe domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterized the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zayd\u012bs]] of [[Tabaristan]] (see [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran]]), the [[Buyids]], the [[Kakuyids]], the rule of [[\u00d6ljeit\u00fc|Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah]] (r.

During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from [[Kufa]]h, [[Baghdad]] and later from [[Najaf]] and [[Hillah]].<ref name=\"al-islam.org\"/> Shiism was the dominant sect in [[Tabaristan]], [[Qom]], [[Kashan]], [[Avaj]] and [[Sabzevar]]. In many other areas merged population of Shia and Sunni lived together.\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries,  [[Fatimids]] sent [[Ismailis]] [[Dawah|Da'i (missioners)]] to Iran as well as other Muslim lands. When Ismailis divided into two sects, [[Nizari]]s established their base in Iran. [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] conquered fortresses and captured  [[Alamut]] in 1090 AD. Nizaris used this fortress until a Mongol raid in 1256.\n\nAfter the Mongol raid and fall of the Abbasids, Sunni hierarchies faltered. Not only did they lose the caliphate but also the status of official [[madhhab]]. Their loss was the gain of Shia, whose center wasn't in Iran at that time. Several local Shia dynasties like [[Sarbadars]] were established during this time.\n\nThe main change occurred in the beginning of the 16th century, when [[Ismail I]] founded the [[Safavid dynasty]] and initiated a religious policy to [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|recognize Shi'a Islam as the official religion]] of the [[Safavid Empire]], and the fact that modern Iran remains an officially Shi'ite state is a direct result of Ismail's actions.\n\n=== Timurid Empire (1370\u20131507) ===\n[[File:Timurid Dynasty 821 - 873 (AH).png|thumb|250px|A map of the [[Timurid Empire]].]]\n{{Main|Timurid Empire}}\nIran remained divided until the arrival of [[Timur]], an Iranified [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]]<ref>Peter B.

A year after his victory in Tabriz, Ism\u0101il proclaimed most of Persia as his domain, and<ref name=\"savoryeiref\" /> quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule. Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], parts of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Mesopotamia]] (Iraq), [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]], [[Dagestan]], large parts of what is now [[Afghanistan]], parts of [[Turkmenistan]], and large chunks of [[Anatolia]], laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the [[Caucasus]] and its [[Peoples of the Caucasus|peoples]]).\n\n[[File:ShahAbbasPortraitFromItalianPainter.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Shah Abbas I]]\n\n[[Tahmasp I]], the son and successor of [[Ismail I]], carried out multiple invasions in the [[Caucasus]] which had been incorporated in the [[Safavid empire]] since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving hundreds of thousands of [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], and [[Armenians]] to Iran's heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the [[Qizilbash]], by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society. As ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'' states, for Tahmasp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qizilbash, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tahmasp-i|title=\u1e6cAHM\u0100SP I|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the indisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the ''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazis]]'' of the neighboring [[Ottoman Empire]]) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]].\n\nShah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] and his successors would significantly expand this policy and plan initiated by Tahmasp, deporting during his reign alone around some 200,000 [[Georgians]], 300,000 [[Armenians]] and 100,000\u2013150,000 [[Circassians]] to Iran, completing the foundation of a new layer in Iranian society. With this, and the complete systematic disorganisation of the Qizilbash by his personal orders, he eventually fully succeeded in replacing the power of the Qizilbash, with that of the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] ghulams. These new Caucasian elements (the so-called ''[[ghilman]]'' / \u063a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646 / ''\"servants\"''), almost always after conversion to [[Shia Islam|Shi'ism]] depending on given function would be, were unlike the Qizilbash, fully loyal only to the Shah. The other masses of Caucasians were deployed in all other possible functions and positions available in the empire, as well as in the [[harem]], regular military, craftsmen, farmers, etc. This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the [[Qajar Dynasty]].\n\n[[File:\u10e0\u10dd\u10e1\u10e2\u10dd\u10db \u10ee\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8.gif|thumb|left|upright|[[Rostom of Kartli|Rostom]] (also known as ''Rustam Khan''), viceroy of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]], eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], from 1633\u20131658]]\n\nThe greatest of the Safavid monarchs, [[Shah Abbas I the Great]] (1587\u20131629) came to power in 1587 aged 16. Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing [[Herat]] and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor [[Mohammad Khodabanda]] by the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1578\u20131590)]].

Between 1616\u20131618, following the disobedience of his most loyal [[Georgians|Georgian]] subjects [[Teimuraz I of Kakheti|Teimuraz I]] and [[Luarsab II of Kartli|Luarsab II]], Abbas carried out a punitive campaign in his territories of Georgia, devastating [[Kakheti]] and [[Tbilisi]] and carrying away 130,000<ref>Eskandar Beg, pp. 900\u2013901, tr.

His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of [[Robert Shirley]] and his brothers following the [[Persian embassy to Europe (1599\u20131602)|first diplomatic mission to Europe]], pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans in the abovementioned 1603\u20131618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength. He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from [[Bahrain]] (1602) and [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf.\n\nHe expanded commercial links with the [[Dutch East India Company]] and established firm links with the European royal houses, which had been initiated by Ismail I earlier on by the [[Habsburg\u2013Persian alliance]]. Thus Abbas I was able to break the dependence on the Qizilbash for military might and therefore was able to centralize control.\nThe Safavid dynasty had already established itself during Shah Ismail I, but under Abbas I it really became a major power in the world along with its archrival the Ottoman Empire, against whom it became able to compete with on equal foot. It also started the promotion of tourism in Iran. Under their rule Persian Architecture flourished again and saw many new monuments in various Iranian cities, of which [[Isfahan]] is the most notable example.\n\nExcept for Shah [[Abbas the Great]], Shah [[Ismail I]], Shah [[Tahmasp I]], and Shah [[Abbas II of Persia|Abbas II]], many of the Safavid rulers were ineffectual, often being more interested in their women, alcohol and other leisure activities. The end of Abbas II's reign in 1666, marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. Despite falling revenues and military threats, many of the later shahs had lavish lifestyles. Shah Soltan Hosain (1694\u20131722) in particular was known for his love of wine and disinterest in governance.<ref>Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.204</ref>\n\nThe declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] chieftain named [[Mirwais Hotak|Mir Wais Khan]] began a rebellion in [[Kandahar]] and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, [[Gurgin Khan]]. In 1722, [[Peter the Great]] of neighbouring [[Imperial Russia]] launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722\u20131723)]], capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including [[Derbent]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Baku]], but also [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]] and [[Astrabad]].

The Shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a [[constitutional monarchy]]). The first [[Majlis]] (parliament) was convened on October 7, 1906.\n\nThe discovery of [[petroleum]] in 1908 by the British in [[Kh\u016bzest\u0101n Province|Khuzestan]] spawned intense renewed interest in Persia by the [[British Empire]] (see [[William Knox D'Arcy]] and [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], now [[BP]]). Control of Persia remained contested between the United Kingdom and Russia, in what became known as [[The Great Game]], and codified in the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]], which divided Persia into spheres of influence, regardless of her national sovereignty.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the country was occupied by British, Ottoman and Russian forces but was essentially neutral (see [[Persian Campaign]]). In 1919, after the [[Russian revolution]] and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a [[protectorate]] in Persia, which was unsuccessful.\n\nFinally, the [[Constitutionalist movement of Gilan]] and the central power vacuum caused by the instability of the Qajar government resulted in the rise of Reza Khan, who was later to become [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], and the subsequent establishment of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] in 1925.  In 1921, a military [[1921 Persian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] established Reza Khan, an officer of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], as the dominant figure for the next 20 years. [[Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabai]] was also a leader and important figure in the perpetration of the coup. The coup was not actually directed at the Qajar monarchy; according to ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'', it was targeted at officials who were in power and actually had a role in controlling the government; the cabinet and others who had a role in governing Persia.<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/coup-detat-of-1299-1921 \"COUP D\u2019ETAT OF 1299/1921\"].

It rejected British and Russian demands to expel the Germans. In response the Allies invaded in August 1941, and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in ''[[Operation Countenance]]''.  Iran became the major conduit of Allied Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian [[oil field]]s and ensure Allied [[supply line]]s (see ''[[Persian Corridor]]'') .

The new, young Shah [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]] initially took a very hands-off role in government, and allowed [[parliament]] to hold a lot of power. Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw the rise and fall of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the [[Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949]], which finally formed the [[Senate of Iran]]\u2014a legislative [[upper house]] allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended.\n\nIn 1951 Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] received the vote required from the parliament to [[nationalize]] the British-owned oil industry, in a situation known as the [[Abadan Crisis]]. Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, the nationalization continued. Mosaddeq was briefly removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier and he, in turn, forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri.\n\n====1953: U.S. organized coup removes Mosaddeq====\n{{main|1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nShortly thereafter on August 19 a successful coup was headed by retired army general [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], organized by the United States (CIA)<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=CIA documents acknowledge its role in Iran's 1953 coup|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23762970|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref> with the active support of the British (MI6) (known as [[Operation Ajax]] and Operation Boot to the respective agencies).<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|year=2013}}</ref> The coup\u2014with a [[black propaganda]] campaign designed to turn the population against Mosaddeq <ref>G\u00f6lz, [https://www.academia.edu/40997855/G%C3%B6lz_The_Dangerous_Classes_and_the_1953_Coup_in_Iran_On_the_Decline_of_lutigari_Masculinities._In_Crime_Poverty_and_Survival_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa_The_Dangerous_Classes_since_1800._Edited_by_Stephanie_Cronin_177_90._London_I.B._Tauris_2019 \"The Dangerous Classes and the 1953 Coup in Iran.

[[Fazlollah Zahedi|Zahedi]] succeeded him as prime minister, and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] and Communist [[Tudeh Party]].\n\n[[File:Shah.ogv|thumb|1971 film about Iran under the Shah]]\nIran was ruled as an autocracy under the shah with American support from that time until the revolution. The Iranian government entered into agreement with an international consortium of foreign companies which ran the Iranian oil facilities for the next 25 years splitting profits fifty-fifty with Iran but not allowing Iran to audit their accounts or have members on their board of directors.  In 1957 martial law was ended after 16 years and Iran became closer to the West, joining the [[Baghdad Pact]] and receiving military and economic aid from the US. In 1961, Iran initiated a series of economic, social, agrarian and administrative reforms to modernize the country that became known as the Shah's White Revolution.\n\nThe core of this program was land reform. Modernization and economic growth proceeded at an unprecedented rate, fueled by Iran's vast petroleum reserves, the third-largest in the world.  However the reforms, including the [[White Revolution]], did not greatly improve economic conditions and the liberal pro-Western policies alienated certain [[Islam]]ic religious and political groups. In early June 1963 [[Movement of 15 Khordad|several days of massive rioting]] occurred in support of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] following the cleric's arrest for a speech attacking the shah.\n\nTwo years later, premier [[Hassan Ali Mansur]] was assassinated and the internal security service, [[SAVAK]], became more violently active.  In the 1970s leftist [[Guerrilla groups of Iran|guerilla groups]] such as [[Mujaheddin-e-Khalq]] (MEK), emerged and attacked regime and foreign targets.\n\nNearly a hundred Iran political prisoners were killed by the SAVAK during the decade before the revolution and many more were arrested and tortured.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' (1999), pp. 135\u20136, 167, 169</ref> The Islamic clergy, headed by the Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] (who had been exiled in 1964), were becoming increasingly vociferous.\n\nIran greatly increased its defense budget and by the early 1970s was the region's strongest military power. Bilateral relations with its neighbor [[Iraq]] were not good, mainly due to a dispute over the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway.  In November 1971, Iranian forces seized control of three islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf; in response, Iraq expelled thousands of Iranian nationals. Following a number of clashes in April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 accord and demanded a renegotiation.\n\nIn mid-1973, the Shah returned the oil industry to national control. Following the [[Yom Kippur War|Arab-Israeli War of October 1973]], Iran did not join the Arab oil embargo against the West and [[Israel]]. Instead, it used the situation to raise oil prices, using the money gained for modernization and to increase defense spending.\n\nA border dispute between Iraq and Iran was resolved with the signing of the [[Algiers Agreement (1975)|Algiers Accord]] on March 6, 1975.\n\n==Revolution and the Islamic Republic (1979\u2013present)==\n{{Main|Iranian Revolution|History of the Islamic Republic of Iran}}\n[[File:Imam Khomeini in Mehrabad.jpg|thumb|Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] returns to Iran after 14 years exile in France on 1 February 1979.]]\n\nThe '''Iranian Revolution''', also known as the '''Islamic Revolution''',<ref name = \"Chamber\">[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/islamic_revolution/islamic_revolution.php Islamic Revolution], Iran Chamber.</ref> was the [[revolution]] that transformed Iran from an absolute [[Pahlavi dynasty|monarchy]] under [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], to an [[Islamic republic]] under Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], one of the leaders of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic.<ref name = \"Britannica\"/> Its time span can be said to have begun in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations,<ref>[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch29ir.html The Iranian Revolution].</ref> and concluded with the approval of the new [[theocratic]] Constitution\u2014whereby Ayatollah Khomeini became [[Supreme Leader]] of the country\u2014in December 1979.<ref name=\"Britannica Khomeini\">[http://www.britanniaca.com/eb/article-9045329 Ruhollah Khomeini] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008024623/http://www.britanniaca.com/eb/article-9045329 |date=2007-10-08 }}, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref>\n\nIn between, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] left the country for exile in January 1979 after strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country, and on February 1, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran.<ref name=\"Britannica Khomeini\"/> The final collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty occurred shortly after on February 11 when Iran's military declared itself \"neutral\" after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting.

Following the events of the revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising [[1979 Khuzestan uprising|Khuzistan]], [[1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|Kurdistan]] and [[Gonbad-e Qabus (city)|Gonbad-e Qabus]], which resulted in severe fighting between rebels and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region. The [[1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|Kurdish uprising]], led by the KDPI, was the most violent, lasting until 1983 and resulting in 10,000 casualties.\n\nIn the summer of 1979 a new constitution giving Khomeini a powerful post as guardian jurist [[Supreme Leader]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-8.html |title=Iranian Government Constitution, English Text |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123063337/http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-8.html |archivedate=2010-11-23 }}</ref> and a clerical [[Council of Guardians]] power over legislation and elections, was drawn up by an [[Assembly of Experts for Constitution]].

The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, Hussein had ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East, and sought to expand Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule.\n\nOf chief importance to Iraq was [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] which not only boasted a substantial Arab population, but rich oil fields as well. On the unilateral behalf of the [[United Arab Emirates]], the islands of [[Abu Musa]] and the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] became objectives as well. With these ambitions in mind, Hussein planned a full-scale assault on Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days. On September 22, 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The attack took revolutionary Iran completely by surprise.\n\nAlthough Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, Iranian forces had pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to [[export of revolution|export his Islamic revolution]] westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi'a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, \"drank the cup of poison\" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations.\n\nTens of thousands of Iranian [[civilians]] and [[military]] personnel were killed when Iraq used [[chemical weapons]] in its warfare.

He sought to restore confidence in the government among the general population by privatizing the companies that had been nationalized in the first few years of the Islamic Republic, as well as by bringing in qualified technocrats to manage the economy. The state of their economy also influenced the government to move towards ending their diplomatic isolation. This was achieved through the reestablishment of normalized relations with neighbors such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and an attempt to improve its reputation in the region with assertions that its revolution was not exportable to other states.<ref>''Treacherous Alliance : the secret dealings of Israel, Iran and the United States'' by Trita Pasri, Yale University Press, 2007, p.145</ref>  During the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991 the country remained [[neutral country|neutral]], restricting its action to the condemnation of the U.S. and allowing fleeing Iraqi aircraft and refugees into the country.\n\nIran in the 1990s had a greater secular behavior and admiration for Western popular culture than in the previous decades, it had become a way in which the urban population expressed their resentment at the invasive Islamic policies of the government.<ref name=\"Westview Press\">{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=William L.|title=A History of the Modern Middle East|date=2016|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=9780813349800}}</ref> The pressures from the population placed on the new Supreme Leader, Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] led to an uneasy alliance between him and President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]]. Through this alliance they attempted to hinder the [[ulama]]'s ability to gain further control of the state. In 1989, they created a sequence of constitutional amendments that removed the office of prime minister and increased the scope of presidential power. However, these new amendments did not curtail the powers of the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] in any way; this position still contained the ultimate authority over the armed forces, the making of war and peace, the final say in foreign policy, and the right to intervene in the legislative process whenever he deemed it necessary.<ref name=\"Westview Press\"/>\n\n====Reforms and consequences (1997\u20132005)====\n[[File:Mohammad Khatami.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mohammad Khatami]], [[Mohammad Khatami's reforms|reformist]] President of Iran from 1997 to 2005]]\n\nPresident Rafsanjani's economic policies that led to greater relations with the outside world and his government's relaxation on the enforcement certain regulations on social behavior were met with some responses of widespread disenchantment among the general population with the ulama as rulers of the country.<ref name=\"Westview Press\"/> This led to the defeat of the government's candidate for president in 1997, who had the backing of the supreme Islamic jurist. He was beaten by an independent candidate from the [[Iranian Reformists|reformist]],  [[Mohammad Khatami]]. He received 69% of the vote and enjoyed particular support from two groups of the population that had felt ostracized by the practices of the state: women and youth. The younger generations in the country had been too young to experience the shah's regime or the revolution that ended it, and now they resented the restrictions placed on their daily lives under the Islamic Republic.  Mohammad Khatami's presidency was soon marked by tensions between the [[Mohammad Khatami's reforms|reform-minded government]] and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy. This rift reached a climax in July 1999 when massive anti-government protests erupted in the streets of [[Tehran]]. The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds.\n\nKhatami was re-elected in June 2001 but his efforts were repeatedly blocked by the conservatives in the parliament. Conservative elements within Iran's government moved to undermine the reformist movement, banning liberal newspapers and disqualifying candidates for parliamentary elections. This clampdown on dissent, combined with the failure of Khatami to reform the government, led to growing political apathy among Iran's youth.\n\nIn June 2003, anti-government protests by several thousand students took place in Tehran.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2980102.stm|title=Iranians protest against clerics|date=11 June 2003|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>[http://iranvajahan.net/german/uprising.html Uprising in Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503222730/http://iranvajahan.net/german/uprising.html |date=2006-05-03 }}</ref> Several [[human right]]s protests also occurred in 2006.\n\n==== 2005 presidential election and consequences (2005\u20132009) ====\nIn [[2005 Iranian presidential election]], [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], mayor of Tehran, became the sixth president of Iran, after winning 62 percent of the vote in the [[runoff election|run-off poll]], against former president Ali-[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4740441.stm\n| title = Iran hardliner becomes president\n| accessdate = 2006-12-06\n| date = August 3, 2005\n| publisher = [[BBC]]\n}}\n</ref> During the authorization ceremony he kissed Khamenei's hand in demonstration of his loyalty to him.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.iranvajahan.net/cgi-bin/news.pl?l=en&y=2006&m=09&d=09&a=1 \n |title=Behind Ahmadinejad, a Powerful Cleric \n |accessdate=2006-12-06 \n |date=September 9, 2006 \n |work=[[The New York Times]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102205142/http://www.iranvajahan.net/cgi-bin/news.pl?l=en&y=2006&m=09&d=09&a=1 \n |archivedate=November 2, 2006 \n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tofoiran.packdeal.com/clips/DrIman/20060906-DrIman-CNN-225.asx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715032350/http://tofoiran.packdeal.com/clips/DrIman/20060906-DrIman-CNN-225.asx |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the American invasion of [[Iraq]], overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime and empowerment of its [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] majority, all strengthened Iran's position in the region particularly in the mainly Shi'a south of Iraq, where a top Shia leader in the week of September 3, 2006 renewed demands for an autonomous Shi'a region.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D890900D-A483-4C19-86C8-41F35135090D.htm |archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100418234826/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D890900D-A483-4C19-86C8-41F35135090D.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 18, 2010 |title=Iraq prime minister to visit Iran |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=September 9, 2006 }}</ref> At least one commentator (Former U.S. Defense Secretary [[William S.

However, after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw thus losing control of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Ionia]]. Fighting continued for several decades after the successful Greek repelling of the Second Invasion with numerous Greek city states under the latters' newly formed [[Delian League]], which eventually ended with the peace of Callias in 449 BC, ending the Greco-Persian Wars. In 404 BC, following the death of [[Darius II]], Egypt rebelled under [[Amyrtaeus]]. Later [[pharaoh]]s successfully resisted Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt until 343 BC, when Egypt was reconquered by [[Artaxerxes III]].\n\n[[File:Pers\u00e9polis, Ir\u00e1n, 2016-09-24, DD 64-68 PAN.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>A panoramic view of [[Persepolis]].</center>]]\n\n===Greek conquest and Seleucid Empire (312 BCE\u2013248 BCE)===\n{{Main|Seleucid Empire}}\n[[File:Seleucid-Empire 200bc.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Seleucid Empire]] in 200 BC, before Antiochus was defeated by the Romans]]\n\nFrom 334 BCE to 331 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]], also known in Avestan as [[Book of Arda Viraf|''Arda Wiraz N\u00e2mag'']]  (\"the accursed Alexander\"), defeated  [[Darius III]] in the battles of [[Battle of the Granicus|Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], swiftly conquering the Persian Empire by 331 BCE. Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death, and Alexander's general, [[Seleucus I Nicator]], tried to take control of Iran, [[Mesopotamia]], and later [[Syria]] and [[Anatolia]]. His empire was the [[Seleucid Empire]]. He was killed in 281 BCE by [[Ptolemy Keraunos]].\n\nGreek language, philosophy, and art came with the colonists.

The Parthian Empire quickly included [[Eastern Arabia]].\n\n[[File:BagdatesI290-280BCEPersia.jpg|thumb|[[Bagadates I]], first native Persian ruler after Greek rule]]\n\nParthia was the eastern arch-enemy of the [[Roman Empire]] and it limited Rome's expansion beyond [[Cappadocia]] (central [[Anatolia]]). The Parthian armies included two types of [[cavalry]]: the heavily armed and armoured [[cataphract]]s and the lightly-armed but highly-mobile [[mounted archery|mounted archers]].\n\nFor the Romans, who relied on heavy [[infantry]], the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. The [[Parthian shot]] used by the Parthian cavalry was most notably feared by the Roman soldiers, which proved pivotal in the crushing Roman defeat at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in [[siege]] warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able completely to [[annexation|annex]] each other's territory.\n\nThe Parthian empire subsisted for five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires. The end of this empire came at last in 224 AD, when the empire's organization had loosened and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassal peoples, the Persians under the Sasanians. However, the Arsacid dynasty continued to exist for centuries onwards in [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Armenia]], the [[Arsacid dynasty of Iberia|Iberia]], and the [[Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania|Caucasian Albania]], which were all eponymous branches of the dynasty.\n\n===Sasanian Empire (224\u2013651 AD)===\n{{Main|Sasanian Empire}}\n{{see also|Roman\u2013Iranian relations|Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars|Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628}}\n[[File:Naqsh i Rustam.

Started in the first century BC by their predecessors, the Parthians and Romans, the last Roman\u2013Persian War was fought in the seventh century. The Persians defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of Edessa]] in 260 and took emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] prisoner for the remainder of his life.\n\nEastern Arabia was conquered early on. During [[Khosrow II]]'s rule in 590\u2013628, [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Lebanon]] were also annexed to the Empire. The Sassanians called their empire ''Er\u00e2nshahr'' (\"Dominion of the Aryans\", i.e., of [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]]).<ref>Garthwaite, Gene R., ''The Persians'', p. 2</ref>\n\nA chapter of Iran's history followed after roughly six hundred years of conflict with the Roman Empire. During this time, the Sassanian and Romano-Byzantine armies clashed for influence in [[Anatolia]], the western [[Caucasus]] (mainly [[Lazica]] and the [[Kingdom of Iberia]]; modern-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Abkhazia]]), [[Mesopotamia]], Armenia and the Levant. Under Justinian I, the war came to an uneasy peace with payment of tribute to the Sassanians.\n\nHowever, the Sasanians used the deposition of the Byzantine emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] as a ''casus belli'' to attack the Empire. After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople, and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace. With the conclusion of the over 700 years lasting Roman\u2013Persian Wars through the climactic [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], which included the very [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]], the war-exhausted Persians lost the [[Battle of al-Q\u0101disiyyah]] (632) in [[Hilla]] (present day [[Iraq]]) to the invading Muslim forces.\n\nThe Sasanian era, encompassing the length of [[Late Antiquity]], is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran, and had a major impact on the world. In many ways the Sassanian period witnessed the highest achievement of Persian civilization, and constitutes the last great Iranian Empire before the adoption of Islam.

Several Iranian nobles and families such as king Dinar of the [[House of Karen]], and later [[Kanarang]]iyans of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], mutinied against their Sasanian overlords. Although the [[House of Mihran]] had claimed the Sasanian throne under the two prominent generals [[Bahr\u0101m Ch\u014dbin]] and [[Shahrbaraz]], it remained loyal to the Sasanians during their struggle against the Arabs, but the Mihrans were eventually betrayed and defeated by their own kinsmen, the [[House of Ispahbudhan]], under their leader [[Farrukhzad]], who had mutinied against Yazdegerd III.\n\nYazdegerd III, fled from one district to another until a local miller killed him for his purse at [[Merv]] in 651.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&fullArticle=true&tocId=9106324 | title=Iran | encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref> By 674, Muslims had conquered [[Greater Khorasan]] (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan and parts of [[Transoxiana]]).\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] ended the Sasanian Empire and led to the eventual decline of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion in Persia. Over time, the majority of Iranians converted to Islam. Most of the aspects of the previous Persian civilizations were not discarded, but were absorbed by the new [[Islam]]ic polity. As [[Bernard Lewis]] has commented:\n{{quote|These events have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders.

During this era, Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of ''mawali''.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shias had failed to quell unrest among these minorities.\n\nHowever, all of Iran was still not under Arab control, and the region of [[Daylam]] was under the control of the [[Daylamites]], while [[Tabaristan]] was under [[Dabuyid dynasty|Dabuyid]] and [[Paduspanids|Paduspanid]] control, and the [[Mount Damavand]] region under [[Masmughans of Damavand]]. The Arabs had invaded these regions several times, but achieved no decisive result because of the inaccessible terrain of the regions. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, known as [[Farrukhan the Great]] (r. 712\u2013728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], who was defeated by a combined Dailamite-Dabuyid army, and was forced to retreat from Tabaristan.<ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 312\u2013313</ref>\n\nWith the death of the Umayyad Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] in 743, the Islamic world was launched into civil war. [[Abu Muslim]] was sent to Khorasan by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] initially as a propagandist and then to revolt on their behalf. He took [[Merv]] defeating the Umayyad governor there [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]]. He became the [[de facto]] Abbasid governor of Khurasan. During the same period, the Dabuyid ruler [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]] declared independence from the Umayyads, but was shortly forced to recognize Abbasid authority. In 750, Abu Muslim became leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at the [[Battle of the Zab]].

The Khorramdin rebellion of Babak spread to the Western and Central parts of [[Iran]] and lasted more than twenty years before it was defeated when Babak was betrayed by [[Afshin (Caliphate General)|Afshin]], a senior general of the Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nAs the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power. Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the [[Tahirids]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (821\u2013873); the [[Saffarids]] in [[Sistan]] (861\u20131003, their rule lasted as maliks of Sistan until 1537); and the [[Samanids]] (819\u20131005), originally at [[Bukhara]]. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan.<ref name=\"Islamic Conquest\"/>\n\nBy the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the [[Buyid dynasty]] (934\u20131062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Turks, who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids, while publicly pledging allegiance to them. The balance of power in Baghdad remained as such \u2013 with the Abbasids in power in name only \u2013 until the Mongol invasion of 1258 sacked the city and definitively ended the Abbasid dynasty.<ref name=\"AHGC\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Abbassid]] period an enfranchisement was experienced by the ''mawali'' and a shift was made in political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire<ref name=\"Tobin\">Tobin 113\u2013115</ref> and c. 930 a requirement was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire be Muslim.<ref name=\"Astren\" />{{clear}}\n\n====Islamic golden age, Shu'ubiyya movement and Persianization process====\n{{See also|Islamization of Iran|Islamic Golden Age|Shu'ubiyya}}\n[[File:Ghotb2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Extract from a medieval manuscript by [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi|Qotbeddin Shirazi]] (1236\u20131311), a Persian astronomer, depicting an epicyclic planetary model]]\n\n[[Islamization]] was a long process by which [[Islam]] was gradually adopted by the majority population of Iran. [[Richard Bulliet]]'s \"conversion curve\" indicates that only about 10% of Iran converted to Islam during the relatively Arab-centric [[Umayyad]] period. Beginning in the [[Abassid]] period, with its mix of Persian as well as Arab rulers, the Muslim percentage of the population rose. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule of the country, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.<ref>Nasr, Hoseyn; Islam and the pliqht of modern man</ref>\n\nAlthough Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as [[Persianization]].

Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to [[Egyptians]], [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Aramaeans]] are attested.<ref>Enderwitz, S. \"Shu'ubiyya\". ''Encyclopedia of Islam''. Vol. IX (1997), pp. 513\u201314.</ref> Citing as its basis Islamic notions of equality of races and nations, the movement was primarily concerned with preserving [[Persia]]n culture and protecting Persian identity, though within a Muslim context.\n\nThe [[Samanid dynasty]] led the revival of Persian culture and the first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, [[Rudaki]], was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals.  Their successor, the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznawids]], who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/samanids/samanids.php|title=History of Iran: Samanid Dynasty|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A treatise on chess 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Persian manuscript describing how an ambassador from India brought [[Shatranj|chess]] to the Persian court]]\n\nThe culmination of the [[Persianization]] movement was the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the national epic of Iran, written almost entirely in Persian. This voluminous work,  reflects Iran's ancient history, its unique cultural values, its pre-Islamic [[Zoroastrian]] religion, and its sense of nationhood. According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:<ref name=\"lewis\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\"Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna...\"</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Islamization of Iran]] was to yield deep transformations within the cultural, scientific, and political structure of Iran's society: The blossoming of [[Persian literature]], [[Iranian philosophy|philosophy]], [[Science and technology in Iran|medicine]] and [[Persian art|art]] became major elements of the newly forming Muslim civilization.

He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path. In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East. Under Tughril Beg's successor, [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]] (1072\u20131092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, [[Nizam al Mulk]]. These leaders established the observatory where [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]] did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built [[Nizamiyya|religious schools]] in all the major towns. They brought [[Abu Hamid Ghazali]], one of the greatest Islamic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the Seljuq capital at Baghdad and encouraged and supported their work.<ref name=\"Islamic Conquest\"/>\n\nWhen Malik Shah I died in 1092, the empire split as his brother and four sons quarrelled over the apportioning of the empire among themselves. In Anatolia, Malik Shah I was succeeded by [[Kilij Arslan I]] who founded the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] and in [[Syria]] by his brother [[Tutush I]]. In [[Persia]] he was succeeded by his son [[Mahmud I of Great Seljuq|Mahmud I]] whose reign was contested by his other three brothers [[Barkiyaruq]] in [[Iraq]], [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]] in [[Baghdad]] and [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. As Seljuq power in Iran weakened, other dynasties began to step up in its place, including a resurgent Abbasid caliphate and the [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmshahs]]. The Khwarezmid Empire was a Sunni Muslim Persianate dynasty, of East Turkic origin, that ruled in Central Asia. Originally vassals of the Seljuqs, they took advantage of the decline of the Seljuqs to expand into Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9045365|title=Academic Home|publisher=}}</ref> In 1194 the Khwarezmshah [[Ala ad-Din Tekish]] defeated the Seljuq sultan [[Toghrul III of Seljuq|Toghrul III]] in battle and the Seljuq empire in Iran collapsed.

At that time, the Khwarezmid Empire was ruled by [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]] (1200\u20131220). Muhammad, like Genghis, was intent on expanding his lands and had gained the submission of most of Iran. He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the Abbasid caliph [[Al-Nasir]].

Genghis' grandson, [[Hulagu Khan]], was tasked with the westward expansion of Mongol dominion. However, by time he ascended to power, the Mongol Empire had already dissolved, dividing into different factions. Arriving with an army, he established himself in the region and founded the [[Ilkhanate]], a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, which would rule Iran for the next eighty years and become Persianate in the process.\n\nHulagu Khan seized Baghdad in 1258 and put the last Abbasid caliph to death. The westward advance of his forces was stopped by the [[Bahri dynasty|Mamelukes]], however, at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1260. Hulagu's campaigns against the Muslims also enraged [[Berke]], khan of the [[Golden Horde]] and a convert to Islam. Hulagu and Berke fought against each other, demonstrating the weakening unity of the Mongol empire.\n\nThe rule of Hulagu's great-grandson, [[Ghazan]] (1295\u20131304) saw the establishment of Islam as the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Ghazan and his famous Iranian vizier, [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]], brought Iran a partial and brief economic revival. The Mongols lowered taxes for artisans, encouraged agriculture, rebuilt and extended irrigation works, and improved the safety of the trade routes. As a result, commerce increased dramatically.\n\nItems from India, China, and Iran passed easily across the Asian steppes, and these contacts culturally enriched Iran. For example, Iranians developed a new style of painting based on a unique fusion of solid, two-dimensional Mesopotamian painting with the feathery, light brush strokes and other motifs characteristic of China. After Ghazan's nephew [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Said]] died in 1335, however, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties \u2013 most prominently the [[Jalayirids]], [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Sarbadars]] and [[Kartids]].\n\nThe mid-14th-century [[Black Death]] killed about 30% of the country's population.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/interrogatory/kelly200509140843.asp Q&A with John Kelly on The Great Mortality on National Review Online].</ref>\n\n==== Sunnism and Shiism in pre-Safavid Iran ====\n{{Main|Islam in Iran}}\n[[File:Imam reza shrine in Mashhad.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Imam Reza shrine]], the tomb of the eighth Imam of the twelver Shiites]]\n\nPrior to the rise of the Safavid Empire, Sunni Islam was the dominant religion, accounting for around 90% of the population at the time.

The writers of [[The Four Books]] of Shia were Iranian, as well as many other great Shia scholars.\n\nThe domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterized the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zayd\u012bs]] of [[Tabaristan]] (see [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran]]), the [[Buyids]], the [[Kakuyids]], the rule of [[\u00d6ljeit\u00fc|Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah]] (r.

During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from [[Kufa]]h, [[Baghdad]] and later from [[Najaf]] and [[Hillah]].<ref name=\"al-islam.org\"/> Shiism was the dominant sect in [[Tabaristan]], [[Qom]], [[Kashan]], [[Avaj]] and [[Sabzevar]]. In many other areas merged population of Shia and Sunni lived together.\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries,  [[Fatimids]] sent [[Ismailis]] [[Dawah|Da'i (missioners)]] to Iran as well as other Muslim lands. When Ismailis divided into two sects, [[Nizari]]s established their base in Iran. [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] conquered fortresses and captured  [[Alamut]] in 1090 AD. Nizaris used this fortress until a Mongol raid in 1256.\n\nAfter the Mongol raid and fall of the Abbasids, Sunni hierarchies faltered. Not only did they lose the caliphate but also the status of official [[madhhab]]. Their loss was the gain of Shia, whose center wasn't in Iran at that time. Several local Shia dynasties like [[Sarbadars]] were established during this time.\n\nThe main change occurred in the beginning of the 16th century, when [[Ismail I]] founded the [[Safavid dynasty]] and initiated a religious policy to [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|recognize Shi'a Islam as the official religion]] of the [[Safavid Empire]], and the fact that modern Iran remains an officially Shi'ite state is a direct result of Ismail's actions.\n\n=== Timurid Empire (1370\u20131507) ===\n[[File:Timurid Dynasty 821 - 873 (AH).png|thumb|250px|A map of the [[Timurid Empire]].]]\n{{Main|Timurid Empire}}\nIran remained divided until the arrival of [[Timur]], an Iranified [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]]<ref>Peter B.

A year after his victory in Tabriz, Ism\u0101il proclaimed most of Persia as his domain, and<ref name=\"savoryeiref\" /> quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule. Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], parts of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Mesopotamia]] (Iraq), [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]], [[Dagestan]], large parts of what is now [[Afghanistan]], parts of [[Turkmenistan]], and large chunks of [[Anatolia]], laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the [[Caucasus]] and its [[Peoples of the Caucasus|peoples]]).\n\n[[File:ShahAbbasPortraitFromItalianPainter.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Shah Abbas I]]\n\n[[Tahmasp I]], the son and successor of [[Ismail I]], carried out multiple invasions in the [[Caucasus]] which had been incorporated in the [[Safavid empire]] since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving hundreds of thousands of [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], and [[Armenians]] to Iran's heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the [[Qizilbash]], by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society. As ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'' states, for Tahmasp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qizilbash, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tahmasp-i|title=\u1e6cAHM\u0100SP I|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the indisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the ''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazis]]'' of the neighboring [[Ottoman Empire]]) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]].\n\nShah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] and his successors would significantly expand this policy and plan initiated by Tahmasp, deporting during his reign alone around some 200,000 [[Georgians]], 300,000 [[Armenians]] and 100,000\u2013150,000 [[Circassians]] to Iran, completing the foundation of a new layer in Iranian society. With this, and the complete systematic disorganisation of the Qizilbash by his personal orders, he eventually fully succeeded in replacing the power of the Qizilbash, with that of the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] ghulams. These new Caucasian elements (the so-called ''[[ghilman]]'' / \u063a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646 / ''\"servants\"''), almost always after conversion to [[Shia Islam|Shi'ism]] depending on given function would be, were unlike the Qizilbash, fully loyal only to the Shah. The other masses of Caucasians were deployed in all other possible functions and positions available in the empire, as well as in the [[harem]], regular military, craftsmen, farmers, etc. This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the [[Qajar Dynasty]].\n\n[[File:\u10e0\u10dd\u10e1\u10e2\u10dd\u10db \u10ee\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8.gif|thumb|left|upright|[[Rostom of Kartli|Rostom]] (also known as ''Rustam Khan''), viceroy of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]], eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], from 1633\u20131658]]\n\nThe greatest of the Safavid monarchs, [[Shah Abbas I the Great]] (1587\u20131629) came to power in 1587 aged 16. Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing [[Herat]] and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor [[Mohammad Khodabanda]] by the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1578\u20131590)]]. Then he turned against the Ottomans, the archrivals of the Safavids, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq and the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] provinces and beyond [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1603\u20131618)|by 1618]]. Between 1616\u20131618, following the disobedience of his most loyal [[Georgians|Georgian]] subjects [[Teimuraz I of Kakheti|Teimuraz I]] and [[Luarsab II of Kartli|Luarsab II]], Abbas carried out a punitive campaign in his territories of Georgia, devastating [[Kakheti]] and [[Tbilisi]] and carrying away 130,000<ref>Eskandar Beg, pp. 900\u2013901, tr.

His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of [[Robert Shirley]] and his brothers following the [[Persian embassy to Europe (1599\u20131602)|first diplomatic mission to Europe]], pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans in the abovementioned 1603\u20131618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength. He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from [[Bahrain]] (1602) and [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf.\n\nHe expanded commercial links with the [[Dutch East India Company]] and established firm links with the European royal houses, which had been initiated by Ismail I earlier on by the [[Habsburg\u2013Persian alliance]]. Thus Abbas I was able to break the dependence on the Qizilbash for military might and therefore was able to centralize control.\nThe Safavid dynasty had already established itself during Shah Ismail I, but under Abbas I it really became a major power in the world along with its archrival the Ottoman Empire, against whom it became able to compete with on equal foot. It also started the promotion of tourism in Iran. Under their rule Persian Architecture flourished again and saw many new monuments in various Iranian cities, of which [[Isfahan]] is the most notable example.\n\nExcept for Shah [[Abbas the Great]], Shah [[Ismail I]], Shah [[Tahmasp I]], and Shah [[Abbas II of Persia|Abbas II]], many of the Safavid rulers were ineffectual, often being more interested in their women, alcohol and other leisure activities. The end of Abbas II's reign in 1666, marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. Despite falling revenues and military threats, many of the later shahs had lavish lifestyles. Shah Soltan Hosain (1694\u20131722) in particular was known for his love of wine and disinterest in governance.<ref>Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.204</ref>\n\nThe declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] chieftain named [[Mirwais Hotak|Mir Wais Khan]] began a rebellion in [[Kandahar]] and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, [[Gurgin Khan]]. In 1722, [[Peter the Great]] of neighbouring [[Imperial Russia]] launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722\u20131723)]], capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including [[Derbent]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Baku]], but also [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]] and [[Astrabad]]. At the mids of all chaos, in the same year  1722 an Afghan army led by Mir Wais' son [[Mahmud Hotak|Mahmud]] marched across eastern Iran, [[Siege of Isfahan|besieged and took Isfahan]]. Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia.

The Shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a [[constitutional monarchy]]). The first [[Majlis]] (parliament) was convened on October 7, 1906.\n\nThe discovery of [[petroleum]] in 1908 by the British in [[Kh\u016bzest\u0101n Province|Khuzestan]] spawned intense renewed interest in Persia by the [[British Empire]] (see [[William Knox D'Arcy]] and [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], now [[BP]]). Control of Persia remained contested between the United Kingdom and Russia, in what became known as [[The Great Game]], and codified in the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]], which divided Persia into spheres of influence, regardless of her national sovereignty.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the country was occupied by British, Ottoman and Russian forces but was essentially neutral (see [[Persian Campaign]]). In 1919, after the [[Russian revolution]] and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a [[protectorate]] in Persia, which was unsuccessful.\n\nFinally, the [[Constitutionalist movement of Gilan]] and the central power vacuum caused by the instability of the Qajar government resulted in the rise of Reza Khan, who was later to become [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], and the subsequent establishment of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] in 1925.

It rejected British and Russian demands to expel the Germans. In response the Allies invaded in August 1941, and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in ''[[Operation Countenance]]''.  Iran became the major conduit of Allied Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian [[oil field]]s and ensure Allied [[supply line]]s (see ''[[Persian Corridor]]'') .

The new, young Shah [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]] initially took a very hands-off role in government, and allowed [[parliament]] to hold a lot of power. Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw the rise and fall of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the [[Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949]], which finally formed the [[Senate of Iran]]\u2014a legislative [[upper house]] allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended.\n\nIn 1951 Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] received the vote required from the parliament to [[nationalize]] the British-owned oil industry, in a situation known as the [[Abadan Crisis]]. Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, the nationalization continued. Mosaddeq was briefly removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier and he, in turn, forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri.\n\n====1953: U.S. organized coup removes Mosaddeq====\n{{main|1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nShortly thereafter on August 19 a successful coup was headed by retired army general [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], organized by the United States (CIA)<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=CIA documents acknowledge its role in Iran's 1953 coup|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23762970|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref> with the active support of the British (MI6) (known as [[Operation Ajax]] and Operation Boot to the respective agencies).<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|year=2013}}</ref> The coup\u2014with a [[black propaganda]] campaign designed to turn the population against Mosaddeq <ref>G\u00f6lz, [https://www.academia.edu/40997855/G%C3%B6lz_The_Dangerous_Classes_and_the_1953_Coup_in_Iran_On_the_Decline_of_lutigari_Masculinities._In_Crime_Poverty_and_Survival_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa_The_Dangerous_Classes_since_1800._Edited_by_Stephanie_Cronin_177_90._London_I.B._Tauris_2019 \"The Dangerous Classes and the 1953 Coup in Iran.

Found guilty, his sentence reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, [[Hossein Fatemi]], was executed. [[Fazlollah Zahedi|Zahedi]] succeeded him as prime minister, and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] and Communist [[Tudeh Party]].\n\n[[File:Shah.ogv|thumb|1971 film about Iran under the Shah]]\nIran was ruled as an autocracy under the shah with American support from that time until the revolution. The Iranian government entered into agreement with an international consortium of foreign companies which ran the Iranian oil facilities for the next 25 years splitting profits fifty-fifty with Iran but not allowing Iran to audit their accounts or have members on their board of directors.  In 1957 martial law was ended after 16 years and Iran became closer to the West, joining the [[Baghdad Pact]] and receiving military and economic aid from the US. In 1961, Iran initiated a series of economic, social, agrarian and administrative reforms to modernize the country that became known as the Shah's White Revolution.\n\nThe core of this program was land reform. Modernization and economic growth proceeded at an unprecedented rate, fueled by Iran's vast petroleum reserves, the third-largest in the world.  However the reforms, including the [[White Revolution]], did not greatly improve economic conditions and the liberal pro-Western policies alienated certain [[Islam]]ic religious and political groups. In early June 1963 [[Movement of 15 Khordad|several days of massive rioting]] occurred in support of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] following the cleric's arrest for a speech attacking the shah.\n\nTwo years later, premier [[Hassan Ali Mansur]] was assassinated and the internal security service, [[SAVAK]], became more violently active.  In the 1970s leftist [[Guerrilla groups of Iran|guerilla groups]] such as [[Mujaheddin-e-Khalq]] (MEK), emerged and attacked regime and foreign targets.\n\nNearly a hundred Iran political prisoners were killed by the SAVAK during the decade before the revolution and many more were arrested and tortured.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' (1999), pp. 135\u20136, 167, 169</ref> The Islamic clergy, headed by the Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] (who had been exiled in 1964), were becoming increasingly vociferous.\n\nIran greatly increased its defense budget and by the early 1970s was the region's strongest military power. Bilateral relations with its neighbor [[Iraq]] were not good, mainly due to a dispute over the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway.  In November 1971, Iranian forces seized control of three islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf; in response, Iraq expelled thousands of Iranian nationals. Following a number of clashes in April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 accord and demanded a renegotiation.\n\nIn mid-1973, the Shah returned the oil industry to national control. Following the [[Yom Kippur War|Arab-Israeli War of October 1973]], Iran did not join the Arab oil embargo against the West and [[Israel]]. Instead, it used the situation to raise oil prices, using the money gained for modernization and to increase defense spending.\n\nA border dispute between Iraq and Iran was resolved with the signing of the [[Algiers Agreement (1975)|Algiers Accord]] on March 6, 1975.\n\n==Revolution and the Islamic Republic (1979\u2013present)==\n{{Main|Iranian Revolution|History of the Islamic Republic of Iran}}\n[[File:Imam Khomeini in Mehrabad.jpg|thumb|Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] returns to Iran after 14 years exile in France on 1 February 1979.]]\n\nThe '''Iranian Revolution''', also known as the '''Islamic Revolution''',<ref name = \"Chamber\">[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/islamic_revolution/islamic_revolution.php Islamic Revolution], Iran Chamber.</ref> was the [[revolution]] that transformed Iran from an absolute [[Pahlavi dynasty|monarchy]] under [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], to an [[Islamic republic]] under Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], one of the leaders of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic.<ref name = \"Britannica\"/> Its time span can be said to have begun in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations,<ref>[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch29ir.html The Iranian Revolution].</ref> and concluded with the approval of the new [[theocratic]] Constitution\u2014whereby Ayatollah Khomeini became [[Supreme Leader]] of the country\u2014in December 1979.<ref name=\"Britannica Khomeini\">[http://www.britanniaca.com/eb/article-9045329 Ruhollah Khomeini] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008024623/http://www.britanniaca.com/eb/article-9045329 |date=2007-10-08 }}, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref>\n\nIn between, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] left the country for exile in January 1979 after strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country, and on February 1, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran.<ref name=\"Britannica Khomeini\"/> The final collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty occurred shortly after on February 11 when Iran's military declared itself \"neutral\" after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting.

Much industry was [[nationalized]], laws and schools Islamicized, and Western influences banned.\n\nThe Islamic revolution also created great impact around the world. In the non-Muslim world it has changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in the politics and spirituality of Islam,<ref>Shawcross, William, ''The Shah's Last Ride'' (1988), p. 110.</ref> along with \"fear and distrust towards Islam\" and particularly the Islamic Republic and its founder.<ref name=nasr>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.138</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Khomeini (1979-1989)}}Khomeini Takes Power (1979\u20131989)===\nKhomeini served as leader of the revolution or as [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] from 1979 to his death on June 3, 1989. This era was dominated by the consolidation of the revolution into a [[theocracy|theocratic]] republic under Khomeini, and by the costly and bloody [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|war with Iraq]].\n\nThe consolidation lasted until 1982\u20133,<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam and Muslim World'', Thomson Gale, 2004, p.357 (article by Stockdale, Nancy, L.)</ref><ref>Keddie, ''Modern Iran'', (2006), p.241</ref> as Iran coped with the damage to its economy, military, and apparatus of government, and protests and uprisings by secularists, leftists, and more traditional Muslims\u2014formerly ally revolutionaries but now rivals\u2014were effectively suppressed. Many political opponents were executed by the new regimes. Following the events of the revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising [[1979 Khuzestan uprising|Khuzistan]], [[1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|Kurdistan]] and [[Gonbad-e Qabus (city)|Gonbad-e Qabus]], which resulted in severe fighting between rebels and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region. The [[1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|Kurdish uprising]], led by the KDPI, was the most violent, lasting until 1983 and resulting in 10,000 casualties.\n\nIn the summer of 1979 a new constitution giving Khomeini a powerful post as guardian jurist [[Supreme Leader]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-8.html |title=Iranian Government Constitution, English Text |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123063337/http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-8.html |archivedate=2010-11-23 }}</ref> and a clerical [[Council of Guardians]] power over legislation and elections, was drawn up by an [[Assembly of Experts for Constitution]].

It was at this time that Khomeini began referring to America as the \"[[Great Satan]].\" In America, where it was considered a violation of the long-standing principle of international law that [[diplomatic immunity|diplomats]] may be expelled but not held captive, it created a powerful anti-Iranian backlash. Relations between the two countries have remained deeply antagonistic and American [[international sanctions]] have hurt Iran's economy.<ref>[http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm History Of US Sanctions Against Iran], ''Middle East Economic Survey'', 26 August 2002</ref>\n\n==== Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988) ====\n{{Main|Iran\u2013Iraq War}}\n[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|250px|An Iranian soldier with gas mask during the Iran\u2013Iraq War]]\n\nDuring this political and social crisis, [[Iraq]]i leader [[Saddam Hussein]] attempted to take advantage of the disorder of the Revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism with Western governments. The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, Hussein had ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East, and sought to expand Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule.\n\nOf chief importance to Iraq was [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] which not only boasted a substantial Arab population, but rich oil fields as well. On the unilateral behalf of the [[United Arab Emirates]], the islands of [[Abu Musa]] and the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] became objectives as well. With these ambitions in mind, Hussein planned a full-scale assault on Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days. On September 22, 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The attack took revolutionary Iran completely by surprise.\n\nAlthough Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, Iranian forces had pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to [[export of revolution|export his Islamic revolution]] westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi'a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, \"drank the cup of poison\" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations.\n\nTens of thousands of Iranian [[civilians]] and [[military]] personnel were killed when Iraq used [[chemical weapons]] in its warfare. [[International aid to combatants in the Iran\u2013Iraq War|Iraq was financially backed]] by [[Egypt]], the Arab countries of the [[Persian Gulf]], the Soviet Union and the [[Warsaw Pact]] states, the United States (beginning in 1983), France, the United Kingdom, Germany, [[Brazil]], and the [[People's Republic of China]] (which also sold weapons to Iran).\n\nThere were more than 182.000 Kurdish victims<ref name=\"r1\">Centre for Documents of The Imposed War, Tehran.

The younger generations in the country had been too young to experience the shah's regime or the revolution that ended it, and now they resented the restrictions placed on their daily lives under the Islamic Republic.  Mohammad Khatami's presidency was soon marked by tensions between the [[Mohammad Khatami's reforms|reform-minded government]] and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy. This rift reached a climax in July 1999 when massive anti-government protests erupted in the streets of [[Tehran]]. The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds.\n\nKhatami was re-elected in June 2001 but his efforts were repeatedly blocked by the conservatives in the parliament. Conservative elements within Iran's government moved to undermine the reformist movement, banning liberal newspapers and disqualifying candidates for parliamentary elections. This clampdown on dissent, combined with the failure of Khatami to reform the government, led to growing political apathy among Iran's youth.\n\nIn June 2003, anti-government protests by several thousand students took place in Tehran.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2980102.stm|title=Iranians protest against clerics|date=11 June 2003|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>[http://iranvajahan.net/german/uprising.html Uprising in Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503222730/http://iranvajahan.net/german/uprising.html |date=2006-05-03 }}</ref> Several [[human right]]s protests also occurred in 2006.\n\n==== 2005 presidential election and consequences (2005\u20132009) ====\nIn [[2005 Iranian presidential election]], [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], mayor of Tehran, became the sixth president of Iran, after winning 62 percent of the vote in the [[runoff election|run-off poll]], against former president Ali-[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4740441.stm\n| title = Iran hardliner becomes president\n| accessdate = 2006-12-06\n| date = August 3, 2005\n| publisher = [[BBC]]\n}}\n</ref> During the authorization ceremony he kissed Khamenei's hand in demonstration of his loyalty to him.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.iranvajahan.net/cgi-bin/news.pl?l=en&y=2006&m=09&d=09&a=1 \n |title=Behind Ahmadinejad, a Powerful Cleric \n |accessdate=2006-12-06 \n |date=September 9, 2006 \n |work=[[The New York Times]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102205142/http://www.iranvajahan.net/cgi-bin/news.pl?l=en&y=2006&m=09&d=09&a=1 \n |archivedate=November 2, 2006 \n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tofoiran.packdeal.com/clips/DrIman/20060906-DrIman-CNN-225.asx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715032350/http://tofoiran.packdeal.com/clips/DrIman/20060906-DrIman-CNN-225.asx |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the American invasion of [[Iraq]], overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime and empowerment of its [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] majority, all strengthened Iran's position in the region particularly in the mainly Shi'a south of Iraq, where a top Shia leader in the week of September 3, 2006 renewed demands for an autonomous Shi'a region.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D890900D-A483-4C19-86C8-41F35135090D.htm |archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100418234826/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D890900D-A483-4C19-86C8-41F35135090D.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 18, 2010 |title=Iraq prime minister to visit Iran |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=September 9, 2006 }}</ref> At least one commentator (Former U.S. Defense Secretary [[William S.

He has enjoyed the best form of his career since 2013, reaching the last 16 stage of three tournaments, and the semi-finals of the [[2014 China Open (snooker)|2014 China Open]] and the [[European Tour 2015/2016 \u2013 Event 3|2015 Ruhr Open]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===1991 to 1997===\n\nBorn in 1971, Dunn turned professional in 1991. His first six seasons came without any success, and although he improved his ranking each year, he was relegated as the world number 139 in 1997, as the secondary UK Tour was formed to run below the professional main tour.\n\nCompeting on the UK Tour for the 1997/1998 season, Dunn reached the last 16 at Event Three, where he lost 2\u20135 to former world number two [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]]. His performances that season were sufficient for him to regain his professional status at its conclusion.<ref>http://cuetracker.net/Players/Mike-Dunn/1997-1998</ref>\n\n===Since 1998===\n\nIn his first season back on the main tour, Dunn reached the last 32 at the 1999 Welsh Open, where he beat five opponents, including [[Munraj Pal]], [[Ian Brumby]], [[Paul Wykes]] and [[Mark King (snooker player)|Mark King]], before being eliminated 5\u20131 by [[Alain Robidoux]].\n\nBeginning 1999/2000 ranked 134th, Dunn would enter the 2000s within the top 100 professional players; a run to the last 32 at the 2000 Thailand Masters, where [[Matthew Stevens]] beat him 5\u20131, contributed to \u00a313,000 in prize money for that season, and he finished it in 93rd position.\n\nDunn's stock continued to rise steadily the following year, but his only showing in the latter stages of an event came at the 2001 Thailand Masters; there, he recovered from 1\u20133 down to 3\u20133 against [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]], but lost 3\u20135.\n\nAs the world number 72 for the 2001/2002 season, Dunn enjoyed his best form yet at the [[2002 World Snooker Championship|2002 World Championship]], defeating Stephen Croft 10\u20132, [[David McDonnell]] 10\u20138, [[Lee Walker]] 10\u20132, [[Dave Finbow]] 10\u20135 and [[Billy Snaddon]] 10\u20139 - having trailed 1\u20135 - to qualify for the main stages at the [[Crucible Theatre]] for the first time. Drawn against Stevens, he came to trail 1\u20137 and, although he recovered well to 6\u20139, could not prevent a 6\u201310 loss. Nevertheless, the performance earned Dunn \u00a314,500, and he broke into the top 64 as a result.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/snooker-contenders-wait-on-osullivans-shoulder-657796.html The Independent: Contenders wait on O'Sullivan's shoulder] {{dead link|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe next few seasons were anticlimactic, Dunn's best progress being a run to the semi-final of the non-ranking Benson & Hedges Championship, where he lost 3\u20136 to [[Mehmet Husnu]]; however, 2005 heralded a first-ever last-16 finish, at the [[2005 Malta Cup]]. There, he beat [[Leo Fernandez]], [[Michael Judge]], [[Marco Fu]], local wilcard entry Simon Zammit and [[David Gray (snooker player)|David Gray]] - whitewashing the latter 5\u20130 - before losing 3\u20135, again to Stevens.\nHaving begun 2004/2005 ranked 53rd, Dunn finished it 54th - the first time he had ever finished a season in a lower position than at the start.<ref>http://cuetracker.net/Players/Mike-Dunn/Career-Total-Statistics</ref>\n\nAt the [[2006 UK Championship (snooker)|2006 UK Championship]], Dunn defeated [[Jamie Jones (snooker player)|Jamie Jones]], [[Mark Davis (snooker player)|Mark Davis]] and [[James Wattana]] to reach the last 32, but was heavily beaten by the resurgent [[Ken Doherty]], losing 1\u20139 to the Irishman.\n\nDoherty again overcame him at the China Open the following season, this time a 5\u20132 victor; Dunn came within one match of making his second Crucible appearance in 2008, but having led [[Dave Harold]] 4\u20133, went on to lose 4\u201310.\n\n2008/2009 brought a run to the last 16 at the inaugural - and only - [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain Championship]], where he beat [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]] 5\u20134 in the last 32, but lost by the same scoreline in his next match against [[Barry Hawkins]].\n\nAfter several last-64 finishes at the start of season 2010/2011, Dunn briefly entered the top 32 in the rankings in October 2010, but dropped back out within several months; he beat Stevens, [[Alfie Burden]] and [[Stuart Bingham]] in the 2011 Snooker Shoot-out, but lost his quarter-final 'match' 14\u201390 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].\n\nBy 2014, Dunn had endured several years of poor form and was in danger of losing his place on tour at the end of the season. However, at the [[2014 China Open (snooker)|2014 China Open]], he mustered the best performance of his career, beating [[Tom Ford (snooker player)|Tom Ford]], [[Peter Lines]], [[Tian Pengfei]], [[Craig Steadman]] and world number one [[Mark Selby]] to reach the semi-finals. There, he faced the home favourite, [[Ding Junhui]], for a place in the final, but was outclassed, losing 6\u20130. This run earned Dunn \u00a321,000 and was enough to ensure he would begin the 2014/2015 season ranked 58th, keeping his professional status.\n\nThe next season brought only one last-16 finish, at the [[2014 Haining Open]], where he lost 3\u20134 to the eventual finalist, Peter Lines's son [[Oliver Lines|Oliver]], but Dunn's results were sufficient to move him up to 42nd in the end-of-season rankings, his highest position since 2011.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nDunn usually practises in The Hartlepool Snooker Centre.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/juniorcoaching/aimsandobjectives.htm Hartlepool Junior Coaching Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416183441/http://www.freewebs.com/juniorcoaching/aimsandobjectives.htm |date=16 April 2008 }}</ref> He is also involved in promotions work for [[World Snooker]], and was in the presentation party at the final of the 2007 [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]].

He has enjoyed the best form of his career since 2013, reaching the last 16 stage of three tournaments, and the semi-finals of the [[2014 China Open (snooker)|2014 China Open]] and the [[European Tour 2015/2016 \u2013 Event 3|2015 Ruhr Open]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===1991 to 1997===\n\nBorn in 1971, Dunn turned professional in 1991. His first six seasons came without any success, and although he improved his ranking each year, he was relegated as the world number 139 in 1997, as the secondary UK Tour was formed to run below the professional main tour.\n\nCompeting on the UK Tour for the 1997/1998 season, Dunn reached the last 16 at Event Three, where he lost 2\u20135 to former world number two [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]]. His performances that season were sufficient for him to regain his professional status at its conclusion.<ref>http://cuetracker.net/Players/Mike-Dunn/1997-1998</ref>\n\n===Since 1998===\n\nIn his first season back on the main tour, Dunn reached the last 32 at the 1999 Welsh Open, where he beat five opponents, including [[Munraj Pal]], [[Ian Brumby]], [[Paul Wykes]] and [[Mark King (snooker player)|Mark King]], before being eliminated 5\u20131 by [[Alain Robidoux]].\n\nBeginning 1999/2000 ranked 134th, Dunn would enter the 2000s within the top 100 professional players; a run to the last 32 at the 2000 Thailand Masters, where [[Matthew Stevens]] beat him 5\u20131, contributed to \u00a313,000 in prize money for that season, and he finished it in 93rd position.\n\nDunn's stock continued to rise steadily the following year, but his only showing in the latter stages of an event came at the 2001 Thailand Masters; there, he recovered from 1\u20133 down to 3\u20133 against [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]], but lost 3\u20135.\n\nAs the world number 72 for the 2001/2002 season, Dunn enjoyed his best form yet at the [[2002 World Snooker Championship|2002 World Championship]], defeating Stephen Croft 10\u20132, [[David McDonnell]] 10\u20138, [[Lee Walker]] 10\u20132, [[Dave Finbow]] 10\u20135 and [[Billy Snaddon]] 10\u20139 - having trailed 1\u20135 - to qualify for the main stages at the [[Crucible Theatre]] for the first time. Drawn against Stevens, he came to trail 1\u20137 and, although he recovered well to 6\u20139, could not prevent a 6\u201310 loss. Nevertheless, the performance earned Dunn \u00a314,500, and he broke into the top 64 as a result.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/snooker-contenders-wait-on-osullivans-shoulder-657796.html The Independent: Contenders wait on O'Sullivan's shoulder] {{dead link|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe next few seasons were anticlimactic, Dunn's best progress being a run to the semi-final of the non-ranking Benson & Hedges Championship, where he lost 3\u20136 to [[Mehmet Husnu]]; however, 2005 heralded a first-ever last-16 finish, at the [[2005 Malta Cup]]. There, he beat [[Leo Fernandez]], [[Michael Judge]], [[Marco Fu]], local wilcard entry Simon Zammit and [[David Gray (snooker player)|David Gray]] - whitewashing the latter 5\u20130 - before losing 3\u20135, again to Stevens.\nHaving begun 2004/2005 ranked 53rd, Dunn finished it 54th - the first time he had ever finished a season in a lower position than at the start.<ref>http://cuetracker.net/Players/Mike-Dunn/Career-Total-Statistics</ref>\n\nAt the [[2006 UK Championship (snooker)|2006 UK Championship]], Dunn defeated [[Jamie Jones (snooker player)|Jamie Jones]], [[Mark Davis (snooker player)|Mark Davis]] and [[James Wattana]] to reach the last 32, but was heavily beaten by the resurgent [[Ken Doherty]], losing 1\u20139 to the Irishman.\n\nDoherty again overcame him at the China Open the following season, this time a 5\u20132 victor; Dunn came within one match of making his second Crucible appearance in 2008, but having led [[Dave Harold]] 4\u20133, went on to lose 4\u201310.\n\n2008/2009 brought a run to the last 16 at the inaugural - and only - [[2008 Bahrain Championship|Bahrain Championship]], where he beat [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]] 5\u20134 in the last 32, but lost by the same scoreline in his next match against [[Barry Hawkins]].\n\nAfter several last-64 finishes at the start of season 2010/2011, Dunn briefly entered the top 32 in the rankings in October 2010, but dropped back out within several months; he beat Stevens, [[Alfie Burden]] and [[Stuart Bingham]] in the 2011 Snooker Shoot-out, but lost his quarter-final 'match' 14\u201390 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].\n\nBy 2014, Dunn had endured several years of poor form and was in danger of losing his place on tour at the end of the season. However, at the [[2014 China Open (snooker)|2014 China Open]], he mustered the best performance of his career, beating [[Tom Ford (snooker player)|Tom Ford]], [[Peter Lines]], [[Tian Pengfei]], [[Craig Steadman]] and world number one [[Mark Selby]] to reach the semi-finals. There, he faced the home favourite, [[Ding Junhui]], for a place in the final, but was outclassed, losing 6\u20130. This run earned Dunn \u00a321,000 and was enough to ensure he would begin the 2014/2015 season ranked 58th, keeping his professional status.\n\nThe next season brought only one last-16 finish, at the [[2014 Haining Open]], where he lost 3\u20134 to the eventual finalist, Peter Lines's son [[Oliver Lines|Oliver]], but Dunn's results were sufficient to move him up to 42nd in the end-of-season rankings, his highest position since 2011.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nDunn usually practises in The Hartlepool Snooker Centre.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/juniorcoaching/aimsandobjectives.htm Hartlepool Junior Coaching Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416183441/http://www.freewebs.com/juniorcoaching/aimsandobjectives.htm |date=16 April 2008 }}</ref> He is also involved in promotions work for [[World Snooker]], and was in the presentation party at the final of the 2007 [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]].

In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a rate can be misleading, insofar as \"rate\" can then be misinterpreted as a number per unit of time. \"Number\" or \"ratio\" is now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nLatent period is the transition time between contagion event and disease manifestation.  In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction numbers for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis (TB). Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

In order to estimate <math>R_0</math>, assumptions are necessary about the time delay between infection and diagnosis and the time between infection and starting to be infectious.\n\nIn exponential growth, <math>K</math> is related to the [[doubling time]] <math>T_d</math> as\n:<math>K=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_d}</math>.\n\n=== Simple model ===\nIf an individual, after getting infected, infects exactly <math>R_0</math> new individuals after exactly a time <math>\\tau</math> has passed, then the number of exposed (not recovered) individuals over time is\n:<math>n_E(t) = n_E(0)\\, R_0^{t/\\tau}.</math>\nIn this case,\n:<math>R_0 = e^{K \\tau}</math> or <math>K = \\frac{\\ln R_0}{\\tau}</math>.\nFor example, with <math>\\tau=5~\\mathrm{d}</math> and <math>K=0.183~\\mathrm{d}^{-1}</math>, we would find <math>R_0=2.5</math>. \n\n=== Latent infectious period, isolation after diagnosis ===\nIn this model, an individual infection has the following stages:\n\n# Exposed: an individual is infected, but has no symptoms and does not yet infect others.

For example, with the same values <math>\\tau=5~\\mathrm{d}</math> and <math>K=0.183~\\mathrm{d}^{-1}</math>, we would find <math>R_0=1.9</math>, rather than <math>2.5</math>. The difference is due to a subtle difference in the underlying growth model; the matrix equation above assumes that newly infected patients may start transmitting the disease directly after getting infected; the time <math>\\tau_E</math> is the average time. This difference illustrates that an estimated value of the reproduction number <math>R_0</math> is dependent on the underlying mathematical model; if the reproduction number is estimated from a particular model, the same model should be used for predictions about the future.\n\n==Limitations of ''R''<sub>0</sub>==\nWhen calculated from [[mathematical models]], particularly [[ordinary differential equation]]s, what is often claimed to be ''R''<sub>0</sub> is, in fact, simply a threshold, not the average number of secondary infections.

Calling the quantity a rate can be misleading, insofar as \"rate\" can then be misinterpreted as a number per unit of time. \"Number\" or \"ratio\" is now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nLatent period is the transition time between contagion event and disease manifestation.  In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction numbers for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis (TB). Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this difference.

The difference is due to a subtle difference in the underlying growth model; the matrix equation above assumes that newly infected patients may start transmitting the disease directly after getting infected; the time <math>\\tau_E</math> is the average time. This difference illustrates that an estimated value of the reproduction number <math>R_0</math> is dependent on the underlying mathematical model; if the reproduction number is estimated from a particular model, the same model should be used for predictions about the future.\n\n==Limitations of ''R''<sub>0</sub>==\nWhen calculated from [[mathematical models]], particularly [[ordinary differential equation]]s, what is often claimed to be ''R''<sub>0</sub> is, in fact, simply a threshold, not the average number of secondary infections.
