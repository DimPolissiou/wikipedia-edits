Small depressions on the upper jaw each contain a lone stiff hair, but are only visible on close inspection. Its head's ventral surface lacks the numerous prominent furrows of the related rorquals, instead bearing two to five shallow furrows on the throat's underside. The gray whale also lacks a [[dorsal fin]], instead bearing 6 to 12 dorsal crenulations (\"knuckles\"), which are raised bumps on the midline of its rear quarter, leading to the [[fluke (tail)|fluke]]s. This is known as the [[dorsal ridge]]. The tail itself is {{convert|3|-|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} across and deeply notched at the center while its edges taper to a point.\n\n===Pacific groups===\nThe two populations of Pacific gray whales (east and west) are morphologically and phylogenically different. Other than DNA structures, differences in proportions of several body parts and body colors including skeletal features, and length ratios of flippers and baleen plates have been confirmed between Eastern and Western populations, and some claims that the original eastern and western groups could have been much more distinct than previously thought, enough to be counted as subspecies.<ref name=SC65bBRG12 /><ref name=GrayJapan>{{Cite journal|author1=Nakamura G.|author2=Kato H.|title=\u65e5\u672c\u6cbf\u5cb8\u57df\u306b\u8fd1\u5e74\uff081990\u20132005 \u5e74\uff09\u51fa\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30af\u30af\u30b8\u30e9Eschrichtius robustus \u306e\u9aa8\u5b66\u7684\u7279\u5fb4\uff0c\u7279\u306b\u982d\u9aa8\u5f62\u72b6\u304b\u3089\u898b\u305f\u5317\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u897f\u90e8\u7cfb\u7fa4\u3068\u6771\u90e8\u7cfb\u7fa4\u4ea4\u6d41\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mammalianscience/54/1/54_73/_article/-char/ja/|journal=\u54fa\u4e73\u985e\u79d1\u5b66\u3000 |volume=54 |issue=1 |year=2014|pages=73\u201388|publisher=The Mammal Society of Japan, Cetacean Research Laboratory in Marine environmental section in the Graduate School of [[Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology]], [[J-STAGE]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref> Since the original Asian and Atlantic populations have become extinct, it is difficult to determine the unique features among whales in these stocks.

This unique feeding selection makes gray whales one of the most strongly reliant on coastal waters among baleen whales. It is classified as a [[baleen whale]] and has [[baleen]], or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] taken in along with sand, water and other material. Off Vancouver Island, gray whales commonly feed on mysids.  When mysids are abundant gray whales are present in fairly large numbers. Despite mysids being a prey of choice, gray whales are opportunistic feeders and can easily switch from feeding planktonically to benthically. When gray whales feed planktonically, they roll onto their right side while their fluke remains above the surface, or they apply the skimming method seen in other baleen whales (skimming the surface with their mouth open). This skimming behavior mainly seems to be used when gray whales are feeding on crab larvae. Gray whales feed benthically, by diving to the ocean floor and rolling on to their side, (gray whales, like blue whales seem to favor rolling onto their right side) and suck up prey from the sea floor.<ref>Oliver, J.

This hunt has been allowed under an \"aboriginal/subsistence whaling\" exception to the commercial-hunting ban. Anti-whaling groups have protested the hunt, saying the meat from the whales is not for traditional native consumption, but is used instead to feed animals in government-run fur farms; they cite annual catch numbers that rose dramatically during the 1940s, at the time when state-run fur farms were being established in the region. Although the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government denied these charges as recently as 1987, in recent years the Russian government has acknowledged the practice.

Some scientists suggest that the lack of sea ice has been preventing the fertilization of amphipods, a main source of food for gray whales, so that they have been hunting krill instead, which is far less nutritious.

Small depressions on the upper jaw each contain a lone stiff hair, but are only visible on close inspection. Its head's ventral surface lacks the numerous prominent furrows of the related rorquals, instead bearing two to five shallow furrows on the throat's underside. The gray whale also lacks a [[dorsal fin]], instead bearing 6 to 12 dorsal crenulations (\"knuckles\"), which are raised bumps on the midline of its rear quarter, leading to the [[fluke (tail)|fluke]]s. This is known as the [[dorsal ridge]]. The tail itself is {{convert|3|-|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} across and deeply notched at the center while its edges taper to a point.\n\n===Pacific groups===\nThe two populations of Pacific gray whales (east and west) are morphologically and phylogenically different. Other than DNA structures, differences in proportions of several body parts and body colors including skeletal features, and length ratios of flippers and baleen plates have been confirmed between Eastern and Western populations, and some claims that the original eastern and western groups could have been much more distinct than previously thought, enough to be counted as subspecies.<ref name=SC65bBRG12 /><ref name=GrayJapan>{{Cite journal|author1=Nakamura G.|author2=Kato H.|title=\u65e5\u672c\u6cbf\u5cb8\u57df\u306b\u8fd1\u5e74\uff081990\u20132005 \u5e74\uff09\u51fa\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30af\u30af\u30b8\u30e9Eschrichtius robustus \u306e\u9aa8\u5b66\u7684\u7279\u5fb4\uff0c\u7279\u306b\u982d\u9aa8\u5f62\u72b6\u304b\u3089\u898b\u305f\u5317\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u897f\u90e8\u7cfb\u7fa4\u3068\u6771\u90e8\u7cfb\u7fa4\u4ea4\u6d41\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mammalianscience/54/1/54_73/_article/-char/ja/|journal=\u54fa\u4e73\u985e\u79d1\u5b66\u3000 |volume=54 |issue=1 |year=2014|pages=73\u201388|publisher=The Mammal Society of Japan, Cetacean Research Laboratory in Marine environmental section in the Graduate School of [[Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology]], [[J-STAGE]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref> Since the original Asian and Atlantic populations have become extinct, it is difficult to determine the unique features among whales in these stocks.

This unique feeding selection makes gray whales one of the most strongly reliant on coastal waters among baleen whales. It is classified as a [[baleen whale]] and has [[baleen]], or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] taken in along with sand, water and other material. Off Vancouver Island, gray whales commonly feed on mysids.  When mysids are abundant gray whales are present in fairly large numbers. Despite mysids being a prey of choice, gray whales are opportunistic feeders and can easily switch from feeding planktonically to benthically. When gray whales feed planktonically, they roll onto their right side while their fluke remains above the surface, or they apply the skimming method seen in other baleen whales (skimming the surface with their mouth open). This skimming behavior mainly seems to be used when gray whales are feeding on crab larvae. Gray whales feed benthically, by diving to the ocean floor and rolling on to their side, (gray whales, like blue whales seem to favor rolling onto their right side) and suck up prey from the sea floor.<ref>Oliver, J.

This hunt has been allowed under an \"aboriginal/subsistence whaling\" exception to the commercial-hunting ban. Anti-whaling groups have protested the hunt, saying the meat from the whales is not for traditional native consumption, but is used instead to feed animals in government-run fur farms; they cite annual catch numbers that rose dramatically during the 1940s, at the time when state-run fur farms were being established in the region. Although the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government denied these charges as recently as 1987, in recent years the Russian government has acknowledged the practice.

Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Russia, the [[Makah people|Makah]] tribe of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single gray whale killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal appeals court decision in December 2002 that required the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] to prepare an [[Environmental Impact Statement]]. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using high-powered rifles in spite of the decision.

Some scientists suggest that the lack of sea ice has been preventing the fertilization of amphipods, a main source of food for gray whales, so that they have been hunting krill instead, which is far less nutritious.

When there was a high prevalence of sunspots, gray whales were five times more likely to strand.
