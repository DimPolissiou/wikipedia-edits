Babulina is unimpressed with the girl, but the shoes catch her eyes so the blonde girl offers them to her to which she accepts. The blonde girl tricks her though, and runs off while a ghost possess Babulina's body. The ghost introduces herself as Audrey, and tells Babu that she was going to dance at this show. She says though that she had died before she could have the chance to perform, and hear the audience cheer for her. Babu initially feels sad, but has an idea. With her horn she shoots out an audience that claps for Audrey which cheers her up enough to keep dancing.

The report contained a quote from Dr. Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \"a high concentration, by any account\".

There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by [[Buddhist monks]] and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures.<ref name=\"tour\" /> A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and [[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|Tracy Marander]]. A Buddhist monk chanted while his daughter, [[Frances Bean Cobain]], scattered his ashes into [[McLane Creek]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], the city where he \"had found his true artistic muse.\"<ref name=cross />{{rp|351}}\n\n== Murder theory ==\nThe official ruling of suicide has been disputed by numerous sources. Tom Grant, a [[private investigator]] hired by Love to find Cobain after his departure from drug rehabilitation, believes that Cobain was [[homicide|murdered]]. Grant's theory has been analyzed and questioned by several books, television shows, films, and the 2015 [[docudrama]] ''[[Soaked in Bleach]]''.\n\n=== Richard Lee ===\nThe first to object publicly to the report of suicide was Seattle [[public access]] host [[Richard Lee (journalist)|Richard Lee]]. A week following Cobain's death, Lee aired the first episode of an ongoing series called ''Kurt Cobain Was Murdered'', claiming there were several discrepancies in the police reports, including several changes in the nature of the shotgun blast. Lee acquired a video that was taped on April 8 from the tree outside Cobain's garage, showing the scene around Cobain's body, which he claimed showed a marked absence of blood for what was reported as a point-blank shotgun blast to the head. Several [[forensic pathology|pathology]] experts have stated that a shotgun blast inside the mouth often results in less blood, unlike a shotgun blast to the head.<ref name=hw>{{Cite book|last1=Halperin|last2=Wallace|title=Who Killed Kurt Cobain? The Mysterious Death of an Icon|publisher= Citadel|edition=June 1, 2000}}</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\n=== Tom Grant ===\nThe main proponent of [[Murder|foul play]] surrounding Cobain's death is Tom Grant, a [[private investigator]] employed by Love after Cobain's disappearance from rehab. Grant was still under Love's employment when the body was found, but then came to believe that Cobain's death was a [[homicide]]. There are several components to Grant's theory.\n\nGrant argues that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a dose and still have been able to pull the trigger.<ref name=hw /> Grant does not believe that Cobain was killed by the heroin dose. He suggests that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain before the final shotgun blast was administered by the perpetrator.<ref name=hw />{{rp|116}} Grant, Wallace, and Halperin have used the dosage reported in the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', not the actual [[autopsy]] report, and may not have the correct figure. The Seattle police cannot release the information to the media because reports and records of autopsies are confidential and protected under state and federal law.\n\n[[File:Kurt'sNote.jpg|thumb|right|Cobain's suicide note ([http://www.kurtcobainssuicidenote.com/kurt_cobains_suicide_note.html full transcription]). The final phrase before the greetings, {{quote|it's better to burn out than to fade away,}} is a quote from [[Neil Young]]'s song \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\".]]\nWhile working for Love, Grant was given access to Cobain's suicide note and used her [[fax machine]] to make a photocopy, which has since been widely distributed. After studying the notes, Grant believed that it was actually a letter written by Cobain announcing his intent to leave Love, Seattle, and the music business. Grant asserts that the lines at the very bottom of the note, separate from the rest, are the only parts implying suicide. While the official report on Cobain's death concluded that Cobain wrote the note, Grant claims that the official report does not distinguish these final lines from the rest of the note and assumes it was entirely written by Cobain.\n\nDespite consulting with many handwriting experts, some disagree with Grant's claims. Document examiner Janis Parker concluded that the note was written by Cobain after spending two weeks examining the original copy. When ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' sent a copy of the note to four different handwriting experts, one concluded that the entire note was in Cobain's hand, while the other three said the sample was inconclusive.<ref name=Dateline>Lauer, Matt. \"More questions in Kurt Cobain death?\" ''[[Dateline NBC]].'' April 5, 2004.</ref> One expert contacted by the television series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' expressed the difficulty in drawing a conclusion, given that the note being studied was a photocopy, not the original. But in the very same documentary, two other experts found the writing, especially the last four lines, suspicious.<ref name=hw />{{rp|112}}\n\nGrant also cites [[circumstantial evidence]] from the official report. For example, the report claimed that the doors of the greenhouse could not have been locked from the outside, meaning that Cobain would have had to lock them himself. Grant claims that when he saw the doors for himself, he found that they could be locked and pulled shut. He also questions the lack of fingerprint evidence connecting Cobain to key evidence, including the shotgun. Grant notes that the official report claims that Cobain's fingerprints were also absent from the suicide note as well as the pen that had been shoved through it, and yet Cobain was found without gloves on. None of the circumstantial evidence directly points to murder, but Grant believes it supports the larger case.<ref name=hw />{{rp|121}}\n\nIn the [[docudrama]] ''[[Soaked in Bleach]]'', Grant actually claims that the \"cadaveric spasm\" was mentioned in the police reports, while many have said that it was clearly not.\n\nIn studying the Rome incident, journalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] contacted Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who treated Cobain after the incident. Galletta contested the claim that the Rome overdose was a suicide attempt, telling Halperin and Wallace, \"We can usually tell a suicide attempt. This didn't look like one to me.\" Galletta also specifically denied Love's claim that 50 [[Rohypnol]] pills were removed from Cobain's stomach.<ref name=hw />{{rp|89}} However, they also stated, \"Grant believes Courtney may have mixed a large number of pills into Kurt's champagne so that when he took a drink, he was actually unknowingly ingesting large amounts of the drug, enough to kill him. But if that's the case, why did she call the police when she found him unconscious on the floor? If she wanted Kurt dead, why didn't she just leave him on the floor until he died?\"\n\nGrant believes that the claim of the Rome incident being a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's death. He claims that people close to Cobain, including Gold Mountain Records, specifically denied the characterization prior to Cobain's death. Grant believes that if Rome had truly been a suicide attempt, Cobain's friends and family would have been told so that they could have watched over him. Others have asserted that the claims by Gold Mountain and others were simply efforts to mask what was happening behind the scenes. [[Lee Ranaldo]], guitarist for [[Sonic Youth]], told ''Rolling Stone'', \"Rome was only the latest installment of [those around Cobain] keeping a semblance of normalcy for the outside world.\"<ref>Strauss, Neil. \"The Downward Spiral.\" ''Cobain: By the Editors of Rolling Stone.'' 1994.</ref>\n\nGrant spoke to Cobain's attorney, Rosemary Carroll, at her office on April 13, 1994. He said she pressed him to investigate Cobain's death, and that Cobain was not suicidal. Carroll also claims that Cobain had asked her to draw up a [[Will and testament|will]] excluding Love because he was planning to file for [[divorce]]. Grant said this was the motive for Cobain's death.<ref name=hw />{{rp|119}} Carroll also provided Grant with a handwriting practice note that she found in Love's backpack that was left at her home. It has been suggested that the handwriting on this practice note is markedly similar to the handwriting found on the last four lines of Cobain's suicide note.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theunredacted.com/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/ |title=The Death of Kurt Cobain: Never Fade Away |date=April 18, 2017 |website=theunredacted.com |accessdate=June 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104202528/http://theunredacted.com/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/ |archivedate=November 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nGrant counters the claim that he profits from the sale of casebook kits on his website by stating that it offsets some of the costs of his investigation.

Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors]]' bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon \"El Duce\" Hoke]], who claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed that he knew who killed Cobain, he did not mention a name and offered no evidence to support his assertion. However, he mentioned speaking to someone called \"Allen\" (Allen Wrench), before quickly interjecting, \"I mean, my friend\", then laughing, \"I'll let the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] catch him.\" According to Mentors' bass player [[Steve Broy]], the whole story was concocted to sell supermarket tabloids.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broy |first1=Steve |title=The Truth is Funnier than Fiction: My Life with Eldon Hoke and the Mentors |date=2015 |publisher=Self published |pages=263\u2013264 |edition=2nd}}</ref> Broomfield incidentally captured Hoke's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train in the middle of the night.\n\nBroomfield titled the finished documentary ''[[Kurt & Courtney]]'', which was released on February 27, 1998. In the end, Broomfield felt he hadn't uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, he summed up his thoughts: \"I think that he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a [[smoking gun]]. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him.

Their initial work, the 1999 book ''Who Killed Kurt Cobain?'', drew a similar conclusion to Broomfield's film: while there wasn't enough evidence to conclusively prove foul play, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened. A notable element of the book included their discussions with Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation he had undertaken while he was working for Love. Halperin and Wallace insisted that Grant play the tapes of his conversations with Carroll so that they could confirm his story. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Vineyard |title=New Book Claims Kurt Cobain Didn't Commit Suicide |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486188/20040405/love_courtney.jhtml |website=[[MTV.com]] |date=April 5, 2004 |accessdate=December 11, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Reactions of Cobain's friends ==\nSeveral of Cobain's friends have accepted that it was suicide, but were surprised when it happened. [[Mark Lanegan]], a long-time friend of Cobain, told ''Rolling Stone'': \"I never knew [Cobain] to be suicidal. I just knew he was going through a tough time.\"<ref>Strauss.</ref> In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that Rome was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, husband of Carroll and founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book ''Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit'' to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts [him] every day\".<ref>Goldberg, Danny.

Miramax, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn August 2005, Sonic Youth's [[Kim Gordon]] was asked about Cobain's death in an interview for [[UNCUT (magazine)|''Uncut'' Magazine]].

It wasn't just an OD. He actually killed himself violently. It was so aggressive, and he wasn't an aggressive person, he was a smart person, he had an interesting intellect.

He was actually, two weeks after he died, he was supposed to come here and he wanted to record a bunch of Leadbelly covers.

There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by [[Buddhist monks]] and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures.<ref name=\"tour\" /> A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and [[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|Tracy Marander]]. A Buddhist monk chanted while his daughter, [[Frances Bean Cobain]], scattered his ashes into [[McLane Creek]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], the city where he \"had found his true artistic muse.\"<ref name=cross />{{rp|351}}\n\n== Murder theory ==\nThe official ruling of suicide has been disputed by numerous sources. Tom Grant, a [[private investigator]] hired by Love to find Cobain after his departure from drug rehabilitation, believes that Cobain was [[homicide|murdered]]. Grant's theory has been analyzed and questioned by several books, television shows, films, and the 2015 [[docudrama]] ''[[Soaked in Bleach]]''.\n\n=== Richard Lee ===\nThe first to object publicly to the report of suicide was Seattle [[public access]] host [[Richard Lee (journalist)|Richard Lee]]. A week following Cobain's death, Lee aired the first episode of an ongoing series called ''Kurt Cobain Was Murdered'', claiming there were several discrepancies in the police reports, including several changes in the nature of the shotgun blast. Lee acquired a video that was taped on April 8 from the tree outside Cobain's garage, showing the scene around Cobain's body, which he claimed showed a marked absence of blood for what was reported as a point-blank shotgun blast to the head. Several [[forensic pathology|pathology]] experts have stated that a shotgun blast inside the mouth often results in less blood, unlike a shotgun blast to the head.<ref name=hw>{{Cite book|last1=Halperin|last2=Wallace|title=Who Killed Kurt Cobain? The Mysterious Death of an Icon|publisher= Citadel|edition=June 1, 2000}}</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\n=== Tom Grant ===\nThe main proponent of [[Murder|foul play]] surrounding Cobain's death is Tom Grant, a [[private investigator]] employed by Love after Cobain's disappearance from rehab. Grant was still under Love's employment when the body was found, but then came to believe that Cobain's death was a [[homicide]]. There are several components to Grant's theory.\n\nGrant argues that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a dose and still have been able to pull the trigger.<ref name=hw /> Grant does not believe that Cobain was killed by the heroin dose. He suggests that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain before the final shotgun blast was administered by the perpetrator.<ref name=hw />{{rp|116}} Grant, Wallace, and Halperin have used the dosage reported in the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', not the actual [[autopsy]] report, and may not have the correct figure. The Seattle police cannot release the information to the media because reports and records of autopsies are confidential and protected under state and federal law.\n\n[[File:Kurt'sNote.jpg|thumb|right|Cobain's suicide note ([http://www.kurtcobainssuicidenote.com/kurt_cobains_suicide_note.html full transcription]). The final phrase before the greetings, {{quote|it's better to burn out than to fade away,}} is a quote from [[Neil Young]]'s song \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\".]]\nWhile working for Love, Grant was given access to Cobain's suicide note and used her [[fax machine]] to make a photocopy, which has since been widely distributed. After studying the notes, Grant believed that it was actually a letter written by Cobain announcing his intent to leave Love, Seattle, and the music business. Grant asserts that the lines at the very bottom of the note, separate from the rest, are the only parts implying suicide. While the official report on Cobain's death concluded that Cobain wrote the note, Grant claims that the official report does not distinguish these final lines from the rest of the note and assumes it was entirely written by Cobain.\n\nDespite consulting with many handwriting experts, some disagree with Grant's claims. Document examiner Janis Parker concluded that the note was written by Cobain after spending two weeks examining the original copy. When ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' sent a copy of the note to four different handwriting experts, one concluded that the entire note was in Cobain's hand, while the other three said the sample was inconclusive.<ref name=Dateline>Lauer, Matt. \"More questions in Kurt Cobain death?\" ''[[Dateline NBC]].'' April 5, 2004.</ref> One expert contacted by the television series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' expressed the difficulty in drawing a conclusion, given that the note being studied was a photocopy, not the original. But in the very same documentary, two other experts found the writing, especially the last four lines, suspicious.<ref name=hw />{{rp|112}}\n\nGrant also cites [[circumstantial evidence]] from the official report. For example, the report claimed that the doors of the greenhouse could not have been locked from the outside, meaning that Cobain would have had to lock them himself. Grant claims that when he saw the doors for himself, he found that they could be locked and pulled shut. He also questions the lack of fingerprint evidence connecting Cobain to key evidence, including the shotgun. Grant notes that the official report claims that Cobain's fingerprints were also absent from the suicide note as well as the pen that had been shoved through it, and yet Cobain was found without gloves on. None of the circumstantial evidence directly points to murder, but Grant believes it supports the larger case.<ref name=hw />{{rp|121}}\n\nIn the [[docudrama]] ''[[Soaked in Bleach]]'', Grant actually claims that the \"cadaveric spasm\" was mentioned in the police reports, while many have said that it was clearly not.\n\nIn studying the Rome incident, journalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] contacted Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who treated Cobain after the incident. Galletta contested the claim that the Rome overdose was a suicide attempt, telling Halperin and Wallace, \"We can usually tell a suicide attempt. This didn't look like one to me.\" Galletta also specifically denied Love's claim that 50 [[Rohypnol]] pills were removed from Cobain's stomach.<ref name=hw />{{rp|89}} However, they also stated, \"Grant believes Courtney may have mixed a large number of pills into Kurt's champagne so that when he took a drink, he was actually unknowingly ingesting large amounts of the drug, enough to kill him. But if that's the case, why did she call the police when she found him unconscious on the floor? If she wanted Kurt dead, why didn't she just leave him on the floor until he died?\"\n\nGrant believes that the claim of the Rome incident being a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's death. He claims that people close to Cobain, including Gold Mountain Records, specifically denied the characterization prior to Cobain's death. Grant believes that if Rome had truly been a suicide attempt, Cobain's friends and family would have been told so that they could have watched over him. Others have asserted that the claims by Gold Mountain and others were simply efforts to mask what was happening behind the scenes. [[Lee Ranaldo]], guitarist for [[Sonic Youth]], told ''Rolling Stone'', \"Rome was only the latest installment of [those around Cobain] keeping a semblance of normalcy for the outside world.\"<ref>Strauss, Neil. \"The Downward Spiral.\" ''Cobain: By the Editors of Rolling Stone.'' 1994.</ref>\n\nGrant spoke to Cobain's attorney, Rosemary Carroll, at her office on April 13, 1994. He said she pressed him to investigate Cobain's death, and that Cobain was not suicidal. Carroll also claims that Cobain had asked her to draw up a [[Will and testament|will]] excluding Love because he was planning to file for [[divorce]].

Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors]]' bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon \"El Duce\" Hoke]], who claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed that he knew who killed Cobain, he did not mention a name and offered no evidence to support his assertion. However, he mentioned speaking to someone called \"Allen\" (Allen Wrench), before quickly interjecting, \"I mean, my friend\", then laughing, \"I'll let the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] catch him.\" According to Mentors' bass player [[Steve Broy]], the whole story was concocted to sell supermarket tabloids.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broy |first1=Steve |title=The Truth is Funnier than Fiction: My Life with Eldon Hoke and the Mentors |date=2015 |publisher=Self published |pages=263\u2013264 |edition=2nd}}</ref> Broomfield incidentally captured Hoke's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train in the middle of the night.\n\nBroomfield titled the finished documentary ''[[Kurt & Courtney]]'', which was released on February 27, 1998.

I don't think that there's a [[smoking gun]]. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death.

Their initial work, the 1999 book ''Who Killed Kurt Cobain?'', drew a similar conclusion to Broomfield's film: while there wasn't enough evidence to conclusively prove foul play, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened. A notable element of the book included their discussions with Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation he had undertaken while he was working for Love. Halperin and Wallace insisted that Grant play the tapes of his conversations with Carroll so that they could confirm his story. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Vineyard |title=New Book Claims Kurt Cobain Didn't Commit Suicide |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486188/20040405/love_courtney.jhtml |website=[[MTV.com]] |date=April 5, 2004 |accessdate=December 11, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Reactions of Cobain's friends ==\nSeveral of Cobain's friends have accepted that it was suicide, but were surprised when it happened.

I just knew he was going through a tough time.\"<ref>Strauss.</ref> In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that Rome was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, husband of Carroll and founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book ''Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit'' to \"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\" stating that Cobain's suicide \"haunts [him] every day\".<ref>Goldberg, Danny.

It wasn't just an OD. He actually killed himself violently. It was so aggressive, and he wasn't an aggressive person, he was a smart person, he had an interesting intellect. So it kind of made sense because it was like: wow, what a fucking gesture. But at the same time it was like: something's wrong with that gesture. It doesn't really lie with what we know.</blockquote>\n\n[[Anthony Kiedis]], lead singer of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], expressed his feelings in his autobiography, ''[[Scar Tissue (book)|Scar Tissue]]'', writing: <blockquote>The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when [[Hillel Slovak|Hillel]] died; it was more like \"The world just suffered a great loss.\" Kurt's death was unexpected&nbsp;...

There was nowhere else to go but down, it was too artificial for him, and he wasn't an artificial person at all. He was actually, two weeks after he died, he was supposed to come here and he wanted to record a bunch of Leadbelly covers. It was kind of in secret, because, I mean, people would definitely not allow him to do that. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just to get out of the scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smokebox.net/archives/interviews/sage801.html |title=interview with greg sage |author=Marc Covert |accessdate=May 3, 2007 |year=2003 |publisher=Smokebox.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173817/http://www.smokebox.net/archives/interviews/sage801.html |archivedate=July 16, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCobain's grandfather, Leland Cobain, publicly said that he believed Cobain was murdered.<ref>Gold, Todd.

Both Marty James and MDA were part of the group [[Scapegoat Wax]]. One Block Radius was formed in late 2003. They have toured and done shows with Hiero, Maroon 5, Living Legends, Matisyahu, De La Soul, [[Trick Daddy]], Pigeon John, Aceyalone and more.\n<!-- One Block Radius represents a unique musical direction, with music blending pop and hip-hop sensibilities, with strong melodies and pop refrains mixed with [[rapping]] and hip-hop production. Their lyrics tend to focus on partying and everyday life, avoiding the aggressive themes of [[gangsta rap]] or the more socially conscious themes of other alternative rappers.  -->And Marty James also featured in the song called Fantasy Girl with [[Baby Bash]] in 2010.\n\nIn 2005, One Block Radius released their debut album ''Long Story Short''. It featured a diverse selection of songs ranging from pure pop to straight-up hip-hop. The following year they released a follow-up in the form of a [[mixtape]] CD called ''Cut Some Static''. ''Cut Some Static'' was an album-length compilation of previously unreleased tracks, but was not released as a proper album. It was not sold at retail, came packaged with home-computer printed labels, and featured members of the band introducing tracks, to keep the underground mixtape feel. Musically, it also featured a grittier, more rap-oriented sound, and more explicit lyrics.\n\n[[Marty James]] was featured on the hook of The Federation's 2006 west coast club anthem \"I Wear My Stunna Glasses at Night\". Since that time he has also become an accomplished writer and producer having worked with [[JR Rotem]], [[E-40]], [[Far East Movement]] [[Sean Kingston]], [[Baby Bash]], [[Paula DeAnda]], [[Diane Warren]], [[Rick Rock]], [[Lil Jon]], [[The Grouch (rapper)|The Grouch]], [[DJ Felli Fel]], [[Jessi Malay]], [[MoZella]], Laze & Royal, The Stooie Brothers and more. In 2007, he co-wrote \"[[What Is It]]\" by Baby Bash ft. Sean Kingston.\n\nIn May 2008 One Block Radius released the single \"You Got Me\" on Property Music Group (Marty James own label). James also produced the song.

They have toured and done shows with Hiero, Maroon 5, Living Legends, Matisyahu, De La Soul, [[Trick Daddy]], Pigeon John, Aceyalone and more.\n<!-- One Block Radius represents a unique musical direction, with music blending pop and hip-hop sensibilities, with strong melodies and pop refrains mixed with [[rapping]] and hip-hop production. Their lyrics tend to focus on partying and everyday life, avoiding the aggressive themes of [[gangsta rap]] or the more socially conscious themes of other alternative rappers.  -->And Marty James also featured in the song called Fantasy Girl with [[Baby Bash]] in 2010.\n\nIn 2005, One Block Radius released their debut album ''Long Story Short''. It featured a diverse selection of songs ranging from pure pop to straight-up hip-hop. The following year they released a follow-up in the form of a [[mixtape]] CD called ''Cut Some Static''. ''Cut Some Static'' was an album-length compilation of previously unreleased tracks, but was not released as a proper album. It was not sold at retail, came packaged with home-computer printed labels, and featured members of the band introducing tracks, to keep the underground mixtape feel. Musically, it also featured a grittier, more rap-oriented sound, and more explicit lyrics.\n\n[[Marty James]] was featured on the hook of The Federation's 2006 west coast club anthem \"I Wear My Stunna Glasses at Night\". Since that time he has also become an accomplished writer and producer having worked with [[JR Rotem]], [[E-40]], [[Far East Movement]] [[Sean Kingston]], [[Baby Bash]], [[Paula DeAnda]], [[Diane Warren]], [[Rick Rock]], [[Lil Jon]], [[The Grouch (rapper)|The Grouch]], [[DJ Felli Fel]], [[Jessi Malay]], [[MoZella]], Laze & Royal, The Stooie Brothers and more. In 2007, he co-wrote \"[[What Is It]]\" by Baby Bash ft. Sean Kingston.\n\nIn May 2008 One Block Radius released the single \"You Got Me\" on Property Music Group (Marty James own label). James also produced the song.

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for four consecutive weeks on Saturdays from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was interested and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced and most of Burnett's former staff and crew were on board for the new series.\n\n==Overview==\nUnder the title ''Carol Burnett & Company'', the new series continued the same format of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which combined comedy sketches and musical numbers including favorite characters/sketches such as \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", \"[[The Oldest Man (character)|The Oldest Man]]\", \"The Charwoman\" and Burnett's impersonation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].  \n\nThe series also featured Conway and [[Vicki Lawrence]] back as regulars; due to the unavailability of [[Harvey Korman]], comic actors [[Craig Richard Nelson]] and [[Kenneth Mars]] were added to the supporting cast; Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' during its entire run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D. Tucker\" who gave humorously misguided sermons about life, with shouts of \"It don't matter!\" interspersed throughout his dissertation (Conway would later use this character on [[The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series)|his own variety show]] when it premiered in March 1980).\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!

It is an informal cinquain widely taught in elementary schools and has been featured in, and popularized by, children's media resources, including [[Junie B. Jones]] and [[PBS Kids]]. This form is also embraced by young adults and older poets for its expressive simplicity.  The prescriptions of this type of cinquain refer to word count, not syllables and stresses.  Ordinarily, the first line is a one-word title, the subject of the poem; the second line is a pair of adjectives describing that title; the third line is a three-word phrase that gives more information about the subject (often a list of three [[gerund]]s); the fourth line consists of four words describing feelings related to that subject; and the fifth line is a single word synonym or other reference for the subject from line one.<br />\n<br />\nFor example:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSnow<br />\nSilent, white<br />\nDancing, falling, drifting<br />\nCovering everything it touches<br />\nBlanket\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other cinquains==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Form\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Tanka]]\n|is a five-line form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, totalling 31 [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]s structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.\n|-\n|Tetractys\n|is a five-line poem of 20 syllables with a title, arranged in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, with each line standing as a phrase on its own.

It is an informal cinquain widely taught in elementary schools and has been featured in, and popularized by, children's media resources, including [[Junie B. Jones]] and [[PBS Kids]]. This form is also embraced by young adults and older poets for its expressive simplicity.  The prescriptions of this type of cinquain refer to word count, not syllables and stresses.  Ordinarily, the first line is a one-word title, the subject of the poem; the second line is a pair of adjectives describing that title; the third line is a three-word phrase that gives more information about the subject (often a list of three [[gerund]]s); the fourth line consists of four words describing feelings related to that subject; and the fifth line is a single word synonym or other reference for the subject from line one.<br />\n<br />\nFor example:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSnow<br />\nSilent, white<br />\nDancing, falling, drifting<br />\nCovering everything it touches<br />\nBlanket\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other cinquains==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Form\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Tanka]]\n|is a five-line form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, totalling 31 [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]s structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.\n|-\n|Tetractys\n|is a five-line poem of 20 syllables with a title, arranged in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, with each line standing as a phrase on its own.

The Erie's service was felt to be unsatisfactory, and the A&GW potentially interested in a new partner. The eastern end of the A&GW was at [[Salamanca, New York]], about {{convert|35|mi|km}} from Port Allegany along the Allegheny River, and could easily be extended along the river to connect with the JSPC&B. At [[Newberry, Pennsylvania|Newberry]], near Williamsport, traffic could be routed onto the [[Catawissa Railroad]] and then the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] to reach the New York area.\n\nRoss's letter gives a good idea of the route planned. He says that it would descend on the western side via [[Mill Creek (Allegheny River)|Mill Creek]],<ref name=\"letter\" /> which meets the Allegheny River at [[Coudersport, Pennsylvania|Coudersport]]. The closest approach to the Pine Creek watershed would leave Mill Creek to climb along [[Nelson Run]]. A summit tunnel {{convert|2300|ft|m}} long was planned,<ref name=\"letter\" /> which would suffice to carry a line from the headwaters of Nelson Run into Splash Dam Hollow, then down [[Lyman Run]] to the [[West Branch Pine Creek]], reaching the main stream of Pine Creek at [[Galeton, Pennsylvania|Galeton]].\n\nBesides the JSPC&B's value as a [[trunk line]], Ross hopefully anticipated the development of traffic along the line from [[lumbering]], coal mining, and [[iron]] manufacturing. In the end, only lumbering and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=534 | title=Marker Details: Potter County | accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> would play a significant role in the industry of the area.

The unfinished line appeared in other grandiose rail schemes: the [[Gaines and State Line Rail Road]], incorporated 1875, would have built north from the JSPC&B at [[Gaines, Pennsylvania|Gaines]] as part of a line to [[Hornellsville, New York|Hornellsville]] and [[Geneva, New York]].<ref>{{citation | author= | url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/rrhtml/rrhome.html | title= Map showing the Geneva & Hornellsville Railroad and its connections | publisher=G.W. & C.B.

The coal companies were plagued by labor disputes, and the deposits they mined were diminishing. The NYC feared that its rival, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], would use its control over coal shipments from central Pennsylvania to inflate the price of that fuel. The solution decided upon was that the coal companies, backed by the NYC, would build a new rail line into the [[Clearfield Coalfield]] and open new mines there. Coal would move north over the new line to the NYC.

The Erie's service was felt to be unsatisfactory, and the A&GW potentially interested in a new partner. The eastern end of the A&GW was at [[Salamanca, New York]], about {{convert|35|mi|km}} from Port Allegany along the Allegheny River, and could easily be extended along the river to connect with the JSPC&B. At [[Newberry, Pennsylvania|Newberry]], near Williamsport, traffic could be routed onto the [[Catawissa Railroad]] and then the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] to reach the New York area.\n\nRoss's letter gives a good idea of the route planned. He says that it would descend on the western side via [[Mill Creek (Allegheny River)|Mill Creek]],<ref name=\"letter\" /> which meets the Allegheny River at [[Coudersport, Pennsylvania|Coudersport]]. The closest approach to the Pine Creek watershed would leave Mill Creek to climb along [[Nelson Run]]. A summit tunnel {{convert|2300|ft|m}} long was planned,<ref name=\"letter\" /> which would suffice to carry a line from the headwaters of Nelson Run into Splash Dam Hollow, then down [[Lyman Run]] to the [[West Branch Pine Creek]], reaching the main stream of Pine Creek at [[Galeton, Pennsylvania|Galeton]].\n\nBesides the JSPC&B's value as a [[trunk line]], Ross hopefully anticipated the development of traffic along the line from [[lumbering]], coal mining, and [[iron]] manufacturing.

The coal companies were plagued by labor disputes, and the deposits they mined were diminishing. The NYC feared that its rival, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], would use its control over coal shipments from central Pennsylvania to inflate the price of that fuel. The solution decided upon was that the coal companies, backed by the NYC, would build a new rail line into the [[Clearfield Coalfield]] and open new mines there.
