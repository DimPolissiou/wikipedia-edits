Later, Sydney runs out of class, almost triggering her powers again, but stops them by thinking about happy memories. Dina runs after her and asks if she's okay and if they can talk about their kiss, but Sydney lies and says everything is fine. Sydney goes to the bowling alley and meets with Stan, who tries to help her understand her powers. There, she admits the trees blew down because she kissed someone at the party and says her powers seem to be tied to her emotions. Stan then tries to trigger Sydney's powers by making her angry, and in the process, Sydney almost hits Stan with bowling balls, angering her.

Running into the library, Sydney inadvertently knocks over all the bookshelves with her powers, and she and Stan recruit Dina to steal the security footage, telling her the reason is that the tapes show them having sex in the library. The three devise a plan and break into the office, successfully stealing the footage. In the locker room, Sydney overhears Jenny and Brad admitting they had sex and Brad cheated on Dina. When Dina walks in, Sydney tells her, despite Brad's pleas for her not to, and Dina and Brad break up.

At lunch, Ricky Berry tells Brad about a rumor about him, while Stan tries to make plans with Sydney about homecoming. She gets angry at him, telling him that she doesn't care about homecoming and he asks someone else.

The terms stipulated the marriage of Charles VII's niece, [[Margaret of Anjou]], to Henry VI, and the creation of a [[truce]] of two years \u2013 later extended \u2013 between the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]]. In exchange for the marriage, Charles wanted the English-held area of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] in northern France, just south of [[Normandy]].\n\nHenry VI married the fifteen-year-old Margaret in April 1445; he did not, however, give up Maine immediately. This clause was initially kept secret, as the cession of this strategically important province was likely to cause a public backlash in England. Charles threatened Henry VI and sent envoys to pressure him; even Margaret tried to persuade Henry to give it up. Henry eventually yielded in 1448 when Charles VII threatened English garrisons with a large army.\n\nThe treaty was seen as a major failure for England as the bride secured for Henry VI was a poor match, being Charles VII's niece only through marriage, and was otherwise related to him by blood only distantly. Her marriage also came without a [[dowry]], as Margaret was the daughter of the impoverished Duke [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], and Henry was also expected to pay for the wedding. Henry believed the treaty was a first step towards a lasting peace, while Charles intended to use it purely for military advantage. The truce collapsed in 1449 and England quickly lost what remained of its French lands, bringing the Hundred Years' War to an end.\n\nThe failure of the treaty of Tours and the renewal of hostilities brought down the English government of the day. Its consequences exacerbated rifts between the court's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] faction and the dukes of [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]] and [[Richard, Duke of York|York]], and has been considered a potentially contributory factor to the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\n==Context==\nIn 1444, the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453) had now raged for more than a century between the houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]], who fought for control of the throne of France. The French under King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] had gained ground dramatically after the intervention of [[Joan of Arc]] in 1429 and the dissolution of the alliance between England and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], a French [[vassal]], in 1435.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=90}} The English king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], who came of age in 1437, was an incompetent ruler and war leader.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=151}} The French held the initiative, and, by 1444, [[Dual monarchy of England and France|English rule in France]] was limited to [[Normandy]] in the north and a strip of land in [[Gascony]] in the southwest, while Charles VII ruled over [[Paris]] and the rest of France with the support of most of the French regional nobility.\n\nThe English territories in France could not withstand more taxation, whereas the English state was nearing bankruptcy. The English political establishment believed that an agreement would have to be reached with the French and that concessions would have to be made, with the exception of the king's uncle, [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] \u2013 then the [[List of heirs to the English throne|heir to the throne]] \u2013 who advocated for continued military presence in France to preserve England's possessions there.{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=120}} A truce would provide the English a much needed break from hostilities. For the French, it would give them time to strengthen their armies in preparation for a possible resumption of the war, and prevent any hypothetical renewal of the Anglo-Burgundian alliance.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=300}}\n\n==Treaty==\nIt is unclear which side had the initiative to propose discussions, but by January 1444 the English council decided to open talks with the French.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=301}} In 1444, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], and Duke [[Philip the Good|Philip of Burgundy]] reached an agreement that their commissioners should meet at Tours to discuss peace terms and a possible marriage alliance between England and France.{{sfn|Weir|1995|pp=108\u2013109}} The English embassy was headed by [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk]], who on 1 February was dispatched to France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=301}} The French delegation was led by [[Jean de Dunois]]. In March 1444, Suffolk landed in France and in April, he met with the French embassy.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}}\n\nThe English offered to drop Henry VI's claim to French throne in exchange for Normandy without French suzerainty,{{sfn|Allmand|2001|p=35}} but this was rejected. The English in turn rejected French demands that landowners who fled the English occupation be restored to their possessions.{{sfn|Allmand|2001|p=35}} Negotiations bogged down, the French refusing any significant concessions.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=301}} Suffolk formally requested the hand of [[Margaret of Anjou]], daughter of [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]] (brother in law to Charles VII) as a wife for Henry.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} Rene agreed, but insisted that he had no money and could not provide the customary dowry,{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} when the amount that should have been given was 20,000 [[Livre tournois|livre]]s. He demanded that in exchange for the marriage and a proposed 21-month truce in the War, England return to France the lands of Maine and Anjou.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} Suffolk knew that this would not be popular in England, but Henry insisted on the truce, having heard that the [[Charles I, Count of Nevers|Count of Nevers]] was preparing to offer marriage to Margaret himself.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} The marriage was not considered advantageous to England since Margaret was not a close relation to Charles VII, and was related only through the marriage of her father to the King\u2019s sister.\n\nThe English had optimistically thought that a marriage alliance would turn Ren\u00e9 of Anjou into a major advocate for peace at his brother-in-law's court.{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=292 n. 1}} For Charles VII however, a marriage between his niece and the English King would prevent the English from concluding a marriage alliance with one of his more rebellious nobles, the [[John IV, Count of Armagnac|Count of Armagnac]] having already made proposals previously.{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=117}} An alliance with the impoverished house of Anjou was less beneficial to the English than one with the [[house of Armagnac]].{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=117}} Another factor cited as a diplomatic blunder was Suffolk's failure to include [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] in the list of Henry VI's allies on the truce, and allowing Charles VII to place Brittany in his own.{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=324}} All of the concessions in the treaty were made by England and France got the better end of the truce.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=176}} Henry believed it was a first step towards a lasting peace; Charles intended to use it purely for military advantage.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=183}}\n\nAdditionally, the blame of the unfavorable request to return Maine and Anjou to the French was laid at Suffolk\u2019s feet, though he insisted that he had made no promises at the Treaty to that demand.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=172}} Suffolk brought the new queen back to England later that year{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=486}} to meet the king.  When she landed in England, the King dressed himself as a squire and brought a letter supposed to be from the King so that he could watch Margaret in secret.  When Suffolk asked later what she thought of the squire, the queen stated that she did not notice him at all.  Suffolk told her that she had just been with the King, and she was upset, realizing she\u2019d kept him on his knees the entire time he read the letter.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=188}}\n\nThe Treaty of Tours was to expire in April 1446, and England sought to extend it in order to find a longer-lasting peace with France.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=490}} This was perhaps undermined by the fact that Henry VI refused to cede the lands of Maine and Anjou until 1448, and only then on threat of military force from Charles VII.\n\n==Aftermath in England==\nIn England, the cession of Maine was expected to garner opposition principally by two powerful men: the [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Earl of Somerset]], who was the greatest landowner in, and the governor of, Maine, and the Duke of Gloucester, who opposed territorial concessions to the French{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=343}} and whose opposition to the peace process was well known.{{sfn|Harriss|2004}} Although Gloucester congratulated the Duke of Suffolk in parliament in June 1445 for his role in the peace process, he soon after helped flare up tensions by sending (12 July) a gift to the [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King of Aragon]] \u2013 the archenemy of Henry VI's new father-in-law Ren\u00e9 of Anjou.{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=122}} Just a few days later (15 July), probably as a response for this, Suffolk and Henry VI humiliated Gloucester in front of French ambassadors,{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=121}} the latter signaling his disdain for his uncle's political inclinations and the former telling them (in the king's presence) later on that Gloucester counted for nothing on government policy.{{sfn|Harriss|2004}}{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=125}}{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=334}} The possibility that Gloucester could serve as a figurehead for embittered war veterans and other opponents of the regime led Suffolk to instigate his arrest on charges of treason in early 1447. The imprisoned duke died shortly afterwards, probably of a stroke, though there were rumors that he had been murdered.{{sfn|Harriss|2004}}\n\nThe Earl of Somerset was brought on board of the cessation of Maine by being offered the governorship of Normandy. However, it was already expected that the office would be held by the [[Richard, Duke of York|Duke of York]].{{sfn|Harriss|1988|pp=357\u2013358}}{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=343}} For the Duke of Suffolk, the easiest way to get York out of the way was to discredit him politically. In late 1446, a violent altercation in parliament between Suffolk's ally bishop [[Adam Moleyns]] and the Duke of York over allegations of the latter's misconduct as lieutenant-general discredited York politically and provided the justification for York's dismissal.{{sfn|Harriss|1988|pp=357\u2013358}}{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=291}}{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=343}} York was mollified by being appointed governor of Ireland. He was nonetheless enraged at his treatment, which alienated Suffolk's regime from a hitherto supporter.{{sfn|Harriss|1988|pp=357\u2013358}}{{sfn|Jones|1989|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nThe truce of Tours collapsed in 1449 and the French then proceeded to conquer Normandy with ease.{{sfn|Allmand|2001|p=36}} The Duke of Suffolk, politically discredited over the failure of his signature achievement, was impeached and murdered in 1450. His demise paved the way for [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Somerset]] to replace him as the court [[favourite]].{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=286}} In the following years York, slighted over his previous treatment and seeing the collapse of English France under Somerset's tenure as damaging to his honor,{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=306\u2013307}} would tirelessly lobby for Somerset's removal from power, accusing him of incompetence and embezzlement.{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=285}} Their feud was a crucial factor in the escalation of tensions that led to the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=306\u2013307}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |last=Allmand |year=2001 |first=C.T. |title=The Hundred Years War: England and France at War, c.1300\u2013c.1450 |edition=revised |publisher=Cambridge University Press |origyear=1988 |isbn=0-521-31923-4 |url={{googlebooks|Igb2Q2WKYQcC|plainurl=y}} |authorlink=Christopher Allmand |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barker |year=2009 |first=Juliet |title=Conquest: The English Kingdom of France |publisher=Little, Brown |place=London<!-- |publicationdate=2009-10-15--> |isbn=978-1-4087-0083-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/conquestenglishk0000bark |url-status=live |authorlink=Juliet Barker |ref=harv |url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite book | last=Griffiths |date=1981 |first=R.A. |title=The Reign of King Henry VI: The exercise of royal authority, 1422\u20131461 |url={{google books|frWDmbf_mXEC|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=University of California Press |place=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |isbn=978-0-520-04372-5 |authorlink=Ralph A.

The terms stipulated the marriage of Charles VII's niece, [[Margaret of Anjou]], to Henry VI, and the creation of a [[truce]] of two years \u2013 later extended \u2013 between the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]]. In exchange for the marriage, Charles wanted the English-held area of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] in northern France, just south of [[Normandy]].\n\nHenry VI married the fifteen-year-old Margaret in April 1445; he did not, however, give up Maine immediately. This clause was initially kept secret, as the cession of this strategically important province was likely to cause a public backlash in England. Charles threatened Henry VI and sent envoys to pressure him; even Margaret tried to persuade Henry to give it up. Henry eventually yielded in 1448 when Charles VII threatened English garrisons with a large army.\n\nThe treaty was seen as a major failure for England as the bride secured for Henry VI was a poor match, being Charles VII's niece only through marriage, and was otherwise related to him by blood only distantly. Her marriage also came without a [[dowry]], as Margaret was the daughter of the impoverished Duke [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], and Henry was also expected to pay for the wedding. Henry believed the treaty was a first step towards a lasting peace, while Charles intended to use it purely for military advantage. The truce collapsed in 1449 and England quickly lost what remained of its French lands, bringing the Hundred Years' War to an end.\n\nThe failure of the treaty of Tours and the renewal of hostilities brought down the English government of the day. Its consequences exacerbated rifts between the court's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] faction and the dukes of [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]] and [[Richard, Duke of York|York]], and has been considered a potentially contributory factor to the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\n==Context==\nIn 1444, the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453) had now raged for more than a century between the houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]], who fought for control of the throne of France. The French under King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] had gained ground dramatically after the intervention of [[Joan of Arc]] in 1429 and the dissolution of the alliance between England and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], a French [[vassal]], in 1435.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=90}} The English king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], who came of age in 1437, was an incompetent ruler and war leader.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=151}} The French held the initiative, and, by 1444, [[Dual monarchy of England and France|English rule in France]] was limited to [[Normandy]] in the north and a strip of land in [[Gascony]] in the southwest, while Charles VII ruled over [[Paris]] and the rest of France with the support of most of the French regional nobility.\n\nThe English territories in France could not withstand more taxation, whereas the English state was nearing bankruptcy. The English political establishment believed that an agreement would have to be reached with the French and that concessions would have to be made, with the expection of the king's uncle, [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] \u2013 then the [[List of heirs to the English throne|heir to the throne]] \u2013 who advocated for continued military presence in France to preserve England's possessions there.{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=120}} A truce would provide the English a much needed break from hostilities. For the French, it would give them time to strengthen their armies in preparation for a possible resumption of the war, and prevent any hypothetical renewal of the Anglo-Burgundian alliance.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=300}}\n\n==Treaty==\nIt is unclear which side had the initiative to propose discussions, but by January 1444 the English council decided to open talks with the French.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=301}} In 1444, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], and Duke [[Philip the Good|Philip of Burgundy]] reached an agreement that their commissioners should meet at Tours to discuss peace terms and a possible marriage alliance between England and France.{{sfn|Weir|1995|pp=108\u2013109}} The English embassy was headed by [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk]], who on 1 February was dispatched to France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=301}} The French delegation was led by [[Jean de Dunois]]. In March 1444, Suffolk landed in France and in April, he met with the French embassy.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}}\n\nThe English offered to drop Henry VI's claim to French throne in exchange for Normandy without French suzerainty,{{sfn|Allmand|2001|p=35}} but this was rejected. The English in turn rejected French demands that landowners who fled the English occupation be restored to their possessions.{{sfn|Allmand|2001|p=35}} Negotiations bogged down, the French refusing any significant concessions.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=301}} Suffolk formally requested the hand of [[Margaret of Anjou]], daughter of [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]] (brother in law to Charles VII) as a wife for Henry.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} Rene agreed, but insisted that he had no money and could not provide the customary dowry,{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} when the amount that should have been given was 20,000 [[Livre tournois|livre]]s. He demanded that in exchange for the marriage and a proposed 21-month truce in the War, England return to France the lands of Maine and Anjou.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} Suffolk knew that this would not be popular in England, but Henry insisted on the truce, having heard that the [[Charles I, Count of Nevers|Count of Nevers]] was preparing to offer marriage to Margaret himself.{{sfn|Weir|1995|p=109}} The marriage was not considered advantageous to England since Margaret was not a close relation to Charles VII, and was related only through the marriage of her father to the King\u2019s sister.\n\nThe English had optimistically thought that a marriage alliance would turn Ren\u00e9 of Anjou into a major advocate for peace at his brother-in-law's court.{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=292 n. 1}} For Charles VII however, a marriage between his niece and the English King would prevent the English from concluding a marriage alliance with one of his more rebellious nobles, the [[John IV, Count of Armagnac|Count of Armagnac]] having already made proposals previously.{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=117}} An alliance with the impoverished house of Anjou was less beneficial to the English than one with the [[house of Armagnac]].{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=117}} Another factor cited as a diplomatic blunder was Suffolk's failure to include [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] in the list of Henry VI's allies on the truce, and allowing Charles VII to place Brittany in his own.{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=324}} All of the concessions in the treaty were made by England and France got the better end of the truce.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=176}} Henry believed it was a first step towards a lasting peace; Charles intended to use it purely for military advantage.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=183}}\n\nAdditionally, the blame of the unfavorable request to return Maine and Anjou to the French was laid at Suffolk\u2019s feet, though he insisted that he had made no promises at the Treaty to that demand.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=172}} Suffolk brought the new queen back to England later that year{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=486}} to meet the king.  When she landed in England, the King dressed himself as a squire and brought a letter supposed to be from the King so that he could watch Margaret in secret.  When Suffolk asked later what she thought of the squire, the queen stated that she did not notice him at all.  Suffolk told her that she had just been with the King, and she was upset, realizing she\u2019d kept him on his knees the entire time he read the letter.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=188}}\n\nThe Treaty of Tours was to expire in April 1446, and England sought to extend it in order to find a longer-lasting peace with France.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=490}} This was perhaps undermined by the fact that Henry VI refused to cede the lands of Maine and Anjou until 1448, and only then on threat of military force from Charles VII.\n\n==Aftermath in England==\nIn England, the cession of Maine was expected to garner opposition principally by two powerful men: the [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Earl of Somerset]], who was the greatest landowner in, and the governor of, Maine, and the Duke of Gloucester, who opposed territorial concessions to the French{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=343}} and whose opposition to the peace process was well known.{{sfn|Harriss|2004}} Although Gloucester congratulated the Duke of Suffolk in parliament in June 1445 for his role in the peace process, he soon after helped flare up tensions by sending (12 July) a gift to the [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King of Aragon]] \u2013 the archenemy of Henry VI's new father-in-law Ren\u00e9 of Anjou.{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=122}} Just a few days later (15 July), probably as a response for this, Suffolk and Henry VI humiliated Gloucester in front of French ambassadors,{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=121}} the latter signaling his disdain for his uncle's political inclinations and the former telling them (in the king's presence) later on that Gloucester counted for nothing on government policy.{{sfn|Harriss|2004}}{{sfn|Saygin|2001|p=125}}{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=334}} The possibility that Gloucester could serve as a figurehead for embittered war veterans and other opponents of the regime led Suffolk to instigate his arrest on charges of treason in early 1447. The imprisoned duke died shortly afterwards, probably of a stroke, though there were rumors that he had been murdered.{{sfn|Harriss|2004}}\n\nThe Earl of Somerset was brought on board of the cessation of Maine by being offered the governorship of Normandy. However, it was already expected that the office would be held by the [[Richard, Duke of York|Duke of York]].{{sfn|Harriss|1988|pp=357\u2013358}}{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=343}} For the Duke of Suffolk, the easiest way to get York out of the way was to discredit him politically. In late 1446, a violent altercation in parliament between Suffolk's ally bishop [[Adam Moleyns]] and the Duke of York over allegations of the latter's misconduct as lieutenant-general discredited York politically and provided the justification for York's dismissal.{{sfn|Harriss|1988|pp=357\u2013358}}{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=291}}{{sfn|Barker|2009|p=343}} York was mollified by being appointed governor of Ireland. He was nonetheless enraged at his treatment, which alienated Suffolk's regime from a hitherto supporter.{{sfn|Harriss|1988|pp=357\u2013358}}{{sfn|Jones|1989|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nThe truce of Tours collapsed in 1449 and the French then proceeded to conquer Normandy with ease.{{sfn|Allmand|2001|p=36}} The Duke of Suffolk, politically discredited over the failure of his signature achievement, was impeached and murdered in 1450. His demise paved the way for [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Somerset]] to replace him as the court [[favourite]].{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=286}} In the following years York, slighted over his previous treatment and seeing the collapse of English France under Somerset's tenure as damaging to his honor,{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=306\u2013307}} would tirelessly lobby for Somerset's removal from power, accusing him of incompetence and embezzlement.{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=285}} Their feud was a crucial factor in the escalation of tensions that led to the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=306\u2013307}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |last=Allmand |year=2001 |first=C.T. |title=The Hundred Years War: England and France at War, c.1300\u2013c.1450 |edition=revised |publisher=Cambridge University Press |origyear=1988 |isbn=0-521-31923-4 |url={{googlebooks|Igb2Q2WKYQcC|plainurl=y}} |authorlink=Christopher Allmand |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barker |year=2009 |first=Juliet |title=Conquest: The English Kingdom of France |publisher=Little, Brown |place=London<!-- |publicationdate=2009-10-15--> |isbn=978-1-4087-0083-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/conquestenglishk0000bark |url-status=live |authorlink=Juliet Barker |ref=harv |url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite book | last=Griffiths |date=1981 |first=R.A. |title=The Reign of King Henry VI: The exercise of royal authority, 1422\u20131461 |url={{google books|frWDmbf_mXEC|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=University of California Press |place=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |isbn=978-0-520-04372-5 |authorlink=Ralph A.

He served as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]] from 1793 to 1801.\n\n==Life==\nWedderburn  was the eldest son of [[Peter Wedderburn, Lord Chesterhall]] (a [[lord of session]]), and was born in [[East Lothian]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe received his basic education at [[Dalkeith]] and at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], [[Edinburgh]], and matriculated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] aged 14. Though he wanted to practise at the [[English bar]], in deference to his father's wishes he qualified as an [[advocate]] at [[Edinburgh]], in 1754.  His father was called to the bench in 1755, and for the next three years Wedderburn stuck to his practice in Edinburgh, when he employed his oratorical powers in the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], and passed his evenings in social and argumentative clubs.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1755 the precursor of the later [[Edinburgh Review]] was started, and Wedderburn edited two of its issues. The dean of faculty at this time, Lockhart, afterwards Lord Covington, a lawyer notorious for his harsh demeanour, in the autumn of 1757 assailed Wedderburn with more than ordinary insolence. Wedderburn retorted with extraordinary powers of invective, and, on being rebuked by the bench, declined to retract or apologize.  Instead, he left the court forever.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Legal career==\nWedderburn was called to the English bar at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1757. To shake off his Scottish accent and to improve his oratory, he engaged the services of [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]] and [[Charles Macklin]]. He studied the forms of English law in order to secure business and to conduct his cases with adequate knowledge.  He solicited [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]], a printer, to get him employed in city causes, and he entered into social intercourse with busy London solicitors. His local connections and the incidents of his previous career brought him to the notice of his countrymen Lord Bute and Lord Mansfield.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nWhen [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]] was prime minister, Wedderburn used to go on errands for him, and it is to Wedderburn's credit that he first suggested to the premier the propriety of granting [[Samuel Johnson]] a pension.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThrough the favor of Lord Bute, he was returned to parliament for the [[Ayr Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayr Burghs]] in 1761. In 1763 he became king's counsel and bencher of [[Lincoln's Inn]], and for a short time went the northern circuits, but was more successful in obtaining business in the [[Court of Chancery]]. In 1767, he married Betty Anne Dawson, only child and heiress of John Dawson of [[Marly, Yorkshire|Marly]], [[Yorkshire]] who brought him considerable wealth in addition to his own.

At the dissolution in the spring of 1768 he was returned by Sir Lawrence Dundas for [[Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond]] as a Tory, but in the questions that arose over [[John Wilkes]] he took the popular side of Wilkes and liberty, and resigned his seat in May 1769. In the opinion of the people he was now regarded as the embodiment of all legal virtue; his health was toasted at the dinners of the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] amid rounds of applause, and, in recompense for the loss of his seat in parliament, he was returned by Lord Clive for his pocket-borough of [[Bishop's Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop's Castle]], in Shropshire, in January 1770.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nDuring the next session he acted vigorously in opposition, but his conduct was always viewed with distrust by his new associates, and his attacks on the ministry of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] grew less and less animated in proportion to its apparent fixity of tenure. In January 1771 he was offered and accepted the post of [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|solicitor-general]]. The high road to the woolsack was now open, but his defection from his former path has stamped his character with general infamy. [[Junius]] wrote of him, \"As for Mr Wedderburn, there is something about him which even treachery cannot trust,\" and Colonel Barr attacked him in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

In June 1778 Wedderburn was promoted to the post of attorney-general, and in the same year he refused the dignity of chief baron of the exchequer because the offer was not accompanied by the promise of a [[peerage]]. At the dissolution in 1774 he had been returned for [[Okehampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Okehampton]] in [[Devon]], and for [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]] in [[Norfolk]], and selected the former constituency; on his promotion as leading law officer of the crown he returned to Bishops Castle. The coveted peerage was not long delayed.

For some time after that ministry's fall he was considered the leader of the Whig party in the [[House of Lords]], and, had the illness of the [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] brought about the return of the Whigs to power, the great seal would have been placed in his hands. The king's restoration to health secured [[William Pitt The Younger]]'s continuance in office, and disappointed the Whigs. In 1792, during the period of the [[French Revolution]], Lord Loughborough seceded from Fox, and on 28 January 1793 he received the great seal in the Tory cabinet of Pitt. The resignation of Pitt on the question of [[Catholic]] emancipation (1801) put an end to Wedderburn's tenure of the Lord Chancellorship, for, much to his surprise, no place was found for him in [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]]'s cabinet.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nPitt's friends believed he had been guilty of treachery over the Emancipation issue; and even the King, who used Loughborough as a spy in Cabinet, later commented that his death removed \"the greatest knave in the Kingdom\".\n\nHis first wife died childless in 1781, and the following year he married Charlotte, youngest daughter of William, Viscount Courtenay; but her only son died in childhood. Lord Loughborough accordingly obtained in 1795 a re-grant of his barony with remainder to his nephew, [[James St Clair-Erskine, 2nd Earl of Rosslyn|Sir James St Clair Erskine]]. The end of his tenure as Lord Chancellor in 1801 was softened by the grant of an earldom (he was created Earl of Rosslyn on 21 April 1801, also with remainder to his nephew), and by a pension of \u00a34000 per annum.

He served as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]] from 1793 to 1801.\n\n==Life==\nWedderburn  was the eldest son of [[Peter Wedderburn, Lord Chesterhall]] (a [[lord of session]]), and was born in [[East Lothian]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe received his basic education at [[Dalkeith]] and at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], [[Edinburgh]], and matriculated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] aged 14. Though he wanted to practise at the [[English bar]], in deference to his father's wishes he qualified as an [[advocate]] at [[Edinburgh]], in 1754.  His father was called to the bench in 1755, and for the next three years Wedderburn stuck to his practice in Edinburgh, when he employed his oratorical powers in the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], and passed his evenings in social and argumentative clubs.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1755 the precursor of the later [[Edinburgh Review]] was started, and Wedderburn edited two of its issues. The dean of faculty at this time, Lockhart, afterwards Lord Covington, a lawyer notorious for his harsh demeanour, in the autumn of 1757 assailed Wedderburn with more than ordinary insolence. Wedderburn retorted with extraordinary powers of invective, and, on being rebuked by the bench, declined to retract or apologize.  Instead, he left the court forever.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Legal career==\nWedderburn was called to the English bar at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1757. To shake off his Scottish accent and to improve his oratory, he engaged the services of [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]] and [[Charles Macklin]]. He studied the forms of English law in order to secure business and to conduct his cases with adequate knowledge.  He solicited [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]], a printer, to get him employed in city causes, and he entered into social intercourse with busy London solicitors. His local connections and the incidents of his previous career brought him to the notice of his countrymen Lord Bute and Lord Mansfield.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nWhen [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]] was prime minister, Wedderburn used to go on errands for him, and it is to Wedderburn's credit that he first suggested to the premier the propriety of granting [[Samuel Johnson]] a pension.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThrough the favor of Lord Bute, he was returned to parliament for the [[Ayr Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayr Burghs]] in 1761. In 1763 he became king's counsel and bencher of [[Lincoln's Inn]], and for a short time went the northern circuits, but was more successful in obtaining business in the [[Court of Chancery]]. In 1767, he married Betty Anne Dawson, only child and heiress of John Dawson of [[Marly, Yorkshire|Marly]], [[Yorkshire]] who brought him considerable wealth in addition to his own.

on the south of the [[East European Plain]]. It originates in the [[Central Russian Upland]], north of [[Belgorod]], flows south-east through [[Ukraine]] ([[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]], [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]]s) and then again through [[Russia]] ([[Rostov Oblast]]) to join the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Sea of Azov]]. The Donets is the [[List of rivers of Ukraine|fourth longest river]] in Ukraine and the biggest in the [[Eastern Ukraine]]. It is an important source of fresh water in the east of the country. It gives its name to the [[Donets Basin]], known commonly as the Donbass, an important coal mining region in Ukraine.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Don'' and its diminutive, ''Donets'' are derived from [[Iranic]], [[Sarmatian language|Sarmatian]] {{lang|xsc-Latn|D\u0101nu}} \"the river\".<ref name=\"Mallory, J.P 2000. p. 106\">Mallory, J.P. and Victor H.

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Ritter's character, Paul Hennessy, was said to have died after collapsing in a grocery store while buying milk. ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal. The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul's death. New male characters, played by [[James Garner]] and [[David Spade]], were later added to the main cast as Ritter's replacements. Shortly before his death, Ritter had done a week-long taping with ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', which was aired as a tribute to him, introduced by [[Henry Winkler]], the executive producer of the show and very close friend of Ritter's.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He was responsible for commissioning the ''[[Charlotte Dundas]]'', the world's \"first practical [[steamboat]]\".\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Marske Cheshire Home 1 by Francis Hannaway.jpg|thumb|Marske Hall]]\n[[File:Aske Hall Yorkshire Morris edited.jpg|thumb|Aske Hall c.1880]]\nDundas was the only son of [[Sir Lawrence Dundas, 1st Baronet]], the \"Nabob of the North\".  Following education at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[St. Andrews University]] he did the [[Grand Tour]], then became Member of Parliament for [[Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond]], 1763&ndash;1768, then for [[Stirlingshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirlingshire]], 1768&ndash;1794. He was elevated to the [[peerage]] as Baron Dundas of [[Aske Hall|Aske]] in August 1794, and was also [[Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland|Lord Lieutenant]] and Vice Admiral of Orkney and Shetland, Councillor of state to the Prince of Wales (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]), President of the [[Society of Scottish Antiquaries]] and Colonel of the North York Militia. He acquired [[Marske Hall]] in North Yorkshire in 1762 after the death of [[Sir William Lowther, 3rd Baronet]]. He succeeded his father as 2nd Baronet in 1781, inheriting [[Aske Hall]], also in North Yorkshire.\n\n==''Charlotte Dundas''==\nDundas followed his father in having an interest in [[Grangemouth]] and in the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]], under construction from 1768 to 1790, and he would have been aware of the 1789 trials on the canal of [[Patrick Miller of Dalswinton]]'s [[double-hull]]ed [[Paddle steamer|paddle boat]] powered with a steam engine fitted by [[William Symington]]. In 1800 Dundas, as Governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, engaged Symington to design a steam tug on the lines of a failed attempt by Captain [[John Schank]] for the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. At a meeting of the canal company's directors on 5 June 1800 Dundas \"produced a model of a boat by Captain Schank to be worked by a steam engine by Mr Symington\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} and it was agreed this should be immediately put in hand.\n\nThe boat was built to Symington's design. It had successful trials on the [[River Carron (Forth)|River Carron]] in June 1801 and further trials towing [[sloop]]s from the [[river Forth]] up the Carron and thence along the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]]. The other proprietors of the canal were concerned about wave damage to the canal banks, and the Committee decided that the boat would \"by no means answer the purpose\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nSymington had proposals for an improved boat which were presented in the form of a model, shown to Lord Dundas, of the boat which would become famous as the ''[[Charlotte Dundas]]'', named in honour of one of his Lordship's daughters. One account states that Lord Dundas had advised Symington to prepare the model and bring it to his Lordship in [[London]], where Symington was introduced to the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater]] who was enthusiastic enough to immediately order eight boats of similar construction for his canal. Unfortunately the Duke of Bridgewater died a few days before the first sailing, and nothing came of this order.\n\nLord Dundas and some of his relatives and friends were on board for the first sailing of the boat on the canal in 1803, but despite the success of the ''Charlotte Dundas'' fears of erosion of the banks prevailed, and the trials were ended leaving Symington [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]].\n\n==Family==\nSir Thomas Dundas, 2nd Baronet married Lady Charlotte FitzWilliam, the daughter of [[William FitzWilliam, 3rd Earl FitzWilliam]], on 24 May 1764 and they had 14 children:\n\n* [[Lawrence Dundas, 1st Earl of Zetland]] (1766&ndash;1839)\n* Anne Dundas (1767)\n* Thomas Dundas (born 1768; died young)\n* Lt-Col. the Hon.
