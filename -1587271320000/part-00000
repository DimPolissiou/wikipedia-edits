Part of the [[1999 Pacific hurricane season|annual hurricane season]], Greg originated from a [[tropical wave]] that departed Africa in mid-August. The wave entered the eastern Pacific by September&nbsp;1, steadily organizing over subsequent days to become a tropical depression on September&nbsp;5. Amid a favorable environment, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Greg a few hours after formation and further organized into a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale|Category 1 hurricane]] on September&nbsp;6. Greg paralleled the southwestern coastline of Mexico, where it destroyed over 250 homes, cut-off roads, killed 10 people, and left at least 4,000 more injured. The storm weakened to tropical storm intensity as it moved ashore [[Baja California Sur]], although rain was generally beneficial there. Succumbing to cooler waters and high [[wind shear]], Greg ultimately dissipated over the Pacific on September&nbsp;9. Its remnants led to thunderstorms across northern [[California]], with only minor impacts.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Greg 1999 track.png}}\nIn mid-August, a [[tropical wave]] emerged off the western coast of Africa. The northern portion of the wave led to the formation of [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Emily|Tropical Storm Emily]] in the Atlantic, while the southern portion of the wave continued westward. It crossed [[Central America]] on August&nbsp;31 and September&nbsp;1, characterized by a large area of [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] and a mid-level [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]]. The disturbance traversed southern Mexico before emerging offshore, where it began to interact with a broad [[Low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] that existed in the eastern Pacific for several days prior. Shower and thunderstorm activity became concentrated about a well-defined center, leading to the formation of a tropical depression near [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo, Mexico]] by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;5. A portion of the tropical wave also combined with monsoonal-like flow across the [[Bay of Campeche]] to form [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Depression Seven|Tropical Depression Seven]] in the [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic]].<ref name=\"Gtcr\">{{cite report|author=Lixion A.

On September&nbsp;6, a tropical storm warning was issued for locations south of [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] on the east coast of Baja California, while a tropical storm watch was hoisted for areas south of [[Punta Abreojos]] on the west coast. A tropical storm warning was then issued for the west coast of Baja California south of [[Cabo San L\u00e1zaro]]. As Greg intensified, a hurricane warning was raised from Arroyo Seco southward, and for the east coast of Baja California from La Paz southward. A tropical storm watch was raised from north of La Paz to [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]]. Late on September&nbsp;7, the hurricane warning was reduced to a tropical storm warning as Greg weakened.
