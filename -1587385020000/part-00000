Bertram goes to Paris to replace his late father as attendant to the ailing King of France. Helena, the daughter of a recently deceased [[physician]], follows Bertram, ostensibly to offer the King her services as a healer. The King is sceptical, and she guarantees the cure with her life: if he dies, she will be put to death, but if he lives, she may choose a [[husband]] from the court.\n\nThe King is cured and Helena chooses Bertram, who rejects her, owing to her poverty and low status. The King forces him to marry her, but after the ceremony Bertram immediately goes to war in Italy without so much as a goodbye kiss. He says that he will only marry her after she has borne his child and wears his family ring. Helena returns home to the countess, who is horrified at what her son has done, and claims Helena as her child in Bertram's place.\n\nIn Italy, Bertram is a successful warrior and also a successful seducer of local virgins. Helena follows him to Italy, befriends Diana, a virgin with whom Bertram is infatuated, and they arrange for Helena to take Diana's place in bed. Diana obtains Bertram's ring in exchange for one of Helena's. In this way Helena, without Bertram's knowledge, consummates their marriage and wears his ring.\n\nHelena fakes her own death. Bertram, thinking he is free of her, comes home. He tries to marry a local lord's daughter, but Diana shows up and breaks up the engagement. Helena appears and explains the ring swap, announcing that she has fulfilled Bertram's challenge; Bertram, impressed by all she has done to win him, swears his love to her. Thus all ends well.\n\nThere is a subplot about Parolles\u2014a disloyal associate of Bertram's: Some of the lords at the court attempt to get Bertram to know that his friend Parolles is a boasting [[coward]]\u2014as Lafew and the Countess have also said. They convince Parolles to cross into enemy territory to fetch a drum that he left behind. While on his way, they pose as enemy soldiers, kidnap him, blindfold him, and, with Bertram observing, get him to betray his friends, and besmirch Bertram's character.\n\n[[File:All's Well That Ends Well Act V Scene iii.jpg|thumb|A 1794 print of the final scene]]\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Decameron Title Page.jpg|thumb|A copy of Boccaccio's ''The decameron containing an hundred pleasant nouels.

Shakespeare may have read an English translation of the tale in [[William Painter (author)|William Painter]]'s ''Palace of Pleasure''.<ref>[[F. E.

Helena's love for the seemingly unlovable Bertram is difficult to explain on the page, but in performance it can be made acceptable by casting an actor of obvious physical attraction or by playing him as a [[naive]] and innocent figure not yet ready for love although, as both Helena and the audience can see, capable of emotional growth.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCandless|first=David |title=Gender and performance in Shakespeare's problem comedies|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|date=1997|pages=57\u201359|chapter=All's Well That Ends Well|isbn=0-253-33306-7}}</ref> This latter interpretation also assists at the point in the final scene in which Bertram suddenly switches from hatred to love in just one line. This is considered a particular problem for actors trained to admire psychological realism. However, some alternative readings emphasise the \"if\" in his equivocal promise: \"If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\" Here, there has been no change of heart at all.<ref name=dickson>{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Andrew|title=The Rough Guide to Shakespeare|publisher=Penguin|location=London|date=2008|pages=3\u201311|chapter=All's Well That Ends Well|isbn=978-1-85828-443-9}}</ref> Productions like the National Theatre's 2009 run, have Bertram make his promise seemingly normally, but then end the play hand-in-hand with Helena, staring out at the audience with a look of \"aghast bewilderment\" suggesting he only relented to save face in front of the King.<ref>{{cite news|last=Billington|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Billington (critic)|title=Theatre review: All's Well That Ends Well / Olivier, London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/29/theatre|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2009}}</ref> A 2018 interpretation from director [[Caroline Byrne (stage director)|Caroline Byrne]] at the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]], London, effects Bertram's reconciliation with Helena by having him make good his vow (Act 2 Scene 2) of only taking her as his wife when she bears his child; as well as Bertram's ring, Helena brings their infant child to their final confrontation before the king.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Paul|title=All's Well That Ends Well, review: Eye-opening and vividly alive|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/alls-well-that-ends-well-sam-wanamaker-playhouse-review-a8165611.html|website=[[The Independent]]|date=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany critics consider that the truncated ending is a drawback, with Bertram's conversion so sudden. Various explanations have been given for this. There is (as always) possibly missing text. Some suggest that Bertram's conversion is meant to be sudden and magical in keeping with the 'clever [[wench]] performing tasks to win an unwilling higher born husband' theme of the play.<ref>W. W. Lawrence, ''Shakespeare's Problem Comedies'' 1931.</ref> Some consider that Bertram is not meant to be contemptible, merely a callow youth learning valuable lessons about values.<ref>J. G. Styan ''Shakespeare in Performance'' 1984; Francis G Schoff ''Claudio, Bertram and a Note on Inerpretation'', 1959</ref> Contemporary audiences would readily have recognised Bertram's enforced marriage as a metaphor for the new requirement (1606), directed at followers of the Catholic religion, to swear an [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)#To James I|Oath of Allegiance]] to Protestant [[James I of England|King James]], suggests academic Andrew Hadfield of the [[University of Sussex]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hadfield|first1=Andrew|title=Bad Faith|journal=Globe|date=August 2017|pages=48\u201353|issn=2398-9483}}</ref>\n\nMany directors have taken the view that when Shakespeare wrote a comedy, he did intend there to be a [[happy ending]], and accordingly that is the way the concluding scene should be staged. [[Elijah Moshinsky]] in his acclaimed [[BBC]] version in 1981 had his Bertram ([[Ian Charleson]]) give Helena a tender kiss and speak wonderingly. Despite his outrageous actions, Bertram can come across as beguiling; the filming of the 1967 [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] performance with [[Ian Richardson]] as Bertram has been lost, but by various accounts (''The New Cambridge Shakespeare'', 2003 etc.) he managed to make Bertram sympathetic, even charming. Ian Charleson's Bertram was cold and egotistical but still attractive.\n\nOne character that has been admired is that of the old Countess of Roussillon, which [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] thought \"the most beautiful old woman's part ever written\".<ref name=dickson /> Modern productions are often promoted as vehicles for great mature actresses; examples in recent decades have starred [[Judi Dench]] and [[Peggy Ashcroft]], who delivered a performance of \"entranc[ing]...worldly wisdom and compassion\" in [[Trevor Nunn]]'s sympathetic, \"[[Anton Chekhov|Chekhovian]]\" staging at [[Royal Shakespeare Company|Stratford]] in 1982.<ref name=dickson /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/14/features.review77|title=Judi...and the beast|last=Kellaway|first=Kate|date=14 December 2003|work=The Observer |location=UK|accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Billington|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Billington (critic)|title=One Night Stands: a Critic's View of Modern British Theatre|publisher=[[Nick Hern Books]]|location=London|date=2001|edition=2|pages=174\u2013176|isbn=1-85459-660-8}}</ref> In the [[BBC Television Shakespeare]] production she was played by [[Celia Johnson]], dressed and posed as [[Rembrandt]]'s portrait of Margaretha de Geer.\n\nIt has recently been argued that [[Thomas Middleton]] either collaborated with Shakespeare on the play, or revised it at a later time.<ref name=\"maguire\"/><ref>Taylor, Gary; Jowett, John; Bourus, Terri; Egan, Gabriel, eds.

Bertram goes to Paris to replace his late father as attendant to the ailing King of France. Helena, the daughter of a recently deceased [[physician]], follows Bertram, ostensibly to offer the King her services as a healer. The King is sceptical, and she guarantees the cure with her life: if he dies, she will be put to death, but if he lives, she may choose a [[husband]] from the court.\n\nThe King is cured and Helena chooses Bertram, who rejects her, owing to her poverty and low status. The King forces him to marry her, but after the ceremony Bertram immediately goes to war in Italy without so much as a goodbye kiss. He says that he will only marry her after she has borne his child and wears his family ring. Helena returns home to the countess, who is horrified at what her son has done, and claims Helena as her child in Bertram's place.\n\nIn Italy, Bertram is a successful warrior and also a successful seducer of local virgins. Helena follows him to Italy, befriends Diana, a virgin with whom Bertram is infatuated, and they arrange for Helena to take Diana's place in bed. Diana obtains Bertram's ring in exchange for one of Helena's. In this way Helena, without Bertram's knowledge, consummates their marriage and wears his ring.\n\nHelena fakes her own death. Bertram, thinking he is free of her, comes home. He tries to marry a local lord's daughter, but Diana shows up and breaks up the engagement. Helena appears and explains the ring swap, announcing that she has fulfilled Bertram's challenge; Bertram, impressed by all she has done to win him, swears his love to her. Thus all ends well.\n\nThere is a subplot about Parolles\u2014a disloyal associate of Bertram's: Some of the lords at the court attempt to get Bertram to know that his friend Parolles is a boasting [[coward]]\u2014as Lafew and the Countess have also said. They convince Parolles to cross into enemy territory to fetch a drum that he left behind. While on his way, they pose as enemy soldiers, kidnap him, blindfold him, and, with Bertram observing, get him to betray his friends, and besmirch Bertram's character.\n\n[[File:All's Well That Ends Well Act V Scene iii.jpg|thumb|A 1794 print of the final scene]]\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Decameron Title Page.jpg|thumb|A copy of Boccaccio's ''The decameron containing an hundred pleasant nouels.

Helena's love for the seemingly unlovable Bertram is difficult to explain on the page, but in performance it can be made acceptable by casting an actor of obvious physical attraction or by playing him as a [[naive]] and innocent figure not yet ready for love although, as both Helena and the audience can see, capable of emotional growth.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCandless|first=David |title=Gender and performance in Shakespeare's problem comedies|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|date=1997|pages=57\u201359|chapter=All's Well That Ends Well|isbn=0-253-33306-7}}</ref> This latter interpretation also assists at the point in the final scene in which Bertram suddenly switches from hatred to love in just one line. This is considered a particular problem for actors trained to admire psychological realism.

Various explanations have been given for this. There is (as always) possibly missing text.

[[Elijah Moshinsky]] in his acclaimed [[BBC]] version in 1981 had his Bertram ([[Ian Charleson]]) give Helena a tender kiss and speak wonderingly. Despite his outrageous actions, Bertram can come across as beguiling; the filming of the 1967 [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] performance with [[Ian Richardson]] as Bertram has been lost, but by various accounts (''The New Cambridge Shakespeare'', 2003 etc.) he managed to make Bertram sympathetic, even charming.

Two [[species]] have been formally described; the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza zaza'') and [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli''). Like all other [[lemur]]s, they are native to [[Madagascar]], where they are found in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|western dry deciduous forests]] and further to the north in the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano Valley]] and [[Sahamalaza National Park|Sahamalaza Peninsula]]. First [[Species description|described]] in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with [[mouse lemur]]s and [[dwarf lemur]]s. In 1870, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] assigned them to their own genus, ''Mirza''. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within [[Cheirogaleidae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of small, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, [[Natural gum|tree gum]], insects, and small [[vertebrate]]s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of [[torpor]] during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form [[pair bond]]s. The northern species also has the largest [[testicle]] size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of [[Seasonal breeder|seasonally]]. [[Home range]]s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males [[Biological dispersal|disperse]]. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]].\n\nPredators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Madagascar buzzard]], [[Madagascar owl]], [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]]. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day [[gestation]]. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under [[CITES|CITES Appendix I]], which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The [[Duke Lemur Center]] coordinated the [[captive breeding]] of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62&nbsp;individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Mirza coquereli 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Artistic illustration of a giant mouse lemur climbing on a branch|The giant mouse lemur described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen|Pollen]] in 1868 (illustrated above) was considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the species described by [[Alfred Grandidier|Grandidier]] (1867), but was shown to be a distinct species in 2005.]]\nThe first species of giant mouse lemur was [[Species description|described]] by the French naturalist [[Alfred Grandidier]] in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near [[Morondava]] in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] was selected in 1939 as MNHN&nbsp;1867\u2013603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist [[Charles Coquerel]],{{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Grandidier placed [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;coquereli'') with the [[dwarf lemur]]s in the [[genus]] ''Cheirogaleus'' (which he spelled ''Cheirogalus'') as ''C.&nbsp;coquereli''. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner''), which he considered to also be members of ''Cheirogaleus''. The following year, the German naturalist [[Hermann Schlegel]] and Dutch naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen]] independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, ''coquereli'', basing theirs on an individual from around the [[Bay of Ampasindava]] in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s); however, these authors also listed all ''Cheirogaleus'' under ''Microcebus'' and based the classification of their species on similarities with the [[greater dwarf lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;typicus'', now ''C.&nbsp;major'').{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1870, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, ''Mirza''. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], [[Guillaume Grandidier]], and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=325}} British anatomist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to ''Cheirogaleus''), its first upper [[premolar]] was proportionally small as in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=333}} In 1977, French zoologist [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] also favored the ''Microcebus'' classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}\n\nThe genus ''Mirza'' was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]]{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} to represent an intermediate branch between ''Microcebus'' and ''Cheirogaleus'',{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}} citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest ''Microcebus'' and [[Animal locomotion|locomotor behavior]] more closely aligned with ''Cheirogaleus''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Adoption of ''Mirza'' was slow,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'' by [[Conservation International]].{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}{{LoM1 Sfn|p=80}} In 1993, primatologist [[Colin Groves]] initially favored the ''Microcebus'' classification in the second edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'',{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but began supporting the resurrection of ''Mirza'' in 2001.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=70\u201371}} In 1991, prior to adopting ''Mirza'', Groves was the first to use the [[common name]] \"giant mouse lemur\".

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (''sic''), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus'').

Prior to that, both species had been listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Populations of both species are in decline due to [[habitat destruction]], primarily for [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and [[charcoal]] production. Also, they are both hunted for [[bushmeat]].{{R|IUCN_Mirza_coquereli|IUCN_Mirza_zaza}} The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive population (45 of 62&nbsp;individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a [[captive breeding]] program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} from the region around Ambanja.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} As of 2009 the [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} in 2015 only a single female remained on record.{{R|ISIS_Mirza_2015}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"WWF_25Mar2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |title=New population of rare giant-mouse lemurs found in Madagascar |date=25 March 2010 |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] |accessdate=1 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101100750/http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC_03Jul2015\">{{cite news |last=Walker |first=M. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Lemur found with giant testicles |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZphzXWDh?url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |archive-date=2015-07-07 |access-date=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_coquereli\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13584/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza coquereli'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_zaza\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136684/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza zaza'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ISIS_Mirza_2015\">{{cite report |title=Species holding report for: ''Mirza'' / Mouse lemur |year=2015 |publisher=[[International Species Information System]] (ISIS)}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CITES\">{{cite web |url=http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Mirza |title=Checklist of CITES Species |website=CITES |publisher=UNEP-WCMC |accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Literature cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009}} -->{{cite book |last1=Beolens |first1=B. |last2=Watkins |first2=M. |last3=Grayson |first3=M. |title=The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC |isbn=978-0-8018-9304-9 |oclc=270129903 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012}} -->{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=A.R. |last2=Zijlstra |first2=J.S. |last3=Groves |first3=C.P. |authorlink3=Colin Groves |title=Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 |url=http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf |journal=[[Lemur News]] |volume=16 |year=2012 |issn=1608-1439 |pages=64\u201370 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Fleagle|2013}} -->{{cite book |last1=Fleagle |first1=J.G. |authorlink1=John G.

Two [[species]] have been formally described; the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza zaza'') and [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli''). Like all other [[lemur]]s, they are native to [[Madagascar]], where they are found in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|western dry deciduous forests]] and further to the north in the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano Valley]] and [[Sahamalaza National Park|Sahamalaza Peninsula]]. First [[Species description|described]] in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with [[mouse lemur]]s and [[dwarf lemur]]s. In 1870, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] assigned them to their own genus, ''Mirza''. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within [[Cheirogaleidae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of small, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, [[Natural gum|tree gum]], insects, and small [[vertebrate]]s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of [[torpor]] during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form [[pair bond]]s. The northern species also has the largest [[testicle]] size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of [[Seasonal breeder|seasonally]]. [[Home range]]s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males [[Biological dispersal|disperse]]. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]].\n\nPredators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Madagascar buzzard]], [[Madagascar owl]], [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]]. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day [[gestation]]. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under [[CITES|CITES Appendix I]], which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The [[Duke Lemur Center]] coordinated the [[captive breeding]] of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62&nbsp;individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Mirza coquereli 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Artistic illustration of a giant mouse lemur climbing on a branch|The giant mouse lemur described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen|Pollen]] in 1868 (illustrated above) was considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the species described by [[Alfred Grandidier|Grandidier]] (1867), but was shown to be a distinct species in 2005.]]\nThe first species of giant mouse lemur was [[Species description|described]] by the French naturalist [[Alfred Grandidier]] in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near [[Morondava]] in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] was selected in 1939 as MNHN&nbsp;1867\u2013603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist [[Charles Coquerel]],{{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Grandidier placed [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;coquereli'') with the [[dwarf lemur]]s in the [[genus]] ''Cheirogaleus'' (which he spelled ''Cheirogalus'') as ''C.&nbsp;coquereli''. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner''), which he considered to also be members of ''Cheirogaleus''. The following year, the German naturalist [[Hermann Schlegel]] and Dutch naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen]] independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, ''coquereli'', basing theirs on an individual from around the [[Bay of Ampasindava]] in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s); however, these authors also listed all ''Cheirogaleus'' under ''Microcebus'' and based the classification of their species on similarities with the [[greater dwarf lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;typicus'', now ''C.&nbsp;major'').{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1870, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, ''Mirza''. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], [[Guillaume Grandidier]], and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=325}} British anatomist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to ''Cheirogaleus''), its first upper [[premolar]] was proportionally small as in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=333}} In 1977, French zoologist [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] also favored the ''Microcebus'' classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}\n\nThe genus ''Mirza'' was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]]{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} to represent an intermediate branch between ''Microcebus'' and ''Cheirogaleus'',{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}} citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest ''Microcebus'' and [[Animal locomotion|locomotor behavior]] more closely aligned with ''Cheirogaleus''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Adoption of ''Mirza'' was slow,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'' by [[Conservation International]].{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}{{LoM1 Sfn|p=80}} In 1993, primatologist [[Colin Groves]] initially favored the ''Microcebus'' classification in the second edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'',{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but began supporting the resurrection of ''Mirza'' in 2001.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=70\u201371}} In 1991, prior to adopting ''Mirza'', Groves was the first to use the [[common name]] \"giant mouse lemur\".

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus'').

Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs, giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}}\n\n===Social structure===\nBoth species usually are solitary foragers,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=170}} although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social, possibly due to its higher population density.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=170\u2013171}} whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}} Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to [[Telemetry|radio-tracking]] and direct observations at [[Analabe]] near Kirindy, they form [[pair bond]]s,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other [[agonistic behavior]], and only rarely [[social grooming]].{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations, the most common of which are contact calls, which sound like \"hum\" or a \"hein\" and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals. A \"mother-infant meeting call\" used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like \"pfiou\" and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a \"croak\", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated \"tisk-tisk-tisk\" sounds.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=108}} Females exhibit a \"waking call sequence\",{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} sometimes referred to as \"loud calls\", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter \"hon\" calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} A long \"sexual call sequence\" consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse \"brroak\" calls is used by both sexes during [[Estrous cycle|estrus]].{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]] on small branches and other objects.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Taking measurements of a male Mirza zaza.JPG|thumb|right|Measurements are taken on a northern giant mouse lemur of its testicle size, which relative to its body size is the largest among living primates.|alt=Male northern giant mouse lemur being held while calipers are used to measure its testicle size.]]\nReproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} the estrous cycle runs approximately 22&nbsp;days, while estrus lasts only a day or less.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the [[aye-aye]] (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'') and the [[red-bellied lemur]] (''Eulemur rubriventer'').{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed,{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}}\n\nOne to three offspring (typically two) are born after 90&nbsp;days of [[gestation]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} weighing approximately {{convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Because they are poorly developed, they initially remain in their mother's nest for up to three weeks, being transported by mouth between nests.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} Once they have grown sufficiently, typically after three weeks, the mother will park her offspring in vegetation while she forages nearby.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} After a month, the young begin to participate in social play and grooming with their mother, and between the first and second month, young males begin to exhibit early sexual behaviors (including mounting, neck biting, and pelvic thrusting).{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} By the third month, the young forage independently, though they maintain vocal contact with their mother{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} and use a small part of her range.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}}\n\nFemales start reproducing after ten months, while males develop functional testicles by their second mating season.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Testicle size in the northern giant mouse lemur does not appear to fluctuate by season,{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} and is so large relative to the animal's body mass that it is the highest among all [[primate]]s.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} This emphasis on sperm production in males, as well as the use of [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], suggests a mating system best described as [[Polygynandry|polygynandrous]]{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} where males use [[scramble competition]] (roaming widely to find many females).{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} In contrast, male Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs appear to fight for access to females (contest competition) during their breeding season.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} Males disperse from their natal range, and the age at which they leave varies from two years to several. Females reproduce every year, although postpartum estrus has been observed in captivity. In the wild, the lifespan of giant mouse lemurs is thought to rarely exceed five or six years,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} though in captivity they can live up to 15&nbsp;years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Madagascar buzzard.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Madagascar buzzard sitting on a branch|The [[Madagascar buzzard]] preys on giant mouse lemurs.]]\nBoth species are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, [[Natural gum|tree gums]], large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} and eggs.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is thought to opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} after an individual was found with a half-eaten [[gray mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;murinus'') in a trap.{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|p=1222}} During June and July, at the peak of the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the [[larva]]e of [[hemiptera]]n and [[cochineal]] insects as well as tree gums.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on [[cashew]] fruits during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are often [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with mouse lemurs, such as ''M.&nbsp;murinus'', though they are typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} At the [[Marosalaza]] forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages [[niche differentiation]] by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=115}}\n\n[[Diurnality|Diurnal]] [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as the [[Madagascar buzzard]] (''Buteo brachypterus'') are their most significant predators. Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] (''Cryptoprocta ferox''), [[Madagascar owl]] (''Asio madagascariensis''), and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]] (''Mungotictis decemlineata'').{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|pp=1222\u20131223}}\n\n==Conservation==\nIn 2012, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) assessed both Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the northern giant mouse lemur as [[Endangered species|endangered]]. Prior to that, both species had been listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Populations of both species are in decline due to [[habitat destruction]], primarily for [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and [[charcoal]] production. Also, they are both hunted for [[bushmeat]].{{R|IUCN_Mirza_coquereli|IUCN_Mirza_zaza}} The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive population (45 of 62&nbsp;individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a [[captive breeding]] program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} from the region around Ambanja.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} As of 2009 the [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} in 2015 only a single female remained on record.{{R|ISIS_Mirza_2015}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"WWF_25Mar2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |title=New population of rare giant-mouse lemurs found in Madagascar |date=25 March 2010 |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] |accessdate=1 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101100750/http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC_03Jul2015\">{{cite news |last=Walker |first=M. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Lemur found with giant testicles |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZphzXWDh?url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |archive-date=2015-07-07 |access-date=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_coquereli\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13584/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza coquereli'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_zaza\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136684/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza zaza'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ISIS_Mirza_2015\">{{cite report |title=Species holding report for: ''Mirza'' / Mouse lemur |year=2015 |publisher=[[International Species Information System]] (ISIS)}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CITES\">{{cite web |url=http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Mirza |title=Checklist of CITES Species |website=CITES |publisher=UNEP-WCMC |accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Literature cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009}} -->{{cite book |last1=Beolens |first1=B. |last2=Watkins |first2=M. |last3=Grayson |first3=M. |title=The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC |isbn=978-0-8018-9304-9 |oclc=270129903 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012}} -->{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=A.R. |last2=Zijlstra |first2=J.S. |last3=Groves |first3=C.P. |authorlink3=Colin Groves |title=Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 |url=http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf |journal=[[Lemur News]] |volume=16 |year=2012 |issn=1608-1439 |pages=64\u201370 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Fleagle|2013}} -->{{cite book |last1=Fleagle |first1=J.G. |authorlink1=John G.

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).
