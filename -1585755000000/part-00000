All of them discuss how Tonya came to be in the figure skating world and what kind of reputation she earned during and after her career.\n\nAs a child, Tonya (here played by Mckenna Grace) is pushed by LaVona to join a figure skating class taught by Diane starting at the age of 4 due to Tonya's obsession with it. Although Diane says she doesn't teach beginners, she becomes convinced after seeing Tonya on the ice. However, LaVona is verbally and physically abusive toward her daughter, claiming that this is what pushed Tonya to be as great as she was. Tonya was closer to her father Al (Jason Davis), as he taught her to hunt, but Tonya was devastated when he left her and LaVona.\n\nTonya meets Jeff at the age of 15. They go on their first date with LaVona accompanying them. They fall in love, but Jeff proves to be just as abusive as LaVona, frequently striking Tonya on a whim. Still, Tonya decides to stay with him in the hopes that things will get better.\n\nIn 1986, Tonya competes at Skate America in Portland, ME. She puts on a strong performance but it annoyed that the judges do not present her with her scores.\n\nAt home, Tonya has dinner with LaVona. They argue about Jeff, which leads to a physical confrontation that ends with LaVona throwing a knife into Tonya's arm, leaving them both stunned and silent.\n\nJeff helps Tonya make her own outfit for her next competition, and she knows it's not nearly as flashy as the outfits the other skaters wear. During her next competition, Tonya once again becomes angry that the judges won't present her scores. She confronts the judges in front of the audience, to which one of the judges coldly tells her she might not be as good as she thinks and that she should pick a different sport. Tonya responds with, \"Suck my dick!\" She goes to the back where Diane meets her, and Tonya fires her, saying she's moving to another coach.\n\nTonya and Jeff eventually get married, which she acknowledges to have been a dumb thing she because she was young. LaVona shows up and naturally criticizes Tonya for marrying Jeff.\n\nAt the 1991 Nationals in Minneapolis, MN, Tonya steps out with her new coach, Dody Teachman (Bojana Novakovic). A heckler attempts to bring Tonya's spirit down, but Dody encourages her. We then see that LaVona paid the heckler to taunt Tonya to motivate her. Here, Tonya becomes the first American woman to successfully pull off a triple axel, to the astonishment of everyone watching. Tonya says this was the moment she knew she was the best figure skater in the world at one point in time, and it makes her emotional.\n\nBoth Tonya and Jeff claim that after the triple, everything changed for them. Jeff became even more abusive, and Tonya would maintain her focus on skating to the point that she leaves Jeff. She chimes in at one point to establish that she and Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) were friends and that they would hang out in between competitions.\n\nTonya reconciles with Jeff, but she feels that her skating got worse after this. She continuously stumbles on the ice, but Tonya perseveres and knows she can do better.\n\nAt the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France, Tonya places 4th behind Nancy after messing up most of her landings, which she blames on her skate blade being replaced poorly after it broke a few days earlier. Flashbacks indicate that her weight gain due to constant drinking was also a factor in her loss.\n\nTonya and Jeff's relationship gets so bad that Tonya starts to file restraining orders until she finally divorces him. Jeff is left alone and remorseful. He eventually finds Tonya in her new home and pulls out a gun, threatening to shoot either her or himself. She runs out of the house, and Jeff fires a shot that ricochets off his truck and hits Tonya above the eye. Jeff tries to drive her to the hospital, but they are pulled over by a cop, and the cop busts Jeff for carrying guns and open booze bottles, but he never notices the wound on Tonya's face.\n\nTonya starts working at a restaurant to make ends meet. When she goes outside for a smoke, she is found by Diane. She tells Tonya that the next Olympics will be in two years instead of four. Tonya starts training again under Diane to lose weight and build muscle in order for her to compete.\n\nTonya later speaks to a skating official and acknowledges that he and the other head honchos don't like her, to which he responds that she just doesn't represent a wholesome image that they want to convey. This leads Tonya to go speak to LaVona at the restaurant where she works, as she believes LaVona cursed her, though she tells Tonya that she made her a winner.\n\nEveryone in the interviews now come to talk about \"the incident\" (Nancy getting her knee whacked by an assailant). Jeff states that there were many contradictory stories, including people claiming that Tonya herself had attacked Nancy.\n\nIt begins in 1993 at the NW Regional Championships in Portland, OR. A cop comes to tell Tonya and Jeff that someone called in a death threat against Tonya, saying she will get \"a bullet in the back\" if she competes. In retaliation, Jeff goes to Shawn to try and send phony death threats to Tonya's competition to scare them. Shawn recruits two of his pals, Derrick Smith (Anthony Reynolds) and Shane Stant (Ricky Russert), to go out to Massachusetts where Nancy trains to try and scare her. Tonya herself is aware of the death threats scare plan. However, Jeff eventually tries to get Shawn to call off the plan, but Shawn thinks they are too far in to call it off.\n\nShane finds Nancy in Detroit at the rink and spots her in the hallway. He takes out a retractable baton and whacks her knee before trying to escape with Derrick serving as the getaway driver. The doors are locked, so he bashes his head through the glass to get away. Tonya and Jeff see the news on TV themselves with Nancy injured and crying in agony. Jeff angrily confronts Shawn for going ahead with the assault, where Shawn also admits that he had called in the death threat to Tonya before. Shane is eventually found by police and is arrested.\n\nLater on, Tonya qualifies to go to the Olympics. She and Jeff are found by FBI agents and questioned in regards to the incident. They claim to not know anything or to not have witnessed anything themselves. Jeff questions Shawn over how the authorities know the name Derrick. Although Shawn denies saying anything, flashbacks over the last 24 hours show that Shawn stupidly told a few people about Derrick, Shane, and most of their plan. 48 hours after that, the same agents that questioned Tonya and Jeff go to Shawn's house to question him, and he pins the blame entirely on Jeff. They attempt to set Jeff up in a sting operation to confess, but he never gives anything up.\n\nTonya continues to compete while Jeff, Shawn, Derrick, and Shane are arrested and brought to trial. The press continues to hound Tonya's home, as well as LaVona's. She goes to visit Tonya with the press right behind her. Although Tonya tries to find support and consolation in her mother, LaVona tries to secretly record a confession from Tonya, which she finds out about and sends LaVona out of the house. With the constant threat of arrest and getting kicked out of competitions looming, Tonya remains firm that she knew nothing about the planned attack, while Jeff and the other guys try to say that she did know something.\n\nTonya goes to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Tonya's skate lace messes up, causing her to cry from the pain. She places eighth, while Nancy places second and wins a silver medal behind Oksana Baiul from the Ukraine who wins the gold.\n\nTonya officially goes to trial following the Olympics. As a result of her hindering the prosecution, she is sentenced to three years probation, a huge fine, 500 hours community service, a psychological evaluation, and she is banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life. This hurts Tonya the most, and she pleads with the judge to serve jail time instead, but his decision is made up.\n\nThrough the interviews, Jeff states that he was sentenced to 18 months in prison but served only eight before being paroled. LaVona mentions that she has lost contact with Tonya, and that she couldn't care less, though it's clear that she feels the opposite. Jeff defends Tonya and says she never would have come up with the death threats, and that he feels responsible for ruining her career.\n\nTonya later competes as a boxer to maintain some kind of career and to stay in the public eye. We see her competing and fighting brutally against her opponent. She reflects on her skating career and how the American public wants someone to love and hate, and how people always ask her to tell the truth. Tonya ends with stating that this is the story of her life, and \"that's the fucking truth.\"\n\nThe final text states that Tonya Harding and LaVona Golden have had no contact in several years. Last Tonya heard, LaVona was living in Washington state behind a porn shop. Jeff Gillooly changed his name to Jeff Stone, and he married a woman named Nancy. The two opened up a hair/tanning salon, and he works as a car salesman, happily married with two children. Tonya quit boxing and worked in landscaping, deck building, and house painting. She is happily married with a son and wants everyone to know she's a good mother.\n\nThe credits show footage of the real Tonya Harding figure skating on the ice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Tonya Harding]]\n** [[Mckenna Grace]] as young Tonya Harding\n** Maizie Smith as Tonya Harding (age 4)\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Jeff Gillooly, Harding's lover and friend, later husband\n* [[Allison Janney]] as LaVona Golden, Harding's abusive mother\n* [[Julianne Nicholson]] as Diane Rawlinson, Harding's skating coach and Bob's wife\n* [[Caitlin Carver]] as [[Nancy Kerrigan]], Harding's skating rival and Olympic teammate, and the victim of the [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|1994 attack]]\n* [[Bojana Novakovic]] as Dody Teachman, another of Harding's coaches\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as Shawn Eckardt, a bodyguard and friend of Gillooly\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Martin Maddox, a former reporter\n* Dan Triandiflou as Bob Rawlinson, Diane's husband and Tonya's attorney\n* [[Ricky Russert]] as Shane Stant, hired by Jeff and Shawn to attack Nancy\n* Anthony Reynolds as Derrick Smith, Stant's uncle, previous friend of Eckardt, first hired to attack Nancy before recruiting Shane himself to injure her\n}}\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] was inspired to write the film after watching a documentary about ice skating which mentioned [[Tonya Harding]].<ref name=\"sagfull\">{{cite interview|last1=Robbie|first1=Margot|last2=Rogers|first2=Steven|last3=Gillespie|first3=Craig|last4=Janney|first4=Allison|display-authors=etal|title=Conversations with I, Tonya [Cast and Crew]|date=December 5, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqysxfvC94A|work=SAG-AFTRA Foundation|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> Rogers arranged separate interviews with Harding and her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly.

[[Christy Lemire]] of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' said: \"Janney absolutely tears it up as the profane, chain-smoking LaVona Harding, constantly insulting Tonya and messing with her mind in the name of making her a champion. It's a showy, scenery-chewing performance but it's not one-note; Janney brings an undercurrent of sorrow to the part in revealing LaVona's twisted methodology.\" Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that: 'Janney steals every scene she's in, playing LaVona, a harridan whose nodding goes beyond tough love.' Helen O'Hara from ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' called Janney's performance flawless and flamboyant, and an unforgettable one. ''[[USA Today]]'' said; \"Janney is magnificent as Tonya Harding's villainous and abusive mommy dearest.

Reviewing the film for ''[[USA Today]]'', [[Christine Brennan]], who covered the real story in 1994, wrote that \"the movie certainly doesn't worry about letting facts get in the way of a good story or bother to tell you that the only person Tonya has to blame...is herself.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In ''[[The Oregonian]]'', J.E. Vader, who covered Harding's rise as a local up-and-coming hero, wrote a scathing review titled \"I, Nauseated\", in which she calls Harding an \"unrepentant felon\", \"habitually 'truth challenged'\", and added that \"this fantasy film is Harding's dream come true\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by I, Tonya}}\n\n''I, Tonya'' earned various awards and nominations following its release.

As Tonya grows up, her parents take her out of school to focus on her skating career, as she trains under coach Diane Rawlinson. Tonya rapidly becomes one of the best [[Figure skating|figure skaters]] in the United States, but is held back by her \"[[white trash]]\" reputation, home-made costumes and unconventional choice of performance music (e.g., [[ZZ Top]]). At 15, she begins dating 18-year-old Jeff Gillooly. They marry, but Jeff becomes abusive. When LaVona scorns Tonya for putting up with it, Tonya blames LaVona for her raising her badly.\n\nAfter a dispute with Diane, Tonya fires her and hires Dody Teachman as her new coach. Tonya becomes the first female figure skater to complete two triple [[Axel jump]]s in competition. At the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], Tonya fails to stick her landings and finishes fourth. Defeated, she moves in again with Jeff and takes a job as a waitress, but Diane convinces her to train for the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. On the day of her November 1993 competition at the Northwest Pacific Regional Championships in Portland, Tonya receives a death threat and chooses not to compete. Realising that he can sabotage Tonya's competition, Jeff instructs his friend Shawn Eckardt to send death threats to Tonya's rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. Tonya makes a phone call trying to locate Kerrigan's training arena and her practice times. Eckardt hires two inept crooks to attack Kerrigan after a practice session in [[Detroit]]. On January 6, 1994, Eckardt's henchmen strike Kerrigan's knee; she cannot compete at the next day's [[1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|National competition]]. The hired henchmen are arrested.\n\nEckardt's bragging quickly leads the FBI to him. He blames Jeff, who is horrified to learn that Eckardt gave orders beyond sending the letters. Tonya qualifies for the Olympic team but realizes she will be found guilty by association. She goes to the FBI and tells them what Jeff and Eckardt did, but they show her interview transcript to Jeff after his arrest, and he races home to confront her. She briefly speaks to Jeff, then climbs out the window, leaving him for good. Jeff later implicates Tonya, saying she knew about the attack.\n\nLaVona visits Tonya and offers her kind words; however, when LaVona asks if Tonya knew anything about the crime, Tonya realises she is [[Covert listening device|wearing a wire]] and throws her mother out. Jeff, Eckardt, and the henchmen are charged, with Tonya's hearing postponed until after the Olympics. Tonya finishes eighth and [[Figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Nancy Kerrigan wins the silver medal]]. Tonya avoids jail but is banned from competitive figure skating for life. Heartbroken, she begs the judge to give her jail time but not to take away the one thing she knows how to do; the judge refuses.\n\nJeff acknowledges that he ruined Tonya's career. He changes his name, remarries, opens a hair salon, divorces, and remarries. LaVona moves to [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] and has no contact with Tonya either. Tonya remarries, divorces, takes up professional [[boxing]], and becomes a landscaper, house painter and deck builder. She now lives happily with her seven-year-old son and third husband.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Tonya Harding]]\n** [[Mckenna Grace]] as young Tonya Harding\n** Maizie Smith as Tonya Harding (age 4)\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Jeff Gillooly, Harding's lover and friend, later husband\n* [[Allison Janney]] as LaVona Golden, Harding's abusive mother\n* [[Julianne Nicholson]] as Diane Rawlinson, Harding's skating coach and Bob's wife\n* [[Caitlin Carver]] as [[Nancy Kerrigan]], Harding's skating rival and Olympic teammate, and the victim of the [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|1994 attack]]\n* [[Bojana Novakovic]] as Dody Teachman, another of Harding's coaches\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as Shawn Eckardt, a bodyguard and friend of Gillooly\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Martin Maddox, a former reporter\n* Dan Triandiflou as Bob Rawlinson, Diane's husband and Tonya's attorney\n* [[Ricky Russert]] as Shane Stant, hired by Jeff and Shawn to attack Nancy\n* Anthony Reynolds as Derrick Smith, Stant's uncle, previous friend of Eckardt, first hired to attack Nancy before recruiting Shane himself to injure her\n}}\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] was inspired to write the film after watching a documentary about ice skating which mentioned [[Tonya Harding]].<ref name=\"sagfull\">{{cite interview|last1=Robbie|first1=Margot|last2=Rogers|first2=Steven|last3=Gillespie|first3=Craig|last4=Janney|first4=Allison|display-authors=etal|title=Conversations with I, Tonya [Cast and Crew]|date=December 5, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqysxfvC94A|work=SAG-AFTRA Foundation|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> Rogers arranged separate interviews with Harding and her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly.

Vader, who covered Harding's rise as a local up-and-coming hero, wrote a scathing review titled \"I, Nauseated\", in which she calls Harding an \"unrepentant felon\", \"habitually 'truth challenged'\", and added that \"this fantasy film is Harding's dream come true\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by I, Tonya}}\n\n''I, Tonya'' earned various awards and nominations following its release.
