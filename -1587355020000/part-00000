Born in [[Las Vegas]], he played youth soccer in his home state and [[California]] before moving to Belgium at the age of sixteen, joining the youth team at [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]]. He signed a professional contract with Brugge but never made a first-team appearance, spending part of the 1992\u201393 season on loan with [[R.W.D. Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] where he made his senior debut and his performances saw him win his first and only cap for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]].\n\nHe returned to the U.S. in 1993 to join [[American Professional Soccer League]] side [[Los Angeles Salsa]] where he was named rookie goalkeeper of the season. In 1994, he joined English [[Premier League]] side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] where he spent two years as a reserve goalkeeper, spending time on loan at [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. Luton later made the transfer permanent, paying \u00a3580,000 to complete the deal, and he played in 90 consecutive league matches for the club before his run was ended by a shoulder injury.\n\nUnable to regain his place in the first-team, he instead joined [[Major League Soccer]] side [[New England Revolution]] to replace the retiring [[Walter Zenga]]. After one season, Zenga returned to play for the team resulting in Feuer being traded to fellow MLS side [[Colorado Rapids]], following a brief loan spell with English [[Non-League football|non-league]] club [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]]. He replaced first choice [[Marcus Hahnemann]] who was sold midway through the 2000 season before returning to England with [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. However, he made just four league appearances during two years at the club and retired in 2002 after brief spells with [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He later worked as a goalkeeping coach in the U.S., including a six year spell at [[LA Galaxy]].\n\n==Early life==\nFeuer, one of six children of show business parents,<ref name=\"More\">{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8458883.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050702/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8458883.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 February 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=More to come from Feuer: New goalie gives Revolution reason for encouragement after opener |newspaper=The Boston Globe |author=Frank Dell'Apa |date=31 March 1998 |access-date=22 February 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> was born and raised in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

Griffiths made the decision to convert Feuer into a goalkeeper and trained with him every Saturday to improve his game, building a soccer equivalent of a [[pitching machine]] to shoot balls at the young goalkeeper at times for up to eight hours a day.<ref name=\"World\"/><ref name=\"Story\"/> He would face hundreds of shots every hour from the machine and Griffiths praised his determination and noted the improvement in his game, stating \"He went from being the worst player on the team to one of the best in the state at 15 years old.\"<ref name=\"World\"/>\n\nDuring his time with the Generals, Feuer was banned from playing soccer in the U.S. after an altercation with a linesman during a match.

Born in [[Las Vegas]], he played youth soccer in his home state and [[California]] before moving to Belgium at the age of sixteen, joining the youth team at [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]]. He signed a professional contract with Brugge but never made a first-team appearance, spending part of the 1992\u201393 season on loan with [[R.W.D. Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] where he made his senior debut and his performances saw him win his first and only cap for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]].\n\nHe returned to the U.S. in 1993 to join [[American Professional Soccer League]] side [[Los Angeles Salsa]] where he was named rookie goalkeeper of the season. In 1994, he joined English [[Premier League]] side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] where he spent two years as a reserve goalkeeper, spending time on loan at [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. Luton later made the transfer permanent, paying \u00a3580,000 to complete the deal, and he played in 90 consecutive league matches for the club before his run was ended by a shoulder injury.\n\nUnable to regain his place in the first-team, he instead joined [[Major League Soccer]] side [[New England Revolution]] to replace the retiring [[Walter Zenga]]. After one season, Zenga returned to play for the team resulting in Feuer being traded to fellow MLS side [[Colorado Rapids]], following a brief loan spell with English [[Non-League football|non-league]] club [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]]. He replaced first choice [[Marcus Hahnemann]] who was sold midway through the 2000 season before returning to England with [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. However, he made just four league appearances during two years at the club and retired in 2002 after brief spells with [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He later worked as a goalkeeping coach in the U.S., including a six year spell at [[LA Galaxy]].\n\n==Early life==\nFeuer, one of six children of show business parents,<ref name=\"More\">{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8458883.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050702/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8458883.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 February 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=More to come from Feuer: New goalie gives Revolution reason for encouragement after opener |newspaper=The Boston Globe |author=Frank Dell'Apa |date=31 March 1998 |access-date=22 February 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> was born and raised in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

Having conceded a goal that he believed was offside, he remonstrated with the linesman over the decision and made physical contact and was subsequently sent off.

He is also the former head coach of both the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States men's national team]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] of [[Major League Soccer]].\n\n==Collegiate career==\nSampson attended [[UCLA]] briefly before transferring to [[Foothill College|Foothill Community College]], located in [[Los Altos Hills, California]], in 1975.  At Foothill Community he earned [[All-American]] honors while playing on the 1976 California junior college state championship team.  He then transferred to [[San Jose State University]] in 1977.  He graduated from San Jose State in 1979 with a minor in Spanish, which he later used as coach of the Costa Rican national soccer team.\n\n==Beginning coaching==\nAfter graduating from San Jose State, he moved to [[Stanford University]] where he earned a [[masters degree]] in education from the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]].  While at Stanford he entered the coaching ranks with the [[Mountain View High School (Mountain View, California)|Awalt High School]] boys varsity soccer team in [[Mountain View, California]].  Then, after graduating from Stanford, he served as an assistant men's soccer coach at Foothill College.  In 1982, [[UCLA Bruins men's soccer|UCLA]] hired Sampson as an assistant men's soccer coach. In 1985, he was on staff when UCLA won the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA men's soccer championship]].\n\n==Santa Clara University==\nAt the end of the 1985 season, [[Santa Clara University]] hired him away from UCLA to serve as their men's soccer head coach.  In 1989, he achieved his greatest success as a college coach when he led Santa Clara to the [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Men's Soccer Championship]].<ref name=\"Cal Poly\">{{cite web|url=http://gopoly.com/sports/msoc/coaches/Sampson-Steve?view=bio|title=Steve Sampson|publisher=Cal Poly Mustangs|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}</ref> Santa Clara's opponent in the final was [[Virginia Cavaliers men's soccer|Virginia]], coached by [[Bruce Arena]], who would later succeed Sampson as head coach of the [[United States men's national soccer team]]. Santa Clara and Virginia played even through regular time and four overtimes before NCAA officials stopped the game, much to the frustration of the players and two coaches, and named Santa Clara and Virginia as co-champions. Sampson was named the 1989 NCAA Men's Soccer Coach of the Year. When he left Santa Clara, he had compiled a 64\u201319\u201319 record.\n\n==1994 World Cup==\nAfter leaving Santa Clara, Sampson became an assistant to [[Bora Milutinovi\u0107|Bora Milutinovic]] on the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] in 1993 and was on the staff when the U.S. hosted the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. In addition to his coaching duties, he served as the Vice President/Competition Management for the World Cup organization.\n\n==U.S. national team coach==\n\n===1995 Copa America===\nWhen Milutinovi\u0107 resigned from the team after the World Cup, the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF) named Sampson as the interim coach in April 1995. But after leading the US to a surprising fourth-place finish at the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica 1995]], including a 3\u20130 romp over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], as well as a victory over arch-rivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the quarterfinals, Sampson was promoted to full-time national team coach in August 1995.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://soccertimes.com/usteams/roster/men/sampson.htm |title=Steve Sampson |work=SoccerTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===1998 Gold Cup===\nSampson coached the team to second-place finish in the [[1998 Gold Cup]], including an historic 1\u20130 victory over Brazil in the semi-final.<ref name=bio/>\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nThe US National Team had a strong showing in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|1998 World Cup qualifying rounds]], finishing with an 8-6-2 record overall.<ref name=bio/>\n\nSampson attempted to improve the team by looking for Americans playing in Europe. [[David Regis]] was the most talented of those Sampson brought in but was impacted by delays in gaining his citizenship. Others like [[Michael Mason (soccer)|Michael Mason]] and [[David Wagner (soccer)|David Wagner]] did not pan out as Sampson tried to overcome the weaknesses of a young MLS. In a controversial move, Sampson removed then captain, [[John Harkes]] from the squad. Sampson gave a variety of reasons, from Harkes' lack of leadership, Harkes wanting a more offensive role, and behavioral issues unbecoming of a national team player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quotes from Steve Sampson and John Harkes |url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/18564/quotes-from-steve-sampson-and-john-harkes.html |work=Soccer America |date=April 14, 1998}}</ref> There were injuries to both of the U.S.'s primary attacking threat, [[Eric Wynalda]] and creative midfielder [[Tab Ramos]].\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] would prove more challenging. Playing the likes of [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[FR Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] were significantly more difficult than in [[CONCACAF]] qualifying. Sampson changed the formation in the spring of 1998 to an unusual 3\u20136\u20131 formation in preparation for the Germany match, trying to counter the quality of the German midfield. The conservative approach almost worked but was not to be as his team conceded a goal from a corner in the first half, due to a mistake by [[Mike Burns (soccer)|Mike Burns]] at the front post. When Sampson changed the system in the second half his team showed promise but was thwarted by an exceptional strike by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]]. The team lost 2\u20130. The second match against Iran showed a spirited team but one that could not find the back of the net. The U.S. team hit the crossbar and post on five different occasions en route to a 2\u20131 loss in their most critical match. Counter-attack goals got the best of the U.S. seeking to overcome the Germany loss and the player unrest after that match. The lone goal came from [[Brian McBride]]. After significant personnel changes for the Yugoslavia game, the team lost 1\u20130. Failing to win a game and finishing in last place, Sampson resigned as coach on June 29, 1998.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-06-30/sports/9806300138_1_soccer-president-alan-rothenberg-alexi-lalas-world-cup-debacle |title=Controversial Sampson Resigns After World Cup Debacle |date=June 30, 1998 |first=Bonnie |last=DeSimone |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>\n \nIn February 2010, Sampson said that Harkes was dropped from the 1998 World Cup because of an affair between John Harkes and Amy Wynalda, the wife of U.S. striker Eric Wynalda.

Despite an array of talent, the team was inconsistent the rest of the year and struggled for large stretches of 2005. Many of the players whom Sampson had brought into the team were absent from the Galaxy squad due to national team commitments for the US, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.

coach currently serving as the head coach of the [[Cal Poly Mustangs men's soccer|men's soccer program at Cal Poly]]. He is also the former head coach of both the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States men's national team]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] of [[Major League Soccer]].\n\n==Collegiate career==\nSampson attended [[UCLA]] briefly before transferring to [[Foothill College|Foothill Community College]], located in [[Los Altos Hills, California]], in 1975.  At Foothill Community he earned [[All-American]] honors while playing on the 1976 California junior college state championship team.  He then transferred to [[San Jose State University]] in 1977.  He graduated from San Jose State in 1979 with a minor in Spanish, which he later used as coach of the Costa Rican national soccer team.\n\n==Beginning coaching==\nAfter graduating from San Jose State, he moved to [[Stanford University]] where he earned a [[masters degree]] in education from the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]].  While at Stanford he entered the coaching ranks with the [[Mountain View High School (Mountain View, California)|Awalt High School]] boys varsity soccer team in [[Mountain View, California]].  Then, after graduating from Stanford, he served as an assistant men's soccer coach at Foothill College.  In 1982, [[UCLA Bruins men's soccer|UCLA]] hired Sampson as an assistant men's soccer coach. In 1985, he was on staff when UCLA won the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA men's soccer championship]].\n\n==Santa Clara University==\nAt the end of the 1985 season, [[Santa Clara University]] hired him away from UCLA to serve as their men's soccer head coach.  In 1989, he achieved his greatest success as a college coach when he led Santa Clara to the [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Men's Soccer Championship]].<ref name=\"Cal Poly\">{{cite web|url=http://gopoly.com/sports/msoc/coaches/Sampson-Steve?view=bio|title=Steve Sampson|publisher=Cal Poly Mustangs|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}</ref> Santa Clara's opponent in the final was [[Virginia Cavaliers men's soccer|Virginia]], coached by [[Bruce Arena]], who would later succeed Sampson as head coach of the [[United States men's national soccer team]]. Santa Clara and Virginia played even through regular time and four overtimes before NCAA officials stopped the game, much to the frustration of the players and two coaches, and named Santa Clara and Virginia as co-champions. Sampson was named the 1989 NCAA Men's Soccer Coach of the Year. When he left Santa Clara, he had compiled a 64\u201319\u201319 record.\n\n==1994 World Cup==\nAfter leaving Santa Clara, Sampson became an assistant to [[Bora Milutinovi\u0107|Bora Milutinovic]] on the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] in 1993 and was on the staff when the U.S. hosted the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. In addition to his coaching duties, he served as the Vice President/Competition Management for the World Cup organization.\n\n==U.S. national team coach==\n\n===1995 Copa America===\nWhen Milutinovi\u0107 resigned from the team after the World Cup, the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF) named Sampson as the interim coach in April 1995. But after leading the US to a surprising fourth-place finish at the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica 1995]], including a 3\u20130 romp over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], as well as a victory over arch-rivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the quarterfinals, Sampson was promoted to full-time national team coach in August 1995.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://soccertimes.com/usteams/roster/men/sampson.htm |title=Steve Sampson |work=SoccerTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===1998 Gold Cup===\nSampson coached the team to second-place finish in the [[1998 Gold Cup]], including an historic 1\u20130 victory over Brazil in the semi-final.<ref name=bio/>\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nThe US National Team had a strong showing in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|1998 World Cup qualifying rounds]], finishing with an 8-6-2 record overall.<ref name=bio/>\n\nSampson attempted to improve the team by looking for Americans playing in Europe. [[David Regis]] was the most talented of those Sampson brought in but was impacted by delays in gaining his citizenship. Others like [[Michael Mason (soccer)|Michael Mason]] and [[David Wagner (soccer)|David Wagner]] did not pan out as Sampson tried to overcome the weaknesses of a young MLS. In a controversial move, Sampson removed then captain, [[John Harkes]] from the squad. Sampson gave a variety of reasons, from Harkes' lack of leadership, Harkes wanting a more offensive role, and behavioral issues unbecoming of a national team player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quotes from Steve Sampson and John Harkes |url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/18564/quotes-from-steve-sampson-and-john-harkes.html |work=Soccer America |date=April 14, 1998}}</ref> There were injuries to both of the U.S.'s primary attacking threat, [[Eric Wynalda]] and creative midfielder [[Tab Ramos]].\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] would prove more challenging. Playing the likes of [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[FR Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] were significantly more difficult than in [[CONCACAF]] qualifying. Sampson changed the formation in the spring of 1998 to an unusual 3\u20136\u20131 formation in preparation for the Germany match, trying to counter the quality of the German midfield. The conservative approach almost worked but was not to be as his team conceded a goal from a corner in the first half, due to a mistake by [[Mike Burns (soccer)|Mike Burns]] at the front post. When Sampson changed the system in the second half his team showed promise but was thwarted by an exceptional strike by [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]]. The team lost 2\u20130. The second match against Iran showed a spirited team but one that could not find the back of the net. The U.S. team hit the crossbar and post on five different occasions en route to a 2\u20131 loss in their most critical match. Counter-attack goals got the best of the U.S. seeking to overcome the Germany loss and the player unrest after that match. The lone goal came from [[Brian McBride]]. After significant personnel changes for the Yugoslavia game, the team lost 1\u20130. Failing to win a game and finishing in last place, Sampson resigned as coach on June 29, 1998.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-06-30/sports/9806300138_1_soccer-president-alan-rothenberg-alexi-lalas-world-cup-debacle |title=Controversial Sampson Resigns After World Cup Debacle |date=June 30, 1998 |first=Bonnie |last=DeSimone |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>\n \nIn February 2010, Sampson said that Harkes was dropped from the 1998 World Cup because of an affair between John Harkes and Amy Wynalda, the wife of U.S. striker Eric Wynalda.

In his first international post, he helped Costa Rica win the [[2003 UNCAF Nations Cup]], going undefeated. Costa Rica also finished fourth in the [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].\n\nIn 2004, Costa Rica ranked 17 in the [[FIFA World Rankings|world]], their highest ever at the time. However, after Costa Rica needed the [[away goals rule|away goals]] tiebreaker to get past [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] in the second round of [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|qualifying for the 2006 World Cup]], Sampson was fired.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/23/sports/sports-briefing.html |title=Sports Briefing |work=New York Times |agency=AP |date=June 23, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Los Angeles Galaxy==\nSampson was hired as the LA Galaxy coach on August 18, 2004, replacing [[Sigi Schmid]]. Despite an array of talent, the team was inconsistent the rest of the year and struggled for large stretches of 2005. Many of the players whom Sampson had brought into the team were absent from the Galaxy squad due to national team commitments for the US, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. As the season continued the Galaxy improved and eventually won the \"double\" of the [[U.S. Open Cup]] and [[MLS Cup]], the latter as the lowest seed in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web   | last = Goff | first = Steven | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/13/AR2005111300708.html | title= Galaxy Wins MLS Cup in OT | accessdate= May 5, 2010 | date= November 14, 2005 | work=Washington Post }}</ref> The Galaxy failed to build on their success in the 2005 season and Sampson was fired on June 6, 2006 after [[Alexi Lalas]], who played for Sampson on the US National Team, was hired as president.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oberjuerge.com/http:/www.oberjuerge.com/awkward-moments-steve-sampson-and-alexi-lalas/ |title=Awkward Moments: Steve Sampson and Alexi Lalas |date=May 30, 2009 |first=Paul |last=Oberjuerge |work=oberjuerge.com}}</ref>\n\n==Cal Poly==\nSteve Sampson was hired as the head men's soccer coach at [[Cal Poly Mustangs men's soccer|California Polytechnic State University]] on December 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2014/12/04/steve-sampson-cal-poly-usmnt-coach |title=Ex-USMNT manager Steve Sampson returns to coaching at Cal Poly |author=Staff |work=Sports Illustrated |date=December 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 2011, he was linked to the vacant coaching position of [[Vietnam national football team]], in the end it was no avail.<ref>https://www.vietnamplus.vn/cuu-hlv-tuyen-my-se-dan-dat-doi-tuyen-viet-nam/84165.vnp</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://soccertimes.com/usteams/roster/men/sampson.htm SoccerTimes.com profile]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=International tournaments\n|list1=\n{{United States squad 1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica}}\n{{United States squad 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup}}\n{{United States squad 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup}}\n{{United States squad 1998 FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Costa Rica squad 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Managerial positions\n|list1=\n{{United States men's national soccer team managers}}\n{{Costa Rica national football team managers}}\n{{Los Angeles Galaxy managers}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards\n|bg= gold\n|fg= navy\n|list1=\n{{NSCAA Coach of the Year}}\n{{West Coast Conference Men's Soccer Coach of the Year navbox}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sampson, Steve}}\n[[Category:1957 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Salt Lake City]]\n[[Category:Soccer players from Utah]]\n[[Category:American soccer players]]\n[[Category:Association footballers not categorized by position]]\n[[Category:Foothill College alumni]]\n[[Category:Stanford Graduate School of Education alumni]]\n[[Category:Foothill Owls men\u2019s soccer players]]\n[[Category:San Jose State Spartans men's soccer players]]\n[[Category:American soccer coaches]]\n[[Category:UCLA Bruins men's soccer coaches]]\n[[Category:Santa Clara Broncos men's soccer coaches]]\n[[Category:United States men's national soccer team managers]]\n[[Category:Costa Rica national football team managers]]\n[[Category:LA Galaxy coaches]]\n[[Category:Cal Poly Mustangs men's soccer coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Soccer coaches]]\n[[Category:1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica managers]]\n[[Category:1998 FIFA World Cup managers]]\n[[Category:American expatriate soccer coaches]]\n[[Category:American expatriate sportspeople in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Expatriate football managers in Costa Rica]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sampson"}
