Joe is forced to follow her by Captain Blue's [[mecha]], Six Machine (renamed \"Machine Six\" in the English anime dub), and meets Captain Blue in the flesh who grants Joe the power to become an action movie hero in his own right called Viewtiful Joe.<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web | author=Casamassina, Matt | date=January 27, 2006 | title=IGN: Viewtiful Joe - Vol. 1 Review | url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/683/683861p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Viewtiful Joe (character)|Joe]]''': The protagonist of the series. He's a fanboy of movies who gets to live his dream as '''Viewtiful Joe''' while he saves Silvia from Jadow. He assumes his superhero outfit via the catchphrase \"Henshin-a-Go-Go, Baby!!\" He is often distracted by double cheeseburgers and doesn't take a lot of things seriously.\n* '''Silvia''': Joe's love interest and partner. In the beginning of the series, she was abducted by Jadow for their evil plan to succeed. After Shadow's defeat, Silvia obtained a V-Watch from Captain Blue so she can team up with Joe as '''Sexy Silvia''' (in the English anime dub '''Go-Go Silvia''') instead of being the \"damsel-in-distress\".\n* '''Junior''': Another self-proclaimed hero worshipper like Joe, only younger. He lived in Blue Town, which was named after Captain Blue, serving as its protector '''Captain Blue Jr'''. Despite his jealousy for Joe being Blue's successor, Junior decided to become Joe's sidekick and offered his knowledge of Movieland as a helping hand. As the series progresses into the Gedow arc, Junior received the V-Yoyos from Captain Blue, assuming his new superhero outfit via the phrase \"Henshin-a-Yo-Yo, Baby!!\"\n* '''Captain Blue''': Joe's idol and mentor. He gave Joe the V-Watch which enables him to use his VFX powers.  In season two, he was transformed into the \"Captain Blue Device\" by the Black Emperor, which Gedow uses to create monsters. The Black Emperor gave him the scar on his face.\n* '''Alastor''': An agent of  Jadow that uses the nicknames \"The Midnight Thunder Boy\" and \"Blade Master.\" Though he was helping Jadow, Alastor doesn't care about their goals, but instead seeking out the ultimate battle, and can be considered an antihero to an extent. He considers himself Joe's rival, despite questioning Joe's methods. Alastor has the habit of watching over Joe during his adventures through Movieland and the two tend to act more like friends rather than enemies, becoming a perfect example of text-book [[frenemies]]. He was also the one who gave Joe the inspiration for his hero name. During Fire Leo's fight with Joe, Alastor restrained Fire Leo as they both fell into the void that surrounds Jadow headquarters, but Alastor promised to survive so he and Joe can finally settle their rivalry.  Following the event Alastor lost his powers and could only restore them by a solar eclipse.  During the time his power was lost, he appears in his normal form giving the heroes advice and sometimes help in fights.  His power is restored to him during a solar eclipse.\n* '''Sprocket''': Coordinator of Jadow and second in command of the organization.  She is one of the few characters who is actually from the real world, being a member of Blue's film crew who was pulled into Movieland. She is annoyed with the antics and incompetence of Jadow's henchmen Charles III, Hulk Davidson, and Gran Bruce. When Jadow was no more, she along with Charles, Hulk, and Bruce joined up with Gedow.\n* '''Almighty Leader''': The leader of Jadow, the antagonistic organization of the anime's first season. When Joe managed to get into Jadow headquarters, he found Silvia, only to see her abducted by the evil leader. Once Joe got to the stadium, \"Almighty Leader\" was revealed to be none other than Captain Blue, who attempted to break Joe's spirit and thus devastated Joe mentally before destroying him physically. But the words of those Joe had befriended in his adventures enabled Joe's confidence to return and fight Blue back. Piloting the King Blue giant robot, Blue was defeated by Joe in Six Majin.\n* '''The Black Emperor''': Leader of the Gedow, the invading alien organization of the anime's second season whose goal is to use their various monsters and foot soldiers to corrupt a movie and alter the ending, causing the film to radiate with darkness. Pilots a battle machine. The Black Emperor is a superhero named Jet Black, Joe's father, owner of the theater and Captain Blue's best friend. He turned evil by the Black V-Watch and the Black Film. He was freed from the Black Film's corruption by Joe and Silvia. In episode 50, it is confirmed he gave Captain Blue his scar with a swipe of his blade.\n\n==Media==\n===Anime===\n{{main|List of Viewtiful Joe episodes}}\n''Viewtiful Joe'' was produced by animation company [[Group TAC]].

[[Bob Papenbrook]], under the name John Smallberries, voiced Captain Blue for the show's first twenty-one English dubbed episodes. Papenbrook died on March 17, 2006, due to complications from a chronic lung condition, making ''Viewtiful Joe'' his final piece of work.<ref>{{cite web | author=DeMott, Rick | date=March 27, 2006 | title=Voice Actor Papenbrook Passes Away | url=http://www.awn.com/news/passing/voice-actor-papenbrook-passes-away | publisher=AWN | accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Paul St. Peter]] for the remainder of the dub.\n\nThe U.S. broadcast began with the fifth episode, with the first three episodes not being shown until a month later.<ref>{{cite web | title=Viewtiful Joe Episodes - Season 1-2 | url=http://www.tv.com/viewtiful-joe/show/33897/episode.html?season=All&tag=list_header;paginator;All | publisher=[[TV.com]] | accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=DeMott, Rick | date=December 16, 2005 | title=Kids\u2019 WB!

In Brazil and Spain, the show was aired completely uncut. In the English version, the name of Joe's flying machine, Six Machine, was renamed in the English dub to Machine Six. There is speculation that it was renamed because its original name sounded close to the phrase \"sex machine\". Also, Six Majin was renamed to Robo-Six. Joe's [[Finger (gesture)|middle finger]] was edited out in his henshin transformation sequence. Silvia's super hero alter ego is renamed from \"Sexy Silvia\" (which was also used in the games) to \"Go-Go Silvia\". Sprocket's jumpsuit is always zipped up completely, though it was originally unzipped (showing large amounts of cleavage) and one of her signature moves was to zip it up. This move was eliminated in the dub by cutting out the scenes, resulting in Sprocket having much less screen time than in the original.\n\nEpisodes of the series have been released on both [[DVD]] and [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]].<ref name=\"press\">{{cite web | author=GameSpot | date=January 5, 2006 | title=The Global Phenomenon Viewtiful Joe is Coming to DVD and UMD! | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/viewtifuljoe/news.html?sid=6141864 | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2009-10-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105111933/http://www.gamespot.com/news/the-global-phenomenon-viewtiful-joe-is-coming-to-dvd-and-umd-6141864|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> In North America, Geneon partnered with [[Foot Locker|Kids Foot Locker]] to promote the show by including DVDs with purchases at the shoe retailer.<ref>{{cite web | author=Johannes, Amy | date=February 8, 2006 | title=Kids Footlocker Lures Consumers with DVD Incentives | url=http://promomagazine.com/incentives/news/kidsfootlocker_dvds_020806/ | publisher=Promo Magazine | accessdate=2009-11-30 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713062830/http://chiefmarketer.com/incentives/news/kidsfootlocker_dvds_020806 | archive-date=July 13, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===CDs===\n[[File:Viewtiful joe soundtrack.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Viewtiful Joe'' CD soundtrack]]\nThe Japanese version of ''Viewtiful Joe'' features music composed by Takehiko Gokita and Yuusuke Hayashi.

[[Matt Casamassina]] of [[IGN]] praised the ''Viewtiful Joe'' for staying true to its source material. He states, \"[...]  the episodes never stray too far from the original subject matter. As a result, anybody who played the Joe titles will have a sense of d\u0113j\u0101 vu as they watch these toons. Viewers who know the franchise's history will find no contradictions in these episodes - merely more back story, most of it entertaining.\" Despite his appreciation for its artwork, Casamassina was displeased with the show's lack of animation.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> This was concurred upon by Zac Bertschy of the [[Anime News Network]] (ANN), who was also very critical of the show's English dub, giving the first DVD volume an overall \"F\". Specifically, he found that the localization's attempt to be [[Hip (slang)|hip]] with a nearly constant use of slang in order to cater to younger audiences resulted in a \"insultingly bad dub\".<ref name=\"annreview1\"/> Carlo Santos, also of ANN, had a similar opinion, and gave the second DVD volume an overall \"D\". He found fault not only in the voice acting, but the script writing as well. \"Joe's vocabulary is ''all, like, totally, DUDE'' every time he opens his mouth, and when he's not hamming it up with unconvincing slang, he's spouting lines that are supposed to sound witty but aren't.\" Santos also noted the series as being too repetitive, but enjoyed the anime's character design, coloring, and visual style taken from the games.<ref>{{cite web | author=Santos, Carlo | date=June 16, 2006 | title=Viewtiful Joe DVD 2 - Review | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/viewtiful-joe/dvd-2 | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> Buzz McClain of ''Video Business'' asserted that the show is \"clearly influenced by the animation style of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]\", and that its use of narrative is much more linear and easy to follow than other anime.<ref>{{cite web | author=McClain, Buzz | date=January 23, 2006 | title=Viewtiful Joe, Vol. 1 | url=http://www.videobusiness.com/ReleasesDetail/9677.html?q=viewtiful | publisher=Video Business | accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/vj/ Official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{tv.com show|viewtiful-joe|Viewtiful Joe}}\n*{{IMDb title|0464782|Viewtiful Joe}}\n* {{ann|anime|4325|Viewtiful Joe}}\n\n{{Viewtiful Joe series}}\n{{Group TAC}}\n{{Kids' WB}}\n\n[[Category:2004 anime television series]]\n[[Category:2005 Japanese television series endings]]\n[[Category:Anime series]]\n[[Category:Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Anime television series based on video games]]\n[[Category:Geneon USA]]\n[[Category:Group TAC]]\n[[Category:Superheroes in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:TV Tokyo shows]]\n[[Category:Viewtiful Joe]]\n[[Category:Works based on Capcom video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Viewtiful Joe\n| image           = Viewtiful joe dvd.jpg\n| caption         = ''Viewtiful Joe'' Volume 1 DVD cover\n| ja_kanji        = \u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30d5\u30eb \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\n| ja_romaji       = By\u016btifuru J\u014d\n| genre           = [[Action fiction|Action]], [[comedy]], [[superhero fiction|superhero]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Viewtiful Joe on Kids'WB |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2005-06-21/viewtiful-joe-on-kids'wb |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=January 2, 2020 |date=June 21, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Paul |title=Jetix UK line up Viewtiful Joe for UK TV; starting in July |url=https://animeuknews.net/2007/06/jetix-uk-line-up-viewtiful-joe-for-uk-tv-starting-in-july/ |website=Anime UK News |accessdate=January 31, 2019 |date=June 28, 2007}}</ref><!-- Genres should be based on what reliable sources list them as and not on personal interpretations.

Joe is forced to follow her by Captain Blue's [[mecha]], Six Machine (renamed \"Machine Six\" in the English anime dub), and meets Captain Blue in the flesh who grants Joe the power to become an action movie hero in his own right called Viewtiful Joe.<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web | author=Casamassina, Matt | date=January 27, 2006 | title=IGN: Viewtiful Joe - Vol. 1 Review | url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/683/683861p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Viewtiful Joe (character)|Joe]]''': The protagonist of the series. He's a fanboy of movies who gets to live his dream as '''Viewtiful Joe''' while he saves Silvia from Jadow. He assumes his superhero outfit via the catchphrase \"Henshin-a-Go-Go, Baby!!\" He is often distracted by double cheeseburgers and doesn't take a lot of things seriously.\n* '''Silvia''': Joe's love interest and partner. In the beginning of the series, she was abducted by Jadow for their evil plan to succeed. After Shadow's defeat, Silvia obtained a V-Watch from Captain Blue so she can team up with Joe as '''Sexy Silvia''' (in the English anime dub '''Go-Go Silvia''') instead of being the \"damsel-in-distress\".\n* '''Junior''': Another self-proclaimed hero worshipper like Joe, only younger. He lived in Blue Town, which was named after Captain Blue, serving as its protector '''Captain Blue Jr'''. Despite his jealousy for Joe being Blue's successor, Junior decided to become Joe's sidekick and offered his knowledge of Movieland as a helping hand. As the series progresses into the Gedow arc, Junior received the V-Yoyos from Captain Blue, assuming his new superhero outfit via the phrase \"Henshin-a-Yo-Yo, Baby!!\"\n* '''Captain Blue''': Joe's idol and mentor. He gave Joe the V-Watch which enables him to use his VFX powers.  In season two, he was transformed into the \"Captain Blue Device\" by the Black Emperor, which Gedow uses to create monsters. The Black Emperor gave him the scar on his face.\n* '''Alastor''': An agent of  Jadow that uses the nicknames \"The Midnight Thunder Boy\" and \"Blade Master.\" Though he was helping Jadow, Alastor doesn't care about their goals, but instead seeking out the ultimate battle, and can be considered an antihero to an extent. He considers himself Joe's rival, despite questioning Joe's methods. Alastor has the habit of watching over Joe during his adventures through Movieland and the two tend to act more like friends rather than enemies, becoming a perfect example of text-book [[frenemies]]. He was also the one who gave Joe the inspiration for his hero name. During Fire Leo's fight with Joe, Alastor restrained Fire Leo as they both fell into the void that surrounds Jadow headquarters, but Alastor promised to survive so he and Joe can finally settle their rivalry.  Following the event Alastor lost his powers and could only restore them by a solar eclipse.  During the time his power was lost, he appears in his normal form giving the heroes advice and sometimes help in fights.  His power is restored to him during a solar eclipse.\n* '''Sprocket''': Coordinator of Jadow and second in command of the organization.  She is one of the few characters who is actually from the real world, being a member of Blue's film crew who was pulled into Movieland. She is annoyed with the antics and incompetence of Jadow's henchmen Charles III, Hulk Davidson, and Gran Bruce. When Jadow was no more, she along with Charles, Hulk, and Bruce joined up with Gedow.\n* '''Almighty Leader''': The leader of Jadow, the antagonistic organization of the anime's first season. When Joe managed to get into Jadow headquarters, he found Silvia, only to see her abducted by the evil leader. Once Joe got to the stadium, \"Almighty Leader\" was revealed to be none other than Captain Blue, who attempted to break Joe's spirit and thus devastated Joe mentally before destroying him physically. But the words of those Joe had befriended in his adventures enabled Joe's confidence to return and fight Blue back. Piloting the King Blue giant robot, Blue was defeated by Joe in Six Majin.\n* '''The Black Emperor''': Leader of the Gedow, the invading alien organization of the anime's second season whose goal is to use their various monsters and foot soldiers to corrupt a movie and alter the ending, causing the film to radiate with darkness. Pilots a battle machine. The Black Emperor is a superhero named Jet Black, Joe's father, owner of the theater and Captain Blue's best friend. He turned evil by the Black V-Watch and the Black Film. He was freed from the Black Film's corruption by Joe and Silvia. In episode 50, it is confirmed he gave Captain Blue his scar with a swipe of his blade.\n\n==Media==\n===Anime===\n{{main|List of Viewtiful Joe episodes}}\n''Viewtiful Joe'' was produced by animation company [[Group TAC]].

[[Bob Papenbrook]], under the name John Smallberries, voiced Captain Blue for the show's first twenty-one English dubbed episodes. Papenbrook died on March 17, 2006 due to complications from a chronic lung condition, making ''Viewtiful Joe'' his final piece of work.<ref>{{cite web | author=DeMott, Rick | date=March 27, 2006 | title=Voice Actor Papenbrook Passes Away | url=http://www.awn.com/news/passing/voice-actor-papenbrook-passes-away | publisher=AWN | accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Paul St. Peter]] for the remainder of the dub.\n\nThe U.S. broadcast began with the fifth episode, with the first three episodes not being shown until a month later.<ref>{{cite web | title=Viewtiful Joe Episodes - Season 1-2 | url=http://www.tv.com/viewtiful-joe/show/33897/episode.html?season=All&tag=list_header;paginator;All | publisher=[[TV.com]] | accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=DeMott, Rick | date=December 16, 2005 | title=Kids\u2019 WB!

In Brazil and Spain, the show was aired completely uncut. In the English version, the name of Joe's flying machine, Six Machine, was renamed in the English dub to Machine Six. There is speculation that it was renamed because its original name sounded close to the phrase \"sex machine\". Also, Six Majin was renamed to Robo-Six. Joe's [[Finger (gesture)|middle finger]] was edited out in his henshin transformation sequence. Silvia's super hero alter ego is renamed from \"Sexy Silvia\" (which was also used in the games) to \"Go-Go Silvia\". Sprocket's jumpsuit is always zipped up completely, though it was originally unzipped (showing large amounts of cleavage) and one of her signature moves was to zip it up. This move was eliminated in the dub by cutting out the scenes, resulting in Sprocket having much less screen time than in the original.\n\nEpisodes of the series have been released on both [[DVD]] and [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]].<ref name=\"press\">{{cite web | author=GameSpot | date=January 5, 2006 | title=The Global Phenomenon Viewtiful Joe is Coming to DVD and UMD! | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/viewtifuljoe/news.html?sid=6141864 | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2009-10-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105111933/http://www.gamespot.com/news/the-global-phenomenon-viewtiful-joe-is-coming-to-dvd-and-umd-6141864|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> In North America, Geneon partnered with [[Foot Locker|Kids Foot Locker]] to promote the show by including DVDs with purchases at the shoe retailer.<ref>{{cite web | author=Johannes, Amy | date=February 8, 2006 | title=Kids Footlocker Lures Consumers with DVD Incentives | url=http://promomagazine.com/incentives/news/kidsfootlocker_dvds_020806/ | publisher=Promo Magazine | accessdate=2009-11-30 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713062830/http://chiefmarketer.com/incentives/news/kidsfootlocker_dvds_020806 | archive-date=July 13, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===CDs===\n[[File:Viewtiful joe soundtrack.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Viewtiful Joe'' CD soundtrack]]\nThe Japanese version of ''Viewtiful Joe'' features music composed by Takehiko Gokita and Yuusuke Hayashi.

[[Matt Casamassina]] of [[IGN]] praised the ''Viewtiful Joe'' for staying true to its source material. He states, \"[...]  the episodes never stray too far from the original subject matter. As a result, anybody who played the Joe titles will have a sense of d\u0113j\u0101 vu as they watch these toons. Viewers who know the franchise's history will find no contradictions in these episodes - merely more back story, most of it entertaining.\" Despite his appreciation for its artwork, Casamassina was displeased with the show's lack of animation.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> This was concurred upon by Zac Bertschy of the [[Anime News Network]] (ANN), who was also very critical of the show's English dub, giving the first DVD volume an overall \"F\". Specifically, he found that the localization's attempt to be [[Hip (slang)|hip]] with a nearly constant use of slang in order to cater to younger audiences resulted in a \"insultingly bad dub\".<ref name=\"annreview1\"/> Carlo Santos, also of ANN, had a similar opinion, and gave the second DVD volume an overall \"D\". He found fault not only in the voice acting, but the script writing as well. \"Joe's vocabulary is ''all, like, totally, DUDE'' every time he opens his mouth, and when he's not hamming it up with unconvincing slang, he's spouting lines that are supposed to sound witty but aren't.\" Santos also noted the series as being too repetitive, but enjoyed the anime's character design, coloring, and visual style taken from the games.<ref>{{cite web | author=Santos, Carlo | date=June 16, 2006 | title=Viewtiful Joe DVD 2 - Review | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/viewtiful-joe/dvd-2 | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> Buzz McClain of ''Video Business'' asserted that the show is \"clearly influenced by the animation style of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]\", and that its use of narrative is much more linear and easy to follow than other anime.<ref>{{cite web | author=McClain, Buzz | date=January 23, 2006 | title=Viewtiful Joe, Vol. 1 | url=http://www.videobusiness.com/ReleasesDetail/9677.html?q=viewtiful | publisher=Video Business | accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/vj/ Official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{tv.com show|viewtiful-joe|Viewtiful Joe}}\n*{{IMDb title|0464782|Viewtiful Joe}}\n* {{ann|anime|4325|Viewtiful Joe}}\n\n{{Viewtiful Joe series}}\n{{Group TAC}}\n{{Kids' WB}}\n\n[[Category:2004 anime television series]]\n[[Category:2005 Japanese television series endings]]\n[[Category:Anime series]]\n[[Category:Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Anime television series based on video games]]\n[[Category:Geneon USA]]\n[[Category:Group TAC]]\n[[Category:Superheroes in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:TV Tokyo shows]]\n[[Category:Viewtiful Joe]]\n[[Category:Works based on Capcom video games]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "date and number fmt", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewtiful_Joe_(TV_series)"}
