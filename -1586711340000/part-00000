It was named as British Weaving School and later East Bengal Textile Institute which was upgraded to offer diploma courses in Textile Technology. In 1950, it was once again renamed as East Pakistan Textile Institute. The institute was transferred to its present campus at [[Tejgaon]] Industrial Area in Dhaka in 1960.\n\n===College of Textile Engineering and Technology===\n\nIn the year of 1978, the institute launched a four-year period [[bachelor's degree]] program in Textile Technology by affiliation with the [[University of Dhaka]] and was upgraded into a college renaming it as College of Textile Engineering & Technology. Initially, intake was only 60 per year and since the introduction of bachelor's degree course, more than 2,800 textile engineers and technologists had graduated from this institution.\n\nThe erstwhile College of Textile Engineering & Technology had been an economically important institute under the administrative control of the [[Ministry of Education]] through Directorate of Technical Education which offered BSc in Textile Technology/BSc in Textile Engineering/BSc in Textile Management courses as a constituent college of the [[University of Dhaka]].\n\n===Birth of BUTEX===\n\nThe [[Bangladesh textile industry]] is the most important industrial sector as more than 83% of export earnings comes from this sector. Equipping the textile industry with qualified manpower with updated technical knowledge, expertise and skill is essential in building the appropriate backward linkages at the shortest possible time to face the challenges of quota-free post-MFA period.\n\nConsidering the importance of textile education and research, the government of Bangladesh took initiatives to upgrade the College of Textile Engineering & Technology to a university.

It was named as British Weaving School and later East Bengal Textile Institute which was upgraded to offer diploma courses in Textile Technology. In 1950, it was once again renamed as East Pakistan Textile Institute. The institute was transferred to its present campus at [[Tejgaon]] Industrial Area in Dhaka in 1960.\n\n===College of Textile Engineering and Technology===\n\nIn the year of 1978, the institute launched a four-year period [[bachelor's degree]] program in Textile Technology by affiliation with the [[University of Dhaka]] and was upgraded into a college renaming it as College of Textile Engineering & Technology. Initially, intake was only 60 per year and since the introduction of bachelor's degree course, more than 2,800 textile engineers and technologists had graduated from this institution.\n\nThe erstwhile College of Textile Engineering & Technology had been an economically important institute under the administrative control of the [[Ministry of Education]] through Directorate of Technical Education which offered BSc in Textile Technology/BSc in Textile Engineering/BSc in Textile Management courses as a constituent college of the [[University of Dhaka]].\n\n===Birth of BUTEX===\n\nThe [[Bangladesh textile industry]] is the most important industrial sector as more than 83% of export earnings comes from this sector. Equipping the textile industry with qualified manpower with updated technical knowledge, expertise and skill is essential in building the appropriate backward linkages at the shortest possible time to face the challenges of quota-free post-MFA period.\n\nConsidering the importance of textile education and research, the government of Bangladesh took initiatives to upgrade the College of Textile Engineering & Technology to a university. For this purpose, \"Bangladesh Textile University Act, 2010\" (Act no. 49, 2010) was passed by the Bangladesh National Assembly and the Honorable President gave consent to the act on 5 October 2010. The Act was made effective from 22 December 2010 as per SRO No. 395-law/2010 date 20 December 2010 of the Ministry of Education.

In 1995, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit, often dressed in an adult-sized [[romper suit]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''.\n\nHe again appeared with Reeves & Mortimer in the BBC series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall & Hopkirk]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with [[David Walliams]], with whom he had already worked in both ''[[Mash and Peas]]'' and ''[[Sir Bernard's Stately Homes]]'', to create ''[[Rock Profile]]'', a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nHis music video appearances include the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\", \"Jesusland\" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and \"[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]\" by [[Fat Les]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' at The Venue, London. He played the performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]].\n\n===''Little Britain''===\n''[[Little Britain]]'' is Lucas's most commercially successful work. The show came about when trainee BBC radio producer, [[Ashley Blaker]], tasked with coming up with ideas for a TV or radio series, bumped into Lucas in London.<ref name=\"jc\">[https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/comedian-ashley-blaker-my-unorthodox-life-in-little-britain-1.59969] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The two were old friends from Haberdashers' and Lucas took Blaker to the [[Groucho Club]], where he told Blaker of his ideas for a sketch show. Little Britain was launched as a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]] and it later became a TV series. Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently \"disabled\" [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], [[homophobic]] homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]], and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]]. In January 2005 Lucas and Walliams were named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful people in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Methven|first1=Nicola|date=11 January 2005|title=Lucas & Walliams 'funniest'|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lucas+%26+Walliams+%27funniest%27-a0126878529|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=MGN Ltd.|access-date=13 September 2017|via=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\n===After ''Little Britain''===\nIn 2005, he took his first role in a television drama, a supporting part as a [[Venice|Venetian]] duke in the BBC historical serial ''[[Casanova (2005 TV serial)|Casanova]]'', written by [[Russell T Davies]].

The show saw Walliams and Lucas each playing multiple characters but, unlike ''Little Britain'', it focused entirely on the working environment of the airline industry. In an interview shown on BBC 3 on 9 February 2011, it was stated that the creators considered bringing travel agent character Carol Beer from ''Little Britain'' to the new series, but decided against it, as they did not want viewers to see the new show as merely a spinoff. Instead, all new characters were introduced.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, Lucas appeared as the \"Generation X\" guest on the Australian game show ''[[Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation]]''.

In 1995, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit, often dressed in an adult-sized [[romper suit]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''.\n\nHe again appeared with Reeves & Mortimer in the BBC series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall & Hopkirk]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with [[David Walliams]], with whom he had already worked in both ''[[Mash and Peas]]'' and ''[[Sir Bernard's Stately Homes]]'', to create ''[[Rock Profile]]'', a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nHis music video appearances include the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\", \"Jesusland\" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and \"[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]\" by [[Fat Les]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' at The Venue, London. He played the performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]].\n\n===''Little Britain''===\n''[[Little Britain]]'' is Lucas's most commercially successful work. The show came about when trainee BBC radio producer, [[Ashley Blaker]], tasked with coming up with ideas for a TV or radio series, bumped into Lucas in London.<ref name=\"jc\">[https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/comedian-ashley-blaker-my-unorthodox-life-in-little-britain-1.59969] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The two were old friends from Haberdashers' and Lucas took Blaker to the [[Groucho Club]], where he told Blaker of his ideas for a sketch show. Little Britain was launched as a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]] and it later became a TV series. Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently \"disabled\" [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], [[homophobic]] homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]], and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]]. In January 2005 Lucas and Walliams were named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful people in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Methven|first1=Nicola|date=11 January 2005|title=Lucas & Walliams 'funniest'|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lucas+%26+Walliams+%27funniest%27-a0126878529|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=MGN Ltd.|access-date=13 September 2017|via=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\n===After ''Little Britain''===\nIn 2005, he took his first role in a television drama, a supporting part as a [[Venice|Venetian]] duke in the BBC historical serial ''[[Casanova (2005 TV serial)|Casanova]]'', written by [[Russell T Davies]].

The show saw Walliams and Lucas each playing multiple characters but, unlike ''Little Britain'', it focused entirely on the working environment of the airline industry. In an interview shown on BBC 3 on 9 February 2011, it was stated that the creators considered bringing travel agent character Carol Beer from ''Little Britain'' to the new series, but decided against it, as they did not want viewers to see the new show as merely a spinoff. Instead, all new characters were introduced.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, Lucas appeared as the \"Generation X\" guest on the Australian game show ''[[Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation]]''.

The polling was conducted using the standard [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] electoral method.\n\n==Background==\nMayor [[Cliff Skeggs]] was re-elected for a record fourth term. Skeggs split from the Citizens' ticket but was re-elected as an independent candidate.

Rebecca took the name '''Hazard''' and joined with [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]] in his new [[Injustice Society]] \u2013 which he called '''Injustice Unlimited'''. However, she refused to allow anyone to be killed, nor would she cause anyone's death in the process. They overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in [[Calgary]]\u2014namely [[Infinity, Inc.]] and a contingent of the [[Global Guardians]]\u2014and forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. Hazard took [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] and the [[Tasmanian Devil (comics)|Tasmanian Devil]] to Las Vegas and, with their help, financially ruined Mr. Taj, proprietor of the Taj Mahal Casino - it had been the crooked games of the casino which were in part to blame for her grandfather's suicide.

Though Hazard had previously voiced an unwillingness to take life, she consented to the murder of the super-powered Infinitors. The first target was [[Star-Spangled Kid|Skyman]], and he was successfully murdered by Harlequin. Within days Hazard joined with Harlequin and the Dummy to murder [[Pat Dugan]] working at Stellar Studios (the Infinity, Inc. HQ) outside Los Angeles. When Pat's young son became a collateral target, however, Hazard used her powers of probability manipulation to help save their lives \u2013 the Dummy decided instead to use Dugan as bait for the rest of the Infinitors. When the other heroes arrived at their HQ and the battle was begun, Hazard feigned the loss of her dice and did not join in.

She can cause good luck or harmful \"accidents\" to befall someone. The origin of her powers, nature of her dice, and the relationship between them are unknown. In addition, she keeps herself in good physical condition but has no known training in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n==Family==\n* Steven Sharpe III is Rebecca's grandfather and was the original [[Gambler (comics)|Gambler]] who vexed the original Justice Society in the late 1940s.\n* Steven Sharpe V is Rebecca's cousin.

A young woman plagued with bad luck, Rebecca \"Becky\" Sharpe is present during [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s return from the Speed Force that affected her and others on a bus with dark matter, giving her the power to emit a field that alters local probability, bringing her good luck while causing bad luck to everyone else within the field. In the episode \"Luck Be a Lady\", she is able to rob a bank by walking in and taking the money while mishaps befall the Flash and anyone who tries to approach her. Dubbed \"Hazard\" by [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Vibe]], Hazard sees this new power and its effects on those around her as retribution for her previous suffering. As she continues to benefit from her new power, the field expands and threatens to engulf all of Central City. After a burst of energy from the destabilized S.T.A.R Labs particle accelerator negates her power temporarily, the Flash is able to capture Hazard, and is remanded to [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]]. Hazard is featured again in the episode \"True Colors\", in which Barry befriends her after being wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of Clifford DeVoe. She confesses she means no harm to anyone and is scared of what her powers can do, and Barry inspires her to use her powers for good. When they find out that Warden Gregory Wolfe plans on selling them to [[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]], they attempt to break out, but they are cornered by Wolfe, who exposes Barry as the Flash. Out of range of the prison's metahuman inhibitors, Sharpe still decides to help Barry despite learning of his identity, knocking out Wolfe and the other metahumans, although she accidentally kills Blacksmith's guards when knocking out Blacksmith. Suddenly, the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]] appears and uses an energy blast to disable the metahumans' powers. Using the power he stole from [[Brain Storm (comics)|Brainstorm]], Thinker transfers his mind into Becky's body as well as steal [[Kilg%re]], [[Dwarfstar]] and [[Black Bison]]'s powers while killing Warden Wolfe. Barry runs towards her in an attempt to save her. With his powers disabled, causing him to run at the pace of a normal human, he can only watch as Becky helplessly cries for help before Thinker successfully takes over her body.<ref>http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/01/31/the-flash-season-4-episode-13-true-colors-preview/</ref> The Thinker then discovers that Becky's body is weakening, possibly due to the strain of absorbing multiple powers at once and he quickly abandons it, transferring his consciousness into the body of [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813191734/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/i.html Cosmic Teams history page]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Marvel Comics character|Hazard (Marvel Comics)}}\n{{more citations needed |date=October 2017}}\n{{Infobox comics character\n|image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Hazard\n|real_name=Rebecca \"Becky\" Sharpe\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Infinity Inc.]]'' #34\n|creators=[[Roy Thomas]]\n|alliances=[[Injustice Society]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Psionic powers that can alter probability as she wishes.\n}}\n'''Hazard''' ('''Rebecca \"Becky\" Sharpe''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=141}}</ref>\n\nHazard made her live appearance on the [[The Flash (season 4)|fourth]] season of ''The Flash'' played by [[Sugar Lyn Beard]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDuring the anti-hero mania that was sweeping the US (during the ''Legends'' mini-series, 1986), Miss Rebecca Sharpe took the opportunity to avenge the death of her grandfather, Steven Sharpe III alias the [[Gambler (comics)|Gambler]].

A young woman plagued with bad luck, Rebecca \"Becky\" Sharpe is present during [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s return from the Speed Force that affected her and others on a bus with dark matter, giving her the power to emit a field that alters local probability, bringing her good luck while causing bad luck to everyone else within the field. In the episode \"Luck Be a Lady\", she is able to rob a bank by walking in and taking the money while mishaps befall the Flash and anyone who tries to approach her. Dubbed \"Hazard\" by [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Vibe]], Hazard sees this new power and its effects on those around her as retribution for her previous suffering. As she continues to benefit from her new power, the field expands and threatens to engulf all of Central City. After a burst of energy from the destabilized S.T.A.R Labs particle accelerator negates her power temporarily, the Flash is able to capture Hazard, and is remanded to [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]]. Hazard is featured again in the episode \"True Colors\", in which Barry befriends her after being wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of Clifford DeVoe. She confesses she means no harm to anyone and is scared of what her powers can do, and Barry inspires her to use her powers for good. When they find out that Warden Gregory Wolfe plans on selling them to [[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]], they attempt to break out, but they are cornered by Wolfe, who exposes Barry as the Flash. Out of range of the prison's metahuman inhibitors, Sharpe still decides to help Barry despite learning of his identity, knocking out Wolfe and the other metahumans, although she accidentally kills Blacksmith's guards when knocking out Blacksmith. Suddenly, the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]] appears and uses an energy blast to disable the metahumans' powers. Using the power he stole from [[Brain Storm (comics)|Brainstorm]], Thinker transfers his mind into Becky's body as well as steal [[Kilg%re]], [[Dwarfstar]] and [[Black Bison]]'s powers while killing Warden Wolfe. Barry runs towards her in an attempt to save her. With his powers disabled, causing him to run at the pace of a normal human, he can only watch as Becky helplessly cries for help before Thinker successfully takes over her body.<ref>http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/01/31/the-flash-season-4-episode-13-true-colors-preview/</ref> The Thinker then discovers that Becky's body is weakening, possibly due to the strain of absorbing multiple powers at once and he quickly abandons it, transferring his consciousness into the body of [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]].\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813191734/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/i.html Cosmic Teams history page]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toWildcat (disambiguation)(link changed toWildcat (DC Comics)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(DC_Comics)"}

He was a [[United States Senate|US Senator]] from California, and in 1856 was the first [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] nominee for [[President of the United States]]. \n\nA native of Georgia, Fr\u00e9mont acquired male protectors after his father's death, and became proficient in mathematics, science, and surveying. During the 1840s, he led five expeditions into the Western United States, and became known as ''The Pathfinder''.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Fr\u00e9mont, the West's Greatest Adventurer: Being a Biography from Certain Hitherto Unpublished Sources of General John C. Fr\u00e9mont, Together with His Wife, Jessie Benton Fr\u00e9mont, and Some Account of the Period of Expansion which Found a Brilliant Leader in the Pathfinder'' (1928)</ref> During the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], Fr\u00e9mont, a major in the U.S. Army, took control of California from the [[California Republic]] in 1846. Fr\u00e9mont was convicted in [[court-martial]] for mutiny and insubordination after a conflict over who was the rightful [[California interim government, 1846\u20131850|military governor of California]]. After his sentence was commuted and he was reinstated by President [[James K. Polk|Polk]], Fr\u00e9mont resigned from the Army. Fr\u00e9mont led a private fourth expedition, which cost ten lives, seeking a rail route over the mountains around the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] in the winter of 1849. \n\nAfterwards, Fr\u00e9mont settled in California at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] while buying cheap land in the Sierra foothills. When gold was found on his Mariposa ranch, Fr\u00e9mont became a wealthy man during the [[California Gold Rush]], but he was soon bogged down with lawsuits over land claims, between the dispossession of various land owners during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the explosion of [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-Niners]] immigrating during the Rush. These cases were settled by the U.S. Supreme Court allowing Fr\u00e9mont to keep his property. Fr\u00e9mont's fifth and final privately funded expedition, between 1853 and 1854, surveyed a route for a transcontinental railroad. Fr\u00e9mont became one of the first two U.S. senators elected from the new state of California in 1850. Fr\u00e9mont was the first presidential candidate of the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], carrying most of the North. He lost the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] to Democrat [[James Buchanan]] when [[Know Nothing]]s split the vote. At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, he was given command of [[Department of the West]] by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. \n\nAlthough Fr\u00e9mont had successes during his brief tenure there, he ran his department autocratically, and made hasty decisions without consulting President Lincoln or Army headquarters. He issued an unauthorized emancipation edict and was relieved of his command for insubordination by Lincoln. Fr\u00e9mont appointed future commander-in-chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to his first command (the strategically important city of [[Cairo, Illinois]]), and wrote later that he saw in Grant an \"iron will\" to fight. Fr\u00e9mont drove the Confederates out of southwest Missouri and [[Action at Springfield|reoccupied Springfield]], the only Union success in the West in 1861. After a brief service tenure in the Mountain Department in 1862, Fr\u00e9mont resided in New York, retiring from the Army in 1864. Fr\u00e9mont was nominated for President in 1864 by the [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]], a breakaway faction of abolitionist Republicans, but he withdrew before the election. After the Civil War, Fr\u00e9mont lost much of his wealth in the unsuccessful [[Pacific Railroad]] in 1866, and lost more in the [[Panic of 1873]]. Fr\u00e9mont served as Governor of Arizona from 1878 to 1881. After his resignation as governor, Fr\u00e9mont retired from politics and died destitute in New York City in 1890.\n\nHistorians portray Fr\u00e9mont as controversial, impetuous, and contradictory. Some scholars regard him as a military hero of significant accomplishment, while others view him as a failure who repeatedly defeated his own best purposes. The keys to Fr\u00e9mont's character and personality may lie in his having been born illegitimately, ambitious drive for success, self-justification, and passive\u2013aggressive behavior.<ref>Andrew Rolle, \"Exploring an Explorer: California, Psychohistory, and John C.

Rolle, ''John Charles Fremont: Character As Destiny'' (1991)</ref> Fr\u00e9mont's published reports and maps produced from his explorations significantly contributed to massive American emigration overland into the West starting in the 1840s. In June 1846, Fr\u00e9mont's and his army expedition's return to California spurred the formation of the [[California Battalion]], and his military advice led to the capture of Sonoma and the formation of the [[Bear Flag Republic]]. During his lifetime, many people believed his 1848 court martial was unjustified. His biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote that Fr\u00e9mont lived a dramatic life, of remarkable successes and dismal failures.\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\nJohn Charles Fr\u00e9mont was born on January 21, 1813, the son of Charles Fr\u00e9mon, a [[French-Canadian]] immigrant school-teacher,{{sfn|Nevins|1931|p=19}}<ref>Chaffin, pp. 21\u201322</ref>{{efn|According to biographer Andrew F.

Pryor confronted Anne when he found out she was having an affair with Fr\u00e9mon.

Mary Lee Spence and Donald Jackson, editors of a large collection of letters by Fremont and others dating from this period, concluded that \"...in the California episode, Fr\u00e9mont was as often right as wrong. And even a cursory investigation of the court-martial record produces one undeniable conclusion: neither side in the controversy acquitted itself with distinction.\"{{sfn|Fr\u00e9mont|1973|p=xix}} Allan Nevins states that Kearny:\n: was a stern-tempered soldier who made few friends and many enemies&nbsp;\u2013 who has been justly characterized by the most careful historian of the period, [[Justin Harvey Smith|Justin H. Smith]], as \"grasping, jealous, domineering, and harsh.\" Possessing these traits, feeling his pride stung by his defeat at San Pasqual, and anxious to assert his authority, he was no sooner in Los Angeles than he quarreled bitterly with Stockton; and Fr\u00e9mont was not only at once involved in this quarrel, but inherited the whole burden of it as soon as Stockton left the country.<ref>Nevins 1939b, p. 306.</ref>\n\nTheodore Grivas wrote that \"It does not seem quite clear how Fr\u00e9mont, an army officer, could have imagined that a naval officer [Stockton] could have protected him from a charge of insubordination toward his superior officer [Kearny]\". Grivas goes on to say, however, that \"This conflict between Kearny, Stockton, and Fr\u00e9mont perhaps could have been averted had methods of communication been what they are today.\"<ref>Grivas, pp. 74\u201375</ref>\n\n==Fourth expedition (1848\u20131849)==\nIntent on restoring his honor and explorer reputation after his court martial, in 1848, Fr\u00e9mont and his father-in-law Sen. Benton developed a plan to advance their vision of Manifest Destiny. With a keen interest in the potential of railroads, Sen. Benton had sought support from the Senate for a railroad connecting St. Louis to San Francisco along the 38th parallel, the latitude which both cities approximately share. After Benton failed to secure federal funding, Fr\u00e9mont secured private funding. In October 1848 he embarked with 35 men up the [[Missouri River|Missouri]], [[Kansas River|Kansas]] and [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] rivers to explore the terrain. The artists and brothers [[Edward Kern]] and Richard Kern, and their brother Benjamin Kern, were part of the expedition, but Fr\u00e9mont was unable to obtain the valued service of Kit Carson as guide as in his previous expeditions.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PT5IAQAAMAAJ&q=Edward+Kern+1848&dq=Edward+Kern+1848&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBWoVChMIzYLMzrKMyAIVytCACh2okA2H  Google Books: \"Edward M. Kern, Artist and Explorer\"], by William Joseph Hefferman; University of California, Berkeley, 1951.</ref>\n\nOn his party's reaching [[Bent's Fort]], he was strongly advised by most of the trappers against continuing the journey. Already a foot of snow was on the ground at Bent's Fort, and the winter in the mountains promised to be especially snowy. Part of Fr\u00e9mont's purpose was to demonstrate that a 38th parallel railroad would be practical year-round. At Bent's Fort, he engaged [[Richens Lacey Wootton|\"Uncle Dick\" Wootton]] as guide, and at what is now [[Pueblo, Colorado]], he hired the eccentric [[Old Bill Williams]] and moved on.\n\nHad Fr\u00e9mont continued up the Arkansas, he might have succeeded. On November 25 at what is now [[Florence, Colorado]], he turned sharply south. By the time his party crossed the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] via [[Mosca Pass]], they had already experienced days of bitter cold, blinding snow and difficult travel. Some of the party, including the guide Wootton, had already turned back, concluding that further travel would be impossible. Benjamin Kern and [[William S. Williams|\"Old Bill\" Williams]] were killed while retracing the expedition trail to look for gear and survivors.\n\nAlthough the passes through the Sangre de Cristo had proven too steep for a railroad, Fr\u00e9mont pressed on. From this point the party might still have succeeded had they gone up the [[Rio Grande]] to its source, or gone by a more northerly route, but the route they took brought them to the very top of Mesa Mountain.<ref>Both Patricia Richmond in ''Trail to Disaster'' and David Roberts in ''A Newer World'' (New York: [[Simon & Schuster]], 2000) detail the exact route.</ref> By December 12, on Boot Mountain, it took ninety minutes to progress three hundred yards. Mules began dying and by December 20, only 59 animals remained alive.\n\nIt was not until December 22 that Fr\u00e9mont acknowledged that the party needed to regroup and be resupplied. They began to make their way to [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] in the [[New Mexico Territory]]. By the time the last surviving member of the expedition made it to Taos on February 12, 1849, 10 of the party had died.

The party journeyed between Missouri and San Francisco, California, over a combination of known trails and unexplored terrain. A primary objective was to pass through the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada Mountains during winter to document the amount of snow and the feasibility of winter rail passage along the route. His photographer ([[daguerreotypist]]) was [[Solomon Nunes Carvalho]].\n\nFr\u00e9mont followed the [[Santa Fe Trail]], passing Bent's Fort before heading west and entering the [[San Luis Valley]] of Colorado in December. The party then followed the North Branch of the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]], crossing the [[Continental Divide]] at [[Cochetopa Pass]] and continuing west into central Utah. But following the trail was made difficult by snow cover. On occasion, they were able to detect evidence of [[John Williams Gunnison|Captain John Gunnison]]'s expedition, which had followed the North Branch just months before.\n\nWeeks of snow and bitter cold took its toll and slowed progress. Nonessential equipment was abandoned and one man died before the struggling party reached the Mormon settlement of [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]] in southwestern Utah on February 8, 1854. After spending two weeks in Parowan to regain strength, the party continued across the [[Great Basin]] and entered the [[Owens Valley]] near present-day [[Big Pine, California|Big Pine]], California. Fr\u00e9mont then journeyed south and crossed the Sierra Nevada Mountains and entered the [[Kern River]] drainage, which was followed west to the [[San Joaquin Valley]].\n\nFr\u00e9mont arrived in [[San Francisco]] on April 16, 1854.

Kentucky was still \"neutral\", and Unionists there feared Fr\u00e9mont's action would sway opinion there toward secession. One group in Louisville telegraphed President [[Abraham Lincoln]]:\n\n:\"There is not a day to lose in disavowing emancipation or Kentucky is gone over the mill dam.\"<ref>Guelzo, Allen C. ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America''. p. 55</ref>\n\nLincoln, fearing that Fr\u00e9mont's emancipation order would tip Missouri (and other Border States) to secession, asked Fr\u00e9mont to revise the order.

President Lincoln told Jessie that Fr\u00e9mont \"should never have dragged the Negro into the war\".{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|p=179}} When Fr\u00e9mont remained obdurate, Lincoln publicly revoked the emancipation clause of the proclamation on 11 September. Fr\u00e9mont's abolitionist allies attacked Lincoln for this, creating more bad feeling.<ref>Guelzo, p. 56</ref> Meanwhile, the War Department compiled a report on Fr\u00e9mont's misconduct as commander in Missouri.

He issued an order removing Fr\u00e9mont from command of the Western Department, which was hand-delivered to him by Lincoln's friend [[Leonard Swett]] on 2 November. Lincoln's actions prompted much hostility among Radical Republicans throughout the North, even from old friends like Senator [[Orville Browning]]. Lincoln himself later privately stated his sympathy for Fr\u00e9mont, noting that the first reformer in some area often overreaches and fails, but he continued to insist that Fr\u00e9mont had exceeded his authority and endangered the Union cause.<ref>Guelzo, p. 57</ref>\n\n===Mountain departments (1862)===\nAfter being dismissed by Lincoln, Fr\u00e9mont left Springfield and returned to St. Louis.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}} On the outside Fr\u00e9mont expressed joy being free from the cares of duty, but on the inside Fr\u00e9mont was smolderingly angry believing the Republicans ran an incompetent war and that the Blairs, acting under malicious motives, were responsible for what he believed to be his unjustified firing by Lincoln.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}} More humiliations followed, Fr\u00e9mont's Zagonyi Guard was mustered out of the Army without pay, and all the contracts he made were suspended upon approval from Washington.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}} Pressure soon mounted among Radicals and Fr\u00e9mont supporters for his reinstatement of command in the Army.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}}\nIn March 1862, Lincoln placed Fr\u00e9mont in command of the Mountain Department, which was responsible for parts of western [[Virginia]], eastern [[Tennessee]] and eastern [[Kentucky]], although he had clearly lost trust in the Pathfinder.{{sfn|Nevins|1939|p=554}}\n\n====Battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic====\n{{see|Jackson's Valley Campaign|Battle of Cross Keys|Battle of Port Republic}}\n[[file:Battle of Cross Keys 1.png|thumb|right|Fr\u00e9mont fought Stonewall Jackson's Army at the '''Battle of Cross Keys'''.]]\nFr\u00e9mont and his army and two other generals, [[Nathaniel P.

Fr\u00e9mont's reputation, however, was damaged after he was relieved of command by Lincoln for insubordination. After leaving the Mountain Department in 1862, Fr\u00e9mont's active service career in the war virtually ended. Fr\u00e9mont's 1861 promotion of [[Ulysses S. Grant]], going against the grain of Army gossip, was fruitful; Grant went on to become the greatest Union general.

After his sentence was commuted and he was reinstated by President [[James K. Polk|Polk]], Fr\u00e9mont resigned from the Army. Fr\u00e9mont led a private fourth expedition, which cost ten lives, seeking a rail route over the mountains around the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] in the winter of 1849. \n\nAfterwards, Fr\u00e9mont settled in California at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] while buying cheap land in the Sierra foothills. When gold was found on his Mariposa ranch, Fr\u00e9mont became a wealthy man during the [[California Gold Rush]], but he was soon bogged down with lawsuits over land claims, between the dispossession of various land owners during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the explosion of [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-Niners]] immigrating during the Rush. These cases were settled by the U.S. Supreme Court allowing Fr\u00e9mont to keep his property. Fr\u00e9mont's fifth and final privately funded expedition, between 1853 and 1854, surveyed a route for a transcontinental railroad. Fr\u00e9mont became one of the first two U.S. senators elected from the new state of California in 1850. Fr\u00e9mont was the first presidential candidate of the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], carrying most of the North. He lost the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] to Democrat [[James Buchanan]] when [[Know Nothing]]s split the vote. At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, he was given command of [[Department of the West]] by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. \n\nAlthough Fr\u00e9mont had successes during his brief tenure there, he ran his department autocratically, and made hasty decisions without consulting President Lincoln or Army headquarters. He issued an unauthorized emancipation edict and was relieved of his command for insubordination by Lincoln. Fr\u00e9mont appointed future commander-in-chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to his first command (the strategically important city of [[Cairo, Illinois]]), and wrote later that he saw in Grant an \"iron will\" to fight. Fr\u00e9mont drove the Confederates out of southwest Missouri and [[Action at Springfield|reoccupied Springfield]], the only Union success in the West in 1861. After a brief service tenure in the Mountain Department in 1862, Fr\u00e9mont resided in New York, retiring from the Army in 1864. Fr\u00e9mont was nominated for President in 1864 by the [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]], a breakaway faction of abolitionist Republicans, but he withdrew before the election. After the Civil War, Fr\u00e9mont lost much of his wealth in the unsuccessful [[Pacific Railroad]] in 1866, and lost more in the [[Panic of 1873]]. Fr\u00e9mont served as Governor of Arizona from 1878 to 1881. After his resignation as governor, Fr\u00e9mont retired from politics and died destitute in New York City in 1890.\n\nHistorians portray Fr\u00e9mont as controversial, impetuous, and contradictory. Some scholars regard him as a military hero of significant accomplishment, while others view him as a failure who repeatedly defeated his own best purposes. The keys to Fr\u00e9mont's character and personality may lie in his having been born illegitimately, ambitious drive for success, self-justification, and passive\u2013aggressive behavior.<ref>Andrew Rolle, \"Exploring an Explorer: California, Psychohistory, and John C.

Rolle, ''John Charles Fremont: Character As Destiny'' (1991)</ref> Fr\u00e9mont's published reports and maps produced from his explorations significantly contributed to massive American emigration overland into the West starting in the 1840s. In June 1846, Fr\u00e9mont's and his army expedition's return to California spurred the formation of the [[California Battalion]], and his military advice led to the capture of Sonoma and the formation of the [[Bear Flag Republic]]. During his lifetime, many people believed his 1848 court martial was unjustified. His biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote that Fr\u00e9mont lived a dramatic life, of remarkable successes and dismal failures.\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\nJohn Charles Fr\u00e9mont was born on January 21, 1813, the son of Charles Fr\u00e9mon, a [[French-Canadian]] immigrant school-teacher,{{sfn|Nevins|1931|p=19}}<ref>Chaffin, pp. 21\u201322</ref>{{efn|According to biographer Andrew F.

After Benton failed to secure federal funding, Fr\u00e9mont secured private funding. In October 1848 he embarked with 35 men up the [[Missouri River|Missouri]], [[Kansas River|Kansas]] and [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] rivers to explore the terrain.

Already a foot of snow was on the ground at Bent's Fort, and the winter in the mountains promised to be especially snowy. Part of Fr\u00e9mont's purpose was to demonstrate that a 38th parallel railroad would be practical year-round. At Bent's Fort, he engaged [[Richens Lacey Wootton|\"Uncle Dick\" Wootton]] as guide, and at what is now [[Pueblo, Colorado]], he hired the eccentric [[Old Bill Williams]] and moved on.\n\nHad Fr\u00e9mont continued up the Arkansas, he might have succeeded. On November 25 at what is now [[Florence, Colorado]], he turned sharply south. By the time his party crossed the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] via [[Mosca Pass]], they had already experienced days of bitter cold, blinding snow and difficult travel. Some of the party, including the guide Wootton, had already turned back, concluding that further travel would be impossible. Benjamin Kern and [[William S.

The party journeyed between Missouri and San Francisco, California, over a combination of known trails and unexplored terrain. A primary objective was to pass through the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada Mountains during winter to document the amount of snow and the feasibility of winter rail passage along the route. His photographer ([[daguerreotypist]]) was [[Solomon Nunes Carvalho]].\n\nFr\u00e9mont followed the [[Santa Fe Trail]], passing Bent's Fort before heading west and entering the [[San Luis Valley]] of Colorado in December. The party then followed the North Branch of the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]], crossing the [[Continental Divide]] at [[Cochetopa Pass]] and continuing west into central Utah. But following the trail was made difficult by snow cover. On occasion, they were able to detect evidence of [[John Williams Gunnison|Captain John Gunnison]]'s expedition, which had followed the North Branch just months before.\n\nWeeks of snow and bitter cold took its toll and slowed progress. Nonessential equipment was abandoned and one man died before the struggling party reached the Mormon settlement of [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]] in southwestern Utah on February 8, 1854. After spending two weeks in Parowan to regain strength, the party continued across the [[Great Basin]] and entered the [[Owens Valley]] near present-day [[Big Pine, California|Big Pine]], California. Fr\u00e9mont then journeyed south and crossed the Sierra Nevada Mountains and entered the [[Kern River]] drainage, which was followed west to the [[San Joaquin Valley]].\n\nFr\u00e9mont arrived in [[San Francisco]] on April 16, 1854. Having completed a winter passage across the mountainous west, Fr\u00e9mont was optimistic that a railroad along the 38th Parallel was viable and that winter travel along the line would be possible through the Rocky Mountains.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Spence|editor-first=Mary Lee|title=The Expeditions of John Charles Fr\u00e9mont; Chapter 3; Travels from 1848 to 1854|year=1970|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|url=https://archive.org/details/expeditionsofjoh03fr}}</ref>\n\n==Republican Party presidential candidate (1856)==\n{{further|United States presidential election, 1856|1856 Republican National Convention|Bleeding Kansas|Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 399PX-~1.PNG\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = Election poster for John C.

On November 1, Fr\u00e9mont ordered Grant to make a demonstration against [[Battle of Belmont|Belmont]], a steamboat landing across the river from Columbus, in an effort to drive Confederate General Price from Missouri.<ref name=Catton_67>[[#Catton|Catton]], p. 67</ref> Grant had early requested to attack Columbus, but Fr\u00e9mont had overruled Grant's initiative.<ref name=Catton_p67-68>[[#Catton|Catton]], pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\n====Emancipation edict controversy====\n[[file:Abraham Lincoln O-55, 1861-crop.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Abraham Lincoln]] ordered Fr\u00e9mont to rescind his emancipation edict.]]\nFr\u00e9mont came under increasing pressure for decisive action, as Confederates controlled half of Missouri, Confederate troops under Price and McCulloch remained ready to strike, and rebel guerillas were wreaking havoc, cutting railroad cars, telegraph lines, burning bridges, raiding farms, and attacking Union posts.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|pp=498\u201399}} Confederate sympathies in stronger slave-holding counties needed to be reduced or broken up.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=177\u201378}} Confederate warfare was causing thousands of Union loyalists to take refuge, penniless, in Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=499}} Radicals in his camp and his wife Jessie urged Fr\u00e9mont to free the slaves of known Confederate supporters.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=499}} They argued that these men were in rebellion and no longer protected by the Constitution, and it was legal to confiscate rebel property, including their slaves.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=499}}\n\nSo, on the morning of August 30, 1861, at dawn, Fr\u00e9mont, without notifying President Lincoln, issued a proclamation putting Missouri under martial law.{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1pp=177\u201378|Nevins|1939b|2p=499}} The edict declared that civilians taken in arms against would be subject to court martial and execution, that the property of those who aided secessionists would be confiscated, and that the slaves of all rebels were immediately emancipated.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=177\u201378}} This last clause caused much concern. Kentucky was still \"neutral\", and Unionists there feared Fr\u00e9mont's action would sway opinion there toward secession. One group in Louisville telegraphed President [[Abraham Lincoln]]:\n\n:\"There is not a day to lose in disavowing emancipation or Kentucky is gone over the mill dam.\"<ref>Guelzo, Allen C. ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America''. p. 55</ref>\n\nLincoln, fearing that Fr\u00e9mont's emancipation order would tip Missouri (and other Border States) to secession, asked Fr\u00e9mont to revise the order. Fr\u00e9mont refused to do so, and sent his wife to plead his case. President Lincoln told Jessie that Fr\u00e9mont \"should never have dragged the Negro into the war\".{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|p=179}} When Fr\u00e9mont remained obdurate, Lincoln publicly revoked the emancipation clause of the proclamation on 11 September. Fr\u00e9mont's abolitionist allies attacked Lincoln for this, creating more bad feeling.<ref>Guelzo, p. 56</ref> Meanwhile, the War Department compiled a report on Fr\u00e9mont's misconduct as commander in Missouri. This included the arrest of [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.|Frank Blair]], which ended Fr\u00e9mont's alliance with the Blair family, who had backed him for the presidential nomination in 1856.\n\nFinally Lincoln decided Fr\u00e9mont had to go. He issued an order removing Fr\u00e9mont from command of the Western Department, which was hand-delivered to him by Lincoln's friend [[Leonard Swett]] on 2 November. Lincoln's actions prompted much hostility among Radical Republicans throughout the North, even from old friends like Senator [[Orville Browning]]. Lincoln himself later privately stated his sympathy for Fr\u00e9mont, noting that the first reformer in some area often overreaches and fails, but he continued to insist that Fr\u00e9mont had exceeded his authority and endangered the Union cause.<ref>Guelzo, p. 57</ref>\n\n===Mountain departments (1862)===\nAfter being dismissed by Lincoln, Fr\u00e9mont left Springfield and returned to St. Louis.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}} On the outside Fr\u00e9mont expressed joy being free from the cares of duty, but on the inside Fr\u00e9mont was smolderingly angry believing the Republicans ran an incompetent war and that the Blairs, acting under malicious motives, were responsible for what he believed to be his unjustified firing by Lincoln.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}} More humiliations followed, Fr\u00e9mont's Zagonyi Guard was mustered out of the Army without pay, and all the contracts he made were suspended upon approval from Washington.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}} Pressure soon mounted among Radicals and Fr\u00e9mont supporters for his reinstatement of command in the Army.{{sfn|Nevins|1939b|p=550}}\nIn March 1862, Lincoln placed Fr\u00e9mont in command of the Mountain Department, which was responsible for parts of western [[Virginia]], eastern [[Tennessee]] and eastern [[Kentucky]], although he had clearly lost trust in the Pathfinder.{{sfn|Nevins|1939|p=554}}\n\n====Battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic====\n{{see|Jackson's Valley Campaign|Battle of Cross Keys|Battle of Port Republic}}\n[[file:Battle of Cross Keys 1.png|thumb|right|Fr\u00e9mont fought Stonewall Jackson's Army at the '''Battle of Cross Keys'''.]]\nFr\u00e9mont and his army and two other generals, [[Nathaniel P.

Smith''' (1894-1969), was an American regional artist, often associated with Cape Cod.  He was a [[World Psychiatric Association|WPA]] administrator and as an artist he was best known for his [[Relief|bas-relief]] woodcarvings.  His works also include oil paintings, watercolors, [[batik]] designs, and constructions in aluminum.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===  Early Years ===\nBorn August 8, 1894 in [[Cortland, New York|Cortland, NY]],  Vernon Smith spent his early years in and around the [[Finger Lakes]] region.  In 1913, Smith began attending the [[Parsons The New School for Design|School of Fine and Applied Arts]] in New York City.  His painting instructors included [[Jonas Lie (painter)|Jonas Lie]], Howard Giles and [[Rae Sloan Bredin|Sloan Bredin]]. He learned metalwork, textile design, and interior decoration under the school's founder [[Frank Alvah Parsons|Frank Parsons]]. Smith taught for a year at the Manhattan School of Art.\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nIn April, 1918, Vernon Smith was conscripted into the Army and arrived at the front in July,  As a private, Smith's duties included camouflaging artillery and attending to mules. He often accompanied Sgt. Harry K. Fisk, a NY illustrator, to sketch advanced locations.\n\nAfter the war, Smith elected to stay in France where he spent time in Paris and then [[Poitiers]], where he enrolled at the Sorbonne Institute of Art.\n\nIn January 1920, Smith returned to New York City, where he met Doris Withycomb, who he later married.   After spending the summer running a tea shop in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown, MA]], Smith moved to [[Beacon Street]] in Boston, where he designed stage sets for the Peabody Playhouse.\n\n=== Cape Cod ===\n\nIn January 1922, at the invitation of Sally White Johnstone and [[Prescott Townsend]], Smith and Withycomb moved to [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]] on [[Cape Cod]] where they married and purchased a home.\n\nDuring his first decade on Cape Cod, Smith made his living designing [[batik]] fabrics and a product line of aluminum buckles and buttons.  He also opened a small antiques shop.  By 1927, the Smiths had three children:  Joy, Sara, and Peter.\n\nIn 1933, a group of Smith's neighbors on Monument Road organized an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] congregation: The Church of the Holy Spirit.  Smith designed the small church and outfitted it with engraved sconces, carved pews, and a crucifix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecva.org/exhibition/acs/orleans_1.html|title=Episcopal Church Visual Arts|last=|first=|date=2002|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  A small cultural movement formed on Monument Road which in addition to the church, included summer camps, an outdoor theater, and \"The Galley West,\" which sold local crafts including Smith's metal work.\n\n=== Federal Arts Project ===\nIn 1936, Smith was appointed supervisor of the Cape Cod artists on relief under the [[Federal Art Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-vernon-b-smith-11887|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> His charges ranged from \u201c[[Modernism|Modernists]]\u201d to \"[[Regionalism (art)|Regionalists]],\" which included among others:  [[Karl Knaths]], [[Blanche Lazzell]], Phillip Malicoat, [[Vernon Herbert Coleman]], George Yater, Eliot Orr, and Howard Gibbs.  He also associated with [[Ross Moffett]], [[Edwin Dickinson]], and [[Edward Hopper]] who he joined in group exhibitions and social activities.  Whitney E. Smith noted in his doctoral dissertation that \"The most important man for the Provincetown artists in [the FAP bureaucracy] was fellow-artist Vernon Smith.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2po7nSzMQC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=elliot+orr+artist&source=bl&ots=F19ns_te47&sig=37PLTDGb4JPkmq1WtRfa8u-IZ5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bzqHVeaXC5CyyASj_qSgAQ&ved=0CFoQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=elliot%20orr%20artist&f=false|title = The Federal Art Project in Provincetown, Massachusetts: The Impact of a ...|date = May 6, 2009|accessdate = |website = Google Books|publisher = University of New Hampshire|last = Smith|first = Whitney E.}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Smith was selected as one of twelve FAP artists to tour the territory of Alaska and record their impressions.  With fellow artists Prescott Jones and [[Edwin Boyd Johnson|Edwin Johnson]], Smith traveled to Valdez, Fairbanks, and McKinley Park.  Artwork from the tour was distributed to federal facilities, with much of it remaining in Alaska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpamurals.com/alaska.htm|title=Alaska New Deal Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring the early years of WWII, Smith worked in a ball bearing factory in Connecticut.  While in Orleans, he volunteered for shore patrol.  Later, Smith performed civilian service at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, charting ocean currents and lettering maps.\n\n=== Postwar ===\nAfter the war, Smith was represented by the [[Kraushaar Galleries]] in New York City.  He had a one-man show there in 1946 and participated in other gallery shows throughout the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/kraushaar-galleries-records-7781/more|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Smith's wife became debilitated with [[multiple sclerosis]] and died.  That same year, Smith helped found the Cape Cod Art Association in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]] and served as its president in 1951.\n\nSmith continued throughout the 1950s to teach art classes at his private studio and in public schools. He continued his artwork and exhibited widely.\n\nIn 1949 he married for a second time to Gwen Barry from New York.  This second marriage ended in 1961, after which Smith began to divide his time between summers on Cape Cod and travels around the country the rest of the year.  He set up a studio in [[Corrales, New Mexico]] where his son Peter Smith lived.\n\nIn 1963, Smith acquired a new dealer for his art in Lester K. Henderson from [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]].  Several times Smith stayed in Carmel where he showed his work and took on commissions.\n\nIn 1965, Smith suffered a stroke while in New Mexico.  Partially paralyzed as a result, this ended his artistic output.  He returned to Cape Cod and lived under the care of his daughter, Sara Smith Joy.  He died in September 1969.  His ashes were interred under one of his soapstone carvings at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Orleans, MA.\n\n== Art work ==\n\n=== Early works ===\nFrom Smith's time in France, the few surviving canvases display influence of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon]] school of landscape.  Other canvases, from his time at the Sorbonne Institute of Art, show the colorful, confident brushwork of a [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]].  His subjects were farms, peasants and flowering trees.\n\nFrom the 1920s, Smith's [[Batik]]s displayed themes from the ages of sailing ships and medieval fairy tale towns.  Crafts from this time consisted of hammered aluminum items such as buttons, buckles, serving trays, candle sconces, while from wood, Smith carved detailed display samples of classic cottage antiques.\n\n=== 1930s ===\nIn the early 1930s, Smith developed an \u201cantique\" style of painting.  Utilizing oil glaze over gessoed hard board, he scratched and scraped the surface of wet paint to create highlights.  [[Still life]]s featured antique props set up in his studio.  Landscapes depicted simple farmhouses and cottages in rural Cape Cod.  Smith limited his palette to basic earth tones, avoiding overuse of white, with dashes of red or viridian applied sparingly.  Smith completed the antique feel of his paintings by setting them in distressed frames.\n\nSmith continued to refine his \"antique\" style and apply it to the [[social realism|Social Realism]] movement in the later 1930s.  Cultural artifacts of the era populate his paintings:  telephone poles, storefronts, jalopies, fishing draggers, and catboats describe scores of paintings that he produced while employed by the FAP.\n\nFrom his FAP tour of Alaska, Smith's work features the re-occurring motif of modern man's herculean, but puny efforts to tame the vast Alaskan wilderness.  His paintings and drawings are replete with boats, wharfs, automobiles, seaplanes, and dredges placed against backgrounds of towering mountains and wild rivers.\n\n=== Postwar ===\nReleased from the troubles of the war, Smith was reinvigorated with artistic activity.  Beginning with \u201cV-J Day\u201d and through a succession of oil paintings, Smith's works became populated with the citizenry of Orleans.  Scenes of square dancing, mending nets, trick-or-treating, raising roof-beams, deer hunting, sunbathing, and picnics celebrated the vibrant character of small town America.  His palette broadened, while his compositions became more playful with ever-increasing abstraction and differing perspectives.  Boats, fish nets, beach umbrellas, and musical instruments took on [[Cubism|cubist]] arrangements.  As noted by artist and Professor of Art History Tony Ververs, \"Smith used a personal adaption of a cubist idiom, much as did Lassell or Knaths... a common practice among early abstractionists.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Vernon Smith|last=Vevers|first=Tony|publisher=Provincetown Art Association and Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Provincetown, MA|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Smith began to carve stylized birds and whales.  This led to a major new direction for Smith.  Abstract motifs from his paintings appeared on flat wood panels, carved in [[bas-relief]].  \"The Sea,\u201d a depiction of a half-veiled female figure floating in a liquid cosmos, is an early example of his new technique.  Other panels combine ubiquitous spirals with clusters of shorebirds, or diving whales.  Smith carved in deep-silhouette and accented the depth with a tight color pallet.  Human mythologies appeared as well; as in \u201cLeda,\u201d where the graceful arc of a swan's neck arrives at a woman's nipple.  Again, Tony Vevers: \"the adoption of a new technique and medium gave Smith a sense of freedom; the rather hesitant abstraction of his earlier paintings become a major theme in his new work.\"<ref name=\":0\" />  Wood carved panels became Smith's principal form of expression until the end of his career.\n\nSmith executed a number of church commissions. He carved crucifixes of simple piety, and created panels based on the meditations of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. He interpreted the [[Stations of the Cross]] for a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College and revisited the Church of the Holy Spirit, carving a set of doors depicting the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] as a dove. In the late 1950s, Smith produced a series of carvings of ancient alphabets and [[alchemy]] symbols.\n\nInfluenced by his friendships with [[John Hay (nature writer)|John Hay]], [[Clare Leighton]], Harry Holl, and [[Betty Lane]], Smith's work shifted toward conservation and naturalist education in the early 1960s.  Cell forms, starbursts, and extraterrestrial craters appeared in his carvings. \u201cGrasshopper,\u201d with a micro view from the grasses, was created the same year as \u201cCosmos,\u201d a macro view through a telescope.\n\n=== New Mexico and Carmel ===\n\nFrom his travels in the 1960s, Smith expanded on his motifs.  From the American Southwest, the confluence of geology, history, and the Native American community led to panels populated with cactus and yucca plants, canyons, and [[Pueblo]]s.  \u201cPueblo Village\u201d and \u201cMesa Verde\u201d exemplify the carvings from his expeditions to the southwest.\n\nThe time spent on the west coast, mostly in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]], resulted in additional motifs \u2013 seals, surf, redwood forests, waterfalls, and rolling hills.\n\nSmith's artistic work ended in 1965.\n\n== Quotes by others on Vernon Smith ==\n<blockquote>\u201cSmith is one of the few artists today whose work has an enduring quality which lifts it above the passing fashions of various \u2018isms.\u2019 His sense of design and subtle use of color is so beautiful that he has no need of momentary tricks to draw attention to his work.\u201d  -

Smith''' (1894-1969), was an American regional artist, often associated with Cape Cod.  He was a [[World Psychiatric Association|WPA]] administrator and as an artist he was best known for his [[Relief|bas-relief]] woodcarvings.  His works also include oil paintings, watercolors, [[batik]] designs, and constructions in aluminum.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===  Early Years ===\nBorn August 8, 1894 in [[Cortland, New York|Cortland, NY]],  Vernon Smith spent his early years in and around the [[Finger Lakes]] region.  In 1913, Smith began attending the [[Parsons The New School for Design|School of Fine and Applied Arts]] in New York City.  His painting instructors included [[Jonas Lie (painter)|Jonas Lie]], Howard Giles and [[Rae Sloan Bredin|Sloan Bredin]]. He learned metalwork, textile design, and interior decoration under the school's founder [[Frank Alvah Parsons|Frank Parsons]]. Smith taught for a year at the Manhattan School of Art.\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nIn April, 1918, Vernon Smith was conscripted into the Army and arrived at the front in July,  As a private, Smith's duties included camouflaging artillery and attending to mules. He often accompanied Sgt. Harry K. Fisk, a NY illustrator, to sketch advanced locations.\n\nAfter the war, Smith elected to stay in France where he spent time in Paris and then [[Poitiers]], where he enrolled at the Sorbonne Institute of Art.\n\nIn January 1920, Smith returned to New York City, where he met Doris Withycomb, who he later married.   After spending the summer running a tea shop in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown, MA]], Smith moved to [[Beacon Street]] in Boston, where he designed stage sets for the Peabody Playhouse.\n\n=== Cape Cod ===\n\nIn January 1922, at the invitation of Sally White Johnstone and [[Prescott Townsend]], Smith and Withycomb moved to [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]] on [[Cape Cod]] where they married and purchased a home.\n\nDuring his first decade on Cape Cod, Smith made his living designing [[batik]] fabrics and a product line of aluminum buckles and buttons.  He also opened a small antiques shop.  By 1927, the Smiths had three children:  Joy, Sara, and Peter.\n\nIn 1933, a group of Smith's neighbors on Monument Road organized an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] congregation: The Church of the Holy Spirit.  Smith designed the small church and outfitted it with engraved sconces, carved pews, and a crucifix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecva.org/exhibition/acs/orleans_1.html|title=Episcopal Church Visual Arts|last=|first=|date=2002|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  A small cultural movement formed on Monument Road which in addition to the church, included summer camps, an outdoor theater, and \"The Galley West,\" which sold local crafts including Smith's metal work.\n\n=== Federal Arts Project ===\nIn 1936, Smith was appointed supervisor of the Cape Cod artists on relief under the [[Federal Art Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-vernon-b-smith-11887|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> His charges ranged from \u201c[[Modernism|Modernists]]\u201d to \"[[Regionalism (art)|Regionalists]],\" which included among others:  [[Karl Knaths]], [[Blanche Lazzell]], Phillip Malicoat, [[Vernon Herbert Coleman]], George Yater, Eliot Orr, and Howard Gibbs.  He also associated with [[Ross Moffett]], [[Edwin Dickinson]], and [[Edward Hopper]] who he joined in group exhibitions and social activities.  Whitney E. Smith noted in his doctoral dissertation that \"The most important man for the Provincetown artists in [the FAP bureaucracy] was fellow-artist Vernon Smith.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2po7nSzMQC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=elliot+orr+artist&source=bl&ots=F19ns_te47&sig=37PLTDGb4JPkmq1WtRfa8u-IZ5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bzqHVeaXC5CyyASj_qSgAQ&ved=0CFoQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=elliot%20orr%20artist&f=false|title = The Federal Art Project in Provincetown, Massachusetts: The Impact of a ...|date = May 6, 2009|accessdate = |website = Google Books|publisher = University of New Hampshire|last = Smith|first = Whitney E.}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Smith was selected as one of twelve FAP artists to tour the territory of Alaska and record their impressions.  With fellow artists Prescott Jones and [[Edwin Boyd Johnson|Edwin Johnson]], Smith traveled to Valdez, Fairbanks, and McKinley Park.  Artwork from the tour was distributed to federal facilities, with much of it remaining in Alaska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpamurals.com/alaska.htm|title=Alaska New Deal Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring the early years of WWII, Smith worked in a ball bearing factory in Connecticut.  While in Orleans, he volunteered for shore patrol.  Later, Smith performed civilian service at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, charting ocean currents and lettering maps.\n\n=== Post War ===\nAfter the war, Smith was represented by the [[Kraushaar Galleries]] in New York City.  He had a one-man show there in 1946 and participated in other gallery shows throughout the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/kraushaar-galleries-records-7781/more|title=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Smith's wife became debilitated with [[multiple sclerosis]] and died.  That same year, Smith helped found the Cape Cod Art Association in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]] and served as its president in 1951.\n\nSmith continued throughout the 1950s to teach art classes at his private studio and in public schools. He continued his artwork and exhibited widely.\n\nIn 1949 he married for a second time to Gwen Barry from New York.  This second marriage ended in 1961, after which Smith began to divide his time between summers on Cape Cod and travels around the country the rest of the year.  He set up a studio in [[Corrales, New Mexico]] where his son Peter Smith lived.\n\nIn 1963, Smith acquired a new dealer for his art in Lester K. Henderson from [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]].  Several times Smith stayed in Carmel where he showed his work and took on commissions.\n\nIn 1965, Smith suffered a stroke while in New Mexico.  Partially paralyzed as a result, this ended his artistic output.  He returned to Cape Cod and lived under the care of his daughter, Sara Smith Joy.  He died in September 1969.  His ashes were interred under one of his soapstone carvings at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Orleans, MA.\n\n== Art Work ==\n\n=== Early Works ===\nFrom Smith's time in France, the few surviving canvases display influence of the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon]] school of landscape.  Other canvases, from his time at the Sorbonne Institute of Art, show the colorful, confident brushwork of a [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]].  His subjects were farms, peasants and flowering trees.\n\nFrom the 1920s, Smith's [[Batik]]s displayed themes from the ages of sailing ships and medieval fairy tale towns.  Crafts from this time consisted of hammered aluminum items such as buttons, buckles, serving trays, candle sconces, while from wood, Smith carved detailed display samples of classic cottage antiques.\n\n=== 1930's ===\nIn the early 1930s, Smith developed an \u201cantique\" style of painting.  Utilizing oil glaze over gessoed hard board, he scratched and scraped the surface of wet paint to create highlights.  [[Still life]]s featured antique props set up in his studio.  Landscapes depicted simple farmhouses and cottages in rural Cape Cod.  Smith limited his palette to basic earth tones, avoiding overuse of white, with dashes of red or viridian applied sparingly.  Smith completed the antique feel of his paintings by setting them in distressed frames.\n\nSmith continued to refine his \"antique\" style and apply it to the [[social realism|Social Realism]] movement in the later 1930s.  Cultural artifacts of the era populate his paintings:  telephone poles, storefronts, jalopies, fishing draggers, and catboats describe scores of paintings that he produced while employed by the FAP.\n\nFrom his FAP tour of Alaska, Smith's work features the re-occurring motif of modern man's herculean, but puny efforts to tame the vast Alaskan wilderness.  His paintings and drawings are replete with boats, wharfs, automobiles, seaplanes, and dredges placed against backgrounds of towering mountains and wild rivers.\n\n=== Post War ===\nReleased from the troubles of the war, Smith was reinvigorated with artistic activity.  Beginning with \u201cV-J Day\u201d and through a succession of oil paintings, Smith's works became populated with the citizenry of Orleans.  Scenes of square dancing, mending nets, trick-or-treating, raising roof-beams, deer hunting, sunbathing, and picnics celebrated the vibrant character of small town America.  His palette broadened, while his compositions became more playful with ever-increasing abstraction and differing perspectives.  Boats, fish nets, beach umbrellas, and musical instruments took on [[Cubism|cubist]] arrangements.  As noted by artist and Professor of Art History Tony Ververs, \"Smith used a personal adaption of a cubist idiom, much as did Lassell or Knaths... a common practice among early abstractionists.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Vernon Smith|last=Vevers|first=Tony|publisher=Provincetown Art Association and Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Provincetown, MA|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Smith began to carve stylized birds and whales.  This led to a major new direction for Smith.  Abstract motifs from his paintings appeared on flat wood panels, carved in [[bas-relief]].  \"The Sea,\u201d a depiction of a half-veiled female figure floating in a liquid cosmos, is an early example of his new technique.  Other panels combine ubiquitous spirals with clusters of shorebirds, or diving whales.  Smith carved in deep-silhouette and accented the depth with a tight color pallet.  Human mythologies appeared as well; as in \u201cLeda,\u201d where the graceful arc of a swan\u2019s neck arrives at a woman\u2019s nipple.  Again, Tony Vevers: \"the adoption of a new technique and medium gave Smith a sense of freedom; the rather hesitant abstraction of his earlier paintings become a major theme in his new work.\"<ref name=\":0\" />  Wood carved panels became Smith's principal form of expression until the end of his career.\n\nSmith executed a number of church commissions. He carved crucifixes of simple piety, and created panels based on the meditations of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. He interpreted the [[Stations of the Cross]] for a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College and revisited the Church of the Holy Spirit, carving a set of doors depicting the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] as a dove. In the late 1950s, Smith produced a series of carvings of ancient alphabets and [[alchemy]] symbols.\n\nInfluenced by his friendships with [[John Hay (nature writer)|John Hay]], [[Clare Leighton]], Harry Holl, and [[Betty Lane]], Smith's work shifted toward conservation and naturalist education in the early 1960s.  Cell forms, starbursts, and extraterrestrial craters appeared in his carvings. \u201cGrasshopper,\u201d with a micro view from the grasses, was created the same year as \u201cCosmos,\u201d a macro view through a telescope.\n\n=== New Mexico and Carmel ===\n\nFrom his travels in the 1960s, Smith expanded on his motifs.  From the American Southwest, the confluence of geology, history, and the Native American community led to panels populated with cactus and yucca plants, canyons, and [[Pueblo]]s.  \u201cPueblo Village\u201d and \u201cMesa Verde\u201d exemplify the carvings from his expeditions to the southwest.\n\nThe time spent on the west coast, mostly in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]], resulted in additional motifs \u2013 seals, surf, redwood forests, waterfalls, and rolling hills.\n\nSmith's artistic work ended in 1965.\n\n== Quotes by Others on Vernon Smith ==\n<blockquote>\u201cSmith is one of the few artists today whose work has an enduring quality which lifts it above the passing fashions of various \u2018isms.\u2019 His sense of design and subtle use of color is so beautiful that he has no need of momentary tricks to draw attention to his work.\u201d  -
