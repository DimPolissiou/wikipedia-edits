She attended California State University located in Fresno in 1969, taking up graduate studies in psychology. At this university, Lacy and fellow graduate student Faith Wilding established the first feminist consciousness-raising group on campus. This lead up to her attendance in Judy Chicago's Feminist Art Program during the Fall of 1970. The 1970s became a period where Suzanne Lacy continued to explore identities, women's bodies, and social conditions.\n\n== Performance art ==\nThe 1976 renovation of the Biltmore Hotel in [[Los Angeles]], California sparked Lacy's performance art piece, ''Inevitable Associations''. The marketing surrounding the old hotel's renovations paralleled the hotel to an old woman. Photographs showing the hotels' original structure stating \"There May Be Life in the Old Girl Yet\" forced Lacy to question the ways in which our society views older women. Throughout her career one can See Lacy's awareness and desire to rebuttal the invisibility of aging women (see performances ''Whisper, the Waves, the Wind'' (1984) and ''Crystal Quilt'' (1987).\n\nThe performance of ''Inevitable Associations'' took place over a span of two days in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel. The first day of the performance featured a public makeover of Lacy. It took nearly three hours for a makeup artist to publicly turn Lacy into an old woman. As the makeover was occurring, collaborators passed out flyers and literature on the hotel renovation as well as information about cosmetic surgery. Throughout the performance old women dressed in all black began to slowly enter the lobby and take seats on the opposite side of Lacy. This went nearly unnoticed until the number of elderly women had grown so large that their presence became undeniable to all of those in the lobby. Once Lacy's makeover was complete the mass of older women silently dressed Lacy in black clothes. The second day of the performance featured three elderly women participants who sat in red chairs in the lobby and told stories about their lives after the age of 60 and the effects of aging to passerby's and any audience that formed.  Lacy's goal throughout the performance was to bring awareness to the invisibility women must struggle with as they age and no longer fit into society's standards of beauty. ''Inevitable Associations'' was a crucial point in Lacy's career as it was the first time in which Lacy took her performance to the public streets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Felshin|first1=Nina|title=But is it Art?

The performance began when a group of exceptionally tall women, made taller by towering black headpieces, arrived at City Hall in a hearse, followed by a caravan of cars filled with women in black. The Performers debarked and formed a circle in front of the steps of City Hall, beneath a banner that read, \u201d''In memory of our sisters, women fight back''.\u201d  The artist's designed the performance, action and imagery, specifically to captivate the interest of television news; and, in successfully achieving this network coverage, used the media to critique itself\u2014which extended the impact of the art performance far beyond the usual feminist and/or art audience.<ref name=\"Wolverton\">{{cite book|last1=Wolverton|first1=Terry|title=Insurgent Muse: Life and Art at The Woman's Building|url=https://archive.org/details/insurgentmuselif0000wolv|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=City Lights|location=San Francisco|page=[https://archive.org/details/insurgentmuselif0000wolv/page/100 100]|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nParticipants from the Woman\u2019s Building, the Rape Hotline Alliance, and City Council joined with the [[feminist]] community and families of the victims in creating a public ritual of rage as well as grief.\n<ref name=\"homepage\" />\nLacy and Labowitz founded [https://www.againstviolence.art ARIADNE: A Social Art Network], a collaborative group to create community-based artwork and educational opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Suzanne|title=In Mourning and In Rage (1977) Suzanne Lacy and Leslie Labowitz|url=http://www.suzannelacy.com/early-works/#/in-mourning-and-in-rage-1977/|website=suzannelacy.com|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> In the mid-seventies, Lacy curated the first exhibition of women's performance art at Womanspace Gallery at The Woman's Building.

During the first two decades of the 2000s, she reworked earlier performances, including ''[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]'', based upon the venues and objectives. In 2012, she re-created the 1977 performance for the Getty Pacific Standard Time Performance Festival.

She attended California State University located in Fresno in 1969, taking up graduate studies in psychology. At this university, Lacy and fellow graduate student Faith Wilding established the first feminist consciousness-raising group on campus. This lead up to her attendance in Judy Chicago's Feminist Art Program during the Fall of 1970. The 1970s became a period where Suzanne Lacy continued to explore identities, women's bodies, and social conditions.\n\n== Performance art ==\nThe 1976 renovation of the Biltmore Hotel in [[Los Angeles]], California sparked Lacy's performance art piece, ''Inevitable Associations''. The marketing surrounding the old hotel's renovations paralleled the hotel to an old woman. Photographs showing the hotels' original structure stating \"There May Be Life in the Old Girl Yet\" forced Lacy to question the ways in which our society views older women. Throughout her career one can See Lacy's awareness and desire to rebuttal the invisibility of aging women (see performances ''Whisper, the Waves, the Wind'' (1984) and ''Crystal Quilt'' (1987).\n\nThe performance of ''Inevitable Associations'' took place over a span of two days in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel. The first day of the performance featured a public makeover of Lacy. It took nearly three hours for a makeup artist to publicly turn Lacy into an old woman. As the makeover was occurring, collaborators passed out flyers and literature on the hotel renovation as well as information about cosmetic surgery. Throughout the performance old women dressed in all black began to slowly enter the lobby and take seats on the opposite side of Lacy. This went nearly unnoticed until the number of elderly women had grown so large that their presence became undeniable to all of those in the lobby. Once Lacy's makeover was complete the mass of older women silently dressed Lacy in black clothes. The second day of the performance featured three elderly women participants who sat in red chairs in the lobby and told stories about their lives after the age of 60 and the effects of aging to passerby's and any audience that formed.  Lacy's goal throughout the performance was to bring awareness to the invisibility women must struggle with as they age and no longer fit into society's standards of beauty. ''Inevitable Associations'' was a crucial point in Lacy's career as it was the first time in which Lacy took her performance to the public streets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Felshin|first1=Nina|title=But is it Art?

The performance began when a group of exceptionally tall women, made taller by towering black headpieces, arrived at City Hall in a hearse, followed by a caravan of cars filled with women in black. The Performers debarked and formed a circle in front of the steps of City Hall, beneath a banner that read, \u201d''In memory of our sisters, women fight back''.\u201d  The artist's designed the performance, action and imagery, specifically to captivate the interest of television news; and, in successfully achieving this network coverage, used the media to critique itself\u2014which extended the impact of the art performance far beyond the usual feminist and/or art audience.<ref name=\"Wolverton\">{{cite book|last1=Wolverton|first1=Terry|title=Insurgent Muse: Life and Art at The Woman's Building|url=https://archive.org/details/insurgentmuselif0000wolv|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=City Lights|location=San Francisco|page=[https://archive.org/details/insurgentmuselif0000wolv/page/100 100]|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nParticipants from the Woman\u2019s Building, the Rape Hotline Alliance, and City Council joined with the [[feminist]] community and families of the victims in creating a public ritual of rage as well as grief.\n<ref name=\"homepage\" />\nLacy and Labowitz founded [https://www.againstviolence.art ARIADNE: A Social Art Network], a collaborative group to create community-based artwork and educational opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Suzanne|title=In Mourning and In Rage (1977) Suzanne Lacy and Leslie Labowitz|url=http://www.suzannelacy.com/early-works/#/in-mourning-and-in-rage-1977/|website=suzannelacy.com|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> In the mid-seventies, Lacy curated the first exhibition of women's performance art at Womanspace Gallery at The Woman's Building.

During the first two decades of the 2000s, she reworked earlier performances, including ''[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]'', based upon the venues and objectives. In 2012, she re-created the 1977 performance for the Getty Pacific Standard Time Performance Festival.

It was designed by [[architects]] [[Leon Levy (architect)|Leon]] and [[Lionel Levy]] in a modified [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], and included both a low building with exhibition space and a 26-story office block. The project also included the construction of a housing development directly behind the complex.\n\nThe Coliseum was planned by [[Robert Moses]], an urban planner and the chairman of the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]] (TBTA). In 1946, it was proposed to build a convention center within a new [[Madison Square Garden]] building at Columbus Circle. This plan was not successful, nor was another plan for [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. After years of delays, the Coliseum was approved in 1953, and construction started in 1954. The Coliseum hosted its first exhibits on April 28, 1956, followed by hundreds of conventions over the next four decades. The Coliseum supplanted the [[Grand Central Palace]] as the city's main convention center until the 1980s, when the Coliseum was superseded in that role by the [[Javits Center]].\n\nThe TBTA's successor, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), started looking for buyers in order to raise money for its operations.

It was designed by [[architects]] [[Leon Levy (architect)|Leon]] and [[Lionel Levy]] in a modified [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], and included both a low building with exhibition space and a 26-story office block. The project also included the construction of a housing development directly behind the complex.\n\nThe Coliseum was planned by [[Robert Moses]], an urban planner and the chairman of the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]] (TBTA). In 1946, it was proposed to build a convention center within a new [[Madison Square Garden]] building at Columbus Circle. This plan was not successful, as was another plan for [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. After years of delays, the Coliseum was approved in 1953, and construction started in 1954. The Coliseum hosted its first exhibits on April 28, 1956, followed by hundreds of conventions over the next four decades. The Coliseum supplanted the [[Grand Central Palace]] as the city's main convention center until the 1980s, when the Coliseum was superseded in that role by the [[Javits Center]].\n\nThe TBTA's successor, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), started looking for buyers in order to raise money for its operations. [[Boston Properties]] attempted to negotiate a lease between 1987 and 1994. The site was ultimately bought by a joint venture between [[Time Warner]] and [[The Related Companies]] in 1998, and the Coliseum was demolished in 2000 to make way for the [[Time Warner Center]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe {{convert|323000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Coliseum was located on the west side of Columbus Circle.

The exhibition space did not contain any windows; its exterior was instead sheathed in plain white stone.

[[Assist (basketball)|assists]], [[Steal (basketball)|steals]], and [[Block (basketball)|blocks]]. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders.

Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\n\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983\u201384 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985\u201386 season, but Iowa State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.<ref name=SPLIT>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/overview/history.html |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic

It is located on the [[Appomattox River]] (a tributary of the longer larger [[James River]] flowing east to meet the southern mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] at the [[Hampton Roads]] harbor and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]). The city is just {{convert|21|mi|km}} south of the historic commonwealth (state) capital city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. The city's unique industrial past and its location as a transportation hub combined to create wealth for Virginia and the [[Middle Atlantic states|Middle Atlantic]] and [[Southeastern United States|Upper South]] regions of the nation.\n\nEarly in the colonial era of the 18th century, Petersburg was the final destination on the [[Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System]] because of its location on the [[Appomattox River]] with its  connection to the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to the east at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]] (the head of navigation of rivers on the [[East coast of the United States|U.S. East Coast]]) and the tying in with the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] shipping traffic was a strategic place for transportation and commercial activities. It connected commerce as far inland as [[Farmville, Virginia]] at the foothills of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]] chain, to shipping further east into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=\"Ely2010\">{{cite book|author=Melvin Patrick Ely|title=Israel on the Appomattox: A Southern Experiment in Black Freedom from the 1790s Through the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bX2Pga6GLUC&pg=PA151|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-77342-5|pages=151\u2013}}</ref> For similar reasons, 17th century era [[Fort Henry (Virginia)|Fort Henry]] was built at the order of the [[Virginia House of Burgesses]] at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic.\n\nAs [[railroad]]s were being  constructed and extended in the state in the 1830s and 1840s, Petersburg was developed as a major transfer point for both north-south and east-west competitors. The [[Petersburg Railroad]], authorized in 1830, three  years after the first American railway, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O.]] in [[Baltimore]], by the state legislatures of both Virginia and North Carolina to the south, which opened in 1833.  It was another one of the earliest predecessors of the modern-day [[CSX Transportation]] system. Several of the earliest predecessors of the area's other major [[Class 1 railroad]], the [[Norfolk Southern]], also met at Petersburg. Access to railroads stimulated industry in the city, which was already established because of the water power available at the fall line, as the river plunged from the Piedmont level to lower tidewater lands.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), because of this railroad network, Petersburg was key to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] plans to capture the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] national capital established early in the war at Richmond. Nine months of [[trench warfare]] were conducted by Union forces during the 1864\u201365 [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Battlefield sites are located throughout the city and surrounding areas, partly preserved as [[Petersburg National Battlefield]] by the [[National Park Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]].\n\nThe city is also significant for its role in African-American history. Petersburg had one of the oldest [[free black]] settlements in the state at [[Pocahontas Island]]. Two [[Baptist]] churches in the city, whose congregations were founded in the late 18th century, are among the oldest black congregations and churches in the [[United States]].<ref name=Raboteau>{{cite book|last=Raboteau|first=Albert J.|title=Slave Religion: The \"Invisible Institution\" in the Antebellum South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3AQUK-6A2cC&pg=PA137|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517413-7|page=137}}</ref> In the 20th century, these and other black churches were leaders in the national [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s-1960s. In the post-bellum period, a [[historically black college]] which later developed as the [[Virginia State University]] was established nearby in [[Ettrick, Virginia|Ettrick]] in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]]. [[Richard Bland College]], now a [[junior college]], was originally established here as a branch of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg's]] famed [[College of William and Mary]].\n\nPetersburg remains a transportation hub, with the network of area highways including Interstate Highways [[Interstate 85 in Virginia|85]], [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|95]], and U.S. Route highways with [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|1]], [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|301]], and [[U.S. Route 460 in Virginia|460]].

This is in the early third of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]] (8000 to 1000 BC). Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years prior to European exploration and colonization.\n\nWhen the English arrived in Virginia in 1607, the region was occupied by the ''[[Appamatuck]]'', a significant tribe of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]].  They were governed by a ''[[weroance]]'', King ''Coquonosum'', and by his sister, Queen ''Oppussoquionuske''.  This [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking people later had a town at Rohoic Creek (formerly known as ''Rohowick'' or Indian Towne Run). Present-day Petersburg developed east of here.\n\n=== Founding ===\nPetersburg was founded at a strategic point at the [[fall line]] of the [[Appomattox River]] and settled by [[English people|English]] colonists. By 1635 they had patented land along the south bank of the Appomattox River as far west as present-day Sycamore Street, and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} inland.  In 1646, the [[Virginia Colony]] established [[Fort Henry (Virginia)|Fort Henry]] a short distance from the Appamatuck town, near the falls. It provided water power for mills and later industrialization. Col. [[Abraham Wood]] sent several famous expeditions out from here in the following years to explore points to the west, as far as the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Some time around 1675, Wood's son-in-law, Peter Jones, who then commanded the fort and traded with the Indians, opened a [[trading post]] nearby, known as '''Peter's Point'''.  The [[Bolling family of Virginia|Bolling family]], prominent [[tobacco]] planters and traders, also lived in the area from the early 18th century.  In 1733, Col. [[William Byrd II]] (who founded [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] at the same time) conceived plans for a city at Peter's Point, to be renamed '''Petersburgh'''. The [[Virginia General Assembly]] formally incorporated both Petersburg and adjacent Blandford on December 17, 1748. Wittontown, north of the river, was settled in 1749, and became incorporated as Pocahontas in 1752. Petersburg was enlarged slightly in 1762, adding {{convert|28|acre|m2}} to \"Old Town\".<ref>James H. Bailey, ''Old Petersburg'', p. 16.</ref>\n\n=== Revolutionary War Period ===\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), the British drive to regain control of the colony erupted in the [[Battle of Blanford]] in 1781, which started just east of Petersburg.  As the Americans retreated north across the Appomattox River, they took up the planks of the wooden Pocahontas bridge to delay the enemy.  Although the British eventually drove the Americans from Blanford and Petersburg, they did not regain a strategic advantage in the war.  Lord Cornwallis' forces coming up from the Carolinas into Virginia and occupied [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], waiting to meet a [[Royal Navy]] fleet. But were soon surrounded in a siege by a larger combined  American-French army which had swiftly slipped away from guarding British occupied [[New York City|New York Town]] and marched quickly south laying siege to Cornwallis who was now trapped and isolated when the French Navy's West Indies fleet under Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|de Grasse]] sailed north catching the British resupply and evacuation fleet, forcing its withdrawal in the offshore naval [[Battle of the Capes]] at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. A month later the beleaguered isolated Lord Cornwallis was forced to surrender to the superior allied [[Continental Army]]'s General [[George Washington]] and [[French Army|French]] general [[comte de Rochambeau]] in October 1781. Two years later after further infrequent conflicts  with dragged out treaty negotiations finally resulted in the Revolutionary War's end and British recognition of the new United States independence.  After the war, in 1784 Petersburg annexed the adjacent towns of Blandford (also called Blanford), Pocahontas and the outlying town of Ravenscroft, which became neighborhoods of the larger city. An area known as Gillfield was annexed in 1798.<ref>James H. Bailey, ''Old Petersburg'', p. 17.</ref> Residents' devotion to the cause of America two decades later during the [[War of 1812]] (1812\u20131815) led to the formation of the militia unit of the Petersburg Volunteers\u2014who distinguished themselves in action at the [[Siege of Fort Meigs]] on the [[Great Lakes]] frontier on May 5, 1813. Fourth President [[James Madison]] called Petersburg \"Cockade of the Union\" (which later was applied to the town as a nickname \"Cockade City\"), in honor of the cockades which Volunteers wore on their caps.<ref>James H. Bailey, ''Old Petersburg'', pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\n=== Free Black Community in Petersburg ===\nBecause of the availability of jobs in Petersburg, many [[free blacks]] in Virginia migrated to the growing urban community. They established [[First Baptist Church (Petersburg, Virginia)|First Baptist]] (1774) and [[Gillfield Baptist Church, Virginia|Gillfield Baptist Church]] (1797), the first and second oldest black congregations in the city and two of the oldest in the nation.<ref>{{cite web | title=Gillfield Baptist Church Minutes | website=VCU Libraries | date=2008-07-28 | url=http://www.library.vcu.edu/jbc/speccoll/vbha/gillmin.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019021534/http://www.library.vcu.edu/jbc/speccoll/vbha/gillmin.html | archive-date=2008-10-19 | url-status=unfit | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=First Baptist Church, Petersburg | website=AfroVirginia | url=http://afrovirginia.org/items/show/141 | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>  The black churches were the first Baptist churches established in Petersburg.<ref name=Raboteau /> For years the center of the free black residential area was [[Pocahontas Island, Virginia|Pocahontas Island]], a peninsula on the north shore of the [[Appomattox River]].  With access to waterways and a population sympathetic to refugee slaves, this neighborhood was an important site on the [[Underground Railroad]].\n\n=== Antebellum Period ===\nDuring the [[Antebellum period]] the Port of Petersburg on the became renowned as a commercial center for processing [[cotton]], [[tobacco]] and metal, then shipping products out of the region.  The city became an important industrial center in a mostly agricultural state with few major cities. Flourishing businesses helped the city make improvements.  Starting in 1813, the city paved its streets.  In 1816 the Upper Appomattox Canal Company completed the [[Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System]] to bypass the Appomattox Falls, in order to promote traffic up and down river to [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]] and power cotton and flour mills.\n\nAs early as 1836, Petersburg had the [[City Point Railroad]], which was linked to docks 8 miles away for transferring goods to large [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]-bound ships at [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]].  As travel technology developed in the mid-19th century, Petersburg became established as a [[railroad]] center. The [[Richmond and Petersburg Railroad]] was completed to Richmond to the north, the [[Southside Railroad (Virginia)|Southside Railroad]] to Farmville and [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] to the west, and the [[Petersburg Railroad]] to [[Weldon, North Carolina]] to the south. The last major line, the [[Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad]], was completed in 1858 to the east, connecting to the Atlantic Ocean port of Norfolk.\n\nIn 1851 the city introduced gaslights and by 1857 installed a new municipal water system.  All these civic improvements helped attract and hold a substantial business community, based on manufacture of tobacco products, cotton and flour and banking.\n\n=== American Civil War ===\n[[File:Essayons Dramatic Club - Siege of Petersburg.jpg|thumb|U.S. Engineer Battalion, during the Siege of Petersburg, August 1864]]\nAt the time of the [[American Civil War]], Petersburg was the second-largest city in Virginia after the capital, Richmond, and the seventh-largest city in the Confederacy. Petersburg's population had the highest percentage of free African Americans of any city in the Confederacy and the largest number of free blacks in the Mid-Atlantic region.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web | title=Proud, free and black: Petersburg \u2013 visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free slaves | website=American Visions| date=1994 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305233514/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032 | archive-date=2009-03-05 | url-status=unfit | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Civil War began in 1861, Petersburg was strategic in supporting the Confederate effort. The city provided several infantry companies and artillery units to the Confederate Army, along with three troops of cavalry. In April 1861 more than 300 free African Americans of Petersburg volunteered to work on the fortifications of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] under their own leader. Slaveholders also contributed the labor of numerous black slaves.<ref>{{cite web | title=Petersburg Black Confederates | website=Petersburg Battlefield | url=http://www.petersburgexpress.com/Petersburg_Black-CSA.html | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Siege of Petersburg ====\nIn 1864, Petersburg became a target during the [[Overland Campaign]] of Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Its numerous railroads made the city a lifeline for Richmond, the Confederate capital. After his defeat at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], Grant remained east of Richmond and moved south to Petersburg. Grant intended to cut the rail lines into Petersburg, stopping Richmond's supplies. On June 9, troops led by [[William Farrar Smith|William F. \"Baldy\" Smith]] of the [[XVIII Corps (ACW)|18th Corps]], attacked the [[First Battle of Petersburg#Background|Dimmock Line]], a series of defensive [[Earthworks (engineering)|breastworks]] constructed to protect Petersburg.\n\nGeneral [[Robert E. Lee]] arrived with his fabled [[Army of Northern Virginia]], and the 292-day [[Siege of Petersburg]] began. Due to botched Union leadership and arrival of Confederate General [[William Mahone]], the Union forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of the Crater]], suffering over 4,000 casualties. In early April 1865, Union troops finally managed to push their left flank to the railroad to [[Weldon, North Carolina]] and the [[Southside Railroad (Virginia)|Southside Railroad]]. With the loss of Petersburg's crucial railroad lines, the Confederate forces had to retreat, ending the siege in a victory for the Union Army. The fall of Petersburg meant that Richmond could no longer be defended. Lee attempted to lead his men south to join up with Confederate forces in North Carolina. Hopelessly outnumbered, he was surrounded and forced to surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], Virginia, on April 9, 1865.\n\n=== Reconstruction era ===\n[[File:SouthSideRailroadDepotPetersburgVA.JPG|thumb|right|South Side Railroad Depot on Rock Street which served as the office of [[William Mahone]] when his Readjustor Party dominated Virginia politics.]]\nIn the years after the Civil War, many freedmen migrated to Petersburg, founding numerous churches, businesses and institutions. The [[Freedmen's Bureau]] established new facilities for [[freedmen]], including a mental health hospital in December 1869, at Howard's Grove Hospital, a former Confederate unit. The U.S. Federal Government and the railroad companies repaired the damaged railroads to the city.<ref>{{cite book|title=Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv4qAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75|year=1900|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=75\u201384}}</ref><ref name=\"Burke2013\">{{cite book|author=James C.

The legislature also founded the state's first system of free public education.\n\n=== Readjuster era ===\nDuring the 1880s, a coalition of black Republicans and white [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]] held power for several years in the state legislature.  This resulted in two major public institutions in Petersburg, as the legislature invested for education and welfare. In 1882, the legislature founded [[Virginia State University]] in nearby Ettrick as Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute.  It was one of the first public (fully state-supported) four-year [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCU) in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]].  This was part of a drive to improve public education that started with the Reconstruction legislature.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/travel/articles/2005/03/09/civil_war_history_lesson/?page=2|title=Civil War history lesson Petersburg, Va., embraces and expands its past|last=Shorr|first=Kathy|date=2005-03-09|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>  In 1888, its first president, [[John Mercer Langston]], was elected to the [[US Congress]] on the Republican ticket, the first [[African American]] to be elected to Congress from Virginia.\n\nIn 1882, the state legislature also authorized moving the mental asylum facility to the Mayfield Farm and developing a new campus there.  This is the site of the present-day [[Central State Hospital (Virginia)|Central State Hospital]], which provides a variety of mental health services.\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\nThe limitations of Petersburg's small geographic area and proximity to Richmond are structural problems that have hampered it in adapting to major economic changes in the 20th century.  Other forces in the mid-20th century, such as industrial and railroad restructuring, reduced the number of jobs in the city. In addition, suburban development attracted people to newer housing outside the city.\n\nWorld wars led to major federal institutions being constructed near Petersburg, which created local jobs.  Soon after [[World War I]] started, the [[US Army]] established Camp Lee just outside of Petersburg in [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]] for training draftees.  The facility was used again during [[World War II]]. In 1950 the camp was designated as [[Fort Lee, Virginia|Fort Lee]], and additional buildings were constructed to house the U.S. Army [[Quartermaster Corps]] Center and School.\n\nDuring WWII [[Camp Picket]] was established west of Petersburg near the small rural town of [[Blackstone, Virginia|Blackstone]], and the [[Defense Supply Center, Richmond]] opened in neighboring [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield]]. In the postwar period, some of these installations have been reduced in size. In the 1950s, Petersburg became the southern terminus of the [[Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike]], predating the [[U.S. Interstate Highway System]].\n\nSince that time, Petersburg has struggled in competition with nearby Richmond, as the capital has grown to dominate the region in a changing economy as industries restructured.\n\n==== Jim Crow ====\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Virginia's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]\u2013dominated legislature approved constitutional changes that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites. Those disfranchised suffered major losses in the ability to exercise their rights as citizens. The legislature also instituted [[Jim Crow]] laws, including imposing racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]].\n\nWith many African Americans having served the nation and cause of freedom in WWII, in the postwar years they pressed for social justice, an end to segregation, and restoration of voting power.\n\nIn 1949 Petersburg businessmen and politician, [[Remmie Arnold]], the president and owner of the Arnold Pen Company, at the time one of the largest manufacturers of [[fountain pens]], launched a campaign for Governor of Virginia. As a Petersburg city councilman, Arnold had pushed through a budgetary increase earmarked for equality and fair access for public housing and recreational facilities for everyone, including people of color, and increased budgetary considerations for the black schools in Petersburg. Unusually for a Democratic politician in the Jim Crow South, Arnold promised to \"deal with all Virginians fairly\", whatever their ethnicity. He was endorsed by [[Arthur Wergs Mitchell]], the first African American to be elected to the United States Congress as a Democrat. Arnold ultimately lost the Democratic primary to [[John S.

Dr. [[Wyatt Tee Walker]], the pastor of Gillfield Baptist Church, had become friends with Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the early 1950s when they were both in divinity school in New York state.  In 1957 they co-founded the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), an important force for leadership of the movement in the South.  Walker also founded the Petersburg Improvement Association (PIA), modeled on the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]] in [[Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Wyatt Tee Walker papers | website=archives.nypl.org | date=1987 | url=http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20626 | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>  According to Walker and other close associates of King, Petersburg had played an important role, a kind of blueprint for the national civil rights movement.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s African Americans in Petersburg struggled to desegregate public schools and facilities. In 1958 the City Council closed Wilcox Lake, a popular [[swimming hole]] in Petersburg to prevent the lake's public recreational area from being racially integrated.  It never re-opened to swimming.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-08-28 | url=https://www.progress-index.com/article/20130807/NEWS/308079915 | title=Petersburg moving to reopen lake closed by segregation | date=2013-08-07 | language=en | website=The Progress-Index}}</ref> Through sit-ins in the bus terminal in 1960, the PIA gained agreement by the president of the Bus Terminal Restaurants to desegregate lunch counters in Petersburg and several other cities.<ref name=Arsenault />\n\nVirginia officials strongly opposed school integration following the 1954 US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. They initiated the program of [[Massive Resistance]].  For instance, rather than allow schools to be integrated, then [[Governor of Virginia]], [[J. Lindsay Almond]] ordered the schools in several localities including [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren County]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], to be closed.  The school board of [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]] closed the public schools for five years, starting in 1959.  In Petersburg, the [[St. Vincent de Paul High School (Petersburg, Virginia)|Bollingbook School]] opened in 1958 as a [[segregation academy]] for white students.<ref name=\"wm1996\">{{Cite journal|last=Tobias|first=Carl|date=1996-06-01|title=Public School Desegregation in Virginia During the Post-Brown Decade|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73967436.pdf|journal=William & Mary Law Review|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1261|issn=0043-5589|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:City Market at Petersburg, Virginia - Stierch.jpg|thumb|The [[City Market (Petersburg, Virginia)|city market]] that has been preserved and is still used as a market.]]\n\n=== Late 20th-century economic decline ===\nRetail and industry prospered until about the late 1980s. Petersburg was hit hard in 1985 when tobacco giant [[Brown & Williamson]], the city's largest manufacturer, closed a [[cigarette]] factory in town. De-industrialization, restructuring of railroads, and related national structural economic changes cost many jobs in the city, as happened in numerous older industrial cities across the North and Midwest. The post-World War II national construction of highways encouraged development outside cities and [[suburbanization]] added to problems. In addition, reacting to racial integration of schools in the 1960s, many middle-class families moved to newer housing in the predominantly white suburbs. They also moved to the Richmond metro area, where the economy was expanding with jobs in new fields of financial and retail services.  Some companies shifted industrial jobs to states further south, where wages were lower, or overseas.\n\nThe declining economy increased the pressure of competition and racial tensions in Petersburg. These flared from 1968 until 1980, when black members of the City Council accused the white Mayor of racism over a re-districting plan which they and the [[ACLU]] alleged was designed to allow whites to maintain [[white supremacy]] in the city. For decades, the city government was run by a small group of white businessmen and bankers. Most were wealthy enough to own homes in the exclusive Walnut Hill neighborhood and their interrelated families had been established there for generations. In 1980 one black councilwoman described the Petersburg city government as \"our own little version of the [[Byrd Organization|Byrd Machine]]\", comparing it to the political organization led by [[segregationist]] [[Conservative Democrat|Democrat]], [[Harry Flood Byrd]], that controlled Virginia politics for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/11/29/redistricting-in-petersburg-brings-charge-of-racial-bias/e0ccf7ff-fea0-4d37-9843-096d4cfdfc56/ |title=Redistricting in Petersburg Brings Charge of Racial Bias |last=Frankel |first=Glenn |date=1981-11-29 |work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-08-28|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1968, Petersburg was the first city to designate his birthday as a holiday; it has been memorialized as a national holiday.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn an attempt to stem its economic decline, in 1971 the city completed steps begun in 1966 to annex 14 square miles of land from adjacent and predominately white counties of Prince George and Dinwiddie. The annexation had been generally supported by the citizens of Petersburg, black and white alike, since the mid-1960s, as a necessary measure to allow the city of expand its tax base and its potential for growth and development. The city argued to the counties that it was better prepared to provide municipal-type services than the predominately [[rural]] counties and that the city needed more land for expected new development. The annexation was opposed by the county governments, who lost most of their commercial tax base, as well as the residents of the annexed suburban areas.\n\nFollowing the annexation, blacks realized that the annexations had added 8,000 new white residents. City council members were then elected at-large, requiring majority approval for each seat. Black civil rights organizations challenged the annexations in court, saying these were motivated to illegally dilute the voting power of blacks. A federal judge, citing provisions of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, agreed and ordered the city to be divided into [[single-member district]]s, or wards, to enable blacks the opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.<ref>{{cite web | title=City of Petersburg, Virginia v.

As residents of the city of Petersburg, their children would be required to attend the Petersburg City Schools, which had become predominately black due to whites sending their children to private schools or moving to suburbs.\n\nProjected industrial development of large tracts of vacant land in the annexed areas failed to take place. In 1985 Petersburg again sought to annex more land from Prince George County. This time the nearby City of [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]], a city that already had huge amounts of taxable industry within its borders, joined the annexation suit to try to annex commercial areas of Prince George County, including [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Fort Lee]] and suburban neighborhoods near the base where many military families live. Many residents of Prince George had relocated to stay within the county after the previous annexation by Petersburg. They were strongly opposed to another attempt by the cities to annex their neighborhoods. The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] also expressed strong opposition to the proposed annexation.  After five years of litigation, with attorney [[Richard Cranwell]] representing Prince George County, the Virginia courts, including the [[Virginia Supreme Court]], unanimously ruled that the cities had not shown that annexation would benefit their cities, nor was it necessary to provide governmental services to Prince George residents.\n\nThe prolonged annexation fight contributed to decades of racially tinged hostility between the county and city governments that have had negative impact on regional cooperation. Prince George County is predominately white while the city of Petersburg is roughly four-fifths black. These strained relationships have slowed regional progress and eroded business confidence, hampering economic development in the region to the present day.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chairman's Statement To Commission On Local Government | website=Prince George County, VA | date=2016-09-13 | url=http://www.princegeorgeva.org/news_detail_T6_R297.php | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, numerous remaining retail merchants, including [[Thalhimers]], [[JC Penney]], and [[Sears Roebuck]], left older shopping areas in Petersburg for the new [[Southpark Mall (Colonial Heights, Virginia)|Southpark Mall]] that opened in 1989 in adjacent, and predominately white, [[Colonial Heights, Virginia|Colonial Heights]].  A [[Miller & Rhoads]] store in Petersburg closed when the [[department store]] chain went out of business in 1990. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] had held marches in Colonial Heights. After the new shopping mall opened, blacks led by civil rights activist [[Curtis W. Harris]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] boycotted Southpark Mall for about five years. The boycott ended after the Mayor of Colonial Heights, James McNeer, met with Harris and members of his board to discuss job opportunities for blacks in the mall area. McNeer later became President of [[Richard Bland College]],\n\nIn the late 20th century, Petersburg worked to restore historic buildings and attract different kinds of stores and businesses to its historic center. During the [[1993 Virginia tornado outbreak]], Petersburg was struck by an [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornado that swept through the downtown area, seriously damaging a number of restored historic buildings and businesses. The same tornado also destroyed a [[Walmart]] store in Colonial Heights.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAs of 2007, Petersburg has continued to evolve as a small city, and its commercial activities have changed. Downtown Petersburg, known as Old Towne, has had new businesses established in the compact core: these include indie restaurants, bars and coffee shops. The long-abandoned Walnut Mall, which closed in the early 1990s, has been demolished. A new [[Food Lion]] grocery store and a [[Walmart]] opened on the South end of town. The Army has expanded activities at nearby Fort Lee, home of the [[United States Army]]'s [[Sustainment Center of Excellence]]. The Army's Logistics Branch, Ordnance, Quartermaster, and the Transportation Corps moved there from [[Fort Eustis]] following the round of [[Base Realignment and Closure]] actions in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/brac_closures_list.pdf|title=Appendix K: Department of Defense Proposed 2005 Realignment and Closure List|date=2005|website=2005 Base Realignment and Closure|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Petersburg faced the prospect of large-scale cuts to public services after a state audit found a $12 million budget shortfall and the prospect of insolvency by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schneider|first1=Gregory S.|title=City on the brink: Petersburg can't pay its bills and time is running out|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/city-on-the-brink-petersburg-cant-pay-its-bills-and-time-is-running-out/2016/09/04/9327c962-6ef9-11e6-8533-6b0b0ded0253_story.html|accessdate=5 September 2016|work=Washington Post|issue=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nPetersburg is located at {{Coord|37|12|46|N|77|24|1|W|type:city}} (37.21295, -77.400417).\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.2|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|22.9|sqmi|1}} of land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|1}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nPetersburg is located on the [[Appomattox River]] at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], which marks the area where the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region (continental [[bedrock]]) and the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] (unconsolidated sediments) meet.

One member is elected to the council from each of the city's seven wards, or [[single-member district]]s. The city council then hires a city manager.\n\nThe city council elects one of its members to serve as mayor and one member to serve as vice mayor, but generally those positions have the authority only of being chair and vice chair of the city council.\n\nThe members of city council:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.petersburgva.gov/123/City-Council?nid=123|title=City Council &#124; Petersburg, VA \u2013 Official Website|website=www.petersburgva.gov}}</ref>\n* Ward One: Treska Wilson-Smith\n* Ward Two: Darrin Hill\n* Ward Three: Samuel Parham (Mayor)\n* Ward Four: Charles H. Cuthburt\n* Ward Five: W. Howard Myers\n* Ward Six:  Annette Smith-Lee\n* Ward Seven: John Hart (Vice Mayor)\n\nThe majority-black population has continued to support primarily Democratic Party candidates since the national party's support for the civil rights movement and federal legislation in the mid-1960s. The independent city is represented by Joseph Preston in the state House of Delegates (63rd District) and Rosalyn R. Dance in the State Senate (16th District). Both Preston and Dance are Democrats. Six of the City Council representatives are confirmed Democrats, including the mayor and vice-mayor. All the local constitutional officers are also Democrats. In 2008, Petersburg gave the second-largest percentage of votes for the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama of any municipality in the nation.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

It is located on the [[Appomattox River]] (a tributary of the longer larger [[James River]] flowing east to meet the southern mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] at the [[Hampton Roads]] harbor and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]). The city is just {{convert|21|mi|km}} south of the historic commonwealth (state) capital city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. The city's unique industrial past and its location as a transportation hub combined to create wealth for Virginia and the [[Middle Atlantic states|Middle Atlantic]] and [[Southeastern United States|Upper South]] regions of the nation.\n\nEarly in the colonial era of the 18th century, Petersburg was the final destination on the [[Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System]] because of its location on the [[Appomattox River]] with its  connection to the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to the east at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]] (the head of navigation of rivers on the [[East coast of the United States|U.S. East Coast]]) and the tying in with the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] shipping traffic was a strategic place for transportation and commercial activities. It connected commerce as far inland as [[Farmville, Virginia]] at the foothills of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]] chain, to shipping further east into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=\"Ely2010\">{{cite book|author=Melvin Patrick Ely|title=Israel on the Appomattox: A Southern Experiment in Black Freedom from the 1790s Through the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bX2Pga6GLUC&pg=PA151|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-77342-5|pages=151\u2013}}</ref> For similar reasons, 17th century era [[Fort Henry (Virginia)|Fort Henry]] was built at the order of the [[Virginia House of Burgesses]] at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic.\n\nAs [[railroad]]s were being  constructed and extended in the state in the 1830s and 1840s, Petersburg was developed as a major transfer point for both north-south and east-west competitors. The [[Petersburg Railroad]], authorized in 1830, three  years after the first American railway, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B.& O.]] in [[Baltimore]], by the state legislatures of both Virginia and North Carolina to the south, which opened in 1833.  It was another one of the earliest predecessors of the modern-day [[CSX Transportation]] system. Several of the earliest predecessors of the area's other major [[Class 1 railroad]], the [[Norfolk Southern]], also met at Petersburg. Access to railroads stimulated industry in the city, which was already established because of the water power available at the fall line, as the river plunged from the Piedmont level to lower tidewater lands.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), because of this railroad network, Petersburg was key to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] plans to capture the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] national capital established early in the war at Richmond. Nine months of [[trench warfare]] were conducted by Union forces during the 1864\u201365 [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Battlefield sites are located throughout the city and surrounding areas, partly preserved as [[Petersburg National Battlefield]] by the [[National Park Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]].\n\nThe city is also significant for its role in African-American history. Petersburg had one of the oldest [[free black]] settlements in the state at [[Pocahontas Island]]. Two [[Baptist]] churches in the city, whose congregations were founded in the late 18th century, are among the oldest black congregations and churches in the [[United States]].<ref name=Raboteau>{{cite book|last=Raboteau|first=Albert J.|title=Slave Religion: The \"Invisible Institution\" in the Antebellum South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3AQUK-6A2cC&pg=PA137|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517413-7|page=137}}</ref> In the 20th century, these and other black churches were leaders in the national [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s-1960s. In the post-bellum period, a [[historically black college]] which later developed as the [[Virginia State University]] was established nearby in [[Ettrick, Virginia|Ettrick]] in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]]. [[Richard Bland College]], now a [[junior college]], was originally established here as a branch of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg's]] famed [[College of William and Mary]].\n\nPetersburg remains a transportation hub, with the network of area highways including Interstate Highways [[Interstate 85 in Virginia|85]], [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|95]], and U.S. Route highways with [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|1]], [[U.S. Route 301 in Virginia|301]], and [[U.S. Route 460 in Virginia|460]].

This is in the early third of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]] (8000 to 1000 BC). Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years prior to European exploration and colonization.\n\nWhen the English arrived in Virginia in 1607, the region was occupied by the ''[[Appamatuck]]'', a significant tribe of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]].  They were governed by a ''[[weroance]]'', King ''Coquonosum'', and by his sister, Queen ''Oppussoquionuske''.  This [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking people later had a town at Rohoic Creek (formerly known as ''Rohowick'' or Indian Towne Run). Present-day Petersburg developed east of here.\n\n=== Founding ===\nPetersburg was founded at a strategic point at the [[fall line]] of the [[Appomattox River]] and settled by [[English people|English]] colonists. By 1635 they had patented land along the south bank of the Appomattox River as far west as present-day Sycamore Street, and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} inland.  In 1646, the [[Virginia Colony]] established [[Fort Henry (Virginia)|Fort Henry]] a short distance from the Appamatuck town, near the falls. It provided water power for mills and later industrialization. Col. [[Abraham Wood]] sent several famous expeditions out from here in the following years to explore points to the west, as far as the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Some time around 1675, Wood's son-in-law, Peter Jones, who then commanded the fort and traded with the Indians, opened a [[trading post]] nearby, known as '''Peter's Point'''.  The [[Bolling family of Virginia|Bolling family]], prominent [[tobacco]] planters and traders, also lived in the area from the early 18th century.  In 1733, Col. [[William Byrd II]] (who founded [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] at the same time) conceived plans for a city at Peter's Point, to be renamed '''Petersburgh'''. The [[Virginia General Assembly]] formally incorporated both Petersburg and adjacent Blandford on December 17, 1748. Wittontown, north of the river, was settled in 1749, and became incorporated as Pocahontas in 1752. Petersburg was enlarged slightly in 1762, adding {{convert|28|acre|m2}} to \"Old Town\".<ref>James H. Bailey, ''Old Petersburg'', p. 16.</ref>\n\n=== Revolutionary War Period ===\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), the British drive to regain control of the colony erupted in the [[Battle of Blanford]] in 1781, which started just east of Petersburg.  As the Americans retreated north across the Appomattox River, they took up the planks of the wooden Pocahontas bridge to delay the enemy.  Although the British eventually drove the Americans from Blanford and Petersburg, they did not regain a strategic advantage in the war.  Lord Cornwallis' forces coming up from the Carolinas into Virginia and occupied [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], waiting to meet a [[Royal Navy]] fleet. But were soon surrounded in a siege by a larger combined  American-French army which had swiftly slipped away from guarding British occupied [[New York City|New York Town]] and marched quickly south laying siege to Cornwallis who was now trapped and isolated when the French Navy's West Indies fleet under Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|de Grasse]] sailed north catching the British resupply and evacuation fleet, forcing its withdrawal in the offshore naval [[Battle of the Capes]] at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. A month later the beleaguered isolated Lord Cornwallis was forced to surrender to the superior allied [[Continental Army]]'s General [[George Washington]] and [[French Army|French]] general [[comte de Rochambeau]] in October 1781. Two years later after further infrequent conflicts  with dragged out treaty negotiations finally resulted in the Revolutionary War's end and British recognition of the new United States independence.  After the war, in 1784 Petersburg annexed the adjacent towns of Blandford (also called Blanford), Pocahontas and the outlying town of Ravenscroft, which became neighborhoods of the larger city. An area known as Gillfield was annexed in 1798.<ref>James H. Bailey, ''Old Petersburg'', p. 17.</ref> Residents' devotion to the cause of America two decades later during the [[War of 1812]] (1812\u20131815) led to the formation of the militia unit of the Petersburg Volunteers\u2014who distinguished themselves in action at the [[Siege of Fort Meigs]] on the [[Great Lakes]] frontier on May 5, 1813. Fourth President [[James Madison]] called Petersburg \"Cockade of the Union\" (which later was applied to the town as a nickname \"Cockade City\"), in honor of the cockades which Volunteers wore on their caps.<ref>James H. Bailey, ''Old Petersburg'', pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\n=== Free Black Community in Petersburg ===\nBecause of the availability of jobs in Petersburg, many [[free blacks]] in Virginia migrated to the growing urban community. They established [[First Baptist Church (Petersburg, Virginia)|First Baptist]] (1774) and [[Gillfield Baptist Church, Virginia|Gillfield Baptist Church]] (1797), the first and second oldest black congregations in the city and two of the oldest in the nation.<ref>{{cite web | title=Gillfield Baptist Church Minutes | website=VCU Libraries | date=2008-07-28 | url=http://www.library.vcu.edu/jbc/speccoll/vbha/gillmin.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019021534/http://www.library.vcu.edu/jbc/speccoll/vbha/gillmin.html | archive-date=2008-10-19 | url-status=unfit | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=First Baptist Church, Petersburg | website=AfroVirginia | url=http://afrovirginia.org/items/show/141 | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>  The black churches were the first Baptist churches established in Petersburg.<ref name=Raboteau /> For years the center of the free black residential area was [[Pocahontas Island, Virginia|Pocahontas Island]], a peninsula on the north shore of the [[Appomattox River]].  With access to waterways and a population sympathetic to refugee slaves, this neighborhood was an important site on the [[Underground Railroad]].\n\n=== Antebellum Period ===\nDuring the [[Antebellum period]] the Port of Petersburg on the became renowned as a commercial center for processing [[cotton]], [[tobacco]] and metal, then shipping products out of the region.  The city became an important industrial center in a mostly agricultural state with few major cities. Flourishing businesses helped the city make improvements.  Starting in 1813, the city paved its streets.  In 1816 the Upper Appomattox Canal Company completed the [[Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System]] to bypass the Appomattox Falls, in order to promote traffic up and down river to [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]] and power cotton and flour mills.\n\nAs early as 1836, Petersburg had the [[City Point Railroad]], which was linked to docks 8 miles away for transferring goods to large [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]-bound ships at [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]].  As travel technology developed in the mid-19th century, Petersburg became established as a [[railroad]] center. The [[Richmond and Petersburg Railroad]] was completed to Richmond to the north, the [[Southside Railroad (Virginia)|Southside Railroad]] to Farmville and [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] to the west, and the [[Petersburg Railroad]] to [[Weldon, North Carolina]] to the south. The last major line, the [[Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad]], was completed in 1858 to the east, connecting to the Atlantic Ocean port of Norfolk.\n\nIn 1851 the city introduced gaslights and by 1857 installed a new municipal water system.  All these civic improvements helped attract and hold a substantial business community, based on manufacture of tobacco products, cotton and flour and banking.\n\n=== American Civil War ===\n[[File:Essayons Dramatic Club - Siege of Petersburg.jpg|thumb|U.S. Engineer Battalion, during the Siege of Petersburg, August 1864]]\nAt the time of the [[American Civil War]], Petersburg was the second-largest city in Virginia after the capital, Richmond, and the seventh-largest city in the Confederacy. Petersburg's population had the highest percentage of free African Americans of any city in the Confederacy and the largest number of free blacks in the Mid-Atlantic region.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web | title=Proud, free and black: Petersburg \u2013 visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free slaves | website=American Visions| date=1994 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305233514/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n3_v9/ai_15495032 | archive-date=2009-03-05 | url-status=unfit | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Civil War began in 1861, Petersburg was strategic in supporting the Confederate effort. The city provided several infantry companies and artillery units to the Confederate Army, along with three troops of cavalry. In April 1861 more than 300 free African Americans of Petersburg volunteered to work on the fortifications of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] under their own leader. Slaveholders also contributed the labor of numerous black slaves.<ref>{{cite web | title=Petersburg Black Confederates | website=Petersburg Battlefield | url=http://www.petersburgexpress.com/Petersburg_Black-CSA.html | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Siege of Petersburg ====\nIn 1864, Petersburg became a target during the [[Overland Campaign]] of Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Its numerous railroads made the city a lifeline for Richmond, the Confederate capital. After his defeat at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]], Grant remained east of Richmond and moved south to Petersburg. Grant intended to cut the rail lines into Petersburg, stopping Richmond's supplies. On June 9, troops led by [[William Farrar Smith|William F. \"Baldy\" Smith]] of the [[XVIII Corps (ACW)|18th Corps]], attacked the [[First Battle of Petersburg#Background|Dimmock Line]], a series of defensive [[Earthworks (engineering)|breastworks]] constructed to protect Petersburg.\n\nGeneral [[Robert E. Lee]] arrived with his fabled [[Army of Northern Virginia]], and the 292-day [[Siege of Petersburg]] began. Due to botched Union leadership and arrival of Confederate General [[William Mahone]], the Union forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of the Crater]], suffering over 4,000 casualties. In early April 1865, Union troops finally managed to push their left flank to the railroad to [[Weldon, North Carolina]] and the [[Southside Railroad (Virginia)|Southside Railroad]]. With the loss of Petersburg's crucial railroad lines, the Confederate forces had to retreat, ending the siege in a victory for the Union Army. The fall of Petersburg meant that Richmond could no longer be defended. Lee attempted to lead his men south to join up with Confederate forces in North Carolina. Hopelessly outnumbered, he was surrounded and forced to surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], Virginia, on April 9, 1865.\n\n=== Reconstruction era ===\n[[File:SouthSideRailroadDepotPetersburgVA.JPG|thumb|right|South Side Railroad Depot on Rock Street which served as the office of [[William Mahone]] when his Readjustor Party dominated Virginia politics.]]\nIn the years after the Civil War, many freedmen migrated to Petersburg, founding numerous churches, businesses and institutions. The [[Freedmen's Bureau]] established new facilities for [[freedmen]], including a mental health hospital in December 1869, at Howard's Grove Hospital, a former Confederate unit. The U.S. Federal Government and the railroad companies repaired the damaged railroads to the city.<ref>{{cite book|title=Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv4qAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75|year=1900|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=75\u201384}}</ref><ref name=\"Burke2013\">{{cite book|author=James C.

The legislature also founded the state's first system of free public education.\n\n=== Readjuster era ===\nDuring the 1880s, a coalition of black Republicans and white [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]] held power for several years in the state legislature.  This resulted in two major public institutions in Petersburg, as the legislature invested for education and welfare. In 1882, the legislature founded [[Virginia State University]] in nearby Ettrick as Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute.  It was one of the first public (fully state-supported) four-year [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCU) in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]].  This was part of a drive to improve public education that started with the Reconstruction legislature.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/travel/articles/2005/03/09/civil_war_history_lesson/?page=2|title=Civil War history lesson Petersburg, Va., embraces and expands its past|last=Shorr|first=Kathy|date=2005-03-09|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>  In 1888, its first president, [[John Mercer Langston]], was elected to the [[US Congress]] on the Republican ticket, the first [[African American]] to be elected to Congress from Virginia.\n\nIn 1882, the state legislature also authorized moving the mental asylum facility to the Mayfield Farm and developing a new campus there.  This is the site of the present-day [[Central State Hospital (Virginia)|Central State Hospital]], which provides a variety of mental health services.\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\nThe limitations of Petersburg's small geographic area and proximity to Richmond are structural problems that have hampered it in adapting to major economic changes in the 20th century.  Other forces in the mid-20th century, such as industrial and railroad restructuring, reduced the number of jobs in the city. In addition, suburban development attracted people to newer housing outside the city.\n\nWorld wars led to major federal institutions being constructed near Petersburg, which created local jobs.  Soon after [[World War I]] started, the [[US Army]] established Camp Lee just outside of Petersburg in [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]] for training draftees.  The facility was used again during [[World War II]]. In 1950 the camp was designated as [[Fort Lee, Virginia|Fort Lee]], and additional buildings were constructed to house the U.S. Army [[Quartermaster Corps]] Center and School.\n\nDuring WWII [[Camp Picket]] was established west of Petersburg near the small rural town of [[Blackstone, Virginia|Blackstone]], and the [[Defense Supply Center, Richmond]] opened in neighboring [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield]]. In the postwar period, some of these installations have been reduced in size. In the 1950s, Petersburg became the southern terminus of the [[Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike]], predating the [[U.S. Interstate Highway System]].\n\nSince that time, Petersburg has struggled in competition with nearby Richmond, as the capital has grown to dominate the region in a changing economy as industries restructured.\n\n==== Jim Crow ====\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Virginia's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]\u2013dominated legislature approved constitutional changes that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites. Those disfranchised suffered major losses in the ability to exercise their rights as citizens. The legislature also instituted [[Jim Crow]] laws, including imposing racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]].\n\nWith many African Americans having served the nation and cause of freedom in WWII, in the postwar years they pressed for social justice, an end to segregation, and restoration of voting power.\n\nIn 1949 Petersburg businessmen and politician, [[Remmie Arnold]], the president and owner of the Arnold Pen Company, at the time one of the largest manufacturers of [[fountain pens]], launched a campaign for Governor of Virginia. As a Petersburg city councilman, Arnold had pushed through a budgetary increase earmarked for equality and fair access for public housing and recreational facilities for everyone, including people of color, and increased budgetary considerations for the black schools in Petersburg. Unusually for a Democratic politician in the Jim Crow South, Arnold promised to \"deal with all Virginians fairly\", whatever their ethnicity. He was endorsed by [[Arthur Wergs Mitchell]], the first African American to be elected to the United States Congress as a Democrat. Arnold ultimately lost the Democratic primary to [[John S. Battle]], who won the gubernatorial election.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nordin|first=Dennis Sven|title=The New Deal's Black Congressman: A Life of Arthur Wergs Mitchell|url=https://archive.org/details/newdealsblackcon00nord|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1102-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdealsblackcon00nord/page/286 286]}}</ref>\n\nEven after the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of many blacks to northern jobs and cities, Petersburg was 40 percent black in 1960.

Dr. [[Wyatt Tee Walker]], the pastor of Gillfield Baptist Church, had become friends with Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the early 1950s when they were both in divinity school in New York state.  In 1957 they co-founded the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), an important force for leadership of the movement in the South.  Walker also founded the Petersburg Improvement Association (PIA), modeled on the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]] in [[Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Wyatt Tee Walker papers | website=archives.nypl.org | date=1987 | url=http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20626 | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>  According to Walker and other close associates of King, Petersburg had played an important role, a kind of blueprint for the national civil rights movement.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s African Americans in Petersburg struggled to desegregate public schools and facilities. In 1958 the City Council closed Wilcox Lake, a popular [[swimming hole]] in Petersburg to prevent the lake's public recreational area from being racially integrated.  It never re-opened to swimming.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-08-28 | url=https://www.progress-index.com/article/20130807/NEWS/308079915 | title=Petersburg moving to reopen lake closed by segregation | date=2013-08-07 | language=en | website=The Progress-Index}}</ref> Through sit-ins in the bus terminal in 1960, the PIA gained agreement by the president of the Bus Terminal Restaurants to desegregate lunch counters in Petersburg and several other cities.<ref name=Arsenault />\n\nVirginia officials strongly opposed school integration following the 1954 US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. They initiated the program of [[Massive Resistance]].  For instance, rather than allow schools to be integrated, then [[Governor of Virginia]], [[J. Lindsay Almond]] ordered the schools in several localities including [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren County]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], to be closed.  The school board of [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]] closed the public schools for five years, starting in 1959.  In Petersburg, the [[St. Vincent de Paul High School (Petersburg, Virginia)|Bollingbook School]] opened in 1958 as a [[segregation academy]] for white students.<ref name=\"wm1996\">{{Cite journal|last=Tobias|first=Carl|date=1996-06-01|title=Public School Desegregation in Virginia During the Post-Brown Decade|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73967436.pdf|journal=William & Mary Law Review|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1261|issn=0043-5589|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:City Market at Petersburg, Virginia - Stierch.jpg|thumb|The [[City Market (Petersburg, Virginia)|city market]] that has been preserved and is still used as a market.]]\n\n=== Late 20th-century economic decline ===\nRetail and industry prospered until about the late 1980s. Petersburg was hit hard in 1985 when tobacco giant [[Brown & Williamson]], the city's largest manufacturer, closed a [[cigarette]] factory in town. De-industrialization, restructuring of railroads, and related national structural economic changes cost many jobs in the city, as happened in numerous older industrial cities across the North and Midwest. The post-World War II national construction of highways encouraged development outside cities and [[suburbanization]] added to problems. In addition, reacting to racial integration of schools in the 1960s, many middle-class families moved to newer housing in the predominantly white suburbs. They also moved to the Richmond metro area, where the economy was expanding with jobs in new fields of financial and retail services.  Some companies shifted industrial jobs to states further south, where wages were lower, or overseas.\n\nThe declining economy increased the pressure of competition and racial tensions in Petersburg. These flared from 1968 until 1980, when black members of the City Council accused the white Mayor of racism over a re-districting plan which they and the [[ACLU]] alleged was designed to allow whites to maintain [[white supremacy]] in the city. For decades, the city government was run by a small group of white businessmen and bankers. Most were wealthy enough to own homes in the exclusive Walnut Hill neighborhood and their interrelated families had been established there for generations. In 1980 one black councilwoman described the Petersburg city government as \"our own little version of the [[Byrd Organization|Byrd Machine]]\", comparing it to the political organization led by [[segregationist]] [[Conservative Democrat|Democrat]], [[Harry Flood Byrd]], that controlled Virginia politics for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/11/29/redistricting-in-petersburg-brings-charge-of-racial-bias/e0ccf7ff-fea0-4d37-9843-096d4cfdfc56/ |title=Redistricting in Petersburg Brings Charge of Racial Bias |last=Frankel |first=Glenn |date=1981-11-29 |work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-08-28|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1968, Petersburg was the first city to designate his birthday as a holiday; it has been memorialized as a national holiday.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn an attempt to stem its economic decline, in 1971 the city completed steps begun in 1966 to annex 14 square miles of land from adjacent and predominately white counties of Prince George and Dinwiddie. The annexation had been generally supported by the citizens of Petersburg, black and white alike, since the mid-1960s, as a necessary measure to allow the city of expand its tax base and its potential for growth and development. The city argued to the counties that it was better prepared to provide municipal-type services than the predominately [[rural]] counties and that the city needed more land for expected new development. The annexation was opposed by the county governments, who lost most of their commercial tax base, as well as the residents of the annexed suburban areas.\n\nFollowing the annexation, blacks realized that the annexations had added 8,000 new white residents. City council members were then elected at-large, requiring majority approval for each seat. Black civil rights organizations challenged the annexations in court, saying these were motivated to illegally dilute the voting power of blacks. A federal judge, citing provisions of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, agreed and ordered the city to be divided into [[single-member district]]s, or wards, to enable blacks the opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.<ref>{{cite web | title=City of Petersburg, Virginia v.

As residents of the city of Petersburg, their children would be required to attend the Petersburg City Schools, which had become predominately black due to whites sending their children to private schools or moving to suburbs.\n\nProjected industrial development of large tracts of vacant land in the annexed areas failed to take place. In 1985 Petersburg again sought to annex more land from Prince George County. This time the nearby City of [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]], a city that already had huge amounts of taxable industry within its borders, joined the annexation suit to try to annex commercial areas of Prince George County, including [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Fort Lee]] and suburban neighborhoods near the base where many military families live. Many residents of Prince George had relocated to stay within the county after the previous annexation by Petersburg. They were strongly opposed to another attempt by the cities to annex their neighborhoods. The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] also expressed strong opposition to the proposed annexation.  After five years of litigation, with attorney [[Richard Cranwell]] representing Prince George County, the Virginia courts, including the [[Virginia Supreme Court]], unanimously ruled that the cities had not shown that annexation would benefit their cities, nor was it necessary to provide governmental services to Prince George residents.\n\nThe prolonged annexation fight contributed to decades of racially tinged hostility between the county and city governments that have had negative impact on regional cooperation. Prince George County is predominately white while the city of Petersburg is roughly four-fifths black. These strained relationships have slowed regional progress and eroded business confidence, hampering economic development in the region to the present day.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chairman's Statement To Commission On Local Government | website=Prince George County, VA | date=2016-09-13 | url=http://www.princegeorgeva.org/news_detail_T6_R297.php | access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, numerous remaining retail merchants, including [[Thalhimers]], [[JC Penney]], and [[Sears Roebuck]], left older shopping areas in Petersburg for the new [[Southpark Mall (Colonial Heights, Virginia)|Southpark Mall]] that opened in 1989 in adjacent, and predominately white, [[Colonial Heights, Virginia|Colonial Heights]].  A [[Miller & Rhoads]] store in Petersburg closed when the [[department store]] chain went out of business in 1990. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] had held marches in Colonial Heights. After the new shopping mall opened, blacks led by civil rights activist [[Curtis W. Harris]] and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] boycotted Southpark Mall for about five years. The boycott ended after the Mayor of Colonial Heights, James McNeer, met with Harris and members of his board to discuss job opportunities for blacks in the mall area. McNeer later became President of [[Richard Bland College]],\n\nIn the late 20th century, Petersburg worked to restore historic buildings and attract different kinds of stores and businesses to its historic center. During the [[1993 Virginia tornado outbreak]], Petersburg was struck by an [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornado that swept through the downtown area, seriously damaging a number of restored historic buildings and businesses. The same tornado also destroyed a [[Walmart]] store in Colonial Heights.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAs of 2007, Petersburg has continued to evolve as a small city, and its commercial activities have changed. Downtown Petersburg, known as Old Towne, has had new businesses established in the compact core: these include indie restaurants, bars and coffee shops. The long-abandoned Walnut Mall, which closed in the early 1990s, has been demolished. A new [[Food Lion]] grocery store and a [[Walmart]] opened on the South end of town. The Army has expanded activities at nearby Fort Lee, home of the [[United States Army]]'s [[Sustainment Center of Excellence]]. The Army's Logistics Branch, Ordnance, Quartermaster, and the Transportation Corps moved there from [[Fort Eustis]] following the round of [[Base Realignment and Closure]] actions in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/brac_closures_list.pdf|title=Appendix K: Department of Defense Proposed 2005 Realignment and Closure List|date=2005|website=2005 Base Realignment and Closure|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Petersburg faced the prospect of large-scale cuts to public services after a state audit found a $12 million budget shortfall and the prospect of insolvency by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schneider|first1=Gregory S.|title=City on the brink: Petersburg can't pay its bills and time is running out|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/city-on-the-brink-petersburg-cant-pay-its-bills-and-time-is-running-out/2016/09/04/9327c962-6ef9-11e6-8533-6b0b0ded0253_story.html|accessdate=5 September 2016|work=Washington Post|issue=5 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nPetersburg is located at {{Coord|37|12|46|N|77|24|1|W|type:city}} (37.21295, -77.400417).\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.2|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|22.9|sqmi|1}} of land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|1}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nPetersburg is located on the [[Appomattox River]] at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]], which marks the area where the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region (continental [[bedrock]]) and the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] (unconsolidated sediments) meet.
