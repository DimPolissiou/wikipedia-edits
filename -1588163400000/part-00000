cricketer who captains the [[England cricket team]] in [[limited overs cricket]]. A left-handed batsman, he plays [[county cricket]] for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and has played for England's [[Test cricket|Test]], [[One Day International]] (ODI), and [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) teams. He previously played for the [[Ireland cricket team]] in ODIs, and was the first player to score an ODI hundred for two nations. His ability to hit boundaries at the end of innings sees him labelled as a \"finisher\"; he is also among the most skilful exponents of the [[reverse sweep]] shot.\n\nAfter [[Alastair Cook]] was removed from the ODI captaincy on 19 December 2014, Morgan was named as the England captain for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], having already captained England in ODIs and T20Is as a stand-in. He is the only England captain to have scored more than 4 ODI centuries. Under his captaincy, England won the [[2019 ICC Cricket World Cup]], the first time they had won the tournament.\n\n{{As of|December 2019}}, Morgan is the all-time leading run scorer and most capped player for England in ODI matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/england-vs-pakistan-3rd-odi-eoin-morgan-to-surpass-paul-collingwood-as-englands-most-capped-player-843592 |title=England vs Pakistan, 3rd ODI: Eoin Morgan to surpass Paul Collingwood as England's most-capped player |work=Cricket Country |accessdate=14 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514113331/https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/england-vs-pakistan-3rd-odi-eoin-morgan-to-surpass-paul-collingwood-as-englands-most-capped-player-843592 |archive-date=14 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> He also holds the England record for the fastest fifty in ODIs and during the 2019 ICC World Cup he scored the highest number of sixes in an ODI innings, with 17 sixes against Afghanistan.\n\n==Youth and early career==\nMorgan was born in [[Dublin]] and brought up in [[Rush, Dublin|Rush]], where his father was from.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/jodys-pride-over-professional-and-gracious-eoin-29566334.html|title=Jody's pride over 'professional and gracious' Eoin|website=Independent.ie|language=en|access-date=2019-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702082637/https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/jodys-pride-over-professional-and-gracious-eoin-29566334.html|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> His mother is English.<ref name=pp /> He learnt to play cricket at [[Rush Cricket Club]], where his father, Jody, was Third XI captain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/05/02/special-report-making-eoin-morgan/|title=Special report: The making of Eoin Morgan|last=Wigmore|first=Tim|date=2019-05-02|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-07-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509052417/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/05/02/special-report-making-eoin-morgan/|archive-date=9 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He was educated at the [[Catholic University School]] on Leeson Street,<ref name=\"future\">{{cite news |work=Sunday Times |date= 21 March 2004|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A114723005/GPS?sid=wikipedia |title=One for the future; Eoin Morgan, Middlesex and Ireland |accessdate=26 September 2017 |page=28}}{{subscription required|via=Academic OneFile}}</ref> where he played in three Leinster Senior Schools Cup champion teams.

He made nine not out in the final match of the series to help England over the line and secure a seven wicket victory.\n\nHe was seen as one of contender to replace Kevin Pietersen, who was not selected for the Test team following reports of him texting South Africans players,  but selectors chose [[James Taylor (cricketer, born 1990)|James Taylor]].

In the second match he made an impressive 73 as England levelled the series. He made 36 not out in the next match as England took a lead in the series. However, Morgan was out for a duck in the final match as England lost by 7 wickets. He was not effective with the bat in the T20 series, scoring just 15 runs in the series, although this was partly due to him having limited time at the crease.\n\nIn the World T20, Morgan was seen as a vital player who would have to perform if England were to do well.

Morgan was praised for captaincy and many pundits suggested he would lead England on a permanent basis in the future.\n\nMorgan was selected for the One Day series against India at the beginning of 2013. He made 41 from 38 balls in the first match, as England won by 9 runs. He suffered poor form as England lost the next three games, his scores including 10 and a duck. However, he returned to form for the final match of the series where he hit an unbeaten 40 as he guided England to an impressive 7 wicket win. Although England lost the series 3\u20132, it was seen as an improvement given their recent poor performances in ODIs in India.\n\nIn the first T20I match against New Zealand, he helped England set 214 after he smashed 46 off just 26 balls as England won the match by 40 runs. In contrast, he only made 13 from 22 deliveries in the next match as England lost by 55 runs. The series decider was rained off. He started the ODI Series in poor fashion, making just 1 in their opening defeat. He did not bat in the next game as England levelled the series at 1\u20131. He helped England win the decider, hitting 39 off 24 balls to help set up a 5 wicket win. He made just 6 in the first match of the return series, before making 21 in the second.

In the final match of the series he made 18 to help England win the match, although they lost the series 2\u20131.\n\nIn the T20 World Cup, England lost their first game to New Zealand, with Morgan making just 12. However, they secured an unlikely victory in the next game against Sri Lanka with Morgan hitting 57 and batting well alongside [[Alex Hales]] to help England chase down a large Sri Lankan score and keep their hopes of winning the tournament alive. The pair set a new record for the highest 3rd wicket partnership in T20 World Cup history (152).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/fow/highest_partnerships_by_wicket.html?id=89;type=trophy|title=Cricket Records {{!}} Records {{!}} World T20 {{!}} Highest partnerships by wicket {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=2017-04-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411221922/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/fow/highest_partnerships_by_wicket.html?id=89%3Btype%3Dtrophy|archivedate=11 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/682939.html|title=22nd Match, Group 1: England v Sri Lanka at Chittagong, Mar 27, 2014 {{!}} Cricket Scorecard {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710115932/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/682939.html|archive-date=10 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, they lost their next game to South Africa, with Morgan scoring just six to end their hopes of qualifying. In the final game of the tournament they suffered a humiliating defeat to the Netherlands, with Morgan scoring just six.\n\n===2014 Sri Lanka and India===\n\nIn the ODI series against Sri Lanka, Morgan made 3 in the first match. He top scored with 40 in the next game as England were bowled out for 99 to allow Sri Lanka to level the series. He was not needed to bat in the third match as England secured a big win to retake the lead in the series. Morgan only made 12 in the next match as Sri Lanka won by seven runs to level the series once more. In the final match of the series he made 17 as England lost the game and the series 3\u20132.\n\nAfter the first game against India was rained off, Morgan made 28 in the second match as England lost to go 1\u20130 down in the series. He made 10 in the next match as India secured another win, this time by six wickets. He made 32 in the next match as England suffered a humiliating nine wicket defeat. The manner of the lead to questions over the personnel in the team, and the pressure increased on captain Alastair Cook. Despite this, England won the final match of the series, although Morgan again failed to make a big score, being dismissed for 14. In the only T20 match between the two sides, Morgan hit 71 from just 31 balls in an innings that included seven sixes. England won the match by three runs and Morgan was named man of the match.\n\nIn the return series in Sri Lanka, Morgan endured a poor time. He scored just 19 runs in the first three games as England went 2-1 down in the series. In the fourth game, Alastair Cook was suspended due to a slow over rate in the previous game, and so Morgan took over as captain. He made 62, his only fifty of the tour, although England still went on to lose the game. In the next game Morgan could only make and he was dismissed for a duck in the penultimate game of the series as Sri Lanka secured a series victory. In the final match Morgan again failed to make an impression, this time making just four runs as England suffered another defeat.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, 2 months before the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup]], it was announced that Cook had been removed as one-day captain due to poor form, and replaced by Eoin Morgan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Irishman to add bite to England campaign |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 January 2015 |page=52 |accessdate=26 September 2017 |last=Lane |first=Daniel |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A395695497/GPS?sid=wikipedia}}{{subscription required|via=[[Academic OneFile]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC Sport\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/30555167|title=Alastair Cook removed as England one-day captain|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=19 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219214739/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/30555167|archive-date=19 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHe was named in the T20I XI of the year 2014 by Cricbuzz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/67711/t20i-team-of-the-year|title=2014 review: T20I team of the year|work=Cricbuzz|accessdate=25 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725173545/https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/67711/t20i-team-of-the-year|archive-date=25 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===2015 Tri-Series and 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup===\nFollowing his appointment as captain, Morgan's first series as skipper was a tournament contested by India, Australia and England. Morgan promised a more aggressive approach as captain and said England would be a more dynamic team. However, they suffered a loss in his first match leading the side against Australia. Morgan himself made an impressive 121 but it was not enough as the rest of England's batsmen struggled. Morgan was not needed to bat in the next match as England secured a comfortable win over India, Morgan's first as permanent captain. He again suffered defeat against Australia in the next game, being dismissed for a duck. England beat India again in the next game to qualify for the final, but Morgan was again unimpressive, making just two. England lost the final to Australia, with Morgan being dismissed for a duck again.\n\nMorgan's poor form continued into the World Cup, where he only scored 90 runs in five innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=6537;team=1;type=tournament|title=Cricket Records - ICC Cricket World Cup, 2014/15 - England - Records - Batting and bowling averages - ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307205343/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=6537%3Bteam%3D1%3Btype%3Dtournament|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His tournament started badly as he was dismissed for a duck in England's opening game against Australia.

He was out for yet another duck in England's must win game against Bangladesh, meaning they exited the tournament. They won their final match against Afghanistan, with Morgan not be required to bat. This meant that England managed to win only 2 out of 6 games in the tournament under Morgan's captaincy, both victories came against much lower ranked teams Afghanistan and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/series/509587.html?view=pointstable|title=Points Table - ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 - ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313214119/http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/series/509587.html?view=pointstable|archive-date=13 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===2015 New Zealand===\nMorgan continued in his role as ODI captain in the five-game series at home against New Zealand. The series began with a dominant performance by England, winning by 210 runs, Morgan contributing 50. The following match was a much more close-run affair, with New Zealand clinching the match by 13 runs (D/L method). Morgan performed strongly with the bat and scoring 88 off only 47 balls. New Zealand were victorious again in the third match, winning by 3 wickets with an over remaining. Morgan scored 71 in England's innings. In the fourth ODI, Morgan scored 113 from 82 balls, which helped England win the match by 7 wickets, a performance which earned him the Man of the Match award. In the final match of the series he was out for a duck, but England went on to win the game and the series 3\u20132. In the one off T20 match between the two sides, Morgan made 4 as England went on to win the game.\n\n===2015 Australia===\nIn the T20 against Australia, Morgan put in a strong performance, scoring 74 to send England on their way to a narrow victory.

However, England went on to win the next three games to win the series 3-1. Morgan did not make a significant contribution with the bat in any of the victories, making scores of 29, 35 and 14. Despite this, he was praised for his captaincy and the amount of improvement that had been seen in the England side since the disappointing World Cup campaign. Morgan made a score of 45 in the first T20I against Pakistan. After making 15 in the next match, Morgan rested himself for the final match of the series, with Jos Buttler replacing him as captain. England won the series 3-0.\n\nMorgan had a poor series against South Africa. He made scores of 23 and 29 in the first two games of the tournament, as England won both to take a 2-0 series lead. However, after these matches his own performances and that of the teams declined and Morgan failed to make double figures in the final three games of the series, being dismissed for scores of 8, 2 and 2 as South Africa won the final three games to take the series 3-2. Morgan played in both T20Is against South Africa, making scores of 10 and 38, although England lost both games to make it five defeats in a row.\n\n===2016 World T20===\nMorgan made 27 in the opening match of the T20 World Cup against West Indies, as England lost their opening group game. In the next match against South Africa, England completed a historic chase of 230, although Morgan himself only made 12. He followed this up with a duck against Afghanistan, although England recovered to win the game.

England lost the final against the West Indies, with Morgan making just five.\n\n===2016 Sri Lanka and Pakistan===\nMorgan made 43 in the first ODI to help England tie the match after matching Sri Lanka's total of 286. He did not bat in the second match as England won the match by ten wickets. In the third match, he again did not bat as the match was abandoned due to rain early in England's reply to Sri Lanka's 248/9. He made 22 in the fourth match to help England win by six wickets, and he made 20 in the final match of the series as England scored 324 to win by 122 runs.

With this century, which is the fifth as a captain, Morgan became the highest century maker for England as a captain, bettered previous record of 4 ODI centuries each by [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Andrew Strauss]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/west-indies-v-england-2016-17/content/story/1085073.html |title=Morgan ton, seamers seal England win |accessdate=3 March 2017 |work=ESPN Cricinfo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304050517/http://www.espncricinfo.com/west-indies-v-england-2016-17/content/story/1085073.html |archive-date=4 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the second match he made seven as England secured a four wicket victory.

[[limited overs cricket]]. A left-handed batsman, he plays [[county cricket]] for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and has played for England's [[Test cricket|Test]], [[One Day International]] (ODI), and [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) teams. He previously played for the [[Ireland cricket team]] in ODIs, and was the first player to score an ODI hundred for two nations. His ability to hit boundaries at the end of innings sees him labelled as a \"finisher\"; he is also among the most skilful exponents of the [[reverse sweep]] shot.\n\nAfter [[Alastair Cook]] was removed from the ODI captaincy on 19 December 2014, Morgan was named as the England captain for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], having already captained England in ODIs and T20Is as a stand-in. He is the only England captain to have scored more than 4 ODI centuries. Under his captaincy, England won the [[2019 ICC Cricket World Cup]], the first time they had won the tournament.\n\n{{As of|December 2019}}, Morgan is the all-time leading run scorer and most capped player for England in ODI matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/england-vs-pakistan-3rd-odi-eoin-morgan-to-surpass-paul-collingwood-as-englands-most-capped-player-843592 |title=England vs Pakistan, 3rd ODI: Eoin Morgan to surpass Paul Collingwood as England's most-capped player |work=Cricket Country |accessdate=14 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514113331/https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/england-vs-pakistan-3rd-odi-eoin-morgan-to-surpass-paul-collingwood-as-englands-most-capped-player-843592 |archive-date=14 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> He also holds the England record for the fastest fifty in ODIs and during the 2019 ICC World Cup he scored the highest number of sixes in an ODI innings, with 17 sixes against Afghanistan.\n\n==Youth and early career==\nMorgan was born in [[Dublin]] and brought up in [[Rush, Dublin|Rush]], where his father was from.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/jodys-pride-over-professional-and-gracious-eoin-29566334.html|title=Jody's pride over 'professional and gracious' Eoin|website=Independent.ie|language=en|access-date=2019-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702082637/https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/jodys-pride-over-professional-and-gracious-eoin-29566334.html|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> His mother is English.<ref name=pp /> He learnt to play cricket at [[Rush Cricket Club]], where his father, Jody, was Third XI captain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/05/02/special-report-making-eoin-morgan/|title=Special report: The making of Eoin Morgan|last=Wigmore|first=Tim|date=2019-05-02|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-07-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509052417/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/05/02/special-report-making-eoin-morgan/|archive-date=9 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He was educated at the [[Catholic University School]] on Leeson Street,<ref name=\"future\">{{cite news |work=Sunday Times |date= 21 March 2004|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A114723005/GPS?sid=wikipedia |title=One for the future; Eoin Morgan, Middlesex and Ireland |accessdate=26 September 2017 |page=28}}{{subscription required|via=Academic OneFile}}</ref> where he played in three Leinster Senior Schools Cup champion teams.

He made nine not out in the final match of the series to help England over the line and secure a seven wicket victory.\n\nHe was seen as one of contender to replace Kevin Pietersen, who was not selected for the Test team following reports of him texting South Africans players,  but selectors chose [[James Taylor (cricketer, born 1990)|James Taylor]].

In the second match he made an impressive 73 as England levelled the series. He made 36 not out in the next match as England took a lead in the series. However, Morgan was out for a duck in the final match as England lost by 7 wickets. He was not effective with the bat in the T20 series, scoring just 15 runs in the series, although this was partly due to him having limited time at the crease.\n\nIn the World T20, Morgan was seen as a vital player who would have to perform if England were to do well.

Morgan was praised for captaincy and many pundits suggested he would lead England on a permanent basis in the future.\n\nMorgan was selected for the One Day series against India at the beginning of 2013. He made 41 from 38 balls in the first match, as England won by 9 runs. He suffered poor form as England lost the next three games, his scores including 10 and a duck. However, he returned to form for the final match of the series where he hit an unbeaten 40 as he guided England to an impressive 7 wicket win. Although England lost the series 3\u20132, it was seen as an improvement given their recent poor performances in ODIs in India.\n\nIn the first T20I match against New Zealand, he helped England set 214 after he smashed 46 off just 26 balls as England won the match by 40 runs. In contrast, he only made 13 from 22 deliveries in the next match as England lost by 55 runs. The series decider was rained off. He started the ODI Series in poor fashion, making just 1 in their opening defeat. He did not bat in the next game as England levelled the series at 1\u20131. He helped England win the decider, hitting 39 off 24 balls to help set up a 5 wicket win. He made just 6 in the first match of the return series, before making 21 in the second.

In the final match of the series he made 18 to help England win the match, although they lost the series 2\u20131.\n\nIn the T20 World Cup, England lost their first game to New Zealand, with Morgan making just 12. However, they secured an unlikely victory in the next game against Sri Lanka with Morgan hitting 57 and batting well alongside [[Alex Hales]] to help England chase down a large Sri Lankan score and keep their hopes of winning the tournament alive. The pair set a new record for the highest 3rd wicket partnership in T20 World Cup history (152).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/fow/highest_partnerships_by_wicket.html?id=89;type=trophy|title=Cricket Records {{!}} Records {{!}} World T20 {{!}} Highest partnerships by wicket {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=2017-04-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411221922/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/fow/highest_partnerships_by_wicket.html?id=89%3Btype%3Dtrophy|archivedate=11 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/682939.html|title=22nd Match, Group 1: England v Sri Lanka at Chittagong, Mar 27, 2014 {{!}} Cricket Scorecard {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710115932/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/682939.html|archive-date=10 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, they lost their next game to South Africa, with Morgan scoring just six to end their hopes of qualifying. In the final game of the tournament they suffered a humiliating defeat to the Netherlands, with Morgan scoring just six.\n\n===2014 Sri Lanka and India===\n\nIn the ODI series against Sri Lanka, Morgan made 3 in the first match. He top scored with 40 in the next game as England were bowled out for 99 to allow Sri Lanka to level the series. He was not needed to bat in the third match as England secured a big win to retake the lead in the series. Morgan only made 12 in the next match as Sri Lanka won by seven runs to level the series once more. In the final match of the series he made 17 as England lost the game and the series 3\u20132.\n\nAfter the first game against India was rained off, Morgan made 28 in the second match as England lost to go 1\u20130 down in the series. He made 10 in the next match as India secured another win, this time by six wickets. He made 32 in the next match as England suffered a humiliating nine wicket defeat. The manner of the lead to questions over the personnel in the team, and the pressure increased on captain Alastair Cook. Despite this, England won the final match of the series, although Morgan again failed to make a big score, being dismissed for 14. In the only T20 match between the two sides, Morgan hit 71 from just 31 balls in an innings that included seven sixes. England won the match by three runs and Morgan was named man of the match.\n\nIn the return series in Sri Lanka, Morgan endured a poor time. He scored just 19 runs in the first three games as England went 2-1 down in the series. In the fourth game, Alastair Cook was suspended due to a slow over rate in the previous game, and so Morgan took over as captain. He made 62, his only fifty of the tour, although England still went on to lose the game. In the next game Morgan could only make and he was dismissed for a duck in the penultimate game of the series as Sri Lanka secured a series victory. In the final match Morgan again failed to make an impression, this time making just four runs as England suffered another defeat.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, 2 months before the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup]], it was announced that Cook had been removed as one-day captain due to poor form, and replaced by Eoin Morgan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Irishman to add bite to England campaign |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 January 2015 |page=52 |accessdate=26 September 2017 |last=Lane |first=Daniel |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A395695497/GPS?sid=wikipedia}}{{subscription required|via=[[Academic OneFile]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC Sport\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/30555167|title=Alastair Cook removed as England one-day captain|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=19 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219214739/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/30555167|archive-date=19 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHe was named in the T20I XI of the year 2014 by Cricbuzz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/67711/t20i-team-of-the-year|title=2014 review: T20I team of the year|work=Cricbuzz|accessdate=25 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725173545/https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/67711/t20i-team-of-the-year|archive-date=25 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===2015 Tri-Series and 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup===\nFollowing his appointment as captain, Morgan's first series as skipper was a tournament contested by India, Australia and England. Morgan promised a more aggressive approach as captain and said England would be a more dynamic team. However, they suffered a loss in his first match leading the side against Australia. Morgan himself made an impressive 121 but it was not enough as the rest of England's batsmen struggled. Morgan was not needed to bat in the next match as England secured a comfortable win over India, Morgan's first as permanent captain. He again suffered defeat against Australia in the next game, being dismissed for a duck. England beat India again in the next game to qualify for the final, but Morgan was again unimpressive, making just two. England lost the final to Australia, with Morgan being dismissed for a duck again.\n\nMorgan's poor form continued into the World Cup, where he only scored 90 runs in five innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=6537;team=1;type=tournament|title=Cricket Records - ICC Cricket World Cup, 2014/15 - England - Records - Batting and bowling averages - ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307205343/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=6537%3Bteam%3D1%3Btype%3Dtournament|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His tournament started badly as he was dismissed for a duck in England's opening game against Australia.

He was out for yet another duck in England's must win game against Bangladesh, meaning they exited the tournament. They won their final match against Afghanistan, with Morgan not be required to bat. This meant that England managed to win only 2 out of 6 games in the tournament under Morgan's captaincy, both victories came against much lower ranked teams Afghanistan and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/series/509587.html?view=pointstable|title=Points Table - ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 - ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|access-date=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313214119/http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/series/509587.html?view=pointstable|archive-date=13 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===2015 New Zealand===\nMorgan continued in his role as ODI captain in the five-game series at home against New Zealand. The series began with a dominant performance by England, winning by 210 runs, Morgan contributing 50. The following match was a much more close-run affair, with New Zealand clinching the match by 13 runs (D/L method). Morgan performed strongly with the bat and scoring 88 off only 47 balls. New Zealand were victorious again in the third match, winning by 3 wickets with an over remaining. Morgan scored 71 in England's innings.

However, England went on to win the next three games to win the series 3-1. Morgan did not make a significant contribution with the bat in any of the victories, making scores of 29, 35 and 14. Despite this, he was praised for his captaincy and the amount of improvement that had been seen in the England side since the disappointing World Cup campaign. Morgan made a score of 45 in the first T20I against Pakistan. After making 15 in the next match, Morgan rested himself for the final match of the series, with Jos Buttler replacing him as captain. England won the series 3-0.\n\nMorgan had a poor series against South Africa. He made scores of 23 and 29 in the first two games of the tournament, as England won both to take a 2-0 series lead. However, after these matches his own performances and that of the teams declined and Morgan failed to make double figures in the final three games of the series, being dismissed for scores of 8, 2 and 2 as South Africa won the final three games to take the series 3-2. Morgan played in both T20Is against South Africa, making scores of 10 and 38, although England lost both games to make it five defeats in a row.\n\n===2016 World T20===\nMorgan made 27 in the opening match of the T20 World Cup against West Indies, as England lost their opening group game.

Their first one-day international with this new status was scheduled to be against [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] in March 2006; however this match was cancelled due to a Kenyan tour of [[Bangladesh]]. Instead their first ODI with this status (and their twelfth overall) came against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]]; this was their first ODI at home. However Sri Lanka won the two match series 2\u20130, with a then-record ODI score of 443\u20139.<ref name=\"TL\" />\n\nThe Dutch played their first Intercontinental Cup match of 2006 against [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] in Nairobi in March.

They finished third in the tournament.<ref name=\"TL\" />\n\nIn November, the Dutch travelled to South Africa.

[[Daan van Bunge]] also opted to take a break from international cricket, and the new coach opted not to retain the services of bowling coach [[Ian Pont]].\n\nIn June 2007, they visited Canada, first winning an Intercontinental Cup match against Canada in [[King City, Ontario]].<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/123/123036.html Scorecard] of Canada v Netherlands, 28 June 2007 at Cricket Archive</ref> They then won the first ODI by 117 runs,<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/123/123079.html Scorecard] of Canada v Netherlands, 3 July 2007 at Cricket Archive</ref> with the second one being abandoned.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/123/123080.html Scorecard] of Canada v Netherlands, 4 July 2007 at Cricket Archive</ref> They then played a quadrangular series in Ireland, losing by ten wickets to the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]],<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/123/123073.html Scorecard] of Netherlands v West Indies, 10 July 2007 at Cricket Archive</ref> and by one run to [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]],<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/123/123073.html Scorecard] of Ireland v Netherlands, 11 July 2007 at Cricket Archive</ref> with the game against Scotland being abandoned due to rain.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/123/123076.html Scorecard] of Netherlands v Scotland, 13 July 2007 at Cricket Archive</ref>\n\nIn August 2008, The Netherlands participated in the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier]].

[[Ryan Ten Doeschate]] top scored 119 from 110 balls. However, the Netherlands were unable to defend their strong total and failed to pull off a huge shock, England winning by 6 wickets with 2 overs to spare.

In order to go through on net run rate against [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]], they needed to chase down Ireland's score in 14.2 overs or less. As Ireland scored 189, this seemed unlikely. However, strong and aggressive batting enabled them to score 193/4 in 13.5 overs, securing passage to the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20 Super 10s]]. Although they lost their first three games in the group, including a 39/10 against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], they pulled off an upset against [[England national cricket

Anderson is the [[Fast bowling#Top five fast bowlers|all-time leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers]] surpassing Glenn McGrath (563 wickets) and holds the record of most wickets for England in both Test and One-Day International (ODI) cricket. He is the only English bowler, and the 6th overall, to pass 500 Test wickets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/wi/content/records/93276.html|title=Test matches {{!}} Most wickets in career |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=12 September 2018}}</ref>Anderson is also a co-presenter alongside [[Greg James]] and [[Felix White]] on the Tailenders podcast. \n\nAnderson plays [[first-class cricket]] for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire county cricket club]] and since arriving on the international scene in 2002/03 (before his first full season of County cricket) has represented England in 150 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] and nearly 200 [[One Day International]]s.<ref name=\"cricinfo player profile\"/> He is England's all-time highest international wicket-taker when combined across all three formats. He and [[Joe Root]] posted the highest ever 10th-wicket Test batting partnership in the 1st Test of India's 2014 tour of England.\n\nA right-arm [[Fast bowling|pace bowler]], Anderson made his international debut at the age of just 20, on England's 2002/03 tour of [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. When he played his first ODI he had only played five [[List A]] matches. Anderson went on to feature in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 ICC World Cup]] and made his Test match debut against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at [[Lord's]] the next summer. Later in 2003, he experienced a dip in form and confidence against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. After this, he was in and out of the team and experienced numerous injuries, including a [[stress fracture]] of the back which kept him out of action for most of the 2006 season. He returned to action and is now the opening bowler in England's Test team. He was a regular strike bowler in England's one-day team but has not played in that format since the 2015 World Cup. He is the first English bowler to reach 400 and 500 wickets in Test matches, and on 11 September 2018, he became 4th highest Test wicket-taker of all time. He reached this position when he took his 564th Test wicket, passing [[Glenn McGrath]] as the leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers. {{As of|2019|January}} he is ranked No.2 in the [[ICC Player Rankings#Top 10 Test Bowlers|ICC Test Bowling Rankings]], having previously reached the top position at various times between 2016 and 2018.\n\nOn 25 July 2016, during the second Test of that year's England-Pakistan series at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], he became the first fast bowler to take 50 wickets against all other 7 major Test-playing nations, Australia, India, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], South Africa, [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/2282874.stm |author=Scott Heinrich |title=Anderson on fast track |publisher=BBC |date=31 December 2002}} Retrieved on 26 June 2008.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket-videos/ashes-2019-james-anderson-world-class-stuart-broad-cricket/article29391846.ece|title=James Anderson delighted for 'world class' Stuart Broad|last=Sportstar|first=Team|website=Sportstar|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref> In December 2019, in the first Test [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2019\u201320|against South Africa]], Anderson became the ninth cricketer to [[List of Test cricket records#Individual records (other)|play in 150 Test matches]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/preview/1185304/south-africa-vs-england-1st-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021 |title=Bruised England look to improve touring record against battered South Africa |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> In January 2020, in the second Test of the series against South Africa, Anderson took his [[List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by James Anderson|28th five-wicket haul]] in Test cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/11901500/james-anderson-completes-five-for-before-england-grow-lead-in-cape-town |title=James Anderson completes five-for before England grow lead in Cape Town |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> He surpassed Sir [[Ian Botham]]'s record of 27, to become the bowler with the [[List of cricketers by number of international five-wicket hauls|most five-wicket hauls]] for England in Test cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/sport/dom-sibley-builds-on-more-good-work-from-james-anderson-as-england-flourish/ |title=Dom Sibley builds on more good work from James Anderson as England flourish |work=Evening Express |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early and personal life==\nJames Anderson was a pupil at St Mary's and [[St Theodore's RC High School]], [[Burnley]].

With 29 overs to chase 173 for victory, the West Indies lost Gayle to Anderson in the first over with the score at 1/1, Anderson going on to add the wicket of Kieron Pollard as he finished with match figures of 2/34 from 6 overs as England won the match by 26 runs, with Anderson's Lancashire teammate [[Andrew Flintoff]] taking a [[List of One Day International cricket hat-tricks|hat-trick]].\n\nAnderson finished the tour with 9 wickets at an average of 38.00 from the Test series, with an economy rate of 2.65 runs per over from both innings and best match figures coming in the fifth Test at Trinidad,<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/8608.html?class=1;template=results;type=bowling;view=series|Bowling Test series averages]</ref> as well as accumulating 24 runs at an average of 12.00, with a highest-score of 20.<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/8608.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=series|Batting Test series averages]</ref> In the ODIs, Anderson took 9 wickets at 21.11 and an economy rate of 5.00 runs per over<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/8608.html?class=2;template=results;type=bowling;view=series|Bowling ODI series averages]</ref> and 8 runs at an equivalent average.<ref>[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/8608.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting;view=series|Batting ODI series averages]</ref>\nHe then rejected offers to play in the [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] since he wanted to commit to a bright future for England over the following summer.\n\nThe Wisden Trophy was up for grabs again a few months later when the West Indies replaced [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], who were still excluded from participating in Test match cricket by the ICC (although originally the tour had been scheduled to be played by Sri Lanka, who pulled out to allow their players to play in the IPL), in a two-Test and three-ODI tour. Anderson was selected after a bright start to the season with Lancashire, which included figures of 11\u2013109 in a match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at Hove.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/countycricket2009/engine/match/382914.html |title=Sussex v Lancashire at Hove, Apr 21\u201324, 2009 &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first Test was held at Lord's, beginning on 6 May 2020. Anderson was not involved directly until the second day, with England batting first, but made only a single in a 19-ball innings. With the wicket showing a green tinge and some cloud cover, Anderson was expected to excel. However he struggled to find his length bowling in the first innings and finished wicketless from seven overs having conceded 32.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/380712.html |title=1st Test: England v West Indies at Lord's, May 6\u20138, 2009 &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> An improvement in the second innings saw him take the first two wickets after the follow-on, including that of the West Indies captain Chris Gayle, and finishing with figures of 2\u201338 from 15 overs and match figures of 2\u201370 as England won by ten wickets.\n\nFrom Lord's, the teams moved to [[Riverside Ground|Chester-le-Street]] for the second and final Test of the series. England again won the toss and chose to bat, and proceeded to dominate the West Indies bowling attack, amassing 569\u20136 declared. Anderson was sent in at the end of the first day in his role as night-watchman to protect Pietersen. Batting with Alastair Cook, they made a partnership of 44, Anderson hitting 14 of them to extend his run of innings without a duck in Test cricket. Later on day three, he was given the ball as England set out to take 20 West Indian wickets and secure match victory. Anderson found some significant swing in the cloudy conditions there, and proceeded to skittle through the West Indies top order, taking the first three wickets (including Gayle again) leaving the West Indies on 68/3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/380713.html |title=2nd Test: England v West Indies at Chester-le-Street, May 14\u201318, 2009 &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> Two late strikes secured Anderson a five-wicket haul, his first in 19 innings since his 7-wicket haul against New Zealand at Trent Bridge the previous summer.<ref>[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/8608.html?class=1;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings|Statsguru \u2013 JM Anderson \u2013 Test bowling \u2013 Bowling innings list].

Neither was he required to bat in the last match of the tour as England scored 328/7 from their 50 overs. Although Anderson went at a run a ball in reply, conceding 58 from 9.4 overs, he took three wickets including the last of the match (that of [[Sulieman Benn]]) as the West Indies fell 58 runs short, sealing a 2\u20130 victory for England in both the Test and ODI series.\n\n===2009\u201310: South Africa===\nAnderson went on the tour of South Africa as one of the leaders of the English attack, having established himself in all formats of the game. In the opening T20 International, Anderson failed to pick up a wicket, although he was fairly economical, going at 8 runs an over. Anderson improved in the following match, bowling 4 for 28 runs, picking up a wicket. He was the pick of the English bowlers as South Africa won the match, posting over 200. Anderson bowled well in the ODI series, picking up regular wickets. He claimed 3\u201360 in the second ODI, and 5\u201323 in the fourth match. The four-match Test series was drawn 1\u20131, with Anderson bowling well. He picked up 5 wickets for 63 runs during the 3rd Test, as well as 4\u201373 in the opening match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/rsaveng09/content/story/437662.html |title=Anderson almost missed one-dayers |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/453492.html |title=Anderson still in the dark over knee problem |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2010: Bangladesh and Pakistan===\nAnderson was selected in the England squad for the 2010 T20 World Cup, despite not being regarded as a specialist in this format of cricket. He did not play in the opening group match against the West Indies. With England playing well in the tournament, and with the three-man seam attack of Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom and Tim Bresnan performing, Anderson could not break into the side. England went on to win the tournament, beating Australia in the final.\n\nEngland faced Bangladesh in a two-match Test series. England were expected to win easily and cruised to victory in the first Test, with Anderson taking figures of 4\u201378 and 1\u201384. Anderson also played in the second Test, finishing with figures of 1\u201345 and 3\u201316. England won the series 2\u20130. Anderson played in the first ODI, but was expensive, taking figures of 3\u201374. He was wicketless in the second game as England suffered a shock defeat. Anderson did not play in the decider, which England won to take the series.\n\nEngland then played Pakistan at home. It was during this series that Anderson established himself as one of the world's best Test bowlers. In the first match he took 5\u201354 and 6\u201317 which England won. This left Anderson with match figures of 11\u201371. He helped England win the second Test, achieving figures of 4\u201320 in the first innings. Anderson continued to impress in the final two Tests continuing to be economical and providing a wicket-taking threat. Anderson was rested for the first ODI, but returned in the second, taking 1\u201336 in ten overs. He then took 3\u201326 in the third match, before playing the remaining matches of the series. Although Anderson struggled to take wickets, his economical bowling frustrated the opposition and kept the run rate down. By the end of the tour, Anderson had established himself as the leader of the England attack, with his swing bowling making him one of the most feared bowlers in the world.\n\n===2010\u201311: Australia===\nAs expected, Anderson was selected in the England squad to play Australia, where he developed his own wobble-seam delivery to combat the Kookaburra ball that doesn't swing as much for as long.<ref>{{Citation|last=ajit ray|title=James Anderson Masterclass \u2013 Part 1|date=16 November 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TELre9qg0LI|accessdate=7 August 2017}}</ref> Anderson played well in the opening tour games and took two wickets in the opening Test match, which finished as a draw. In the second Test England thrashed Australia, winning by an innings and 71 runs. Anderson took 4\u201351 in the first innings and Australia were never able to recover. England lost the third Test, but Anderson still impressed taking 4 wickets. Anderson took 4\u201344 in the fourth Test, which England won to retain the Ashes. He then took 4\u201366 and 3\u201361 as England won the fifth Test and series 3\u20131. During the series Anderson became the second youngest England bowler to claim 200 Test wickets.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/8211822/The-Ashes-2010-James-Andersons-200-Test-wicket-milestone-fails-to-paper-over-England-fielding-faults.html |title=The Ashes 2010: James Anderson's 200 Test wicket milestone fails to paper over England fielding faults |author=Scyld Berry |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=25 May 2013 |location=London |date=18 December 2010}}</ref> Anderson was rested at the start of the ODI series, but with England struggling he was recalled, taking 2\u201357 in the third match. In the sixth match Anderson took 1\u201391 of his ten overs as the England team struggled. Anderson took 3\u201348 in the final match of the series, but it wasn't enough to prevent another defeat as England lost the one-day series 6\u20131.\n\n===2011: World Cup, Sri Lanka and India===\nAnderson was selected in the squad for the 2011 World Cup and played in the opening game against the Netherlands. He was involved in the dramatic tie against India, where both teams posted 338, and also played as England suffered an embarrassing defeat against Ireland. His best match of the tournament came when he helped England defend 171 against South Africa, where he bowled six overs, collecting figures of 2\u201316. He was left out of the team against the West Indies, which England won. Anderson did not appear in England's final match against Sri Lanka, in which they lost by ten wickets and so bowed out at the quarter-final stage of the competition. Overall, Anderson had a disappointing tournament, although the pitches did not suit his style of bowling being unable to get the ball to swing.\n\nAnderson was part of the England team when Sri Lanka toured in 2011. Anderson took 3\u201366 in the first innings, but was unable to bowl in the second due to an injury. England won the first Test after Sri Lanka collapsed for 82 all out in the second innings. Anderson was ruled out of the second Test through injury but returned for the third, taking figures of 2\u201356 and 2\u201381 as England drew the match, but won the series 1\u20130. Anderson took 4\u201318 in the first ODI but was wicketless in the second match. In the fourth match he returned to his best, taking 3\u201324. In the final match he took 2\u201355, helping England to a series win.\n\nEngland's next opponents were India. England needed to win the four match series by two games to overtake India in the world rankings and become the new top-ranked Test team. Anderson shone in the first Test, taking 5\u201365 as England took a 1\u20130 lead. Anderson took 5 more wickets in the second Test and a further 6 in the third as England took a 3\u20130 series lead. Anderson took 3 more wickets in the final Test as England won the series 4\u20130 and became the new world Number Ones. Following Anderson's performance, he was widely considered the premier fast bowler in the world. Anderson took 3\u201348 in the third ODI but was left out of the final game of the series as had already won, taking a 2\u20130 lead into the final match, which they also won by 6 wickets.\n\n===2011\u201312: Pakistan and Sri Lanka===\nEngland toured Pakistan at the back end of 2012. The series was held in [[UAE|the UAE]]. England struggled in the conditions and slumped to a heavy defeat in the first Test, with Anderson largely ineffectual. England again lost the second Test, with poor performances from the batsmen giving the bowlers little to work with. Anderson took his best figures of the tour, 3\u201335 in the final match of the series, but it wasn't enough to prevent a whitewash for Pakistan. After the series, England moved on to Sri Lanka for a two-match Test series. Anderson took 5\u201372 in the first innings but it wasn't enough to prevent a fourth straight defeat for England. Anderson was praised for his performance in conditions which did not favour seam bowlers. England won the final Test to level the series, with Anderson taking figures of 4\u201398 in the match. As a result of his performances, Anderson was named England Cricketer of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/564834.html |title=Anderson voted Player of the Year |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2012: West Indies and South Africa===\nIn the second Test against West Indies, Anderson took 4\u201343 at Trent Bridge, a ground where he always performed due to the swing-friendly conditions. With England taking a 2\u20130 series lead, Anderson was rested for the final match of the series to help him avoid burnout.  Anderson played in the ODI series against the West Indies, taking 2\u201338 in the second match. England then played Australia in 5 ODIs. Anderson took 2\u201355 in the first match, and 2\u201334 in the fourth match. There were suggestions that Anderson would play no part in the series, both to rest him and to deprive Australia of facing him ahead of the Ashes series the following year. However, despite this, Anderson played a key part in the series.\n\nEngland faced South Africa at the end of the summer, with their Number One ranking on the line. The series was also anticipated as a chance to see Anderson go head to head with Dale Steyn, regarded as the world's two best seam bowlers. The series was a disappointment for England. They lost the first Test by an innings, with Anderson managing figures of 1\u2013116. The second Test was a tighter affair, with the match ending in a draw, but Anderson could only manage three wickets in the match. England lost the third Test, meaning a 2\u20130 series defeat, and South Africa earned their place at the top of the Test rankings. Anderson took 4\u201344 in the third ODI, and 2\u201341 in the fifth as the series ended as 2\u20132 draw. This was seen as a positive result for England, with several young players being blooded against an experienced South African team.\n\n===2012\u201313: India, New Zealand and Champions Trophy===\nFollowing the defeat to South Africa, Andrew Strauss retired and was replaced as captain by Alistair Cook. The first series under the leadership of Cook was against India. England lost the first Test by 9 wickets, with Anderson taking just one wicket in the match. England won the second Test convincingly, but Anderson again struggled in conditions more suited to spinners. Anderson performed much better in the third Test, taking six wickets overall. Anderson took the wicket of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] in the 1st innings of the third Test to equal [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] as the most successful bowler against Tendulkar with a total of eight dismissals. With England needing just a draw to win the series in the final Test, Anderson took 4\u201381 to help England draw the match and win the series 2\u20131.\n\nIn the tour of New Zealand, Anderson returned to the ODI side. In February 2013 during England's loss of the [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2012\u201313#1st ODI|1st One day international in New Zealand]], with the wicket of [[BJ Watling]], his 529th in international cricket, Anderson overtook [[Ian Botham]] to become England's all-time highest wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/19/james-anderson-ian-botham-england-record |title=James Anderson 'honoured' to overhaul Sir Ian Botham's England record |accessdate=18 May 2013|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=19 February 2013}}</ref> He took 5\u201334 in the second match as England went on to win the series. Anderson took 4\u2013137 in the first Test and went on to take wickets in every innings in the series. The series itself finished 0\u20130, with the batsmen dominating on good batting wickets.\n\n[[File:Anderson bowling, 2013.jpg|thumb|300px|Anderson bowling during the Champions Trophy match in which he became England's leading wicket-taker in ODIs]]\n\nAnderson played a key role in the 2013 Champions Trophy. He took 3\u201330 against Australia as England made a winning start to their campaign. During the match [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy|ICC Champions Trophy match against Australia]] he became England's leading ODI wicket-taker when he took his 235th wicket.<ref name=\"ODIWickets\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/22829402 |title=James Anderson becomes England's leading ODI wicket-taker |accessdate=8 June 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> In the final Group A match he took 3\u201332 as England reached the semi-finals of the competition. England shocked South Africa and won by 7 wickets, with Anderson taking 2\u201314 off 8 overs. England played India, the favourites for the competition in the final, in what proved to be a rain interrupted match. Only being able to bowl four overs, Anderson took 1\u201324, but a poor batting performance meant that England lost the match and India went on to become champions.\n\nIn the opening match of the Test series against New Zealand, Anderson took match figures of 7\u201370. One the second day of the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2013#1st Test|1st Test against New Zealand]], he became the fourth English bowler to take 300 Test wickets when he dismissed [[Peter Fulton]].<ref name=\"Anderson300\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/22573162 |title=James Anderson takes 300th Test wicket for England |accessdate=17 May 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> England went on to win the series 2\u20130. Anderson took 3\u201331 in the first ODI, and also played in the second match. England lost the series 2\u20131.\n\n===2013\u201314: Australia===\nDuring the summer of 2013, England played Australia in the first of what would be back-to-back Ashes Series. The first Test of the [[2013 Ashes Series|home series]] was held at Trent Bridge. Despite being favourites, England struggled in the first innings, posting just 215. Anderson led the fightback, taking 5\u201385 as England bowled Australia out for 280. As Australia closed in on winning the match in the second innings, Anderson took 5\u201373, including the winning wicket. Anderson was required to bowl a long spell to win England the match, and Kevin Pietersen later posted a picture of Anderson lying exhausted on the floor. England won the second Test, although this time Anderson was less influential, taking only three wickets. Anderson was again quiet in the third Test, in which England managed to hold on to a draw following a long rain delay. Anderson took 2\u201365 in the fourth Test as England went 3\u20130 up in the series. Following the game, there was speculation Anderson would be rested for the final Test to ensure he would be fresh for the return series in Australia. However, Anderson played and took 4\u201395 in the first innings, as the match ended in a draw and England won the series 3\u20130. Anderson was rested for the ODI series as back up bowlers such as Ben Stokes and Boyd Rankin were given the chance to play.\n\nAnderson again toured Australia as part of the [[2013\u201314 Ashes series]]. It proved to be a miserable tour for Anderson and the rest of his England teammates. Anderson was ineffectual in the first Test as England lost convincingly. He took 3 wickets in the second Test but it was clear the conditions did not suit his game. In the third Test he bowled 19 wicketless overs and conceded 105 runs as England lost the series. He took 4\u201367 in the fourth Test but was unable to prevent defeat as the English batsmen continued to struggle. In the fifth Test Australia completed the whitewash, with Anderson taking three wickets in the match. Anderson was rested for the ODI series, which England again struggled in, losing 4\u20131.\n\n===2014: Sri Lanka and India===\n\nFollowing the Ashes series, England played Sri Lanka at home. In the first match of the series Anderson had figures of 1\u201322. In the second ODI between England and Sri Lanka, Anderson took two wickets for 38 runs. He finished with figures of 2\u201310 in the next match as England won by 10 wickets. He took 2\u201360 in the next match as Sri Lanka levelled the series at 2\u20132. England lost the final match of the series, with Anderson finishing with figures of 1\u201333. After picking up figures of 3\u201393 in the Sri Lankan first innings, he took 4\u201325 in the second as England fell narrowly short of victory as the first Test ended in a draw. In the second Test, he took 2\u201349 in the first innings before taking 3\u201391 in the second. As England battled to save the Test, Anderson faced 55 balls but was dismissed on the penultimate ball of the match as England lost the match. Anderson was named England's man of the series after taking 12 wickets in the series.\n\nOn 12 July 2014, in the First Test of the [[Indian cricket team in England in 2014|series against India]], Anderson and teammate [[Joe Root]] broke numerous records in England's first innings of the first Test against [[Indian national cricket team|India]] at Trent Bridge. Anderson hit his maiden first-class fifty as well as posting the highest score (81 runs) by an England No 11 batsman in Test history. His innings was also the longest innings by a No 11 batsman in Test history. Timed at 230 minutes, it surpassed the previous record set by Mushtaq Ahmed in 1997 (183 minutes) by almost an hour. He and Root also set a new [[world record]] for a 10th-wicket partnership in Test cricket scoring 198 runs, beating the 163 run-partnership by Australians [[Phillip Hughes]] and [[Ashton Agar]] at [[Trent Bridge]] on 11 July 2013. Anderson and fellow bowler Stuart Broad were criticised for their performance in the second Test after failing to capitalise on a good bowling surface. Anderson finished with match figures of 5\u2013137 as England lost the match, increasing the pressure on the team. He returned to his best in the next Test as England levelled the series as he took figures of 5\u201353 in the first innings and 2\u201324 in the second. His first-innings spell was nominated to be one of the best Test bowling performance of the year 2014 by ESPNCricinfo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/awards2014/content/story/819605.html|title=All hail the left-armers|website=www.espncricinfo.com|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\nIn the fourth match of the series he took match figures of 5\u201364 as England won the match by an innings to go 2\u20131 up in the series. Anderson was again pivotal as England won the final match of the series, taking four wickets in the match. After the conclusion of the 5th Test, Anderson was named Man of the Series for taking 25 wickets. Anderson had a mixed ODI series against India. After the first match was abandoned, Anderson was wicket less in the first three games of the series, taking figures of 0\u201357, 0\u201329 and 0\u201338 as England went 3\u20130 down in the series. However, he bowled well in the final match of the series, taking figures of 2\u201339 as England won the match.\n\n===2015: Tri-Series===\nFollowing injury, Anderson returned to the England team for the second match of the Tri-Series against India, where he had figures of 4\u201318 to help England win. In the next match against Australia he was wicket less as England were defeated. In the game against India, Anderson picked up figures of 1\u201324 to help England qualify for the final. In the final, Anderson picked up two wickets but England lost the match and finished runners-up.\n\n===2015: World Cup===\nAnderson failed to take a wicket in the first match against Australia, finishing with figures of 0\u201367. In the next match against New Zealand he finished with figures of 0\u201337 as England suffered a humiliating eight wicket defeat. He took his first wickets of the tournament against Scotland as he collected figures of 2\u201330 as England won their first game of the tournament. He was again wicket less in England's defeat to Sri Lanka. In their must win game against Bangladesh, Anderson took figures of 2\u201345 but was later the last man out as England lost the game to exit the World Cup. In their final group game against Afghanistan, Anderson bowled economically, finishing with figures of 1\u201318 as England won their final match of the tournament.\n\n===2015: West Indies and New Zealand===\nIn April 2015, during the drawn first Test of the [[English cricket team in the West Indies in 2014\u201315|West Indies tour]] in [[Antigua]] (Anderson's 100th match), he had West Indies captain [[Denesh Ramdin]] caught at [[Slip (cricket)|slip]] for his 384th Test wicket, thus overtaking another [[Ian Botham]] record and becoming England's all-time highest Test match wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/32361929 |title=James Anderson proud to surpass Sir Ian Botham's Test record |accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|location=London|date=18 April 2015}}</ref> Despite Anderson's best efforts, the match ended in a draw. In the second Test Anderson took 2\u201347 West Indies first innings as they were bowled out for 299. His figures of 4\u201343 in the second innings helped England put themselves in a match winning position. They won the game by nine wickets to go 1\u20130 up in the series. In the final Test, Anderson took 6\u201342 in the West Indies first innings as England took a first innings lead. However, England collapsed in their second innings and although Anderson took a wicket in the West Indies second innings, it wasn't enough to prevent a five wicket defeat as the series ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He was awarded with the player of the series award.\n\n[[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2015|New Zealand toured England]] for a 2 test and 5 ODI series. Anderson took 1\u201388 in New Zealand's first innings in the first Test between the two sides.

In the second Test he failed to take a wicket in the whole match, finishing with figures of 0\u201399 in the first innings and 0\u201348 in the second innings as Australia won the match by 405 runs. In the third Test, Anderson took 6\u201347 in the Australian first innings to help restrict them to 136. He took 1\u201315 in the second innings but injured himself in the process. Although England won the game to go 2\u20131 up in the series, Anderson was ruled out of the remainder of the series through injury.

In the second innings he took figures of 2\u201330 as Pakistan were bowled out for 173, but England did not have enough time to force a win and the match finished in a draw. In the second Test Anderson took 1\u201340 in the first innings, before finishing with figures of 2\u201322 in Pakistan's second innings as they were dismissed for 354.

However, they recovered in their second innings, scoring 355, despite Anderson taking 2\u201352. An England second innings collapse saw Pakistan win the series 2\u20130.\n\n===2015\u201316: South Africa===\nAnderson was injured for the first Test against South Africa. He returned to the side for the second Test but failed to make an impact, taking 1\u201377 as the match ended in a draw. In the third Test Anderson took 1\u201360 in South Africa's first innings, before taking 1\u201326 in their second innings as they collapsed to 83 all out to hand England a historic victory on South Africa soil. Anderson took his best figures of the series in the final Test, finishing with 3\u201347 in South Africa's second innings, but a poor batting performance from England saw South Africa win the Test by 280 run, although England won the series 2\u20131.\n\n===2016: Sri Lanka and Pakistan===\nIn the first Test against Sri Lanka, Anderson was in sublime form, taking figures of 5\u201316 in the tourist's first innings to restrict them to 91. In their second innings, he took figures of 5\u201329 as England secured a comprehensive victory by a margin of an innings and 88 runs.

In the final, rain affected match of the series, Anderson took figures of 2\u201361 in Sri Lanka's first innings, and then took the only wicket to fall in Sri Lanka's second innings as the match ended in a draw.

In the third match, he took figures of 2\u201354 in Pakistan's first innings and then took 2\u201331 in their second innings as England recorded a 141 run victory.

In the fourth Test he took 0\u201363 as India posted 631 and won the game by an innings and 36 runs. Anderson missed the final Test through injury, with England losing the series 4\u20130.\n\n===2017\u201318: Australia===\nAnderson was named as England Test vice-captain after Ben Stokes was suspended indefinitely.

Although coach [[Trevor Bayliss]] described the incident as trivial, coming as it did after the Stokes affair and a head-butting incident between [[Cameron Bancroft (cricketer)|Cameron Bancroft]] and [[Jonny Bairstow]], it seemed to confirm that England had off-field issues during the 2017\u201318 Ashes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shemilt |first1=Stephan |title=Ashes: Ben Duckett suspended from playing on England Lions tour |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/42298950 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAnderson played all five Test matches in the Ashes but couldn't prevent his team losing control of the urn, with England slipping to a 4\u20130 series defeat. Despite the poor performance of the team as a whole, Anderson emerged with some considerable personal credit having returned figures of 17 wickets at an average of 27.82 over the Test series, including a haul of 5/43 in the 2nd innings of the day-night 2nd Test at Adelaide.<ref>{{cite web |title=James Anderson out to prove doubters wrong after maiden five-wicket haul in Australia |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2017/12/05/james-anderson-prove-doubters-wrong-maiden-five-wicket-haul/ |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> He ended the tour as the top England wicket-taker in the Ashes.

Anderson''', is an English international [[cricket]]er who plays for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] and the [[England cricket team]]. Anderson is the [[Fast bowling#Top five fast bowlers|all-time leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers]] surpassing Glenn McGrath (563 wickets) and holds the record of most wickets for England in both Test and One-Day International (ODI) cricket. He is the only English bowler, and the 6th overall, to pass 500 Test wickets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/wi/content/records/93276.html|title=Test matches {{!}} Most wickets in career |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=12 September 2018}}</ref>Anderson is also a co-presenter alongside [[Greg James]] and [[Felix White]] on the Tailenders podcast. \n\nAnderson plays [[first-class cricket]] for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire county cricket club]] and since arriving on the international scene in 2002/03 (before his first full season of County cricket) has represented England in 150 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] and nearly 200 [[One Day International]]s.<ref name=\"cricinfo player profile\"/> He is England's all-time highest international wicket-taker when combined across all three formats. He and [[Joe Root]] posted the highest ever 10th-wicket Test batting partnership in the 1st Test of India's 2014 tour of England.\n\nA right-arm [[Fast bowling|pace bowler]], Anderson made his international debut at the age of just 20, on England's 2002/03 tour of [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. When he played his first ODI he had only played five [[List A]] matches. Anderson went on to feature in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 ICC World Cup]] and made his Test match debut against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at [[Lord's]] the next summer. Later in 2003, he experienced a dip in form and confidence against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. After this, he was in and out of the team and experienced numerous injuries, including a [[stress fracture]] of the back which kept him out of action for most of the 2006 season. He returned to action and is now the opening bowler in England's Test team. He was a regular strike bowler in England's one-day team but has not played in that format since the 2015 World Cup. He is the first English bowler to reach 400 and 500 wickets in Test matches, and on 11 September 2018, he became 4th highest Test wicket-taker of all time. He reached this position when he took his 564th Test wicket, passing [[Glenn McGrath]] as the leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers. {{As of|2019|January}} he is ranked No.2 in the [[ICC Player Rankings#Top 10 Test Bowlers|ICC Test Bowling Rankings]], having previously reached the top position at various times between 2016 and 2018.\n\nOn 25 July 2016, during the second Test of that year's England-Pakistan series at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], he became the first fast bowler to take 50 wickets against all other 7 major Test-playing nations, Australia, India, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], South Africa, [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/2282874.stm |author=Scott Heinrich |title=Anderson on fast track |publisher=BBC |date=31 December 2002}} Retrieved on 26 June 2008.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket-videos/ashes-2019-james-anderson-world-class-stuart-broad-cricket/article29391846.ece|title=James Anderson delighted for 'world class' Stuart Broad|last=Sportstar|first=Team|website=Sportstar|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref> In December 2019, in the first Test [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2019\u201320|against South Africa]], Anderson became the ninth cricketer to [[List of Test cricket records#Individual records (other)|play in 150 Test matches]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/preview/1185304/south-africa-vs-england-1st-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021 |title=Bruised England look to improve touring record against battered South Africa |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> In January 2020, in the second Test of the series against South Africa, Anderson took his [[List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by James Anderson|28th five-wicket haul]] in Test cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/11901500/james-anderson-completes-five-for-before-england-grow-lead-in-cape-town |title=James Anderson completes five-for before England grow lead in Cape Town |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> He surpassed Sir [[Ian Botham]]'s record of 27, to become the bowler with the [[List of cricketers by number of international five-wicket hauls|most five-wicket hauls]] for England in Test cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/sport/dom-sibley-builds-on-more-good-work-from-james-anderson-as-england-flourish/ |title=Dom Sibley builds on more good work from James Anderson as England flourish |work=Evening Express |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early and personal life==\nJames Anderson was a pupil at St Mary's and [[St Theodore's RC High School]], [[Burnley]].

England were expected to win easily and cruised to victory in the first Test, with Anderson taking figures of 4\u201378 and 1\u201384. Anderson also played in the second Test, finishing with figures of 1\u201345 and 3\u201316. England won the series 2\u20130. Anderson played in the first ODI, but was expensive, taking figures of 3\u201374. He was wicketless in the second game as England suffered a shock defeat. Anderson did not play in the decider, which England won to take the series.\n\nEngland then played Pakistan at home. It was during this series that Anderson established himself as one of the world's best Test bowlers. In the first match he took 5\u201354 and 6\u201317 which England won. This left Anderson with match figures of 11\u201371. He helped England win the second Test, achieving figures of 4\u201320 in the first innings. Anderson continued to impress in the final two Tests continuing to be economical and providing a wicket-taking threat. Anderson was rested for the first ODI, but returned in the second, taking 1\u201336 in ten overs. He then took 3\u201326 in the third match, before playing the remaining matches of the series. Although Anderson struggled to take wickets, his economical bowling frustrated the opposition and kept the run rate down. By the end of the tour, Anderson had established himself as the leader of the England attack, with his swing bowling making him one of the most feared bowlers in the world.\n\n===2010\u201311: Australia===\nAs expected, Anderson was selected in the England squad to play Australia, where he developed his own wobble-seam delivery to combat the Kookaburra ball that doesn't swing as much for as long.<ref>{{Citation|last=ajit ray|title=James Anderson Masterclass \u2013 Part 1|date=16 November 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TELre9qg0LI|accessdate=7 August 2017}}</ref> Anderson played well in the opening tour games and took two wickets in the opening Test match, which finished as a draw.

England lost the third Test, but Anderson still impressed taking 4 wickets. Anderson took 4\u201344 in the fourth Test, which England won to retain the Ashes. He then took 4\u201366 and 3\u201361 as England won the fifth Test and series 3\u20131.

Anderson took 3\u201348 in the final match of the series, but it wasn't enough to prevent another defeat as England lost the one-day series 6\u20131.\n\n===2011: World Cup, Sri Lanka and India===\nAnderson was selected in the squad for the 2011 World Cup and played in the opening game against the Netherlands. He was involved in the dramatic tie against India, where both teams posted 338, and also played as England suffered an embarrassing defeat against Ireland. His best match of the tournament came when he helped England defend 171 against South Africa, where he bowled six overs, collecting figures of 2\u201316. He was left out of the team against the West Indies, which England won. Anderson did not appear in England's final match against Sri Lanka, in which they lost by ten wickets and so bowed out at the quarter-final stage of the competition. Overall, Anderson had a disappointing tournament, although the pitches did not suit his style of bowling being unable to get the ball to swing.\n\nAnderson was part of the England team when Sri Lanka toured in 2011. Anderson took 3\u201366 in the first innings, but was unable to bowl in the second due to an injury. England won the first Test after Sri Lanka collapsed for 82 all out in the second innings. Anderson was ruled out of the second Test through injury but returned for the third, taking figures of 2\u201356 and 2\u201381 as England drew the match, but won the series 1\u20130. Anderson took 4\u201318 in the first ODI but was wicketless in the second match. In the fourth match he returned to his best, taking 3\u201324. In the final match he took 2\u201355, helping England to a series win.\n\nEngland's next opponents were India. England needed to win the four match series by two games to overtake India in the world rankings and become the new top-ranked Test team. Anderson shone in the first Test, taking 5\u201365 as England took a 1\u20130 lead. Anderson took 5 more wickets in the second Test and a further 6 in the third as England took a 3\u20130 series lead. Anderson took 3 more wickets in the final Test as England won the series 4\u20130 and became the new world Number Ones. Following Anderson's performance, he was widely considered the premier fast bowler in the world. Anderson took 3\u201348 in the third ODI but was left out of the final game of the series as had already won, taking a 2\u20130 lead into the final match, which they also won by 6 wickets.\n\n===2011\u201312: Pakistan and Sri Lanka===\nEngland toured Pakistan at the back end of 2012. The series was held in [[UAE|the UAE]]. England struggled in the conditions and slumped to a heavy defeat in the first Test, with Anderson largely ineffectual. England again lost the second Test, with poor performances from the batsmen giving the bowlers little to work with. Anderson took his best figures of the tour, 3\u201335 in the final match of the series, but it wasn't enough to prevent a whitewash for Pakistan. After the series, England moved on to Sri Lanka for a two-match Test series. Anderson took 5\u201372 in the first innings but it wasn't enough to prevent a fourth straight defeat for England. Anderson was praised for his performance in conditions which did not favour seam bowlers. England won the final Test to level the series, with Anderson taking figures of 4\u201398 in the match. As a result of his performances, Anderson was named England Cricketer of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/564834.html |title=Anderson voted Player of the Year |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2012: West Indies and South Africa===\nIn the second Test against West Indies, Anderson took 4\u201343 at Trent Bridge, a ground where he always performed due to the swing-friendly conditions. With England taking a 2\u20130 series lead, Anderson was rested for the final match of the series to help him avoid burnout.  Anderson played in the ODI series against the West Indies, taking 2\u201338 in the second match. England then played Australia in 5 ODIs. Anderson took 2\u201355 in the first match, and 2\u201334 in the fourth match. There were suggestions that Anderson would play no part in the series, both to rest him and to deprive Australia of facing him ahead of the Ashes series the following year. However, despite this, Anderson played a key part in the series.\n\nEngland faced South Africa at the end of the summer, with their Number One ranking on the line. The series was also anticipated as a chance to see Anderson go head to head with Dale Steyn, regarded as the world's two best seam bowlers. The series was a disappointment for England. They lost the first Test by an innings, with Anderson managing figures of 1\u2013116. The second Test was a tighter affair, with the match ending in a draw, but Anderson could only manage three wickets in the match. England lost the third Test, meaning a 2\u20130 series defeat, and South Africa earned their place at the top of the Test rankings. Anderson took 4\u201344 in the third ODI, and 2\u201341 in the fifth as the series ended as 2\u20132 draw. This was seen as a positive result for England, with several young players being blooded against an experienced South African team.\n\n===2012\u201313: India, New Zealand and Champions Trophy===\nFollowing the defeat to South Africa, Andrew Strauss retired and was replaced as captain by Alistair Cook. The first series under the leadership of Cook was against India. England lost the first Test by 9 wickets, with Anderson taking just one wicket in the match. England won the second Test convincingly, but Anderson again struggled in conditions more suited to spinners. Anderson performed much better in the third Test, taking six wickets overall. Anderson took the wicket of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] in the 1st innings of the third Test to equal [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] as the most successful bowler against Tendulkar with a total of eight dismissals. With England needing just a draw to win the series in the final Test, Anderson took 4\u201381 to help England draw the match and win the series 2\u20131.\n\nIn the tour of New Zealand, Anderson returned to the ODI side. In February 2013 during England's loss of the [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2012\u201313#1st ODI|1st One day international in New Zealand]], with the wicket of [[BJ Watling]], his 529th in international cricket, Anderson overtook [[Ian Botham]] to become England's all-time highest wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/19/james-anderson-ian-botham-england-record |title=James Anderson 'honoured' to overhaul Sir Ian Botham's England record |accessdate=18 May 2013|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=19 February 2013}}</ref> He took 5\u201334 in the second match as England went on to win the series. Anderson took 4\u2013137 in the first Test and went on to take wickets in every innings in the series. The series itself finished 0\u20130, with the batsmen dominating on good batting wickets.\n\n[[File:Anderson bowling, 2013.jpg|thumb|300px|Anderson bowling during the Champions Trophy match in which he became England's leading wicket-taker in ODIs]]\n\nAnderson played a key role in the 2013 Champions Trophy. He took 3\u201330 against Australia as England made a winning start to their campaign. During the match [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy|ICC Champions Trophy match against Australia]] he became England's leading ODI wicket-taker when he took his 235th wicket.<ref name=\"ODIWickets\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/22829402 |title=James Anderson becomes England's leading ODI wicket-taker |accessdate=8 June 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> In the final Group A match he took 3\u201332 as England reached the semi-finals of the competition. England shocked South Africa and won by 7 wickets, with Anderson taking 2\u201314 off 8 overs. England played India, the favourites for the competition in the final, in what proved to be a rain interrupted match. Only being able to bowl four overs, Anderson took 1\u201324, but a poor batting performance meant that England lost the match and India went on to become champions.\n\nIn the opening match of the Test series against New Zealand, Anderson took match figures of 7\u201370. One the second day of the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2013#1st Test|1st Test against New Zealand]], he became the fourth English bowler to take 300 Test wickets when he dismissed [[Peter Fulton]].<ref name=\"Anderson300\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/22573162 |title=James Anderson takes 300th Test wicket for England |accessdate=17 May 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> England went on to win the series 2\u20130. Anderson took 3\u201331 in the first ODI, and also played in the second match. England lost the series 2\u20131.\n\n===2013\u201314: Australia===\nDuring the summer of 2013, England played Australia in the first of what would be back-to-back Ashes Series. The first Test of the [[2013 Ashes Series|home series]] was held at Trent Bridge. Despite being favourites, England struggled in the first innings, posting just 215. Anderson led the fightback, taking 5\u201385 as England bowled Australia out for 280. As Australia closed in on winning the match in the second innings, Anderson took 5\u201373, including the winning wicket. Anderson was required to bowl a long spell to win England the match, and Kevin Pietersen later posted a picture of Anderson lying exhausted on the floor. England won the second Test, although this time Anderson was less influential, taking only three wickets. Anderson was again quiet in the third Test, in which England managed to hold on to a draw following a long rain delay. Anderson took 2\u201365 in the fourth Test as England went 3\u20130 up in the series. Following the game, there was speculation Anderson would be rested for the final Test to ensure he would be fresh for the return series in Australia. However, Anderson played and took 4\u201395 in the first innings, as the match ended in a draw and England won the series 3\u20130. Anderson was rested for the ODI series as back up bowlers such as Ben Stokes and Boyd Rankin were given the chance to play.\n\nAnderson again toured Australia as part of the [[2013\u201314 Ashes series]]. It proved to be a miserable tour for Anderson and the rest of his England teammates. Anderson was ineffectual in the first Test as England lost convincingly. He took 3 wickets in the second Test but it was clear the conditions did not suit his game. In the third Test he bowled 19 wicketless overs and conceded 105 runs as England lost the series. He took 4\u201367 in the fourth Test but was unable to prevent defeat as the English batsmen continued to struggle. In the fifth Test Australia completed the whitewash, with Anderson taking three wickets in the match. Anderson was rested for the ODI series, which England again struggled in, losing 4\u20131.\n\n===2014: Sri Lanka and India===\n\nFollowing the Ashes series, England played Sri Lanka at home. In the first match of the series Anderson had figures of 1\u201322. In the second ODI between England and Sri Lanka, Anderson took two wickets for 38 runs. He finished with figures of 2\u201310 in the next match as England won by 10 wickets. He took 2\u201360 in the next match as Sri Lanka levelled the series at 2\u20132. England lost the final match of the series, with Anderson finishing with figures of 1\u201333. After picking up figures of 3\u201393 in the Sri Lankan first innings, he took 4\u201325 in the second as England fell narrowly short of victory as the first Test ended in a draw. In the second Test, he took 2\u201349 in the first innings before taking 3\u201391 in the second. As England battled to save the Test, Anderson faced 55 balls but was dismissed on the penultimate ball of the match as England lost the match. Anderson was named England's man of the series after taking 12 wickets in the series.\n\nOn 12 July 2014, in the First Test of the [[Indian cricket team in England in 2014|series against India]], Anderson and teammate [[Joe Root]] broke numerous records in England's first innings of the first Test against [[Indian national cricket team|India]] at Trent Bridge. Anderson hit his maiden first-class fifty as well as posting the highest score (81 runs) by an England No 11 batsman in Test history. His innings was also the longest innings by a No 11 batsman in Test history. Timed at 230 minutes, it surpassed the previous record set by Mushtaq Ahmed in 1997 (183 minutes) by almost an hour. He and Root also set a new [[world record]] for a 10th-wicket partnership in Test cricket scoring 198 runs, beating the 163 run-partnership by Australians [[Phillip Hughes]] and [[Ashton Agar]] at [[Trent Bridge]] on 11 July 2013. Anderson and fellow bowler Stuart Broad were criticised for their performance in the second Test after failing to capitalise on a good bowling surface. Anderson finished with match figures of 5\u2013137 as England lost the match, increasing the pressure on the team. He returned to his best in the next Test as England levelled the series as he took figures of 5\u201353 in the first innings and 2\u201324 in the second. His first-innings spell was nominated to be one of the best Test bowling performance of the year 2014 by ESPNCricinfo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/awards2014/content/story/819605.html|title=All hail the left-armers|website=www.espncricinfo.com|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\nIn the fourth match of the series he took match figures of 5\u201364 as England won the match by an innings to go 2\u20131 up in the series. Anderson was again pivotal as England won the final match of the series, taking four wickets in the match. After the conclusion of the 5th Test, Anderson was named Man of the Series for taking 25 wickets. Anderson had a mixed ODI series against India. After the first match was abandoned, Anderson was wicket less in the first three games of the series, taking figures of 0\u201357, 0\u201329 and 0\u201338 as England went 3\u20130 down in the series. However, he bowled well in the final match of the series, taking figures of 2\u201339 as England won the match.\n\n===2015: Tri-Series===\nFollowing injury, Anderson returned to the England team for the second match of the Tri-Series against India, where he had figures of 4\u201318 to help England win. In the next match against Australia he was wicket less as England were defeated. In the game against India, Anderson picked up figures of 1\u201324 to help England qualify for the final. In the final, Anderson picked up two wickets but England lost the match and finished runners-up.\n\n===2015: World Cup===\nAnderson failed to take a wicket in the first match against Australia, finishing with figures of 0\u201367. In the next match against New Zealand he finished with figures of 0\u201337 as England suffered a humiliating eight wicket defeat. He took his first wickets of the tournament against Scotland as he collected figures of 2\u201330 as England won their first game of the tournament. He was again wicket less in England's defeat to Sri Lanka. In their must win game against Bangladesh, Anderson took figures of 2\u201345 but was later the last man out as England lost the game to exit the World Cup. In their final group game against Afghanistan, Anderson bowled economically, finishing with figures of 1\u201318 as England won their final match of the tournament.\n\n===2015: West Indies and New Zealand===\nIn April 2015, during the drawn first Test of the [[English cricket team in the West Indies in 2014\u201315|West Indies tour]] in [[Antigua]] (Anderson's 100th match), he had West Indies captain [[Denesh Ramdin]] caught at [[Slip (cricket)|slip]] for his 384th Test wicket, thus overtaking another [[Ian Botham]] record and becoming England's all-time highest Test match wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/32361929 |title=James Anderson proud to surpass Sir Ian Botham's Test record |accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|location=London|date=18 April 2015}}</ref> Despite Anderson's best efforts, the match ended in a draw. In the second Test Anderson took 2\u201347 West Indies first innings as they were bowled out for 299. His figures of 4\u201343 in the second innings helped England put themselves in a match winning position. They won the game by nine wickets to go 1\u20130 up in the series. In the final Test, Anderson took 6\u201342 in the West Indies first innings as England took a first innings lead. However, England collapsed in their second innings and although Anderson took a wicket in the West Indies second innings, it wasn't enough to prevent a five wicket defeat as the series ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He was awarded with the player of the series award.\n\n[[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2015|New Zealand toured England]] for a 2 test and 5 ODI series. Anderson took 1\u201388 in New Zealand's first innings in the first Test between the two sides. In the second innings he took 1\u201331 as England won the match by 124 runs to go 1\u20130 up in the series. In the second Test he took 2\u201343 as New Zealand were bowled out for 350. He made an unbeaten ten with the bat to help England reach 350 and level the scores. In New Zealand's second innings he took 2\u201396 as New Zealand won the Test to level the series at 1\u20131. During the series Anderson took his 400th Test wicket and scored his 1000th Test run.\n\n===2015: Australia===\nIn the first Test Anderson took figures of 3\u201343 in Australia's first innings to help restrict them to 308, and England went on to win the game by 169 runs. In the second Test he failed to take a wicket in the whole match, finishing with figures of 0\u201399 in the first innings and 0\u201348 in the second innings as Australia won the match by 405 runs.

Although England won the game to go 2\u20131 up in the series, Anderson was ruled out of the remainder of the series through injury. England went on to win the series 3\u20132.\n\n===2015: Pakistan===\nAnderson recovered from his injury in time for the Test series against Pakistan. In the first innings of the first Test, Anderson took figures of 2\u201342 and bowled economically as Pakistan were dismissed for 523. In the second innings he took figures of 2\u201330 as Pakistan were bowled out for 173, but England did not have enough time to force a win and the match finished in a draw. In the second Test Anderson took 1\u201340 in the first innings, before finishing with figures of 2\u201322 in Pakistan's second innings as they were dismissed for 354. However, England's batting was unable to chase down the target and the suffered a 127 run defeat. England needed to win the final Test of the series to level it, and Pakistan were dismissed cheaply for 234 in the first innings, with Anderson taking 4\u201317. However, they recovered in their second innings, scoring 355, despite Anderson taking 2\u201352. An England second innings collapse saw Pakistan win the series 2\u20130.\n\n===2015\u201316: South Africa===\nAnderson was injured for the first Test against South Africa. He returned to the side for the second Test but failed to make an impact, taking 1\u201377 as the match ended in a draw. In the third Test Anderson took 1\u201360 in South Africa's first innings, before taking 1\u201326 in their second innings as they collapsed to 83 all out to hand England a historic victory on South Africa soil. Anderson took his best figures of the series in the final Test, finishing with 3\u201347 in South Africa's second innings, but a poor batting performance from England saw South Africa win the Test by 280 run, although England won the series 2\u20131.\n\n===2016: Sri Lanka and Pakistan===\nIn the first Test against Sri Lanka, Anderson was in sublime form, taking figures of 5\u201316 in the tourist's first innings to restrict them to 91. In their second innings, he took figures of 5\u201329 as England secured a comprehensive victory by a margin of an innings and 88 runs. In the second Test, Anderson took 3\u201336 in Sri Lanka's first innings, and followed this up with 5\u201358 in their second innings as England secured another win, this time by nine wickets. In the final, rain affected match of the series, Anderson took figures of 2\u201361 in Sri Lanka's first innings, and then took the only wicket to fall in Sri Lanka's second innings as the match ended in a draw.

Anderson missed the final Test through injury, with England losing the series 4\u20130.\n\n===2017\u201318: Australia===\nAnderson was named as England Test vice-captain after Ben Stokes was suspended indefinitely.

Although coach [[Trevor Bayliss]] described the incident as trivial, coming as it did after the Stokes affair and a head-butting incident between [[Cameron Bancroft (cricketer)|Cameron Bancroft]] and [[Jonny Bairstow]], it seemed to confirm that England had off-field issues during the 2017\u201318 Ashes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shemilt |first1=Stephan |title=Ashes: Ben Duckett suspended from playing on England Lions tour |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/42298950 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAnderson played all five Test matches in the Ashes but couldn't prevent his team losing control of the urn, with England slipping to a 4\u20130 series defeat.

Originally a [[batting order (cricket)#Top order|top-order batsman]], his developing [[medium pace bowling]] has made him an [[all-rounder]] and he has the best bowling figures for England in a [[Twenty20 International]]. Bopara has also played for [[Karachi Kings]] in the [[Pakistan Super League]], [[Kings XI Punjab]] in the [[Indian Premier League]], [[Sydney Sixers]] in the [[Big Bash League]] and [[Chittagong Vikings]] in the [[Bangladesh Premier League]].\n\nBopara was first called up to the England [[One Day International]] team in 2007, before a difficult Test debut in Sri Lanka saw him dropped in early 2008 after a string of three [[duck (cricket)|ducks]]. He regained his place for a Test against the West Indies in the winter of 2008\u201309; on his return to the side, Bopara became the fifth batsman to score three consecutive Test centuries for England. Despite this success, during the [[2009 Ashes]] Bopara again struggled and was dropped for the final Test of the series. At the start of the 2016 season he took over the captaincy of the Essex one day team.\n\n==Early days==\n\nHe was born into a Sikh family, educated at [[Brampton Manor Academy|Brampton Manor School]], East Ham and [[Barking Abbey School]], Bopara attended [http://www.frenfordclubs.org Frenford Clubs] and represented [http://www.essexboysandgirlsclubs.org/ Essex Boys and Girls Clubs] in their representative U14 cricket team. Bopara made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut for Essex in May 2002. In 2003 and 2004, he played several matches for [[England U-19 cricket team|England U-19s]], including in the [[2004 U-19 Cricket World Cup]]. He has allegedly bowled at Radio 1 DJ Greg James whilst playing for either Wanstead or Hainault and Clayhall Cricket club.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?filter=programmes&q=Tailenders&suggid=urn%3Abbc%3Aprogrammes%3Ap02pcb4w#page=7</ref>\n[[Image:Ravinder Bopara.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Bopara playing against [[Cambridge UCCE]], April 2005]]\nIn the [[2005 English cricket season|2005 season]], he scored 880 first-class runs, including his first first-class century.

In July, he was selected in England's 30-man provisional squad for the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 Champions Trophy]].\n\n==International career==\n\n===2007 World Cup===\nIn January 2007 [[Kevin Pietersen]] sustained a rib injury in England's first [[One Day International]] against Australia, keeping him out of the remainder of the series. Bopara was called up as his replacement, and made his ODI debut on 2 February.

On 30 August, in the fourth match of huge series, he featured in a prominent tail end partnership, this time with [[Stuart Broad]] as the pair added an unbeaten 99 for the 8th wicket to defeat India at Old Trafford. Bopara finished 43 not out. He could not continue his good form, making just 11 in the next match.\n\nHe made his [[Test cricket|Test]] debut in the tour to [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in December 2007 but had a poor series, scoring only 42 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in five [[innings]] including three [[duck (cricket)|ducks]], and taking only one [[wicket]] at an [[bowling average|average]] of 81.

He made 23 in the next match, but did not bowl in either matches. In the return series in England, Bopara got off to a slow start, making scores of 10 and 27 in his first two matches. However, in the fourth match of the series he made 58 although it wasn't enough to prevent a narrow defeat for England. He made 30 in the final match of the series, leaving him with over 100 runs in the matches he played in.\n\nHe played in the first ODI against South Africa but was not required to bat, instead just bowling two overs and conceding 11 runs.

who plays for [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[England cricket team|England]] in all three formats. Originally a [[batting order (cricket)#Top order|top-order batsman]], his developing [[medium pace bowling]] has made him an [[all-rounder]] and he has the best bowling figures for England in a [[Twenty20 International]]. Bopara has also played for [[Karachi Kings]] in the [[Pakistan Super League]], [[Kings XI Punjab]] in the [[Indian Premier League]], [[Sydney Sixers]] in the [[Big Bash League]] and [[Chittagong Vikings]] in the [[Bangladesh Premier League]].\n\nBopara was first called up to the England [[One Day International]] team in 2007, before a difficult Test debut in Sri Lanka saw him dropped in early 2008 after a string of three [[duck (cricket)|ducks]]. He regained his place for a Test against the West Indies in the winter of 2008\u201309; on his return to the side, Bopara became the fifth batsman to score three consecutive Test centuries for England. Despite this success, during the [[2009 Ashes]] Bopara again struggled and was dropped for the final Test of the series. At the start of the 2016 season he took over the captaincy of the Essex one day team.\n\n==Early days==\n\nHe was born into a Sikh family, educated at [[Brampton Manor Academy|Brampton Manor School]], East Ham and [[Barking Abbey School]], Bopara attended [http://www.frenfordclubs.org Frenford Clubs] and represented [http://www.essexboysandgirlsclubs.org/ Essex Boys and Girls Clubs] in their representative U14 cricket team. Bopara made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut for Essex in May 2002. In 2003 and 2004, he played several matches for [[England U-19 cricket team|England U-19s]], including in the [[2004 U-19 Cricket World Cup]]. He has allegedly bowled at Radio 1 DJ Greg James whilst playing for either Wanstead or Hainault and Clayhall Cricket club.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?filter=programmes&q=Tailenders&suggid=urn%3Abbc%3Aprogrammes%3Ap02pcb4w#page=7</ref>\n[[Image:Ravinder Bopara.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Bopara playing against [[Cambridge UCCE]], April 2005]]\nIn the [[2005 English cricket season|2005 season]], he scored 880 first-class runs, including his first first-class century. He also hit 135 in a non-first-class match against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]], putting on 270 for the [[wicket#Partnership|second wicket]] with [[Alastair Cook]],<ref>[http://content.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/256684.html This article from Cricinfo] gives Bopara's score as 14, but the [http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005/AUS_IN_ENG/SCORECARDS/AUS_ESSEX_03-04SEP2005.html scorecard from Cricinfo] and the [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/83/83438.html scorecard from CricketArchive] both say 135.</ref> and in 2006 he was selected for [[England A cricket team|England A]] in their March tour of the [[West Indies]], as well as their matches against the touring [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lankans]] and [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistanis]] in the summer of that year. In July, he was selected in England's 30-man provisional squad for the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 Champions Trophy]].\n\n==International career==\n\n===2007 World Cup===\nIn January 2007 [[Kevin Pietersen]] sustained a rib injury in England's first [[One Day International]] against Australia, keeping him out of the remainder of the series. Bopara was called up as his replacement, and made his ODI debut on 2 February. Later that month, he was named in the England squad for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]],<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/280268.html Bopara wins place ahead of Loye], [[Cricinfo]], 14 February 2007.</ref> and he played his second ODI in England's second match of that tournament. In England's match against [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]], Bopara was named [[man of the match]] for his 52 off 53 balls, which brought England to within three runs of victory from a seemingly hopeless position.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/247489.html Scorecard] from [[Cricinfo]], retrieved 5 April 2007.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6521215.stm Match report] from the [[BBC]], retrieved 5 April 2007.</ref>\nThe partnership for the seventh wicket was an English World Cup record and was the second record partnership made by Bopara in the tournament, following his record fifth wicket partnership with [[Paul Collingwood]] against [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]].<ref>[http://www1.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/STATS/WC/BY_TEAM/ENG/WC_PARTNERSHIP_RECORDS_ENG.html World Cup Partnership Records for England] from [[Cricinfo]], retrieved 5 April 2007.</ref>\n\n===2007 India and Sri Lanka===\nIn the first three games of the limited overs series against India Bopara was ineffectual, not batting in the first game and then making just 27 runs in the next two games combined. On 30 August, in the fourth match of huge series, he featured in a prominent tail end partnership, this time with [[Stuart Broad]] as the pair added an unbeaten 99 for the 8th wicket to defeat India at Old Trafford. Bopara finished 43 not out. He could not continue his good form, making just 11 in the next match.\n\nHe made his [[Test cricket|Test]] debut in the tour to [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in December 2007 but had a poor series, scoring only 42 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in five [[innings]] including three [[duck (cricket)|ducks]], and taking only one [[wicket]] at an [[bowling average|average]] of 81. One [[BBC]] commentator described him as \"well out of his depth at Test level\",<ref>''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tms/2007/12/england_series_rankings_1.shtml England series rankings]'' from the BBC [[Test Match Special]] [[blog]], retrieved 23 December 2007.</ref> and Bopara was subsequently selected in the ODI squad but not the Test squad for the tour to [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] in early 2008.<ref>''[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/current/story/328905.html Prior dropped as Ambrose gets his chance]'' from [[Cricinfo]], retrieved 4 January 2008.</ref> However, he returned to the Test squad for the fourth Test against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] in August 2008, following a good season for Essex in the [[County Championship]].<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7540971.stm Bopara replaces Vaughan in squad]'' from [[BBC Sport]], retrieved 4 August 2008.</ref>\n\nOn 4 June 2008, Bopara recorded his highest List A score in the quarter finals of the Friends Provident Trophy.

There, England took on the [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex Crusaders]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national cricket team|Trinidad and Tobago]] before facing the Stanford All-Stars on 1 November. The winning players in that match would have earned $1million each, with a further $1million being shared between the four players left out of the side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7603859.stm|title=Harmison gets $1m Stanford chance |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-05-06 | date=9 September 2008}}</ref> This never came to fruition, however, as England fell to a heavy defeat in the final.

He made 23 in the next match, but did not bowl in either matches. In the return series in England, Bopara got off to a slow start, making scores of 10 and 27 in his first two matches. However, in the fourth match of the series he made 58 although it wasn't enough to prevent a narrow defeat for England. He made 30 in the final match of the series, leaving him with over 100 runs in the matches he played in.\n\nHe played in the first ODI against South Africa but was not required to bat, instead just bowling two overs and conceding 11 runs. England won the match by 20 runs.\n\nHe made 54 not out in the first ODI against India as he continued to consolidate himself in the ODI side. In the third match he made 60, although England lost the game by 16 runs.

He then took 4\u201339 vs New Zealand in a losing effort after England had already been bowled out for 146, with New Zealand making the runs in just 27.1 overs.

With his first game getting figures of 4\u201371, England suffered defeat by 112 runs. Broad improved on his economy rate in the 4th ODI with figures of 2\u201330 from 9.5 overs.

He took the wicket of [[Mark Boucher]] the next day to leave [[Graeme Swann]] to dismiss the rest of the South African line up. This gave England an innings and 98 run victory. After this test Broad went up to 7th in the ICC Test bowling rankings, the highest in his career.

The ODIs against Bangladesh were less note-worthy \u2013 England won 2\u20131 with Broad taking 4 wickets.\n\nIn the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010|home series against Pakistan]], Broad was involved in a disciplinary incident in the second Test. After Pakistani batsman [[Zulqarnain Haider]] defended a ball bowled by Broad down the pitch, Broad picked the ball up and threw it at Haider, striking him on the hand.

He scored a 22-ball 19 in England's first-innings total of 435, but in 32 overs he took just one wicket (that of [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]], caught behind for 83) as Australia amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions. Nonetheless, his final-day 14 proved crucial, keeping the Australians at bay alongside [[Paul Collingwood]] for a minute over an hour before [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Monty Panesar]] blocked out the final 11\u00bd overs to salvage an unlikely draw.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/345970.html England v Australia at Cardiff, 2009]. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved 3 August 2011.</ref>\n\nThe second Test at [[Lord's]] saw Broad take three wickets, including the important wicket of Australian skipper [[Ricky Ponting]], bowled off an inside-edged cut for 38 as England pursued victory, and took a diving outfield catch to remove the opener [[Simon Katich]] in the first innings, as England took a 1\u20130 lead in the series.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/345971.html England v Australia at Lord's, 2009]. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved 3 August 2011.</ref>\n\nThough he took no wickets in the first innings of the third Test at [[Edgbaston cricket ground|Edgbaston]], Broad hit a 64-ball 55 to extend England's first-innings lead to 114. On the final day, Broad took two of the three wickets to fall: [[Mike Hussey]] for 64 and, late in the day, [[Marcus North]] for 96. Nonetheless, Australia drew the match with ease.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/345972.html England v Australia at Birmingham, 2009]. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved 3 August 2011.</ref>\n\nIn the fourth Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], Broad took his place in an England first-innings collapse, clipping [[Stuart Clark]] to square leg for 3 as Australia's seam attack bowled England out for 102. As Australia scored 445, Broad took six wickets for 91 in Australia's only innings, at that time his best first-class innings return, and in the second innings contributed a rapid 61 from 48 balls, though he could not avert an innings defeat.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/345973.html England v Australia at Leeds, 2009]. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved 3 August 2011.</ref>\n\nEngland therefore started the fifth Test at [[the Oval]] with the series level at 1\u20131, with a victory required to secure the Ashes. He took 5 for 37 in the afternoon session of the second day, taking five of the first seven wickets to fall to take the Australian innings from 73/0 to 111/7 and eventually 160 all out. He also contributed 37 and 29 with the bat, and on the final day took the wicket of [[Shane Watson]] lbw for 40, the second wicket to fall in consecutive overs to start Australia's collapse, winning the Man of the Match award as England won by 197 runs to regain the 'Ashes' 2\u20131.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/345974.html England v Australia at the Oval, 2009].

Though three Australian bowlers took more wickets, Broad was the only bowler from either side to claim two five-wicket innings hauls during the series.<ref>[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=4249;type=series The Ashes, 2009: Most Wickets]. Stats.cricinfo.com. Retrieved 3 August 2011.</ref>\n\n===2009: ICC Champions Trophy===\nThis was a good tournament for Broad. He was the second highest wicket taker overall throughout the tournament with 10 wickets in 3 matches, only behind [[Wayne Parnell]] who took 11 in the same number of matches. In the first match of the tournament against Sri Lanka he took 3\u201349 in a winning effort. He followed it up with a 3\u201367 vs South Africa, putting England through to the semi finals. He then took 4\u201339 vs New Zealand in a losing effort after England had already been bowled out for 146, with New Zealand making the runs in just 27.1 overs. This was his last game in the tournament with Broad picking up an injury that kept him out of the semi finals, which England lost to Australia.\n\n===2009\u201310: South Africa===\nBroad's injuries continued through to the tour of South Africa, keeping him out of the two [[twenty20]] matches, which both ended up being abandoned. The weather affected the 1st One Day International which was probably an advantage for Broad and the England team with Broad being fit for the 3rd ODI, with England winning the second ODI by 7 wickets after Paul Collingwood and [[Jonathan Trott]] had a partnership of 162 with Collingwood getting 105.\n\nWhen Broad returned he instantly made an impact with numerous wickets but turned out to be very expensive. With his first game getting figures of 4\u201371, England suffered defeat by 112 runs. Broad improved on his economy rate in the 4th ODI with figures of 2\u201330 from 9.5 overs. This backed up James Anderson who took 5\u201323. The final game was rained off before a ball was bowled to leave England with a 2\u20131 victory and only the second team to win a one-day series vs South Africa in South Africa.\n\nBroad struggled in the First test in [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] with only taking 1\u201374 in the first innings and 2\u201354 in the second. His batting was unsuccessful, getting only 17 and a duck. The duck was during a dramatic collapse where England went from 205\u20134 to 218\u20139 with [[Graham Onions]] batting out the final over to save the test.\n\nIn the second test Broad showed good form with the ball with 2\u201344 in the first innings but then taking 4\u201343 in the second dismissing [[Jacques Kallis]], [[AB de Villiers]] and [[JP Duminy]] all within 3 overs. He took the wicket of [[Mark Boucher]] the next day to leave [[Graeme Swann]] to dismiss the rest of the South African line up. This gave England an innings and 98 run victory. After this test Broad went up to 7th in the ICC Test bowling rankings, the highest in his career. During this tour he declined to play in the [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] with James Anderson on the grounds he wanted to focus on his Test cricket first, and feared injury in the IPL.\n\n===2010: Bangladesh, T20 World Cup, Australia and Pakistan===\n[[File:Stuart Broad3.JPG|thumbnail|Broad with the Man of the Match award after the Test match against [[Pakistan]] at Lord's in 2010]]\n[[File:Stuart Broad secures his half-century.jpg|thumb|On 27 August 2010 Stuart Broad makes a half century]]\n\nAfter South Africa, England toured [[English cricket team in Bangladesh in 2009\u201310|Bangladesh]], playing three ODIs and two Test matches. Injuries to Anderson, Onions and Sidebottom meant that Broad was the leader of a relatively inexperienced pace attack. However, an injury before the Test series meant that he wasn't fully fit and was outbowled by [[Tim Bresnan]] and debutant [[Steven Finn (cricketer)|Steven Finn]].\n\nEngland then travelled to the West Indies for the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]]. England won the tournament, beating Australia in the final. Broad won the man of the match award against Sri Lanka in the semi-final, and overall took 8 wickets at an average of 17.50.\n\nBack in England, Broad was rested for the [[Bangladeshi cricket team in England in 2010|home series against Bangladesh]] before returning to the side for a [[Australian cricket team in England in 2010|5-match ODI series against Australia]]. England won the first three games to take the series, with Broad named man of the match in the second game after bowling figures of 4\u201344. England lost the last two games, though Broad did achieve another four-wicket haul in the fifth game to finish the series with an average of 19.83. The ODIs against Bangladesh were less note-worthy \u2013 England won 2\u20131 with Broad taking 4 wickets.\n\nIn the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010|home series against Pakistan]], Broad was involved in a disciplinary incident in the second Test. After Pakistani batsman [[Zulqarnain Haider]] defended a ball bowled by Broad down the pitch, Broad picked the ball up and threw it at Haider, striking him on the hand. Broad was fined 50% of his match fee.\n\nIn the final Test of the series, Broad reached his maiden Test century at Lord's. Coming to the crease at 102\u20137, he scored 169 and put on a 332-run partnership with fellow centurion Jonathan Trott; a [[List of Test cricket records#Partnership records|world record for an eight-wicket partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/trott-broad-in-worldrecord-partnership-20100828-13wxa.html|title=Trott, Broad in world-record partnership|first=|last=London|publisher=}}</ref> It was his first century in all forms of cricket since an under-19's match for [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] and saw his name go on the Lord's batting honours board, a feat that his father never achieved. He also surpassed his father's Test best of 162, and they became the first father and son both to score centuries for England in Test match cricket. His efforts both with the bat and with the ball (he also took three wickets during the match and made a direct-hit run out) earned him the man of the match award.\n\n===2010\u201311: Ashes series===\n[[File:Board bowling against Sri Lanka at Lord's, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Broad bowling against [[Sri Lanka]] at Lord's in June 2011]]\n\nBroad had an indifferent [[English cricket team in Australia in 2010-11|tour of Australia]], which was cut short due to injury.

In England's innings he was not needed as Alistair Cook scored 294 to pass 700. Broad took two wickets in the second innings to beat India and for England to become World number 1 in Test Cricket. Broad made a lesser impact in the fourth Test with him taking two wickets in both India's innings and he did not bat due to an early declaration.\n\n===2011\u201312: Pakistan and Sri Lanka===\nIn the first Test against Pakistan Broad took 3\u201384 in the first innings. However, England suffered a ten wicket defeat as the batsmen struggled to acclimatise to sub continent conditions. Broad took 4\u201347 in the next match as well as an unbeaten fifty in England's 1st innings (he'd only score 1 test fifty in 5 years after scoring this 50) but another batting collapse saw England lose the match again (bowled out for 72 chasing 145) to go 2\u20130 down in the three match series.

England were unable to chase down their target and went on to lose the series 3\u20130. England lost their fourth straight match, this time against Sri Lanka as the batsmen continued to struggle. Broad took just two wickets in the match, although he made 33 runs with the bat in the match, and was not out in the second innings.\n\n===2012: West Indies and South Africa===\nBroad started off his summer with his best international innings yet, of 7\u201372, against the West Indies, at [[Lord's]], the first test match of the series, was started with a bang as he was able to get a [[five wicket haul]] at the home of cricket, Lord's, becoming only the 8th player to join an elite club of all-rounders to be on [[Lord's Honours Boards|both honours boards]], after his maiden test century of 169 against Pakistan in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/565271.html|title=Broad achieves honours board double|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHe soon followed this up by taking 4 more wickets in the next innings, missing a possible hat trick however, to get Test best figures of 11 for 165, being the first to take a 10 wicket haul at Lord's since [[Ian Botham]] in 1978.

He was rested for the last Test match against the West Indies along with James Anderson. However the game was heavily disrupted by rain and the game ended as a draw. England won the following One Day series 2\u20130 with the third game being abandoned because of rain. On Broad's 26th birthday, he captained the team to a comfortable victory with Notts teammate Alex Hales scoring 99. He was then named in the squad to play Australia in a five match ODI series. Broad's bowling was overshadowed by Steven Finn who took 11 wickets in four games compared to Broad's 5.\n\nBroad was picked in the first Test against South Africa but failed to take a wicket. He added 16 with the bat in England's first innings of 386. Broad and the England bowlers struggled in South Africa's innings of 637\u20132 with [[Hashim Amla]] scoring a triple century (the first South African to do so) with Jacques Kallis and [[Graeme Smith]] also scoring centuries. In the second innings Broad was out for a duck as England lost by an innings and 12 runs. In the second Test, South Africa scored 419 in the first innings with Broad taking 3\u201396. He then scored 1 run in England's innings of 425. Broad then had a burst of wickets on the last day with the wickets of AB de Villiers and JP Duminy in successive deliveries. He finished with figures of 5\u201369 as England couldn't reach the target and the game ended in a draw. In the following Test, Broad was pushed up the order to number 8 after Tim Bresnan was left out. Broad only managed one wicket in South Africa's first innings of 309. He then added 16 in England's first innings of 315. Broad, who had been down on pace all summer struggled as he took 2\u201376 as South Africa set England 346 to win.

The injury which Broad obtained prevented him from bowling in the second innings, as England went on to lose the game and the series. Broad was declared fit for the fourth test and took 3\u201345 in the Australian first innings, but struggled in the second, bowling 10 wicketless overs for 58 runs.

In the second test against Sri Lanka at Headingley Broad became only the fourth player, and first Englishman to take two test hat-tricks, although he needed to be informed of this by the PA system as he was unaware. England went on to lose the game after James Anderson was dismissed in the penultimate ball of the match, meaning England lost the series 1\u20130.\n\nBroad bowled well on a good batting pitch in the first game of the series against India, taking four wickets in the match. However, in the second game he was accused of bowling badly in the first innings as India won the match to go 1\u20130 up in the series.

With New Zealand chasing a big score to win the match, Broad took 3\u201350 in New Zealand's second innings to help England win by 124 runs and go 1\u20130 up in the series. Broad took 5\u2013109 in New Zealand's first innings of the next Test, although he went at an economy rate of over six an over. He made 46 with the bat to help England level the scores after the first innings.

While Broad only took one wicket in the match, he bowled economically, including bowling eight overs for just eight runs in the second innings. England came to close to forcing a result, but the match ended in a draw.

Included in his six wickets were the prized wickets of AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla. England went on to win the game by seven wickets, with the result giving them an unassailable 2\u20130 series lead.

He played in the fourth ODI, although he returned expensive figures, finishing up with 1\u201355 in seven overs, as England lost the game.
