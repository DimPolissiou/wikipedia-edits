The [[office]] was created in 1994 with the passing of the [[Constitution of Belarus]] by the [[Supreme Soviet]]. This replaced the office of [[Chairman of the Supreme Soviet]] as the head of state. The tasks of the president include executing [[foreign policy|foreign]] and [[domestic policy]], defending the rights and general welfare of citizens and residents, and upholding the Constitution. The president is mandated by the Constitution to serve as a leader in the social affairs of the country and to act as its main representative abroad. The duties, responsibilities and other transitional clauses dealing with the presidency are listed in Chapter Three, Articles 79 through 89, of the Constitution.\n\nThe [[term of office|term]] for the president is five years, but due to a [[1996 Belarusian referendum|1996 referendum]], [[2001 Belarusian presidential election|the election]] that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could only serve for two terms as president, but due to [[2004 Belarusian referendum|a change in the constitution]], term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in [[1994 Belarusian presidential election|1994]], [[2001 Belarusian presidential election|2001]], [[2006 Belarusian presidential election|2006]], [[2010 Belarusian presidential election|2010]] and on [[2015 Belarusian presidential election|11 October 2015]]. [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the only person who has served as president since the elections in 1994.\nThe presidential office is located in the [[Palace of the Republic (Minsk)|Palace of the Republic]] in [[Minsk]], while the presidential residence is located in [[Zaslawye]] (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e\u0435), Minsk District.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{Politics of Belarus}}\n\nBelarus first declared independence in early 1918 as the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]]. Its head of state was the president of a provisional supreme governing body, the [[Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic]]. In 1919, the Soviet [[Red Army]] forced the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic into [[government in exile|exile]] where the Rada still exists, now led by President [[Ivonka Survilla]]. Under Soviet rule, the [[de facto]] leader of the [[Byelorussian SSR]] was the first secretary of the [[Communist Party of Byelorussia]], the only legal party in Soviet Belarus.\n\nThe Republic of Belarus was formed in 1991 shortly after declaring itself independent of the [[Soviet Union]]. From independence until passage of the Constitution in 1994, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state and the [[List of Belarusian Prime Ministers|prime minister]] as the head of government. When the office of the presidency was created, the role of the prime minister was reduced to assisting the president and resulted in the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, along with its chairman, in 1996.<ref name=\"byind\">Country Studies [http://countrystudies.us/belarus/39.htm Belarus - Prelude to Independence].

He is also considered the guardian of the Constitution and the rights and freedoms of those who claim Belarusian citizenship or residency. The president is the personification of unification of the Belarusian state when conducting foreign or internal affairs and shall be the main representative when dealing with other nations or international organizations. The president is also entrusted with the safety, prosperity and stability of the country and acts as an intermediary between the bodies of the national government.<ref name=\"s4\">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html Section 4 of the Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217000000/http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html |date=2007-12-17 }}.

The candidate must also reside within the republic for ten years and he or she must be able to cast a ballot legally. The provisions are set down in Article 80 of the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n===Election===\n[[Elections in Belarus|Elections]] for president occur every five years by a national vote. Candidates, as soon as they are deemed eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the candidate is declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret ballots are collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a [[Two-round system|run-off election]] will occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person who wins the most votes in the run-off is declared the president-elect.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nIn the event the office is vacant, the election to replace the president must occur between thirty and seventy days after the vacancy occurred. During normal election cycles, the elections must occur before the last two months of the current president. In either situation, the government body that calls for elections is the [[House of Representatives of Belarus|House of Representatives]].<ref name=\"s4\"/> The last round of [[presidential elections]] [[2015 Belarusian presidential election|occurred in 2015]].<ref>[http://news.belta.by/en/main_news?id=580390 Belarus sets date of presidential election for 19 December 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706163519/http://news.belta.by/en/main_news?id=580390 |date=6 July 2011 }}</ref> President Lukashenko, when addressing the press in February 2007, stated his health will determine if he will run in 2011 or step down at that time.<ref>MosNews.

Other than the enumerated powers, Number 30 allows the president to use other powers granted to him either from national law or from other sections of the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nPart of the prerogative of the president is the right to call national [[referendum]]s, and to call regular and extraordinary elections to the House of Representatives, the [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] and local representative bodies. He can also dissolve the chambers of the Parliament, as the Constitution permits. It is his duty to appoint the [[List of Belarusian Prime Ministers|prime minister of the Republic of Belarus]] with the consent of the House of Representatives, and to decide the structure of the [[Government of Belarus|Government of the Republic of Belarus]]. The president signs bills, and has the right to return it, fully or in parts, with objections to the House of Representatives. He also appoints\u2013 and can dismiss\u2013 the deputy Prime ministers, the ministers and the other members of the Government, and he decides in cases of resignation of the Government, or any of its members. With the consent of the Council of the Republic, the president appoints the chairperson of the [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme Court]], and can dismiss this chairperson and other judges. The president is supposed to deliver annual messages to the Parliament, and has the right to participate in the sessions of Parliament and its bodies. In instances of strike, the president has the right, in instances specified in the law, to defer or suspend a strike for a period not exceeding three months. In international affairs, it is the president's duty to conduct negotiations and sign international treaties, and to appoint and recall diplomatic representatives of the Republic.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nNot only the president is the head of government, he is the social leader of Belarus. The president delivers messages to the citizens several times a year and can issue decrees to establish red letter days and national holidays. The president is the main authority for the granting of Belarusian citizen and can present [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Belarus|state decorations]] to honored individuals. The president also has the ability to determine the status of asylum seekers and grant [[pardon]]s to convicted citizens.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nAs the supreme [[Commander-in-Chief|commander-in-chief]] of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the president has the duty to protect the Belarusian territory from internal and external forces. The president can call for a [[state of emergency]] in the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the threat of violence. Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] must be notified by the president and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the president issues a state of [[martial law]] in the event of a possible military action against Belarus. The president has to form and head the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus, and can appoint and dismiss the state secretary of the Security Council and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n==Oath of office==\n\nBefore any person can assume the office officially, an [[oath]] must be sworn within two months of the election results being finalized. The text of the oath is as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''Assuming the office of President of the Republic of Belarus, I solemnly swear to faithfully serve the people of the Republic of Belarus, to respect and safeguard the rights and liberties of man and citizen, to abide by and protect the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus, and to discharge strictly and conscientiously the lofty duties that have been bestowed upon me.''}}\n\nDuring the inauguration ceremony, members of both houses of the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]], government ministers, officials and judges from the [[Constitutional Court of Belarus|Constitutional]], [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme]] and [[Economic Court of Belarus|Economic Court]] must be present.

The text of the oath can be found in Article 83 of the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n==Removal==\nArticles 87 through 89 of the Constitution deal with how the presidency can change hands in-between election cycles. The president has the ability to resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the [[House of Representatives of Belarus|House of Representatives]] and is accepted by them. The president has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] on the resolution to remove the president. An [[ad hoc]] committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the president has committed a grave crime, such as [[treason]], one-third of the House must bring charges against the president formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the president from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n==Privileges==\nUnder Article 79 of the Constitution, the president is immune from arrest, with exception to the treason/grave crimes clauses listed in Article 88 in the same document. Also under Article 79, the honor and dignity of the president will be protected by national law.<ref name=\"s4\"/> Information, either printed in the news or reported on [[Television in Belarus|television]], that is considered [[defamation]] against the president is illegal under Article 5 of the Belarusian Law on Press.<ref>Global Campaign of Free Expression [http://www.article19.org/pdfs/analysis/belarus-supreme-economic-court-decision-on-def.pdf Comment on the Decision of the Supreme Economic Court of the Republic of Belarus: Case 1-9/2002 of 13 June 2002].

The [[office]] was created in 1994 with the passing of the [[Constitution of Belarus]] by the [[Supreme Soviet]]. This replaced the office of [[Chairman of the Supreme Soviet]] as the head of state. The tasks of the president include executing [[foreign policy|foreign]] and [[domestic policy]], defending the rights and general welfare of citizens and residents, and upholding the Constitution. The president is mandated by the Constitution to serve as a leader in the social affairs of the country and to act as its main representative abroad. The duties, responsibilities and other transitional clauses dealing with the presidency are listed in Chapter Three, Articles 79 through 89, of the Constitution.\n\nThe [[term of office|term]] for the president is five years, but due to a [[1996 Belarusian referendum|1996 referendum]], [[2001 Belarusian presidential election|the election]] that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could only serve for two terms as president, but due to [[2004 Belarusian referendum|a change in the constitution]], term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in [[1994 Belarusian presidential election|1994]], [[2001 Belarusian presidential election|2001]], [[2006 Belarusian presidential election|2006]], [[2010 Belarusian presidential election|2010]] and on [[2015 Belarusian presidential election|11 October 2015]]. [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the only person who has served as president since the elections in 1994.\nThe presidential office is located in the Republic Palace in [[Minsk]], while the presidential residence is located in [[Zaslawye]] (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e\u0435), Minsk District.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{Politics of Belarus}}\n\nBelarus first declared independence in early 1918 as the [[Belarusian Democratic Republic]]. Its head of state was the president of a provisional supreme governing body, the [[Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic]]. In 1919, the Soviet [[Red Army]] forced the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic into [[government in exile|exile]] where the Rada still exists, now led by President [[Ivonka Survilla]]. Under Soviet rule, the [[de facto]] leader of the [[Byelorussian SSR]] was the first secretary of the [[Communist Party of Byelorussia]], the only legal party in Soviet Belarus.\n\nThe Republic of Belarus was formed in 1991 shortly after declaring itself independent of the [[Soviet Union]]. From independence until passage of the Constitution in 1994, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state and the [[List of Belarusian Prime Ministers|prime minister]] as the head of government. When the office of the presidency was created, the role of the prime minister was reduced to assisting the president and resulted in the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, along with its chairman, in 1996.<ref name=\"byind\">Country Studies [http://countrystudies.us/belarus/39.htm Belarus - Prelude to Independence].

He is also considered the guardian of the Constitution and the rights and freedoms of those who claim Belarusian citizenship or residency. The president is the personification of unification of the Belarusian state when conducting foreign or internal affairs and shall be the main representative when dealing with other nations or international organizations. The president is also entrusted with the safety, prosperity and stability of the country and acts as an intermediary between the bodies of the national government.<ref name=\"s4\">Webportal of the President of the Republic of Belarus [http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html Section 4 of the Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217000000/http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html |date=2007-12-17 }}.

The candidate must also reside within the republic for ten years and he or she must be able to cast a ballot legally. The provisions are set down in Article 80 of the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n===Election===\n[[Elections in Belarus|Elections]] for president occur every five years by a national vote. Candidates, as soon as they are deemed eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the candidate is declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret ballots are collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a [[Two-round system|run-off election]] will occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person who wins the most votes in the run-off is declared the president-elect.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nIn the event the office is vacant, the election to replace the president must occur between thirty and seventy days after the vacancy occurred. During normal election cycles, the elections must occur before the last two months of the current president. In either situation, the government body that calls for elections is the [[House of Representatives of Belarus|House of Representatives]].<ref name=\"s4\"/> The last round of [[presidential elections]] [[2015 Belarusian presidential election|occurred in 2015]].<ref>[http://news.belta.by/en/main_news?id=580390 Belarus sets date of presidential election for 19 December 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706163519/http://news.belta.by/en/main_news?id=580390 |date=6 July 2011 }}</ref> President Lukashenko, when addressing the press in February 2007, stated his health will determine if he will run in 2011 or step down at that time.<ref>MosNews.

Other than the enumerated powers, Number 30 allows the president to use other powers granted to him either from national law or from other sections of the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nPart of the prerogative of the president is the right to call national [[referendum]]s, and to call regular and extraordinary elections to the House of Representatives, the [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] and local representative bodies. He can also dissolve the chambers of the Parliament, as the Constitution permits. It is his duty to appoint the [[List of Belarusian Prime Ministers|prime minister of the Republic of Belarus]] with the consent of the House of Representatives, and to decide the structure of the [[Government of Belarus|Government of the Republic of Belarus]]. The president signs bills, and has the right to return it, fully or in parts, with objections to the House of Representatives. He also appoints\u2013 and can dismiss\u2013 the deputy Prime ministers, the ministers and the other members of the Government, and he decides in cases of resignation of the Government, or any of its members. With the consent of the Council of the Republic, the president appoints the chairperson of the [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme Court]], and can dismiss this chairperson and other judges. The president is supposed to deliver annual messages to the Parliament, and has the right to participate in the sessions of Parliament and its bodies. In instances of strike, the president has the right, in instances specified in the law, to defer or suspend a strike for a period not exceeding three months. In international affairs, it is the president's duty to conduct negotiations and sign international treaties, and to appoint and recall diplomatic representatives of the Republic.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nNot only the president is the head of government, he is the social leader of Belarus. The president delivers messages to the citizens several times a year and can issue decrees to establish red letter days and national holidays. The president is the main authority for the granting of Belarusian citizen and can present [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Belarus|state decorations]] to honored individuals. The president also has the ability to determine the status of asylum seekers and grant [[pardon]]s to convicted citizens.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\nAs the supreme [[Commander-in-Chief|commander-in-chief]] of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the president has the duty to protect the Belarusian territory from internal and external forces. The president can call for a [[state of emergency]] in the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the threat of violence. Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] must be notified by the president and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the president issues a state of [[martial law]] in the event of a possible military action against Belarus. The president has to form and head the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus, and can appoint and dismiss the state secretary of the Security Council and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n==Oath of office==\n\nBefore any person can assume the office officially, an [[oath]] must be sworn within two months of the election results being finalized. The text of the oath is as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''Assuming the office of President of the Republic of Belarus, I solemnly swear to faithfully serve the people of the Republic of Belarus, to respect and safeguard the rights and liberties of man and citizen, to abide by and protect the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus, and to discharge strictly and conscientiously the lofty duties that have been bestowed upon me.''}}\n\nDuring the inauguration ceremony, members of both houses of the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus|National Assembly]], government ministers, officials and judges from the [[Constitutional Court of Belarus|Constitutional]], [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme]] and [[Economic Court of Belarus|Economic Court]] must be present. Upon reading of the oath, any powers held by a previous president will be transferred to the president-elect. The text of the oath can be found in Article 83 of the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n==Removal==\nArticles 87 through 89 of the Constitution deal with how the presidency can change hands in-between election cycles. The president has the ability to resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the [[House of Representatives of Belarus|House of Representatives]] and is accepted by them. The president has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] on the resolution to remove the president. An [[ad hoc]] committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the president has committed a grave crime, such as [[treason]], one-third of the House must bring charges against the president formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the president from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.<ref name=\"s4\"/>\n\n==Privileges==\nUnder Article 79 of the Constitution, the president is immune from arrest, with exception to the treason/grave crimes clauses listed in Article 88 in the same document. Also under Article 79, the honor and dignity of the president will be protected by national law.<ref name=\"s4\"/> Information, either printed in the news or reported on [[Television in Belarus|television]], that is considered [[defamation]] against the president is illegal under Article 5 of the Belarusian Law on Press.<ref>Global Campaign of Free Expression [http://www.article19.org/pdfs/analysis/belarus-supreme-economic-court-decision-on-def.pdf Comment on the Decision of the Supreme Economic Court of the Republic of Belarus: Case 1-9/2002 of 13 June 2002].

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|right|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]] from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet Lavochkin La-11 fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew.\n\nShortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n# On 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\n===Roots===\n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

She earned a Ph.D. in  [[clinical psychology]] but instead chose to work in the field of genetics.\n\nThe daughter of a Huntington's patient, she led a research team into a remote part of Venezuela where the disease is prevalent. She visited the villages of Laguneta, San Luis, and Barranquitas. She obtained samples of [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid) from a large family with a majority of the members having Huntington's disease. The samples her team collected were instrumental in allowing a global collaborative research group to locate the gene that causes the disease. Wexler participated in the successful effort to create a chromosomal test to identify carriers of Huntington's Disease.\n\n==Early life and Education==\nNancy Wexler was born 19 July 1945, in Washington, D.C., and grew up in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. Wexler's father, Dr. [[Milton Wexler]], was a psychoanalyst and clinical psychologist, and her mother was a geneticist who taught biology before her children were born. Both parents taught the girls different areas of science, including the environment, nature, physics, and astronomy. Wexler's grandfather died when her mother, Leonore, was only 15 years old. Leonore looked up [[Huntington's disease]] (HD) at the library and read that it was \u201ca fatal, inherited disease only affecting men.\u201d<ref name=Glimm2005/> Leonore's three brothers, Seymour, Paul, and Jesse Sabin, all suffered from HD and died within four years of each other. The diagnosis was kept a secret from the rest of the family for many years. The uncles were called \"nervous,\" instead of ill. When Leonore started showing symptoms of HD, her then ex-husband, Milton, kept the diagnosis from her for about a year. She still thought that HD only affected men. When they finally told her she had HD, Nancy said, \u201cHer mother did not protest. It seemed as if Leonore, knowing her family history, had perhaps understood the truth all along.\u201d<ref name=Glimm2005/>\n\nWexler thought at an early age she would want to know as much as possible about the disease. Nancy Wexler attended many workshops including her own. She was most impressed by the workshop of George Hunting which was a film showing Huntington disease patients as a part of a community near Lake Maracaibo in comparison to most U.S patients confined to nursing homes.<ref name=\"Shelbourne2007\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Shelbourne | first1 = P.

Her beliefs regarding counseling stem from her own experience regarding presymptomatic testing and also talking with colleagues in other programs.  Being at risk has had a profound effect on most people's lives.  They may have had an ill parent, with whom they may or may not have had contact, and perhaps other relatives who have suffered from HD.  Almost all welcome the opportunity to talk with someone knowledgeable about the experience that they are going through. Wexler states that, \u201cThe genetic test gives people a crystal ball to see the future: will the city be free of bombs from now on or will a bomb crash into their home, killing them and jeopardizing their children?\u201d<ref name=WexlerArchNeurol1985/>\n\n==Tetrabenazine==\nOn December 6, 2007 Prestwick Pharmaceuticals presented information to the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regarding [[tetrabenazine]]. Tetrabenazine was a drug that helped treat [[chorea]], a symptom associated with Huntington's disease.  Wexler posted a note of action to her Hereditary Disease Foundation regarding the safety of this drug.  In her letter, Wexler stated that she would speak in front of the FDA committee regarding her own personal experience with HD and why she believed tetrabenazine could benefit those with HD.  Until this point, there were no approved treatments in the United States for chorea associated with HD.  She urged patients suffering from chorea to speak to the potential for this much needed use of tetrabenazine.  It was with the aid of Nancy Wexler that tetrabenazine was able to be approved by the FDA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hddrugworks.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=208&Itemid=24 |title=It's Unanimous: Advisory Committee Votes to Approve Tetrabenazine |author=Goodman, LaVonne |date=December 6, 2007 |publisher=Huntington's disease Drug Works |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref>\n<ref name=Glimm2005>{{cite book |title=Gene Hunter: The Story of Neuropsychologist Nancy Wexler |last=Glimm |first=Adele |year=2005 |publisher=[[Scholastic Library Publishing]] |isbn=978-0531167786 }}</ref> \n<ref name=\"ha\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huntington-assoc.com/Interview%20with%20Nancy%20Wexler.pdf|title=An Interview with Dr. Nancy Wexler|publisher=International Huntington Alliance|accessdate=2012-07-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008132451/http://www.huntington-assoc.com/Interview%20with%20Nancy%20Wexler.pdf|archivedate=October 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/nancy-wexler-phd Official] webpage at the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.hhmi.org/genetictrail/b100.html |title=Kinships That Hold Clues to Disease |author=Merz, Beverly |publisher=[[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] |accessdate=2012-08-05}}\n* [http://www.makers.com/nancy-wexler Nancy Wexler]  Video produced by ''[[Makers: Women Who Make America]]''\n* NY Times Interview: A Second Interview With Dr. Nancy Wexler, 30 Years Later [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/reader-center/nancy-wexler-interview.html 10 March 2020]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wexler, Nancy}}\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:American geneticists]]\n[[Category:Radcliffe College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan alumni]]\n[[Category:Columbia University faculty]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Hastings Center Fellows]]\n[[Category:Huntington's disease]]\n[[Category:Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n[[Category:Fulbright Scholars]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American geneticist}}\n{{cleanup|date=April 2016|reason=much of the article's content is unencyclopedic or lacks impartiality.}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox scientist\n|name              = Nancy Wexler\n|image             = Nancy Wexler (1) (cropped).jpg\n|image_size        = \n|caption           = Wexler in March 2015\n|birth_date        = {{birth date and age|1945|7|19}}\n|birth_place       = \n|death_date        = \n|death_place       = \n|nationality       = United States\n|fields            = Genetics\n|workplaces        = [[Columbia University]]\n|alma_mater        = [[Radcliffe College]] <br>[[University of Michigan]]\n|known_for         = Contributing to identification of the gene that causes [[Huntington's disease]]\n|awards            = [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Life Science (2007)\n}}\n'''Nancy Wexler''' (b. 19 July 1945)<ref name=\"cv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hdfoundation.org/bios/cvs/NANCY-WEXLER-CV-09-07.pdf|title=Nancy Wexler CV|publisher=[[Hereditary Disease Foundation]]|year=2007|accessdate=2012-07-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617085032/http://www.hdfoundation.org/bios/cvs/NANCY-WEXLER-CV-09-07.pdf|archivedate=June 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]] is an American geneticist and the Higgins Professor of [[Neuropsychology]] in the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry of the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], best known for her involvement in the discovery of the location of the gene that causes [[Huntington's disease]]. She earned a Ph.D. in  [[clinical psychology]] but instead chose to work in the field of genetics.\n\nThe daughter of a Huntington's patient, she led a research team into a remote part of Venezuela where the disease is prevalent. She visited the villages of Laguneta, San Luis, and Barranquitas. She obtained samples of [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid) from a large family with a majority of the members having Huntington's disease. The samples her team collected were instrumental in allowing a global collaborative research group to locate the gene that causes the disease. Wexler participated in the successful effort to create a chromosomal test to identify carriers of Huntington's Disease.\n\n==Early life and Education==\nNancy Wexler was born 19 July 1945, in Washington, D.C., and grew up in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. Wexler's father, Dr. [[Milton Wexler]], was a psychoanalyst and clinical psychologist, and her mother was a geneticist who taught biology before her children were born. Both parents taught the girls different areas of science, including the environment, nature, physics, and astronomy. Wexler's grandfather died when her mother, Leonore, was only 15 years old. Leonore looked up HD at the library and read that it was \u201ca fatal, inherited disease only affecting men.\u201d<ref name=Glimm2005/> Leonore's three brothers, Seymour, Paul, and Jesse Sabin, all suffered from HD and died within four years of each other. The diagnosis was kept a secret from the rest of the family for many years. The uncles were called \"nervous,\" instead of ill. When Leonore started showing symptoms of HD, her then ex-husband, Milton, kept the diagnosis from her for about a year. She still thought that HD only affected men. When they finally told her she had HD, Nancy said, \u201cHer mother did not protest. It seemed as if Leonore, knowing her family history, had perhaps understood the truth all along.\u201d<ref name=Glimm2005/>\n\nWexler thought at an early age she would want to know as much as possible about the disease. Nancy Wexler attended many workshops including her own. She was most impressed by the workshop of George Hunting which was a film showing Huntington disease patients as a part of a community near Lake Maracaibo in comparison to most U.S patients confined to nursing homes.<ref name=\"Shelbourne2007\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Shelbourne | first1 = P.

Her beliefs regarding counseling stem from her own experience regarding presymptomatic testing and also talking with colleagues in other programs.  Being at risk has had a profound effect on most people's lives.  They may have had an ill parent, with whom they may or may not have had contact, and perhaps other relatives who have suffered from HD.  Almost all welcome the opportunity to talk with someone knowledgeable about the experience that they are going through. Wexler states that, \u201cThe genetic test gives people a crystal ball to see the future: will the city be free of bombs from now on or will a bomb crash into their home, killing them and jeopardizing their children?\u201d<ref name=WexlerArchNeurol1985/>\n\n==Tetrabenazine==\nOn December 6, 2007 Prestwick Pharmaceuticals presented information to the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regarding [[tetrabenazine]]. Tetrabenazine was a drug that helped treat [[chorea]], a symptom associated with Huntington's disease.  Wexler posted a note of action to her Hereditary Disease Foundation regarding the safety of this drug.  In her letter, Wexler stated that she would speak in front of the FDA committee regarding her own personal experience with HD and why she believed tetrabenazine could benefit those with HD.  Until this point, there were no approved treatments in the United States for chorea associated with HD.  She urged patients suffering from chorea to speak to the potential for this much needed use of tetrabenazine.  It was with the aid of Nancy Wexler that tetrabenazine was able to be approved by the FDA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hddrugworks.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=208&Itemid=24 |title=It's Unanimous: Advisory Committee Votes to Approve Tetrabenazine |author=Goodman, LaVonne |date=December 6, 2007 |publisher=Huntington's disease Drug Works |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref>\n<ref name=Glimm2005>{{cite book |title=Gene Hunter: The Story of Neuropsychologist Nancy Wexler |last=Glimm |first=Adele |year=2005 |publisher=[[Scholastic Library Publishing]] |isbn=978-0531167786 }}</ref> \n<ref name=\"ha\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huntington-assoc.com/Interview%20with%20Nancy%20Wexler.pdf|title=An Interview with Dr. Nancy Wexler|publisher=International Huntington Alliance|accessdate=2012-07-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008132451/http://www.huntington-assoc.com/Interview%20with%20Nancy%20Wexler.pdf|archivedate=October 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/nancy-wexler-phd Official] webpage at the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.hhmi.org/genetictrail/b100.html |title=Kinships That Hold Clues to Disease |author=Merz, Beverly |publisher=[[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] |accessdate=2012-08-05}}\n* [http://www.makers.com/nancy-wexler Nancy Wexler]  Video produced by ''[[Makers: Women Who Make America]]''\n* NY Times Interview: A Second Interview With Dr. Nancy Wexler, 30 Years Later [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/reader-center/nancy-wexler-interview.html 10 March 2020]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wexler, Nancy}}\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:American geneticists]]\n[[Category:Radcliffe College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan alumni]]\n[[Category:Columbia University faculty]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Hastings Center Fellows]]\n[[Category:Huntington's disease]]\n[[Category:Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n[[Category:Fulbright Scholars]]\n", "name_user": "David Fuchs", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly life and Education:I'm not sure about abbreviating Huntingtons throughout, but at the very least it should be introduced first", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wexler"}

Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]], Arab versus [[Kurds|Kurd]], tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 78\">Humphreys, 78</ref> The desire for stable rule in a country rife with [[Political faction|factionalism]] led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 78\" />\n\nSaddam actively fostered the modernization of the Iraqi economy along with the creation of a strong security apparatus to prevent coups within the power structure and insurrections apart from it. Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs.\n\nAt the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector.

Saddam established and controlled the \"National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy\" and the campaign for \"Compulsory Free Education in Iraq,\" and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news2/indepth/words/saddam_hussein.html Saddam Hussein], CBC News, 29 December 2006</ref><ref>Jessica Moore, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030625145156/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html The Iraq War player profile: Saddam Hussein's Rise to Power], PBS Online Newshour {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115205745/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html |date=15 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWith the help of increasing oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based [[economy of Iraq|Iraqi economy]]. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to tens of billions of dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion.\n\nThe oil revenue benefited Saddam politically.<ref name=\"economist2007\">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8492668 | title=Saddam Hussein&nbsp;\u2013 The blundering dictator |date=4 January 2007 |work=[[The Economist]]}}</ref> According to ''[[The Economist]]'', \"Much as Adolf Hitler won early praise for galvanising German industry, ending mass unemployment and building autobahns, Saddam earned admiration abroad for his deeds.

Saddam's self-aggrandising propaganda, with himself posing as the defender of Arabism against Jewish or [[Iran|Persian]] intruders, was heavy-handed, but consistent as a drumbeat.

As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally. He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations. He was the ''de facto'' leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979. He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party. Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\nIn 1979, al-Bakr started to make treaties with Syria, also under Ba'athist leadership, that would lead to unification between the two countries. Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]] would become deputy leader in a union, and this would drive Saddam to obscurity. Saddam acted to secure his grip on power. He forced the ailing al-Bakr to resign on 16 July 1979, and formally assumed the presidency.\n\n====1979 Ba'ath Party Purge====\n{{main|1979 Ba'ath Party Purge}}\nSaddam convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979.

After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty. The 68 people arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of [[treason]]. 22 were sentenced to execution.

The Ba'ath Party, secular by nature, adopted Pan-Arab ideologies which in turn were problematic for significant parts of the population. Following the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Iraq faced the prospect of r\u00e9gime change from two Shi'ite factions ([[Islamic Dawa Party|Dawa]] and [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq|SCIRI]]) which aspired to model Iraq on its neighbour Iran as a Shia theocracy. A separate threat to Iraq came from parts of the ethnic Kurdish population of [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]] which opposed being part of an Iraqi state and favoured independence (an ongoing ideology which had preceded Ba'ath Party rule). To alleviate the threat of revolution, Saddam afforded certain benefits to the potentially hostile population. Membership in the Ba'ath Party remained open to all Iraqi citizens regardless of background. However, repressive measures were taken against its opponents.<ref name=\"Iraq: A Country Study\">Helen Chapin Metz (ed) ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/iqtoc.html Iraq: A Country Study:]'' \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+iq0115) Internal Security in the 1980s\"], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], 1988</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = \"There is a feeling that at least three million Iraqis are watching the eleven million others.\"|source=\u2014\"A European diplomat\", quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 3, 1984.<ref name=\"Makiya 62-65\">{{cite book|authorlink=Kanan Makiya|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, Updated Edition|url=https://archive.org/details/republicoffearpo00maki|url-access=registration|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=9780520921245|pp=[https://archive.org/details/republicoffearpo00maki/page/62 62]\u201365}}</ref>|width=30em|align=left}}\n\nThe major instruments for accomplishing this control were the paramilitary and police organizations. Beginning in 1974, [[Taha Yassin Ramadan]] (himself a Kurdish Ba'athist), a close associate of Saddam, commanded the [[Popular Army (Iraq)|People's Army]], which had responsibility for internal security. As the Ba'ath Party's paramilitary, the People's Army acted as a counterweight against any coup attempts by the regular armed forces. In addition to the People's Army, the Department of General Intelligence was the most notorious arm of the state-security system, feared for its use of [[torture]] and assassination. [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], Saddam's younger [[Sibling|half-brother]], commanded Mukhabarat. Foreign observers believed that from 1982 this department operated both at home and abroad in its mission to seek out and eliminate Saddam's perceived opponents.<ref name=\"Iraq: A Country Study\" />\n\nSaddam was notable for using terror against his own people.

He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as on Iraqi currency. Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the [[Bedouin]], the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even [[Kurdish clothing]], but also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader.

Relations between Iraq and Egypt violently ruptured in 1977, when the two nations broke relations with each other following Iraq's criticism of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s peace initiatives with [[Israel]]. In 1978, Baghdad hosted an [[Arab League]] summit that condemned and ostracized Egypt for accepting the [[Camp David Accords]]. However, Egypt's strong material and diplomatic support for Iraq in the war with Iran led to warmer relations and numerous contacts between senior officials, despite the continued absence of ambassadorial-level representation. Since 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt's \"natural role\" among Arab countries.\n\n[[File:Arab Summit 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|left|Saddam Hussein and [[Hafez al-Assad]] of Syria at an [[Arab League Summit|Arab Summit]] in Baghdad in November 1978]]\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated [[Rolex]] wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world.

In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq.

The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas\u2014hostile to his secular rule\u2014were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population.\n\nThere had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s. Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of [[An Najaf]]. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated. However, when Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. However this turned out to be an imminent failure and a political catalyst, for Khomeini had access to more media connections and also collaborated with a much larger Iranian community under his support which he used to his advantage.\n\nAfter Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway, which divides the two countries. During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations. However, in a private meeting with Salah Omar al-Ali, Iraq's permanent ambassador to [[United Nations|the United Nations]], he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months. Later (probably to appeal for support from the United States and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well.<ref name=\"PIRRR\">Esposito, John, \"Political Islam Revolution, Radicalism, or Reform\", ''Political Islam and Gulf Security'', Lynne Rienner Publishers, {{ISBN|1-55587-262-X}}, pp. 56\u201358</ref>\n\n[[File:Shakinghands high.OGG|thumb|left|thumbtime=05| Middle East special envoy [[Donald Rumsfeld]] meeting Saddam Hussein on 19\u201320 December 1983.

With the support of the Arab states, the United States, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Saddam Hussein had become \"the defender of the Arab world\" against a revolutionary Iran. The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] claimed that [[Leonid Brezhnev]] refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists. Consequently, many viewed Iraq as \"an agent of the civilized world.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" /> The blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored.

Iraq successfully gained some military and financial aid, as well as diplomatic and moral support, from the Soviet Union, China, France, and the United States, which together feared the prospects of the expansion of revolutionary Iran's influence in the region. The Iranians, demanding that the international community should force Iraq to pay war reparations to Iran, refused any suggestions for a cease-fire. Despite several [[United Nations Security Council Resolutions concerning Iraq|calls for a ceasefire]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], hostilities continued until 20 August 1988.\n\nOn 16 March 1988, the Kurdish town of [[Halabja]] was attacked with a mix of [[mustard gas]] and [[nerve agent]]s, killing 5,000 civilians, and maiming, disfiguring, or seriously debilitating 10,000 more.

There were hundreds of thousands of casualties with estimates of up to one million dead. Neither side had achieved what they had originally desired and the borders were left nearly unchanged. The southern, oil rich and prosperous Khuzestan and Basra area (the main focus of the war, and the primary source of their economies) were almost completely destroyed and were left at the pre-1979 border, while Iran managed to make some small gains on its borders in the Northern Kurdish area. Both economies, previously healthy and expanding, were left in ruins.\n\nSaddam borrowed tens of billions of dollars from other Arab states and a few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shi'a radicalism. However, this had proven to completely backfire both on Iraq and on the part of the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shi'a population. Faced with rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and internal resistance, Saddam desperately re-sought cash, this time for postwar reconstruction.\n\n===Al-Anfal Campaign===\n{{Main|Al-Anfal Campaign}}\n\nThe Al-Anfal Campaign was a genocidal campaign<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2006/08/14/genocide-iraq-anfal-campaign-against-kurds] The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds.

This campaign also targeted [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] and [[Yazidi]]s, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkoman people]] and [[Mandeans]] and many villages belonging to these ethnic groups were also destroyed.

Saddam urged the Kuwaitis to waive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30&nbsp;billion, but they refused.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\">Humphreys, 105</ref>\n\nSaddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however. In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in [[OPEC]] to the cuts that Saddam had requested. Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt.\n\nSaddam had always argued that Kuwait was historically an integral part of Iraq, and that Kuwait had only come into being through the maneuverings of British imperialism; this echoed a belief that Iraqi nationalists had voiced for the past 50 years. This belief was one of the few articles of faith uniting the political scene in a nation rife with sharp social, ethnic, religious, and ideological divides.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\" />\n\nThe extent of Kuwaiti oil reserves also intensified tensions in the region. The oil reserves of Kuwait (with a population of 2&nbsp;million next to Iraq's 25) were roughly equal to those of Iraq. Taken together, Iraq and Kuwait sat on top of some 20 percent of the world's known oil reserves; as an article of comparison, [[Saudi Arabia]] holds 25 percent.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\"/>\n\nSaddam complained to the [[U.S. State Department]] that Kuwait had slant drilled oil out of wells that Iraq considered to be within its disputed border with Kuwait. Saddam still had an experienced and well-equipped army, which he used to influence regional affairs. He later ordered troops to the Iraq\u2013Kuwait border.\n\n[[File:April Glaspie, Sadoun al-Zubaydi and Saddam Hussein.jpg|thumb|[[United States Ambassador to Iraq|U.S. Ambassador to Iraq]] [[April Glaspie]] meets Saddam for an emergency meeting]]As Iraq-Kuwait relations rapidly deteriorated, Saddam was receiving conflicting information about how the U.S. would respond to the prospects of an invasion.

It can only mean prejudice against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights.

Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends.

On 4 August an Iraqi-backed \"[[Republic of Kuwait|Provisional Government of Free Kuwait]]\" was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a \"merger\" of the two countries. On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th [[Governorates of Iraq|Governorate]] of Iraq. Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, \"Saddam Hussein did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent.\" Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he \"overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nWhen later asked why he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed that it was because Kuwait was rightfully Iraq's 19th province and then said \"When I get something into my head I act. That's just the way I am.\"<ref name=\"economist2007\" /> After Saddam's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, a UN coalition led by the United States drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait in February 1991. The ability for Saddam Hussein to pursue such military aggression was from a \"military machine paid for in large part by the tens of billions of dollars Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nShortly before he invaded Kuwait, he shipped 100 new [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan. Two days before the first attacks, Saddam reportedly offered Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] 50&nbsp;million dollars in cash, \"ostensibly for grain.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/605fgcob.asp |title=Saddam's Cash |date=5 May 2003 |work=The Weekly Standard |author=Stephen F.

On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets.<ref>Walter LaFeber, ''Russia, America, and the Cold War'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 358.</ref> On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region.<ref>For a statement asserting the overriding importance of oil to U.S. national security and the U.S. economy, see, e.g., the declassified document, \"Responding to Iraqi Aggression in the Gulf,\" The White House, National Security Directive (NSD 54), top secret, 15 January 1991.

Britain profited heavily from billions of dollars of Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who happened to be in the U.S. at the time.<ref>See Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (1979\u20131990), 817.</ref>\n\nCooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union made possible the passage of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving the use of force if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. U.S. officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait. Accordingly, the U.S. and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and [[Czechoslovakia]], deployed a massive number of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.\n\nSaddam's officers looted Kuwait, stripping even the marble from its palaces to move it to Saddam's own palace.<ref name=\"economist2004\" />\n\nDuring the period of negotiations and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.\n\nSaddam ignored the Security Council deadline. Backed by the Security Council, a U.S.-led coalition launched round-the-clock missile and aerial attacks on Iraq, beginning 16 January 1991. Israel, though subjected to attack by Iraqi missiles, refrained from retaliating in order not to provoke Arab states into leaving the coalition. A ground force consisting largely of U.S. and British armoured and infantry divisions ejected Saddam's army from Kuwait in February 1991 and occupied the southern portion of Iraq as far as the [[Euphrates]].<ref>http://milmag.com/2011/02/battle-at-rumaila/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 9 January 2017</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1991, Bush announced \"What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea\u2014a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law.\"<ref>http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=19253 Retrieved 9 January 2017</ref>\n\nIn the end, the out-numbered and under-equipped Iraqi army proved unable to compete on the battlefield with the highly mobile coalition land forces and their overpowering air support. Some 175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and casualties were estimated at over 85,000. As part of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq agreed to scrap all poison gas and [[biological warfare|germ weapons]] and allow UN observers to inspect the sites. UN trade sanctions would remain in effect until Iraq complied with all terms. Saddam publicly claimed victory at the end of the war.\n\n==Post-Gulf war period==\n{{Main|1991 uprisings in Iraq}}\n[[File:Iraq, Saddam Hussein (222).jpg|thumb|Saddam addresses state television, in January 2001]]\nIraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions. In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government. Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed. [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|Uprisings in 1991]] led to the death of 100,000\u2013180,000 people, mostly civilians.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Solomon |title=2 Mass Graves in Iraq Unearthed |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/05/world/fg-graves5 |accessdate=23 September 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe United States, which had urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the widespread Shi'ite rebellions, had no interest in provoking another war, while [[Turkey]] opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nSaddam routinely cited his survival as \"proof\" that Iraq had in fact won the war against the U.S. This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world. John Esposito, however, claims that \"Arabs and Muslims were pulled in two directions. That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice.\" As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] feelings.<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nAs one U.S. Muslim observer noted: \"People forgot about Saddam's record and concentrated on America&nbsp;... Saddam Hussein might be wrong, but it is not America who should correct him.\" A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period \"from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nSaddam, therefore, increasingly portrayed himself as a devout Muslim, in an effort to co-opt the conservative religious segments of society. Some elements of [[Sharia]] law were re-introduced, and the ritual phrase \"[[Allahu Akbar]]\" (\"God is great\"), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the national flag. Saddam also commissioned the production of a \"[[Blood Qur'an]],\" written using 27 litres of his own blood, to thank God for saving him from various dangers and conspiracies.<ref name=\"BBC-2000\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/941490.stm \"Iraqi leader's Koran 'written in blood'\"].

U.S. officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf War's cease fire, by developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] and other banned weaponry, and violating the UN-imposed sanctions. Also during the 1990s, President [[Bill Clinton]] maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the \"Iraqi no-fly zones\" ([[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]]), in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq. Western charges of Iraqi resistance to UN access to suspected weapons were the pretext for crises between 1997 and 1998, culminating in intensive U.S. and British missile strikes on Iraq, 16\u201319 December 1998.

Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]], Arab versus [[Kurds|Kurd]], tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 78\">Humphreys, 78</ref> The desire for stable rule in a country rife with [[Political faction|factionalism]] led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 78\" />\n\nSaddam actively fostered the modernization of the Iraqi economy along with the creation of a strong security apparatus to prevent coups within the power structure and insurrections apart from it. Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs.\n\nAt the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the [[1973 energy crisis]], and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda.\n\n[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1988.jpg|thumb|left|Saddam talking to [[Michel Aflaq]], the founder of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]], in 1988]]\nWithin just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the \"National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy\" and the campaign for \"Compulsory Free Education in Iraq,\" and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program.

As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally. He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations. He was the ''de facto'' leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979. He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party. Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\nIn 1979, al-Bakr started to make treaties with Syria, also under Ba'athist leadership, that would lead to unification between the two countries. Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]] would become deputy leader in a union, and this would drive Saddam to obscurity. Saddam acted to secure his grip on power. He forced the ailing al-Bakr to resign on 16 July 1979, and formally assumed the presidency.\n\n====1979 Ba'ath Party Purge====\n{{main|1979 Ba'ath Party Purge}}\nSaddam convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979.

After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty. The 68 people arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of [[treason]]. 22 were sentenced to execution.

The Ba'ath Party, secular by nature, adopted Pan-Arab ideologies which in turn were problematic for significant parts of the population. Following the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Iraq faced the prospect of r\u00e9gime change from two Shi'ite factions ([[Islamic Dawa Party|Dawa]] and [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq|SCIRI]]) which aspired to model Iraq on its neighbour Iran as a Shia theocracy. A separate threat to Iraq came from parts of the ethnic Kurdish population of [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]] which opposed being part of an Iraqi state and favoured independence (an ongoing ideology which had preceded Ba'ath Party rule). To alleviate the threat of revolution, Saddam afforded certain benefits to the potentially hostile population. Membership in the Ba'ath Party remained open to all Iraqi citizens regardless of background. However, repressive measures were taken against its opponents.<ref name=\"Iraq: A Country Study\">Helen Chapin Metz (ed) ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/iqtoc.html Iraq: A Country Study:]'' \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+iq0115) Internal Security in the 1980s\"], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], 1988</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = \"There is a feeling that at least three million Iraqis are watching the eleven million others.\"|source=\u2014\"A European diplomat\", quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 3, 1984.<ref name=\"Makiya 62-65\">{{cite book|authorlink=Kanan Makiya|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, Updated Edition|url=https://archive.org/details/republicoffearpo00maki|url-access=registration|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=9780520921245|pp=[https://archive.org/details/republicoffearpo00maki/page/62 62]\u201365}}</ref>|width=30em|align=left}}\n\nThe major instruments for accomplishing this control were the paramilitary and police organizations. Beginning in 1974, [[Taha Yassin Ramadan]] (himself a Kurdish Ba'athist), a close associate of Saddam, commanded the [[Popular Army (Iraq)|People's Army]], which had responsibility for internal security. As the Ba'ath Party's paramilitary, the People's Army acted as a counterweight against any coup attempts by the regular armed forces. In addition to the People's Army, the Department of General Intelligence was the most notorious arm of the state-security system, feared for its use of [[torture]] and assassination. [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], Saddam's younger [[Sibling|half-brother]], commanded Mukhabarat. Foreign observers believed that from 1982 this department operated both at home and abroad in its mission to seek out and eliminate Saddam's perceived opponents.<ref name=\"Iraq: A Country Study\" />\n\nSaddam was notable for using terror against his own people.

He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as on Iraqi currency. Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the [[Bedouin]], the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even [[Kurdish clothing]], but also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing full headdress and robe, praying toward [[Mecca]].\n\nHe also conducted two [[show election]]s, in 1995 and 2002.

Relations between Iraq and Egypt violently ruptured in 1977, when the two nations broke relations with each other following Iraq's criticism of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s peace initiatives with [[Israel]]. In 1978, Baghdad hosted an [[Arab League]] summit that condemned and ostracized Egypt for accepting the [[Camp David Accords]]. However, Egypt's strong material and diplomatic support for Iraq in the war with Iran led to warmer relations and numerous contacts between senior officials, despite the continued absence of ambassadorial-level representation. Since 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt's \"natural role\" among Arab countries.\n\n[[File:Arab Summit 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|left|Saddam Hussein and [[Hafez al-Assad]] of Syria at an [[Arab League Summit|Arab Summit]] in Baghdad in November 1978]]\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated [[Rolex]] wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world.

In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq. Saddam led Arab opposition to the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel (1979).\n\nSaddam initiated Iraq's nuclear enrichment project in the 1980s, with French assistance.

The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas\u2014hostile to his secular rule\u2014were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population.\n\nThere had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s. Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of [[An Najaf]]. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated. However, when Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. However this turned out to be an imminent failure and a political catalyst, for Khomeini had access to more media connections and also collaborated with a much larger Iranian community under his support which he used to his advantage.\n\nAfter Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway, which divides the two countries. During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations. However, in a private meeting with Salah Omar al-Ali, Iraq's permanent ambassador to [[United Nations|the United Nations]], he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months. Later (probably to appeal for support from the United States and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well.<ref name=\"PIRRR\">Esposito, John, \"Political Islam Revolution, Radicalism, or Reform\", ''Political Islam and Gulf Security'', Lynne Rienner Publishers, {{ISBN|1-55587-262-X}}, pp. 56\u201358</ref>\n\n[[File:Shakinghands high.OGG|thumb|left|thumbtime=05| Middle East special envoy [[Donald Rumsfeld]] meeting Saddam Hussein on 19\u201320 December 1983.

With the support of the Arab states, the United States, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Saddam Hussein had become \"the defender of the Arab world\" against a revolutionary Iran. The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] claimed that [[Leonid Brezhnev]] refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists. Consequently, many viewed Iraq as \"an agent of the civilized world.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" /> The blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored.

Health Minister Dr. Riyadh Ibrahim suggested that Saddam temporarily step down to promote peace negotiations. Initially, Saddam Hussein appeared to take in this opinion as part of his cabinet democracy. A few weeks later, Dr. Ibrahim was sacked when held responsible for a fatal incident in an Iraqi hospital where a patient died from intravenous administration of the wrong concentration of potassium supplement.\n\nDr. Ibrahim was arrested a few days after he started his new life as a sacked minister.

The southern, oil rich and prosperous Khuzestan and Basra area (the main focus of the war, and the primary source of their economies) were almost completely destroyed and were left at the pre-1979 border, while Iran managed to make some small gains on its borders in the Northern Kurdish area. Both economies, previously healthy and expanding, were left in ruins.\n\nSaddam borrowed tens of billions of dollars from other Arab states and a few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shi'a radicalism. However, this had proven to completely backfire both on Iraq and on the part of the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shi'a population. Faced with rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and internal resistance, Saddam desperately re-sought cash, this time for postwar reconstruction.\n\n===Al-Anfal Campaign===\n{{Main|Al-Anfal Campaign}}\n\nThe Al-Anfal Campaign was a genocidal campaign<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2006/08/14/genocide-iraq-anfal-campaign-against-kurds] The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds. A Middle East Watch Report: Human Rights Watch 1993.</ref> against the Kurdish people (and many others) in Kurdish regions of Iraq led by the government of Saddam Hussein and headed by [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]]. The campaign takes its name from [[Sura]]t [[al-Anfal]] in the [[Qur'an]], which was used as a [[code name]] by the former Iraqi [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'athist]] administration for a series of attacks against the ''peshmerga'' rebels and the mostly Kurdish civilian population of rural Northern Iraq, conducted between 1986 and 1989 culminating in 1988. This campaign also targeted [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] and [[Yazidi]]s, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkoman people]] and [[Mandeans]] and many villages belonging to these ethnic groups were also destroyed. Human Rights Watch estimates that between 50,000 and 100,000 people were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/ |title=Iraqi Anfal, Human Rights Watch, 1993 |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> Some Kurdish sources put the number higher, estimating that 182,000 Kurds were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/actual/iraq/4.html |title=Ethnic Cleansing and the Kurds |publisher=Jafi.org.il |date=15 May 2005 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202235943/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/actual/iraq/4.html |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Tensions with Kuwait===\nThe end of the war with Iran served to deepen latent tensions between Iraq and its wealthy neighbor Kuwait. Saddam urged the Kuwaitis to waive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30&nbsp;billion, but they refused.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\">Humphreys, 105</ref>\n\nSaddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however. In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in [[OPEC]] to the cuts that Saddam had requested. Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt.\n\nSaddam had always argued that Kuwait was historically an integral part of Iraq, and that Kuwait had only come into being through the maneuverings of British imperialism; this echoed a belief that Iraqi nationalists had voiced for the past 50 years. This belief was one of the few articles of faith uniting the political scene in a nation rife with sharp social, ethnic, religious, and ideological divides.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\" />\n\nThe extent of Kuwaiti oil reserves also intensified tensions in the region. The oil reserves of Kuwait (with a population of 2 million next to Iraq's 25) were roughly equal to those of Iraq. Taken together, Iraq and Kuwait sat on top of some 20 percent of the world's known oil reserves; as an article of comparison, [[Saudi Arabia]] holds 25 percent.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\"/>\n\nSaddam complained to the [[U.S. State Department]] that Kuwait had slant drilled oil out of wells that Iraq considered to be within its disputed border with Kuwait. Saddam still had an experienced and well-equipped army, which he used to influence regional affairs. He later ordered troops to the Iraq\u2013Kuwait border.\n\n[[File:April Glaspie, Sadoun al-Zubaydi and Saddam Hussein.jpg|thumb|[[United States Ambassador to Iraq|U.S. Ambassador to Iraq]] [[April Glaspie]] meets Saddam for an emergency meeting]]As Iraq-Kuwait relations rapidly deteriorated, Saddam was receiving conflicting information about how the U.S. would respond to the prospects of an invasion.

It can only mean prejudice against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We know that you can harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends.

On 4 August an Iraqi-backed \"[[Republic of Kuwait|Provisional Government of Free Kuwait]]\" was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a \"merger\" of the two countries. On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th [[Governorates of Iraq|Governorate]] of Iraq. Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, \"Saddam Hussein did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent.\" Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he \"overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nWhen later asked why he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed that it was because Kuwait was rightfully Iraq's 19th province and then said \"When I get something into my head I act. That's just the way I am.\"<ref name=\"economist2007\" /> After Saddam's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, a UN coalition led by the United States drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait in February 1991. The ability for Saddam Hussein to pursue such military aggression was from a \"military machine paid for in large part by the tens of billions of dollars Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nShortly before he invaded Kuwait, he shipped 100 new [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan. Two days before the first attacks, Saddam reportedly offered Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] 50 million dollars in cash, \"ostensibly for grain.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/605fgcob.asp |title=Saddam's Cash |date=5 May 2003 |work=The Weekly Standard |author=Stephen F. Hayes}}</ref>\n\nU.S. President George H. W. Bush responded cautiously for the first several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets.<ref>Walter LaFeber, ''Russia, America, and the Cold War'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 358.</ref> On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region.<ref>For a statement asserting the overriding importance of oil to U.S. national security and the U.S. economy, see, e.g., the declassified document, \"Responding to Iraqi Aggression in the Gulf,\" The White House, National Security Directive (NSD 54), top secret, 15 January 1991.

Britain profited heavily from billions of dollars of Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who happened to be in the U.S. at the time.<ref>See Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (1979\u20131990), 817.</ref>\n\nCooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union made possible the passage of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving the use of force if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. U.S. officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait. Accordingly, the U.S. and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and [[Czechoslovakia]], deployed a massive number of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.\n\nSaddam's officers looted Kuwait, stripping even the marble from its palaces to move it to Saddam's own palace.<ref name=\"economist2004\" />\n\nDuring the period of negotiations and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.\n\nSaddam ignored the Security Council deadline. Backed by the Security Council, a U.S.-led coalition launched round-the-clock missile and aerial attacks on Iraq, beginning 16 January 1991. Israel, though subjected to attack by Iraqi missiles, refrained from retaliating in order not to provoke Arab states into leaving the coalition. A ground force consisting largely of U.S. and British armoured and infantry divisions ejected Saddam's army from Kuwait in February 1991 and occupied the southern portion of Iraq as far as the [[Euphrates]].<ref>http://milmag.com/2011/02/battle-at-rumaila/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 9 January 2017</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1991, Bush announced \"What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea\u2014a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law.\"<ref>http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=19253 Retrieved 9 January 2017</ref>\n\nIn the end, the out-numbered and under-equipped Iraqi army proved unable to compete on the battlefield with the highly mobile coalition land forces and their overpowering air support. Some 175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and casualties were estimated at over 85,000. As part of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq agreed to scrap all poison gas and [[biological warfare|germ weapons]] and allow UN observers to inspect the sites. UN trade sanctions would remain in effect until Iraq complied with all terms. Saddam publicly claimed victory at the end of the war.\n\n==Post-Gulf war period==\n{{Main|1991 uprisings in Iraq}}\n[[File:Iraq, Saddam Hussein (222).jpg|thumb|Saddam addresses state television, in January 2001]]\nIraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions. In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government. Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed. [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|Uprisings in 1991]] led to the death of 100,000\u2013180,000 people, mostly civilians.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Solomon |title=2 Mass Graves in Iraq Unearthed |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/05/world/fg-graves5 |accessdate=23 September 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe United States, which had urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the widespread Shi'ite rebellions, had no interest in provoking another war, while [[Turkey]] opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nSaddam routinely cited his survival as \"proof\" that Iraq had in fact won the war against the U.S. This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world. John Esposito, however, claims that \"Arabs and Muslims were pulled in two directions. That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice.\" As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] feelings.<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nAs one U.S. Muslim observer noted: \"People forgot about Saddam's record and concentrated on America&nbsp;... Saddam Hussein might be wrong, but it is not America who should correct him.\" A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period \"from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nSaddam, therefore, increasingly portrayed himself as a devout Muslim, in an effort to co-opt the conservative religious segments of society. Some elements of [[Sharia]] law were re-introduced, and the ritual phrase \"[[Allahu Akbar]]\" (\"God is great\"), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the national flag. Saddam also commissioned the production of a \"[[Blood Qur'an]],\" written using 27 litres of his own blood, to thank God for saving him from various dangers and conspiracies.<ref name=\"BBC-2000\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/941490.stm \"Iraqi leader's Koran 'written in blood'\"].

U.S. officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf War's cease fire, by developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] and other banned weaponry, and violating the UN-imposed sanctions. Also during the 1990s, President [[Bill Clinton]] maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the \"Iraqi no-fly zones\" ([[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]]), in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq. Western charges of Iraqi resistance to UN access to suspected weapons were the pretext for crises between 1997 and 1998, culminating in intensive U.S. and British missile strikes on Iraq, 16\u201319 December 1998.
