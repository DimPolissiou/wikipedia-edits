In 2015, it was the [[Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic|fourth busiest airport]] in the United Kingdom after [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]]. Stansted's runway is also used by private companies such as the [[Harrods Aviation]], [[Titan Airways]] and XJet terminals which are private ground handlers who are able to handle private flights, charter flights and state visits.\n\nOriginally owned and operated by [[Heathrow Airport Holdings|BAA]], since February 2013 the airport has been owned [[Manchester Airports Group]] (MAG) following a March 2009 ruling by the Competition Commission.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stansted Airport being sold to Manchester for \u00a31.5bn |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21093783 |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u00a31.5&nbsp;billion Stansted Airport sale complete |author=Sinead Holland |url=http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/News/Harlow-news/15-billion-Stansted-Airport-sale-complete-20130228174702.htm |newspaper=Harlow Star |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nLondon Stansted Airport has one main passenger terminal, near the village of [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]. There are three passenger satellites in which the departure gates are situated; one is connected to the main terminal by an air-bridge and the other two by the [[Stansted Airport Transit System]] people mover.\n\nThe terminal building was designed by [[Foster and Partners|Foster Associates]] with input from the structural engineer [[Peter Rice]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-genius-expressed-in-nuts-and-bolts-peter-rice-is-an-engineer-revered-by-the-worlds-top-1530478.html|title=Architecture: Genius expressed in nuts and bolts: Peter Rice is an|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>  and features a \"floating\" roof, supported by a [[space frame]] of inverted-pyramid roof trusses, creating the impression of a stylised swan in flight. The base of each truss structure is a \"utility pillar\", which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, go through security and on to the departure gates all on the same level.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Stansted saw rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24&nbsp;million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years to 2012. Passenger totals later increased, and in 2016 recorded an annual increase of 8.0% to 24.3&nbsp;million and numbers have since continued to rise.<ref name=\"stats\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Before Stansted Airport aa.jpg|thumb|300px|Where Stansted Airport is now, as about 1935]]\n[[File:B-26-stanst.jpg|thumb|A [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] of the 344th Bomb Group at Stansted, 1944.]]\n[[File:Avro 685 York XF919.G-AMUS Air Charter STA 10.4.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|[[Avro York]] of the based [[Air Charter Limited|Air Charter Ltd]] taking off on a trooping flight in 1955 with wartime hangars in the background]]\n===Second World War===\n{{Main article|RAF Stansted Mountfitchet}}\n\nThe airfield opened in 1943 and was used during the Second World War as [[RAF Stansted Mountfitchet]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.\n\nThe station was first allocated to the [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] in August 1942 as a heavy bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an [[Air Materiel Command#Air Technical Services Command|Air Technical Services Command]] (ATSC) maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.\n\n===Post-war use===\nAfter the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the [[Air Ministry]] and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services (LAMS), equipped with ex-RAF [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70-1\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to [[NATO]]. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under [[BAA Limited|BAA]] control in 1966.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s the Fire Service Training School (FSTS) was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields as well as those of many overseas countries.\n\n===Commercial operations===\n[[File:London Stansted Airport main entrance.jpg|thumb|The Terminal building at night]]\n[[File:London Stansted Airport - Baggage reclaim.jpg|thumb|The Arrivals hall in the Terminal building, which was extended in 2008.]]\nBeginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.\n[[File:London Stansted Airport Air View.jpg|thumb|View of Stansted from the air.]]\n\nStansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford In 1966-67 the Government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the \"[[Roskill Commission]]\") of 1968-71 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that [[Cublington]] in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London's third airport.<ref>Roskill (1971). ''Report, Commission on the Third London Airport''. London: HMSO.</ref> However, the Conservative Government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed. But, in 1974, the incoming Labour Government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=Inside London's Airports Policy: Indecision, decision and counter-decision|last=Le Blond|first=Paul|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763655|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nStansted was then considered as an option for long term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy (ACAP) and the Study Group on South East Airports (SGSEA) and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative Government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981-83. The Inspector's Report was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a White Paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport's capacity to 15&nbsp;million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nThe current terminal building was designed by architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]. Construction was undertaken by [[John Laing Group|John Laing]] and took place between 1988 and 1991,<ref>Ritchie, p. 173</ref> costing \u00a3100&nbsp;million.<ref>''Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA''&nbsp;\u2013 1991 (Michael Donne&nbsp;\u2013 BAA plc), p. 62-63</ref> In 1990 it was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award]]. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport, and [[Stansted Airport railway station]] opened in 1991.\n\nLong-haul scheduled services commenced in the early 1990s when [[American Airlines]] operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and [[O'Hare International Airport]], however the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news | title = American Airlines to quit Stansted: Long haul carrier scraps Chicago service |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1 April 1993 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/american-airlines-to-quit-stansted-long-haul-carrier-scraps-chicago-service-1452654.html | first=Michael | last=Harrison | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> [[Continental Airlines]] also operated services in the late 1990s from [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], but this service was stopped shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nLong-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when [[Eos Airlines]] and [[MAXjet Airways]] commenced all-business-class services from Stansted to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK Airport]]. In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington, D.C.]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York\u2013JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008. However, because of the [[2000s energy crisis|jump in fuel price]], [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|weakening economic performance]] and worsening credit environment at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2008/04/27/why-eos-failed/|title=Why Eos failed - Business Traveller \u2013 The leading magazine for frequent flyers|date=27 April 2008|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/24/maxjetbankrupt|title=MAXjet goes bankrupt|first=Press|last=Association|date=24 December 2007|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/american-airlines-eliminates-jfk-stansted-service-221052|title=American Airlines Eliminates JFK-Stansted Service|date=28 May 2008|publisher=}}</ref> all three services to the United States have since been discontinued following the demise of MAXjet Airways in December 2007 and Eos Airlines in April 2008. Finally, in July 2008, American Airlines withdrew from the airport.\n\n===Latest developments===\nLong haul transatlantic operations made a return to Stansted in June 2010, when [[Sun Country Airlines]] announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to [[Minneapolis]]. The flights made a re-fuelling stop-over in [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a non-stop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and were then discontinued due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long haul flights. {{Cn|date=May 2017}}\n\nLong-haul services to Asia commenced in March 2009 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2009/03/09/air-asia-x-launches-flights-between-stansted-and-kl/|title=Air Asia X launches flights between Stansted and KL \u2013 Business Traveller|work=Business Traveller|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> with Malaysian low-cost airline [[AirAsia X]] providing direct flights to [[Kuala Lumpur]]; however, on 24 October 2011, this service moved to Gatwick Airport before being later withdrawn completely.\n\nA major expansion programme to the existing terminal took place between 2007 and 2009, adding nearly {{convert|5900|m2|abbr=on}} of floorspace to give space for additional baggage carousels, a new immigration and passport control hall and a [[hypostyle]] arrivals hall with improved facilities.\n\nIn November 2006, [[Uttlesford]] District Council rejected a [[BAA Limited|BAA]] planning application to increase the permitted number of aircraft movements and to remove the limit on passenger numbers. BAA immediately appealed against the decision and a public inquiry opened lasting from May until October 2007. Planning Inspector Alan Boyland made his recommendations in January 2008. {{Cn|date=May 2017}} Those recommendations were largely followed by the Secretary of State for Transport ([[Geoff Hoon]]) and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears), who jointly allowed the applicant's appeal in October 2008. A legal challenge by community campaign group Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) was rejected by the High Court in March 2009. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/13/stop-stansted-loses-legal-battle|title=Stop Stansted Expansion group loses legal battle|last=Percival|first=Jenny|date=2009-03-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, 57 people were arrested after [[Plane Stupid]], the environmental activist group, broke through the barriers and created a 'stockade' on a taxiway which resulted in 52 flights being cancelled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/7771079.stm|title=Runway protest strands passengers|work=BBC News| date=8 December 2008 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Competition Commission ruled in March 2009 that BAA should sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports within two years.<ref>{{cite news |title=BAA could challenge airport sale |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7951377.stm |work=BBC News |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> The ruling was quashed within a year following an appeal but was subsequently upheld.<ref>{{cite news |title=BAA sell-off back on track after court ruling |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11531559 |work=BBC News |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> The Competition Commission reconfirmed its ruling in July 2011 that the airport be sold,<ref>{{cite news|title=BAA loses final Competition Commission sell-off ruling|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14196639|accessdate=19 July 2011|work=BBC News|date=19 July 2011}}</ref> and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] turned down an appeal by BAA on 26 July 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=BAA loses latest appeal against Stansted sale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19001159 |work=BBC News |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref> In light of the result, BAA chose not to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and confirmed on 20 August 2012 that the airport would be sold.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stansted Airport to be sold by BAA |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19318094 |work=BBC News |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, [[Antonov Airlines]] opened a UK office at Stansted for cargo charter flights, generally of outsize loads.<ref name=aircargonews-20170220>{{cite news |url=http://www.aircargonews.net/news/airlines/single-view/news/uk-office-handles-antonov-airlines-charter.html |title=UK office handles Antonov Airlines charter |newspaper=aircargonews |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, a group of activists delayed a deportation flight to Nigeria.<ref name=\"batchelor\">{{cite news |last1=Batchelor |first1=Tom |title=Stansted Airport runway closed after activists stage protest against Home Office deportation flight |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stansted-airport-closed-protesters-deportation-plane-runway-a7655036.html |accessdate=14 December 2018 |work=The Independent |date=28 March 2017}}</ref> 15 of the protestors were found guilty of \"intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome\", under the 1990 [[Aviation and Maritime Security Act]].

There are no gates in the main Terminal building; instead there are three separate oblong satellite buildings in which the gates are located. \n\nAn additional building, known as the Advanced Passenger Vehicle (APV), was brought back into use in 2016 for flights departing during the busy 06:00 to 08:00 period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stacc.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/160617-STACC-Airport-Management-Report-June-2016.pdf |title=Airport Management Report|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> The APV building is linked to the main terminal building by an accessible route and acts as a bus terminal for international flights at remote stands. Prior to the completion of Satellite 3, this terminal (then consisted of gates 90-95) was in regular passenger use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Satellite Building !! Gate Numbers !!

There are regular bus service transfers between the Terminal building and Stansted's car parks and hotels.\n\n===Control tower===\n[[File:Stansted Airport - geograph.org.uk - 1761312.jpg|thumb|The Terminal Building with the adjacent Control Tower]]\nStansted's [[air traffic control tower]] was completed in 1996 and was the tallest in Britain at the time of its construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdaconsulting.co.uk/consulting/transport-and-utilities/stansted-airport-control-tower|title=Stansted Airport Control Tower&nbsp;\u2013 MDA Consulting|accessdate=29 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009175913/http://www.mdaconsulting.co.uk/consulting/transport-and-utilities/stansted-airport-control-tower|archivedate=9 October 2011}}</ref> It is located on the southside of the airfield alongside the main terminal building. It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.\n\n===Other infrastructure===\nThere are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] and the [[Boeing 747]]. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport. The largest are located at the south east of the airfield, one of which is used by Ryanair.\n\n[[Titan Airways]] has its head office in the Enterprise House on the airport property.<ref>\"[http://www.titan-airways.com/contact-us.html Contact Us].\" Titan Airways.

This would have been the subject of a public inquiry and, if approved, would have allowed Stansted to handle more passengers than Heathrow did at the time of the application.<ref>{{Cite news | title = \u00a32.5bn Stansted Generation 2 planning bid submitted | publisher = Transport Briefing | date = 12 March 2008 | url = http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4781 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081007053448/http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4781 | archivedate = 7 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2010, BAA withdrew its plans to build a second runway at Stansted and withdrew the plans to build a new runway at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].<ref name=\"withdraw\">BBC News: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8701433.stm Heathrow and Stansted runway plans scrapped by BAA], 24 May 2010. Visited 20 June 2011</ref>\n\nThe ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA's 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.\n\nPrior to the United Kingdom's May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly \u00a3200&nbsp;million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.\n\nThe public inquiry into BAA's second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] to allow time for BAA and the Government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission's ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission's ruling and to sell Stansted.\n\nOn 10 February 2010, Secretary of State [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the General Election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.<ref name=\"withdraw\"/>\n\n====Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE)====\nThe [[advocacy group]] Stop Stansted Expansion (\"SSE\"), formed in 2002 as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport [[White Paper]] in December 2003.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100519093443/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/air/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; The Future of Air Transport \u2013 White Paper and the Civil Aviation Bill]. Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nIt still actively campaigns against what its members see as the unsustainable expansion of the airport. SSE was a major participant in the 2007 \"G1\" public inquiry and had committed to be a major participant in the anticipated inquiry into the 'G2' second runway proposal. Following the withdrawal of the G2 planning application the group called upon BAA to sell the homes it had bought to support the planned expansion.\n\nIn September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the Government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies,<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission Airports Commission]. GOV.UK. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref> to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK's status as a global aviation hub. The Commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election the Commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.\n\nThroughout 2013, the Airports Commission published discussion papers and invited submissions from key stakeholders on the main issues it wished to consider. SSE made several thorough submissions. SSE also accepted an invitation to give oral evidence and make a presentation to the Commission on aviation demand forecasting and connectivity at a public evidence session held in Manchester in July 2013.<ref>Stansted Airport Airfield Fire Services 30 March 1998 Emerald Airways HS748 engine exploded on take off whilst carrying the Leeds United football team, aircraft written off but no one injured.

MAG has invested \u00a340&nbsp;million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, a number of new shops and an Escape Lounge, however the remodelling has drawn heavy criticism due to the length of time it takes to walk through the shopping areas to get to the departure gates.\n\nSatellite One has also been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |title=Transport Secretary Launches \u00a380 Million Terminal Redevelopment |date=20 June 2013 |publisher=London Stansted Airport |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234429/http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |archivedate=21 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===New Arrivals Terminal===\nAn arrivals terminal is planned to be built at Stansted, with construction due to begin in 2018, taking three years to complete. The site will include larger immigration and baggage reclaim areas, with more shops and facilities available after arrival into the UK. The current terminal will be reconfigured to departures only, with security and check-in areas due to be expanded. The project is expected to cost \u00a3130m, and, once completed, will make London Stansted the only airport in the UK with dedicated arrivals and departures terminal buildings.<ref>{{Cite

The base of each truss structure is a \"utility pillar\", which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, go through security and on to the departure gates all on the same level.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Stansted saw rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24&nbsp;million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years to 2012. Passenger totals later increased, and in 2016 recorded an annual increase of 8.0% to 24.3&nbsp;million and numbers have since continued to rise.<ref name=\"stats\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Before Stansted Airport aa.jpg|thumb|300px|Where Stansted Airport is now, as about 1935]]\n[[File:B-26-stanst.jpg|thumb|A [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] of the 344th Bomb Group at Stansted, 1944.]]\n[[File:Avro 685 York XF919.G-AMUS Air Charter STA 10.4.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|[[Avro York]] of the based [[Air Charter Limited|Air Charter Ltd]] taking off on a trooping flight in 1955 with wartime hangars in the background]]\n===Second World War===\n{{Main article|RAF Stansted Mountfitchet}}\n\nThe airfield opened in 1943 and was used during the Second World War as [[RAF Stansted Mountfitchet]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.\n\nThe station was first allocated to the [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] in August 1942 as a heavy bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an [[Air Materiel Command#Air Technical Services Command|Air Technical Services Command]] (ATSC) maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.\n\n===Post-war use===\nAfter the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the [[Air Ministry]] and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services (LAMS), equipped with ex-RAF [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70-1\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to [[NATO]]. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under [[BAA Limited|BAA]] control in 1966.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s the Fire Service Training School (FSTS) was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields as well as those of many overseas countries.\n\n===Commercial operations===\n[[File:London Stansted Airport main entrance.jpg|thumb|The Terminal building at night]]\n[[File:London Stansted Airport - Baggage reclaim.jpg|thumb|The Arrivals hall in the Terminal building, which was extended in 2008.]]\nBeginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.\n[[File:London Stansted Airport Air View.jpg|thumb|View of Stansted from the air.]]\n\nStansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford In 1966-67 the Government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the \"[[Roskill Commission]]\") of 1968-71 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that [[Cublington]] in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London's third airport.<ref>Roskill (1971). ''Report, Commission on the Third London Airport''. London: HMSO.</ref> However, the Conservative Government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed. But, in 1974, the incoming Labour Government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=Inside London's Airports Policy: Indecision, decision and counter-decision|last=Le Blond|first=Paul|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763655|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nStansted was then considered as an option for long term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy (ACAP) and the Study Group on South East Airports (SGSEA) and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative Government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981-83. The Inspector's Report was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a White Paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport's capacity to 15&nbsp;million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nThe current terminal building was designed by architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]. Construction was undertaken by [[John Laing Group|John Laing]] and took place between 1988 and 1991,<ref>Ritchie, p. 173</ref> costing \u00a3100&nbsp;million.<ref>''Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA''&nbsp;\u2013 1991 (Michael Donne&nbsp;\u2013 BAA plc), p. 62-63</ref> In 1990 it was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award]]. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport, and [[Stansted Airport railway station]] opened in 1991.\n\nLong-haul scheduled services commenced in the early 1990s when [[American Airlines]] operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and [[O'Hare International Airport]], however the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news | title = American Airlines to quit Stansted: Long haul carrier scraps Chicago service |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1 April 1993 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/american-airlines-to-quit-stansted-long-haul-carrier-scraps-chicago-service-1452654.html | first=Michael | last=Harrison | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> [[Continental Airlines]] also operated services in the late 1990s from [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], but this service was stopped shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nLong-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when [[Eos Airlines]] and [[MAXjet Airways]] commenced all-business-class services from Stansted to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK Airport]]. In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington, D.C.]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York\u2013JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008.

Finally, in July 2008, American Airlines withdrew from the airport.\n\n===Latest developments===\nLong haul transatlantic operations made a return to Stansted in June 2010, when [[Sun Country Airlines]] announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to [[Minneapolis]]. The flights made a re-fuelling stop-over in [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a non-stop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010.

It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.\n\n===Other infrastructure===\nThere are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] and the [[Boeing 747]]. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport.

Visited 20 June 2011</ref>\n\nThe ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA's 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.\n\nPrior to the United Kingdom's May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly \u00a3200&nbsp;million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.\n\nThe public inquiry into BAA's second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] to allow time for BAA and the Government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission's ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission's ruling and to sell Stansted.\n\nOn 10 February 2010, Secretary of State [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the General Election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.<ref name=\"withdraw\"/>\n\n====Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE)====\nThe [[advocacy group]] Stop Stansted Expansion (\"SSE\"), formed in 2002 as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport [[White Paper]] in December 2003.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100519093443/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/air/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; The Future of Air Transport \u2013 White Paper and the Civil Aviation Bill]. Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nIt still actively campaigns against what its members see as the unsustainable expansion of the airport. SSE was a major participant in the 2007 \"G1\" public inquiry and had committed to be a major participant in the anticipated inquiry into the 'G2' second runway proposal. Following the withdrawal of the G2 planning application the group called upon BAA to sell the homes it had bought to support the planned expansion.\n\nIn September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the Government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies,<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission Airports Commission]. GOV.UK. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref> to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK's status as a global aviation hub. The Commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election the Commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.\n\nThroughout 2013, the Airports Commission published discussion papers and invited submissions from key stakeholders on the main issues it wished to consider. SSE made several thorough submissions. SSE also accepted an invitation to give oral evidence and make a presentation to the Commission on aviation demand forecasting and connectivity at a public evidence session held in Manchester in July 2013.<ref>Stansted Airport Airfield Fire Services 30 March 1998 Emerald Airways HS748 engine exploded on take off whilst carrying the Leeds United football team, aircraft written off but no one injured.

MAG has invested \u00a340&nbsp;million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, a number of new shops and an Escape Lounge, however the remodelling has drawn heavy criticism due to the length of time it takes to walk through the shopping areas to get to the departure gates.\n\nSatellite One has also been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |title=Transport Secretary Launches \u00a380 Million Terminal Redevelopment |date=20 June 2013 |publisher=London Stansted Airport |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234429/http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |archivedate=21 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===New Arrivals Terminal===\nAn arrivals terminal is planned to be built at Stansted, with construction due to begin in 2018, taking three years to complete.

The current terminal will be reconfigured to departures only, with security and check-in areas due to be expanded.

The word may refer to someone born in the [[U.S.]] of full or partial Colombian descent or to someone who has emigrated to the U.S. from Colombia. Colombian Americans are the [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Demographics|seventh-largest Latin American group]] and the largest [[South American]] Hispanic group in the United States.<ref>Pamela Sturner, \"Colombian Americans.\" ''Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America'', edited by Thomas Riggs, (3rd ed., vol. 1, Gale, 2014), pp. 519-530.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first Colombians immigrants who settled in the United States likely arrived in the 1800s. However, the Colombian presence in United States would not be known with certainty since the federal census did not specify the country of origin for South Americans until 1960. These immigrants did not maintain any relation with their native countries, just until a few generations after, they identify themselves only as Americans.\n\nThe first Colombian community formed after [[World War I]], through the arrival of several hundred professionals (nurses, accountants, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, and bilingual secretaries) that established themselves in [[New York City]]; later on, more people were added to the community when Colombian students decided to stay in the US after earning their degrees. Most immigrants settled in [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]], a middle-class neighborhood in the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]] in New York City, that has good housing, schools and churches. The growth of the Colombian population was slow until 1940, when there was an increase in Colombian immigration to New York.\n\n===Post World War II===\nMost Colombians who arrived after the mid-1960s wanted to stay in the United States temporarily. Therefore, the number of undocumented Colombian immigrants increased: from 250,000 to 350,000 people in the mid 1970s. Despite a succession of immigration laws, the Colombian population in the United States continued to grow. New York remained the most popular destination.  Smaller communities formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[Houston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] and in the 1970s, [[North Side, Chicago]].<ref name=\"everyculture\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Colombian-Americans.html|title=Colombian Americans - History, Immigration, Acculturation and Assimilation, Holidays, Dances and songs, Health issues|website=Everyculture.com|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1980s, many Colombians have settled in [[Miami]] (especially in its suburbs, such as [[Doral, Florida|Doral]], [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], and the [[Weston, Florida|Weston]] suburb of [[Fort Lauderdale]]). Initially they settled in [[Little Havana]], the largest Cuban neighborhood, many of them engaged in the business of trade between Miami and Latin America.  The area also attracted wealthy Colombians, who settled there to get medical care, send their children to school, and escape from social, economic, and political turmoil in Colombia.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nBy 1987, Colombians were one of the fastest growing Hispanic groups in Miami. By the early 1990s, many Colombians left the metropolitan centers for the suburbs due to crime and the high cost of urban living. This trend was probably started for the first time in the coastal towns of Connecticut and New York. Colombian communities grew significantly in places such as [[Stamford, Connecticut]], [[Bergenline Avenue|Bergenline]] and [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[New Jersey]], [[Jacksonville]], Florida (which attracted a growing number of people from Miami), and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]] and [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], [[Illinois]]. Despite the migration to other areas, the largest communities remained in New York City, Miami, and their environs.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, 43,891 Colombians were admitted to the United States, more than from any other Latin American country. They were for the first time the most populous group of undocumented immigrants in the US from Latin America, excluding Mexico. Between 1992 and 1997, [[Colombian conflict (1964\u2013present)|the intensity of the conflict]] in Colombia increased, so nearly 75,000 Colombians immigrated to the United States in this period, many of them going to [[California]].<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\n===Causes of migration===\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Flag of Colombia.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | caption1 = [[Flag of Colombia]]\n | image2 = Flag of the United States.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = [[Flag of the United States]]\n }}\nIn Miville's \"Colombians in the United States: History, Values, and Challenges,\" the nature of Colombian migration is described. He writes,\"Colombian migration patterns have been distinguished by scholars as three distinct waves involving diverse demographic groups, reasons for migrating, and contextual factors with a mixture of push and pull factors from both the originating and host countries (Madrigal, 2013; Migration Policy Institute, 2015). Immigration to the United States was essentially minor from about 1820 to 1950 when fewer than 7000 Colombians immigrated to the United States. Indeed, the Colombian presence in United States was not recognized officially until 1960, when the U.S. Census began to specify the country of origin for South Americans (Migration Policy Institute, 2015).\"\nEconomic problems and violence have led to an emigration of Colombians to the United States, particularly [[South Florida]] (especially in the suburbs of Miami, Florida such as [[Doral, Florida|Doral]], [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], and the [[Weston, Florida|Weston]] suburb of Fort Lauderdale), [[Central Florida]], [[New Jersey]] ([[North Jersey]]), [[Queens|Queens County]] in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], the [[Washington DC]] metro area, eastern [[Long Island]], and an expanding community in [[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], mainly in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Atlanta]] areas.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nFirst Wave: After of World War I, many Colombians immigrated to United States in order to complete their education there, studying in the universities of the country. Most of them settled in New York. Many Colombians immigrated to the United States in order to complete their education, studying in universities across the country (Madrigal, 2013; Sassen-Koob, 1989)\" After the civil war in 1948 and increased poverty in Colombia many Colombians also emigrated to United States during the 1950s. In the 1960s, the economic crisis prompted the emigration of many Colombians to the United States, obtaining U.S. citizenship Between 1960 and 1977.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nSecond Wave (1965-1989): \"The passage of several U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Act\u2019s amendments in 1965 allowed for more Colombians to migrate to the United States (Madrigal, 2013)\"\n\nThird Wave (1990-2008): \"The 1980s and 1990s brought the rise in cocaine trafficking, along with the influence of the drug cartels and paramilitary groups (Carvajal, 2017; Migration Policy Institute, 2015). From the 1990s, along with the ensuing turmoil over a political assassination in 1989, the number of Colombians admitted to the United States tripled, representing the largest numbers of immigrants from a South American country (Carvajal, 2017; Migration Policy Institute, 2015)\" Since the 1980s, many Colombians fled their urban cities to migrate to suburban areas in states like [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]], as their [[socioeconomic status]] improved. The conflict escalation between terrorists, paramilitaries, and narcos between 1992 and 1997 also boosted the Colombian emigration during this period. As was discussed earlier, about 75,000 Colombians immigrated at that time the United States, concentrating mostly in the state of California.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the 2000 Census, 228,400 Colombians were living in the New York metro area and 169,271 Colombians were living in the Miami metropolitan area.  The largest Colombian community lives in the [[South Florida|South Florida area]] ([[Doral, Florida|Doral]], [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], [[Weston, Florida|Weston]], and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]]) with a population of 138,768,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects05/lie/col.html|title=Colombian Immigration|website=Umich.edu|accessdate=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211233353/http://www.umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects05/lie/col.html|archive-date=11 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"SFC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.epodunk.com/ancestry/Colomban.html |title=Ancestry Map of Colombian Communities |publisher=Epodunk.com |accessdate=2008-01-25 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]] in Queens County, New York city.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nIn [[New York City]], a large Colombian community thrives and continues to expand in size since the wave of immigration began in the 1970s. [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]] in Queens County was heavily Colombian  during the 1980s, but other immigrant groups have settled in the area, notably Ecuadoreans and Mexicans. Many of the displaced [[Colombian people|Colombians]] have moved to adjacent areas such as [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], [[East Elmhurst, Queens|East Elmhurst]], [[Corona, Queens|Corona]], while wealthier Colombian Immigrants have gone further afield to [[College Point, Queens|College Point]] and [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]].

However, the Colombian presence in United States would not be known with certainty since the federal census did not specify the country of origin for South Americans until 1960. These immigrants did not maintain any relation with their native countries, just until a few generations after, they identify themselves only as Americans.\n\nThe first Colombian community formed after [[World War I]], through the arrival of several hundred professionals (nurses, accountants, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, and bilingual secretaries) that established themselves in [[New York City]]; later on, more people were added to the community when Colombian students decided to stay in the US after earning their degrees. Most immigrants settled in [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]], a middle-class neighborhood in the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]] in New York City, that has good housing, schools and churches. The growth of the Colombian population was slow until 1940, when there was an increase in Colombian immigration to New York.\n\n===Post World War II===\nMost Colombians who arrived after the mid-1960s wanted to stay in the United States temporarily. Therefore, the number of undocumented Colombian immigrants increased: from 250,000 to 350,000 people in the mid 1970s. Despite a succession of immigration laws, the Colombian population in the United States continued to grow. New York remained the most popular destination.  Smaller communities formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[Houston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] and in the 1970s, [[North Side, Chicago]].<ref name=\"everyculture\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Colombian-Americans.html|title=Colombian Americans - History, Immigration, Acculturation and Assimilation, Holidays, Dances and songs, Health issues|website=Everyculture.com|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1980s, many Colombians have settled in [[Miami]] (especially in its suburbs, such as [[Doral, Florida|Doral]], [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], and the [[Weston, Florida|Weston]] suburb of [[Fort Lauderdale]]). Initially they settled in [[Little Havana]], the largest Cuban neighborhood, many of them engaged in the business of trade between Miami and Latin America.  The area also attracted wealthy Colombians, who settled there to get medical care, send their children to school, and escape from social, economic, and political turmoil in Colombia.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nBy 1987, Colombians were one of the fastest growing Hispanic groups in Miami. By the early 1990s, many Colombians left the metropolitan centers for the suburbs due to crime and the high cost of urban living. This trend was probably started for the first time in the coastal towns of Connecticut and New York. Colombian communities grew significantly in places such as [[Stamford, Connecticut]], [[Bergenline Avenue|Bergenline]] and [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[New Jersey]], [[Jacksonville]], Florida (which attracted a growing number of people from Miami), and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]] and [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], [[Illinois]]. Despite the migration to other areas, the largest communities remained in New York City, Miami, and their environs.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, 43,891 Colombians were admitted to the United States, more than from any other Latin American country. They were for the first time the most populous group of undocumented immigrants in the US from Latin America, excluding Mexico. Between 1992 and 1997, [[Colombian conflict (1964\u2013present)|the intensity of the conflict]] in Colombia increased, so nearly 75,000 Colombians immigrated to the United States in this period, many of them going to [[California]].<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\n===Causes of migration===\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Flag of Colombia.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | caption1 = [[Flag of Colombia]]\n | image2 = Flag of the United States.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = [[Flag of the United States]]\n }}\nIn Miville's \"Colombians in the United States: History, Values, and Challenges,\" the nature of Colombian migration is described. He writes,\"Colombian migration patterns have been distinguished by scholars as three distinct waves involving diverse demographic groups, reasons for migrating, and contextual factors with a mixture of push and pull factors from both the originating and host countries (Madrigal, 2013; Migration Policy Institute, 2015). Immigration to the United States was essentially minor from about 1820 to 1950 when fewer than 7000 Colombians immigrated to the United States. Indeed, the Colombian presence in United States was not recognized officially until 1960, when the U.S. Census began to specify the country of origin for South Americans (Migration Policy Institute, 2015).\"\nEconomic problems and violence have led to an emigration of Colombians to the United States, particularly [[South Florida]] (especially in the suburbs of Miami, Florida such as [[Doral, Florida|Doral]], [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], and the [[Weston, Florida|Weston]] suburb of Fort Lauderdale), [[Central Florida]], [[New Jersey]] ([[North Jersey]]), [[Queens|Queens County]] in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], the [[Washington DC]] metro area, eastern [[Long Island]], and an expanding community in [[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], mainly in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Atlanta]] areas.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nFirst Wave: After of World War I, many Colombians immigrated to United States in order to complete their education there, studying in the universities of the country. Most of them settled in New York. Many Colombians immigrated to the United States in order to complete their education, studying in universities across the country (Madrigal, 2013; Sassen-Koob, 1989)\" After the civil war in 1948 and increased poverty in Colombia many Colombians also emigrated to United States during the 1950s. In the 1960s, the economic crisis prompted the emigration of many Colombians to the United States, obtaining U.S. citizenship Between 1960 and 1977.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\nSecond Wave (1965-1989): \"The passage of several U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Act\u2019s amendments in 1965 allowed for more Colombians to migrate to the United States (Madrigal, 2013)\"\n\nThird Wave (1990-2008): \"The 1980s and 1990s brought the rise in cocaine trafficking, along with the influence of the drug cartels and paramilitary groups (Carvajal, 2017; Migration Policy Institute, 2015). From the 1990s, along with the ensuing turmoil over a political assassination in 1989, the number of Colombians admitted to the United States tripled, representing the largest numbers of immigrants from a South American country (Carvajal, 2017; Migration Policy Institute, 2015)\" Since the 1980s, many Colombians fled their urban cities to migrate to suburban areas in states like [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]], as their [[socioeconomic status]] improved. The conflict escalation between terrorists, paramilitaries, and narcos between 1992 and 1997 also boosted the Colombian emigration during this period. As was discussed earlier, about 75,000 Colombians immigrated at that time the United States, concentrating mostly in the state of California.<ref name=\"everyculture\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the 2000 Census, 228,400 Colombians were living in the New York metro area and 169,271 Colombians were living in the Miami metropolitan area.

The newspapers did not bother recording the point scorers though they did mention that the Shore side gave everybody in the team a chance to kick for goal.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 5\u20132\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Ponsonby Defeats City/Wins for North Shore and Grafton\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = City\n| try1 = [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]] (mark)\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = [[Ernie Asher]]\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Ferguson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Otahuhu\n| score = 8\u201317\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grafton V Otahuhu\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = George Cook, [[Arthur Hardgrave]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = M Stanaway\n| try2 = [[Bob Mitchell (rugby league)|Bob Mitchell]], [[Karl Ifwersen]] 2\n| con2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]] 3\n| pen2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]]\n| stadium = Otahuhu\n| attendance =\n| referee = Tyson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = North Shore\n| score = 43\u20132\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title = North Shore V Newton\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Newton\n| try1 = unknown x ?\n| con1 = unknown x ?\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = unknown x 1\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = Benson\n}}\n\n======Final======\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 18 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 2\u201313\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Championship Final/Won by North Shore/A Record Attendance\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15665\n| date = 1914-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140720.2.10.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]]\n| try2 =Wynyard, Edward Fox, [[Stan Weston]]\n| con2 = Jack Paul 2\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = R Benson\n}}\n\n===Top Try Scorers and Point Scorers===\nNone of the North Shore point scorers from their farcical Round 9 match with Newton Rangers were credited and therefore the following lists will be inaccurate as 43 points were scored by them.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment.\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service has 50 million subscribers {{as of|2020|04|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{Cite news |last=Spangler |first=Todd |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Daniel |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.
