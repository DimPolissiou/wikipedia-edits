After the war the economy began to improve, before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] the Croatian economy grew at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.\n\nThe Croatian economy is one of the strongest economies in [[Southeast Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hr-eu.net/article.php?lang=2&id=31&t=Economic%20transition|title=Economic transition|website=www.hr-eu.net|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Croatia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2000, [[NATO]] in 2009 and became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013. Croatian economy was badly affected by the financial crisis which, together with slow progress of economic reforms, resulted in six years of recession and a cumulative decline in GDP of 12.5%.\nCroatia formally emerged from the recession in the 4th quarter of 2014, and had a continuous GDP growth since. Croatian economy reached pre \n[[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|crisis]] levels in 2019 but due to [[Coronavirus_disease_2019|Coronavirus disease]] the economy is set to contract more than -6,2% during first and second quarter of 2020, however growth is set to pick up in thrid quarter of 2020.<ref>https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/croatia/overview#3</ref>\n\nThe [[Industry of Croatia|industrial sector]] with exports of over \u20ac10 billion annually is dominated by shipbuilding which accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry also account for significant portions of industrial output and exports. Industrial sector represents 27% of Croatia's total economic output while agriculture represents 6%. Industrial sector is responsible for 25% of Croatia's GDP, with agriculture, forestry and fishing accounting for the remaining 5% of Croatian GDP.\n\n[[Tourism]] is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 14 million tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of \u20ac8 billion.

Many industrial branches developed in that time, like forestry and wood industry ([[stave (wood)|stave]] fabrication, the production of potash, lumber mills, shipbuilding). The most profitable one was stave fabrication, the boom of which started in the 1820s with the clearing of the oak forests around [[Karlovac]] and [[Sisak]] and again in the 1850s with the marshy oak masses along the Sava and Drava rivers. Shipbuilding in Croatia played a huge role in the 1850s [[Austrian Empire]], especially the longe-range sailing boats. Sisak and [[Vukovar]] were the centres of river-shipbuilding.<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/81678 Mariann Nagy \u2013 Croatia in the Economic Structure of the Habsburg Empire in the Light of the 1857 Census], p. 81-82</ref> [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]] was also mostly an agricultural land and it was known for its silk production.

Most of its industry was based in Slovenia and Croatia, but further industrial development was modest and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards and food-processing plants.

Its currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|NDH kuna]]. The Croatian State Bank was the central bank, responsible for issuing currency. As the war progressed the government kept printing more money and its amount in circulation was rapidly increasing, resulting in high inflation rates.<ref>Jozo Toma\u0161evi\u0107: Rat i revolucija u Jugoslaviji 1941\u20131945, 2010, p. 785</ref>\n\nAfter the World War II, the new [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] resorted to a command economy on the Soviet model of rapid industrial development. By 1948 almost all domestic and foreign-owned capital had been nationalized. The industrialization plan relied on high taxation, fixed prices, [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|war reparations]], Soviet credits, and export of food and raw materials. Forced collectivization of agriculture was initiated in 1949. At that time 94% of agricultural land was privately owned, and by 1950 96% was under the control of the social sector. A rapid improvement of food production and the standard of living was expected, but due to bad results the program was abandoned three years later.<ref name=Frucht />\n\nThroughout the 1950s Croatia experienced rapid urbanization. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]]. [[SR Croatia]] was, after [[SR Slovenia]], the second most developed republic in Yugoslavia with a 25% higher GDP per capita than the Yugoslav average. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall [[standard of living]]. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly.

[[Privatization in Croatia]] and transformation from a planned economy to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady, largely as a result of public mistrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. With the end of the war, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment.<ref name=IBP /><ref name=Benczes>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203</ref> The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace. As of 2000, roughly 70% of Croatia's major companies were still state-owned, including water, electricity, oil, transportation, telecommunications, and tourism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Land, and Culture], p. 473</ref>\n\nEarly 1990s were characterized with high inflation rates. In 1991 the [[Croatian dinar]] was introduced as a transitional currency, but inflation continued to accelerate. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 decreased retail price inflation from a monthly rate of 38,7% to 1,4%, and by the end of the year Croatia experienced deflation. In 1994 Croatia introduced the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] as its currency.<ref name=Benczes />\n\nAs a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995\u20131997.<ref name=Benczes /> Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of commercial creditors, when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks. In 1997 around 60 percent of Croatia's external debt was inherited from former Yugoslavia.<ref name=Benczes2>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 205-206</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1998 value-added tax was introduced.

After the collapse of [[socialism]], [[Croatia]] went through a process of transition to a [[Market economy|market-based economy]] in the 1990s, but its economy suffered badly during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the war the economy began to improve, before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] the Croatian economy grew at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.\n\nThe Croatian economy is one of the strongest economies in [[Southeast Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hr-eu.net/article.php?lang=2&id=31&t=Economic%20transition|title=Economic transition|website=www.hr-eu.net|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Croatia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2000, [[NATO]] in 2009 and became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013. Croatian economy was badly affected by the financial crisis which, together with slow progress of economic reforms, resulted in six years of recession and a cumulative decline in GDP of 12.5%.\nCroatia formally emerged from the recession in the 4th quarter of 2014, and had a continuous GDP growth since. Croatian economy reached pre \n[[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|crisis]] levels in 2019 but due to [[Coronavirus_disease_2019|Coronavirus disease]] the economy is set to contract more than -6,2% during first and second quarter of 2020, however growth is set to pick up in thrid quarter of 2020.<ref>https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/croatia/overview#3</ref>\n\nThe [[Industry of Croatia|industrial sector]] with exports of over \u20ac10 billion annually is dominated by shipbuilding which accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry also account for significant portions of industrial output and exports. Industrial sector represents 27% of Croatia's total economic output while agriculture represents 6%. Industrial sector is responsible for 25% of Croatia's GDP, with agriculture, forestry and fishing accounting for the remaining 5% of Croatian GDP.\n\n[[Tourism]] is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 14 million tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of \u20ac8 billion.

Many industrial branches developed in that time, like forestry and wood industry ([[stave (wood)|stave]] fabrication, the production of potash, lumber mills, shipbuilding). The most profitable one was stave fabrication, the boom of which started in the 1820s with the clearing of the oak forests around [[Karlovac]] and [[Sisak]] and again in the 1850s with the marshy oak masses along the Sava and Drava rivers. Shipbuilding in Croatia played a huge role in the 1850s [[Austrian Empire]], especially the longe-range sailing boats.

Most of its industry was based in Slovenia and Croatia, but further industrial development was modest and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards and food-processing plants.

By 1948 almost all domestic and foreign-owned capital had been nationalized. The industrialization plan relied on high taxation, fixed prices, [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|war reparations]], Soviet credits, and export of food and raw materials. Forced collectivization of agriculture was initiated in 1949. At that time 94% of agricultural land was privately owned, and by 1950 96% was under the control of the social sector. A rapid improvement of food production and the standard of living was expected, but due to bad results the program was abandoned three years later.<ref name=Frucht />\n\nThroughout the 1950s Croatia experienced rapid urbanization. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]].

Croatia and Slovenia accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall [[standard of living]].

Privatization under the new government had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], infrastructure sustained massive damage in the period 1991\u201392, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry. [[Privatization in Croatia]] and transformation from a planned economy to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady, largely as a result of public mistrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. With the end of the war, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment.<ref name=IBP /><ref name=Benczes>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203</ref> The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace.

In 1991 the [[Croatian dinar]] was introduced as a transitional currency, but inflation continued to accelerate. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 decreased retail price inflation from a monthly rate of 38,7% to 1,4%, and by the end of the year Croatia experienced deflation. In 1994 Croatia introduced the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] as its currency.<ref name=Benczes />\n\nAs a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995\u20131997.<ref name=Benczes /> Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of commercial creditors, when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks.

The fire heavily affected the [[Bonita Creek]], causing increased sedimentation in Ponil Creek. It caused the loss of [[Cottonwood tree|cottonwoods]] and [[Willow|willows]]. The riparian tree canopy reduced due to the burning of riparian vegetation, which caused higher stream temperature.<ref name=\":3\">\"[https://allaboutwatersheds.org/groups/ute-park-fire-recovery/ute-park-fire-recovery-public-group-folder/ute-park-fire-damage-assessment-and-burned-area-emergency-rehabilitation-plan UTE Park Fire]\".
