Combining [[science]], [[aesthetics]], and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively.\n\nThe fundamental uses of traditional cartography are to:\n* Set the map's agenda and select traits of the object to be mapped. This is the concern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as [[Toponomy|toponyms]] or political boundaries.\n* Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. This is the concern of [[map projection]]s.\n* Eliminate characteristics of the mapped object that are not relevant to the map's purpose. This is the concern of [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]].\n* Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped. This is also the concern of generalization.\n* Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience.

In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models \u2013 Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1507, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name \"America\".

This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) which was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the [[sinusoidal projection]] and the [[Bonne projection]].

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-01-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-02-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Renaissance]], maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly. Because of this,\u00a0 towards the end of the Renaissance, maps were displayed with equal importance of painting, sculptures, and other pieces of art.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2011|title=Worldly Consumer: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=63|pages=123\u2013126|via=}}</ref> In the sixteenth century, maps were becoming increasingly available to consumers through the introduction of printmaking, with about 10% of Venetian homes having some sort of map by the late 1500s.\n\nThere were three main functions of maps in the Renaissance:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Cartography and the Renaissance: Continuity and Change|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=3\u201324|via=}}</ref>\n*General descriptions of the world\n*Navigation and wayfinding\n*Land surveying and property management\n\nIn medieval times, written directions of how to get somewhere were more common than the use of maps. With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power.<ref name=\":0\" /> Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.\n\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]\n\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Cartographica, Vol. 26, No. 2. pp 1-5]</ref> An example of this understanding is that \"[<nowiki />European reproduction of terrain on maps] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth\u2026\".<ref name=Harley/> 17th-century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts.

General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref name=Ovenden>{{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5| pages=22, 60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |url=https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit |url-access=registration |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit/page/162 162\u2013163] |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H.

[[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map \"is convincing because it implies authenticity\".<ref>{{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}} (p.&nbsp;9)</ref> An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}} p.&nbsp;93</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled \"[[trap streets]]\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-53421-3 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}</ref> Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]</ref>\n\nAnother motive for deliberate errors is cartographic \"vandalism\": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.\n\n[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Main|Outline of cartography}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Animated mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Cartogram}}\n* {{annotated link|Terrain cartography|aka=Cartographic relief depiction}}\n* {{annotated link|City map}}\n* {{annotated link|Counter-mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Fantasy map}}\n* {{annotated link|Figure-ground in map design}}\n* {{annotated link|Geoinformatics}}\n* {{annotated link|Geovisualization}}\n* {{annotated link|Geo warping}}\n* {{annotated link|History of cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|History of Cartography Project}}\n* {{annotated link|List of cartographers}}\n* {{annotated link|Locator map}}\n* {{annotated link|OpenStreetMap}}\n* {{annotated link|Pictorial map}}\n* {{annotated link|Planetary cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Seafloor mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Scribing (cartography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Toponymy}}\n* {{annotated link|World map}}\n* {{annotated link|Page layout (cartography)}}\n<!-- The article titled ''{{annotated link|great circle distance}}'' explains how to find that quantity if one knows the two latitudes and longitudes. -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Mapmaking\n* {{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Kraak, Menno-Jan  |author2=Ormeling, Ferjan |title=Cartography: Visualization of Spatial Data |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-088890-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Peterson, Michael P. |title=Interactive and Animated Cartography |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-13-079104-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slocum, T. |title=Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-13-035123-4}}\n\n;History\n* {{cite book |title=Mapping the World: An Illustrated History of Cartography |author=Ralph E Ehrenberg |publisher=National Geographic |date=October 11, 2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 256] |isbn=978-0-7922-6525-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[John Brian Harley|J.

This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) which was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the [[sinusoidal projection]] and the [[Bonne projection]].

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-01-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-02-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Renaissance]], maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly. Because of this,\u00a0 towards the end of the Renaissance, maps were displayed with equal importance of painting, sculptures, and other pieces of art.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2011|title=Worldly Consumer: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=63|pages=123\u2013126|via=}}</ref> In the sixteenth century, maps were becoming increasingly available to consumers through the introduction of printmaking, with about 10% of Venetian homes having some sort of map by the late 1500s.\n\nThere were three main functions of maps in the Renaissance:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Cartography and the Renaissance: Continuity and Change|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=3\u201324|via=}}</ref>\n*General descriptions of the world\n*Navigation and wayfinding\n*Land surveying and property management\n\nIn medieval times, written directions of how to get somewhere were more common than the use of maps. With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power.<ref name=\":0\" /> Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.\n\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images.

However, to later scholars in the field{{When|date=April 2019}}, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.<ref name=Harley/> For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.<ref name=\"Basset\" /> This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.{{Why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Map types==\n\n===General vs. thematic cartography===\n[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]\n[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]\n\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref name=Ovenden>{{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5| pages=22, 60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |url=https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit |url-access=registration |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit/page/162 162\u2013163] |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H.

[[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map \"is convincing because it implies authenticity\".<ref>{{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}} (p.&nbsp;9)</ref> An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}} p.&nbsp;93</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled \"[[trap streets]]\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-53421-3 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}</ref> Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]</ref>\n\nAnother motive for deliberate errors is cartographic \"vandalism\": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work.

It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.\n\n[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Main|Outline of cartography}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Animated mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Cartogram}}\n* {{annotated link|Terrain cartography|aka=Cartographic relief depiction}}\n* {{annotated link|City map}}\n* {{annotated link|Counter-mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Fantasy map}}\n* {{annotated link|Figure-ground in map design}}\n* {{annotated link|Geoinformatics}}\n* {{annotated link|Geovisualization}}\n* {{annotated link|Geo warping}}\n* {{annotated link|History of cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|History of Cartography Project}}\n* {{annotated link|List of cartographers}}\n* {{annotated link|Locator map}}\n* {{annotated link|OpenStreetMap}}\n* {{annotated link|Pictorial map}}\n* {{annotated link|Planetary cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Seafloor mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Scribing (cartography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Toponymy}}\n* {{annotated link|World map}}\n* {{annotated link|Page layout (cartography)}}\n<!-- The article titled ''{{annotated link|great circle distance}}'' explains how to find that quantity if one knows the two latitudes and longitudes. -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Mapmaking\n* {{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Kraak, Menno-Jan  |author2=Ormeling, Ferjan |title=Cartography: Visualization of Spatial Data |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-088890-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Peterson, Michael P. |title=Interactive and Animated Cartography |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-13-079104-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slocum, T. |title=Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-13-035123-4}}\n\n;History\n* {{cite book |title=Mapping the World: An Illustrated History of Cartography |author=Ralph E Ehrenberg |publisher=National Geographic |date=October 11, 2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 256] |isbn=978-0-7922-6525-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[John Brian Harley|J.

Amylase is present in the [[saliva]] of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of [[digestion]]. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as [[rice]] and [[potatoes]], may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The [[pancreas]] and salivary gland make amylase ([[alpha amylase]]) to hydrolyse dietary starch into [[disaccharides]] and [[trisaccharides]] which are converted by other enzymes to [[glucose]] to supply the body with energy. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. Specific amylase [[protein]]s are designated by different Greek letters.

By acting at random locations along the starch chain, \u03b1-amylase breaks down long-chain [[saccharides]], ultimately yielding either [[maltotriose]] and [[maltose]] from [[amylose]], or maltose, [[glucose]] and [[dextrin|\"limit dextrin\"]] from [[amylopectin]]. They belong to [[glycoside hydrolase family 13]].\n\nBecause it can act anywhere on the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], \u03b1-amylase tends to be faster-acting than \u03b2-amylase.  In [[animal]]s, it is a major [[digestion|digestive]] enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7\u20137.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/introbiochem/effectspH.html|title=Effects of pH (Introduction to Enzymes)|work=worthington-biochem.com|access-date=17 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn human physiology, both the salivary and pancreatic amylases are \u03b1-amylases.\n\nThe \u03b1-amylase form is also found in plants, fungi ([[ascomycetes]] and [[basidiomycetes]]) and bacteria (''[[Bacillus]]'').\n\n===\u03b2-Amylase===\nAnother form of amylase, [[\u03b2-amylase]] ({{EC number|3.2.1.2 }}) (alternative names: 1,4-\u03b1-<small>D</small>-glucan maltohydrolase; glycogenase; saccharogen amylase) is also synthesized by [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[plant]]s.  Working from the non-reducing end, \u03b2-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the second \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond, cleaving off two glucose units ([[maltose]]) at a time.  During the [[ripening]] of [[fruit]], \u03b2-amylase breaks starch into maltose, resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit. They belong to [[glycoside hydrolase family 14]].\n\nBoth \u03b1-amylase and \u03b2-amylase are present in seeds; \u03b2-amylase is present in an inactive form prior to [[germination]], whereas \u03b1-amylase and proteases appear once germination has begun.

The \u03b3-amylase has most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3. They belong to a variety of different GH families, such as [[glycoside hydrolase family 15]] in fungi, [[glycoside hydrolase family 31]] of human [[Maltase-glucoamylase|MGAM]], and [[glycoside hydrolase family 97]] of bacterial forms.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Fermentation===\n\u03b1- and \u03b2-amylases are important in [[brewing]] beer and liquor made from sugars derived from [[starch]].  In [[fermentation]], [[yeast]] ingests sugars and excretes [[ethanol]].  In beer and some liquors, the sugars present at the beginning of fermentation have been produced by \"mashing\" grains or other starch sources (such as [[potato]]es).  In traditional beer brewing, [[malted barley]] is mixed with hot water to create a \"[[Mash (beer)|mash]]\", which is held at a given temperature to allow the amylases in the malted grain to convert the barley's starch into sugars.  Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars.  In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, [[mouthfeel]], aroma, and flavor of the finished beer.\n\nIn some historic methods of producing alcoholic beverages, the conversion of starch to sugar starts with the brewer chewing grain to mix it with saliva.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chew It Up, Spit It Out, Then Brew.

[[Yeast]] then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread.

Populations known to rely more on saccharides have a higher number of AMY1 copies than human populations that, by comparison, consume little starch.

Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars.  In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, [[mouthfeel]], aroma, and flavor of the finished beer.\n\nIn some historic methods of producing alcoholic beverages, the conversion of starch to sugar starts with the brewer chewing grain to mix it with saliva.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chew It Up, Spit It Out, Then Brew.

Large polymers such as starch are partially hydrolyzed in the mouth by the enzyme amylase before being cleaved further into sugars. Many mammals have seen great expansions in the copy number of the amylase gene. These duplications allow for the pancreatic amylase ''AMY2'' to re-target to the salivary glands, allowing animals to detect starch by taste and to digest starch more efficiently and in higher quantities. This has happened independently in mice, rats, dogs, pigs, and most importantly, humans after the agricultural revolution.<ref name=Pajic2019>{{cite journal |last1=Pajic |first1=Petar |last2=Pavlidis |first2=Pavlos |last3=Dean |first3=Kirsten |last4=Neznanova |first4=Lubov |last5=Romano |first5=Rose-Anne |last6=Garneau |first6=Danielle |last7=Daugherity |first7=Erin |last8=Globig |first8=Anja |last9=Ruhl |first9=Stefan |last10=Gokcumen |first10=Omer |title=Independent amylase gene copy number bursts correlate with dietary preferences in mammals |journal=eLife |date=14 May 2019 |volume=8 |doi=10.7554/eLife.44628 |pmid=31084707 |doi-access=free |lay-url=https://elifesciences.org/articles/47523}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[First agricultural revolution|agricultural revolution]] 12,000 years ago, human diet began to shift more to plant and animal [[domestication]] in place of [[Hunter-gatherer|gathering and hunting]].

One event allowed it to evolve salivary specificity, leading to the production of amylase in the saliva (named in humans as ''AMY1'').

Populations known to rely more on saccharides have a higher number of AMY1 copies than human populations that, by comparison, consume little starch. The number of ''AMY1'' gene copies in humans can range from six copies in agricultural groups such as European-American and Japanese (two high starch populations) to only 2\u20133 copies in hunter-gatherer societies such as the [[Aka people|Biaka]], [[Datog]], and [[Yakuts]].<ref name=Perry2007/>\n\nThe correlation that exists between starch consumption and number of ''AMY1'' copies specific to population suggest that more AMY1 copies in high starch populations has been selected for by natural selection and considered the favorable phenotype for those individuals.

This offers strong evidence that natural selection has acted on this gene as opposed to the possibility that the gene has spread through genetic drift.<ref name=Perry2007/>\n\nVariations of amylase copy number in dogs mirrors that of human populations, suggesting they acquired the extra copies as they followed humans around.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arendt |first1=M |last2=Cairns |first2=K M |last3=Ballard |first3=J W O |last4=Savolainen |first4=P |last5=Axelsson |first5=E |title=Diet adaptation in dog reflects spread of prehistoric agriculture |journal=Heredity |date=13 July 2016 |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=301\u2013306 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2016.48 |pmid=27406651|doi-access=free }}</ref> Unlike humans whose amylase levels depend on starch content in diet, wild animals eating a broad range of foods tend to have more copies of amylase.

The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids. Additionally, the interaction between glutamine and sodium cation may have given rise to [[sodium glutamate]] (MSG), which can further contribute to the umami flavor.   Basic tastes can also be attributed to amino acid groups arranged in specific sequence. In soy sauce, it was found that \"amino acids were grouped as MSG-like (monosodium glutamate-like) (Asp+Glu), sweet (Ala+Gly+Ser+Thr), bitter (Arg+His+Ile+Leu+Met+Phe+Trp+Try+Val), and tasteless (Cys+Lys+Pro)\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tseng|first1=Yu-Hsiu|last2=Lee|first2=Yu-Ling|last3=Li|first3=Ruei-Chian|last4=Mau|first4=Jeng-Leun|title=Non-volatile flavour components of Ganoderma tsugae|journal=Food Chemistry|date=May 2005|volume=90|issue=3|pages=409\u2013415|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2004.03.054}}</ref>\n\nDespite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product ''per se'' does not present a strong aroma.

The term ''kecap'' is also used to describe other non-soy-based sauces, such as ''kecap ikan'' ([[fish sauce]]) and ''kecap Inggris'' ([[worcestershire sauce]]; lit. \"English sauce\", due to Worcestershire sauce originating in England). Three common varieties of soy-based ''kecap'' exist in [[Indonesian cuisine]], used either as ingredients or [[condiment]]s:\n\n* ''Kecap manis'' : Sweetened soy sauce, which has a thick syrupy consistency and a unique, pronounced, sweet somewhat [[molasses|treacle]]-like flavor due to generous addition of [[palm sugar]]. Regular soy with brown sugar and a trace of molasses added can substitute. It is by far, the most popular type of soy sauce employed in [[Indonesian cuisine]], accounts for an estimated 90 percent of the nation's total soy sauce production.<ref name=\"Soyinfo\">{{cite book | title = History of Soybeans and Soyfoods in Southeast Asia (13th Century To 2010): Extensively Annotated Bibliography and Sourcebook | author1= William Shurtleff| author2= Akiko Aoyagi | publisher = Soyinfo Center | year = 2010 |isbn = 9781928914303 |url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wUWmc4Tr-WUC | page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wUWmc4Tr-WUC/page/n536 537] | accessdate = 15 February 2016}}</ref> ''Kecap manis'' is an important sauce in Indonesian signature dishes, such as ''[[nasi goreng]]'', ''[[mie goreng]]'', [[satay]], ''[[tongseng]]'' and ''[[Semur (Indonesian stew)|semur]]''. ''Sambal kecap'' for example is type of ''[[sambal]]'' dipping sauce of kecap manis with sliced chili, tomato and shallot, a popular dipping sauce for ''sate kambing'' (goat meat satay) and ''ikan bakar'' (grilled fish/seafood). Since soy sauce is of Chinese origin, ''kecap asin'' is also an important seasoning in [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]].\n* ''Kecap manis sedang'' : Medium sweet soy sauce, which has a less thick consistency, is less sweet and has a saltier taste than ''kecap manis''.\n* ''Kecap asin'' : Regular soy sauce derived from the Japanese ''shoyu'', but are usually more concentrated, thicker, darker color and stronger flavor; it can be replaced by Chinese light soy sauce in some recipes. Salty soy sauce was first introduced into Indonesia by [[Hokkien people]] so its taste resembles that of Chinese soy sauce. [[Hakka]] soy sauce made from black beans is very salty and large productions are mainly made in [[Bangka Island]].\n\n=== Japanese ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sushi]]. -->\n[[File:Soy sauce in supermarket.JPG|thumb|Japanese supermarket soy sauce corner]]\n\n''Sh\u014dyu'' is traditionally divided into five main categories depending on differences in their ingredients and method of production. Most, but not all Japanese soy sauces include wheat as a primary ingredient, which tends to give them a slightly sweeter taste than their Chinese counterparts. They also tend towards an alcoholic [[sherry]]-like flavor, sometimes enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alcohol as a natural [[preservative]]. The widely varying flavors of these soy sauces are not always interchangeable, some recipes only call for one type or the other, much as a white wine cannot replace a red's flavor or beef stock does not make the same results as [[Fish stock (food)|fish stock]].\n\nSome soy sauces made in the Japanese way or styled after them contain about 50% wheat.\n\n==== Varieties ====\n\n* ''Koikuchi'' (\u6fc3\u53e3, \"thick taste\"): Originating in the [[Kant\u014d region]], its usage eventually spread all over Japan. Over 80% of the Japanese domestic soy sauce production is of ''koikuchi'', and can be considered the typical Japanese soy sauce. It is made from roughly equal quantities of soybean and wheat.<ref name=\":25\"/><ref name=\":13\"/> This variety is also called ''kij\u014dyu'' (\u751f\u91a4\u6cb9) or ''namash\u014dyu'' (\u751f\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3086) when it is not [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]].\n* ''Usukuchi'' (\u8584\u53e3, \"thin taste\"): Almost 14% of soy sauce production is Usukuchi shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" /> It is particularly popular in the [[Kansai]] region of Japan. It matures for less time than koichuchi shoyu<ref name=\":13\" /> and is both saltier and lighter in color than ''koikuchi''. The lighter color arises from the use of ''[[amazake]]'', a sweet liquid made from fermented rice, that is used in its production. It is commonly used in cooking as it does not alter the color and taste of the ingredients.<ref name=\":25\" />\n* ''Tamari'' (\u305f\u307e\u308a): Made mainly in the [[Ch\u016bbu region]] of Japan, ''tamari'' is darker in appearance and richer in flavor than ''koikuchi''. It contains little or no wheat. Wheat-free ''tamari'' can be used by people with [[gluten intolerance]]. Tamari is more viscous than koikuchi shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" /> 1.5% of soy sauce produced in Japan is tamari shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" /> It is the \"original\" Japanese soy sauce, as its recipe is closest to the soy sauce originally introduced to Japan from China. Technically, this variety is known as ''miso-damari'' (\u5473\u564c\u6e9c\u308a), as this is the liquid that runs off [[miso]] as it [[Aging barrel|matures]]. The Japanese word ''tamari'' is derived from the verb ''tamaru'' (\u6e9c\u308b) that signifies \"to accumulate\", referring to the fact that ''tamari'' was traditionally a liquid byproduct made during the fermentation of [[miso]] (type of seasoning). Japan is the leading producer of ''tamari''.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> Tamari shoyu is often used for sashimi.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":25\" /> Oftentimes, other varieties of soy sauce for sashimi are inaccurately referred to as tamari shoyu.<ref name=\":13\" /> The back label in Japan, by law, will clarify whether or not it is actually tamari.<ref name=\":13\" />\n* ''Shiro'' (\u767d, \"white\"): In contrast to ''tamari'' soy sauce, ''shiro'' soy sauce uses mostly wheat and very little soybean, lending it a light appearance and sweet taste. It is more commonly used in the Kansai region to highlight the appearances of food, for example [[sashimi]]. Shiro shoyu used to be used a lot in high class cookery and is not available abroad.<ref name=\":13\" /> Its main use is for pickles.<ref name=\":25\" /> 0.7% of soy sauce production in Japan is shiro shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" />\n* ''Saishikomi'' (\u518d\u4ed5\u8fbc, \"twice-brewed\") : This variety substitutes previously made ''koikuchi'' for the brine normally used in the process.

This type is also known as ''kanro sh\u014dyu'' (\u7518\u9732\u91a4\u6cb9) or \"sweet soy sauce\". 0.8% of soy sauce production in Japan is saishikomi shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" />\n* Kanro shoyu is a variety of soy sauce made exclusively in Yanai, a city in Yamaguchi Prefecture.<ref name=\":13\" /> It is handmade and is less salty and less sweet than saishikomi shoyu.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nNewer varieties of Japanese soy sauce include:<ref name=\"Steinkraus\">{{cite book |title=Industrialization of indigenous fermented foods |editor-first=Keith H. |editor-last=Steinkraus |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WfjPq9dfTuMC&pg=PA22&dq=genen+usujio&q=genen%20usujio |page=22|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8247-4784-8|publisher=Marcel Dekker |edition= Second}}</ref>\n\n* {{nihongo|''Gen'en''|{{linktext|\u6e1b|\u5869}}||\"reduced salt\"}}: This version contains 50% less salt than regular soy sauce for consumers concerned about heart disease.\n* {{nihongo|''Usujio''|{{linktext|\u8584|\u5869}}||\"light salt\"}}: This version contains 20% less salt than regular soy sauce.\n\nAll of these varieties are sold in three different grades according to how they were made:\n\n* {{nihongo|''Honj\u014dz\u014d''|\u672c\u91b8\u9020||\"genuine fermented\"}}: Contains 100% genuine fermented product\n* {{nihongo|''Kong\u014d-j\u014dz\u014d''|\u6df7\u5408\u91b8\u9020||\"mixed fermented\"}}: Contains genuine fermented sh\u014dyu mash mixed with 30\u201350% of chemical or [[enzymatic]] hydrolysate of plant protein\n* {{nihongo|''Kong\u014d''|\u6df7\u5408||\"mixed\"}}: Contains ''Honj\u014dz\u014d'' or ''Kong\u014d-j\u014dz\u014d'' ''sh\u014dyu'' mixed with 30\u201350% of chemical or enzymatic hydrolysate of plant protein\n\nAll the varieties and grades may be sold according to three official levels of quality:<ref>{{cite book|title=Microbiology of fermented foods |editor-first=Brian J.

The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids. Additionally, the interaction between glutamine and sodium cation may have given rise to [[sodium glutamate]] (MSG), which can further contribute to the umami flavor.   Basic tastes can also be attributed to amino acid groups arranged in specific sequence. In soy sauce, it was found that \"amino acids were grouped as MSG-like (monosodium glutamate-like) (Asp+Glu), sweet (Ala+Gly+Ser+Thr), bitter (Arg+His+Ile+Leu+Met+Phe+Trp+Try+Val), and tasteless (Cys+Lys+Pro)\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tseng|first1=Yu-Hsiu|last2=Lee|first2=Yu-Ling|last3=Li|first3=Ruei-Chian|last4=Mau|first4=Jeng-Leun|title=Non-volatile flavour components of Ganoderma tsugae|journal=Food Chemistry|date=May 2005|volume=90|issue=3|pages=409\u2013415|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2004.03.054}}</ref>\n\nDespite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product ''per se'' does not present a strong aroma.

They also tend towards an alcoholic [[sherry]]-like flavor, sometimes enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alcohol as a natural [[preservative]]. The widely varying flavors of these soy sauces are not always interchangeable, some recipes only call for one type or the other, much as a white wine cannot replace a red's flavor or beef stock does not make the same results as [[Fish stock (food)|fish stock]].\n\nSome soy sauces made in the Japanese way or styled after them contain about 50% wheat.\n\n==== Varieties ====\n\n* ''Koikuchi'' (\u6fc3\u53e3, \"thick taste\"): Originating in the [[Kant\u014d region]], its usage eventually spread all over Japan. Over 80% of the Japanese domestic soy sauce production is of ''koikuchi'', and can be considered the typical Japanese soy sauce. It is made from roughly equal quantities of soybean and wheat.<ref name=\":25\"/><ref name=\":13\"/> This variety is also called ''kij\u014dyu'' (\u751f\u91a4\u6cb9) or ''namash\u014dyu'' (\u751f\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3086) when it is not [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]].\n* ''Usukuchi'' (\u8584\u53e3, \"thin taste\"): Almost 14% of soy sauce production is Usukuchi shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" /> It is particularly popular in the [[Kansai]] region of Japan. It matures for less time than koichuchi shoyu<ref name=\":13\" /> and is both saltier and lighter in color than ''koikuchi''. The lighter color arises from the use of ''[[amazake]]'', a sweet liquid made from fermented rice, that is used in its production. It is commonly used in cooking as it does not alter the color and taste of the ingredients.<ref name=\":25\" />\n* ''Tamari'' (\u305f\u307e\u308a): Made mainly in the [[Ch\u016bbu region]] of Japan, ''tamari'' is darker in appearance and richer in flavor than ''koikuchi''.

Tamari is more viscous than koikuchi shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" /> 1.5% of soy sauce produced in Japan is tamari shoyu.<ref name=\":25\" /> It is the \"original\" Japanese soy sauce, as its recipe is closest to the soy sauce originally introduced to Japan from China. Technically, this variety is known as ''miso-damari'' (\u5473\u564c\u6e9c\u308a), as this is the liquid that runs off [[miso]] as it [[Aging barrel|matures]]. The Japanese word ''tamari'' is derived from the verb ''tamaru'' (\u6e9c\u308b) that signifies \"to accumulate\", referring to the fact that ''tamari'' was traditionally a liquid byproduct made during the fermentation of [[miso]] (type of seasoning).

The category, called ''[[sugar confectionery]]'', encompasses any sweet confection, including [[chocolate]], [[chewing gum]], and [[sugar candy]]. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be ''[[Candied fruit|candied]]''.\n\nPhysically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or [[sugar substitutes]].  Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces.  However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food.  Unlike sweet pastries served for a [[dessert]] course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals.  Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert.

In the Middle Ages candy appeared on the tables of only the most wealthy at first. At that time, it began as a combination of spices and sugar that was used as an aid to digestive problems. Digestive problems were very common during this time due to the constant consumption of food that was neither fresh nor well balanced. Banquet hosts would typically serve these types of 'candies' at banquets for their guests. One of these candies, sometimes called ''chamber spice'', was made with [[cloves]], ginger, [[aniseed]], [[juniper berries]], almonds and [[pine kernels]] dipped in melted sugar.<ref name=\"History of Food\" />\n\nThe [[Middle English]] word ''candy'' began to be used in the late 13th century.<ref name=\"OED-candy\">{{OEtymD|candy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sugarcane: Saccharum Officinarum |publisher=USAID, Govt of United States |year=2006 |page=1 (Chapter 7) |url=http://www1.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag&environ/Sugarcane.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106015828/http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag%26environ/Sugarcane.pdf |archivedate=November 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe first candy came to America in the early 18th century from Britain and France. Only a few of the early colonists were proficient in sugar work and sugary treats were generally only enjoyed by the very wealthy.

The new market was not only for the enjoyment of the rich but also for the pleasure of the working class. There was also an increasing market for children. While some fine confectioners remained, the [[candy store]] became a staple of the child of the [[Working class in the United States|American working class]]. Penny candies epitomized this transformation of candy. [[Penny candy]] became the first material good that children spent their own money on. For this reason, candy store-owners relied almost entirely on the business of children to keep them running. Even penny candies were directly descended from medicated lozenges that held bitter medicine in a hard sugar coating.<ref name=\"Refined Tastes\">{{cite book|last=Woloson|first=Wendy|title=Refined Tastes|year=2002|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}</ref>\n\nIn 1847, the invention of the [[candy press]] (also known as a toy machine) made it possible to produce multiple shapes and sizes of candy at once. In 1851, confectioners began to use a revolving steam pan to assist in boiling sugar. This transformation meant that the candy maker was no longer required to continuously stir the boiling sugar. The heat from the surface of the pan was also much more evenly distributed and made it less likely the sugar would burn. These innovations made it possible for only one or two people to successfully run a candy business.<ref name=Encyclopedia />\n\n[[File:Our Mutual Friend by Joseph Keppler 1885 Puck 2017011.tif|thumb |right|''Our Mutual Friend'', January 7, 1885, satirical cartoon by [[Joseph Keppler]], warning of the dangers of color additives used in candy.]]\nAs the path from producer to market became increasingly complicated, many foods were affected by [[adulteration]] and the addition of [[Food additive|additives]] which ranged from relatively harmless ingredients, such as cheap [[Corn starch|cornstarch]] and [[corn syrup]], to poisonous ones.  Some manufacturers produced bright colors in candy by the addition of hazardous substances for which there was no legal regulation: green ([[chromium oxide]] and [[copper acetate]]), red ([[lead oxide]] and [[mercury sulfide]]), yellow ([[lead chromate]]) and  white ([[chalk]], [[arsenic trioxide]]).<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nIn an 1885 cover cartoon for ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', [[Joseph Keppler]] satirized the dangers of additives in candy by depicting the \"mutual friendship\" between striped candy, doctors, and [[Sexton (office)|gravediggers]].

[[Hot chocolate]] or other cocoa-based drinks are excluded, as is candy made from [[white chocolate]].  However, when chocolate is treated as a separate branch, it also includes confections whose classification is otherwise difficult, being neither exactly candies nor exactly baked goods, like chocolate-dipped foods, tarts with chocolate shells, and chocolate-coated cookies.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Comparison of chocolate types\">\nFile:Chocolat Bonnat. 100%.jpg|Unsweetened [[baking chocolate]] contains no sugar.\nFile:Bar of Guittard chocolate.jpg|Bittersweet or [[dark chocolate]] contains some sugar.\nFile:Milk_chocolate.jpg|[[Milk chocolate]] contains milk and lower levels of [[cocoa solids]].\nFile:WeisseLuftschokolade.jpg|Because [[white chocolate]] contains no cocoa solids, it is classified as [[sugar confectionery]] instead of chocolate.\nFile: Couverture chocolate and compund chocolate.jpg|[[Compound chocolate]] is used in place of pure chocolate to reduce costs.\nFile:300x300 choc rose cake.jpg|These flowers were made from [[modeling chocolate]].\n</gallery>\n\nSugar candies can be classified into noncrystalline and crystalline types. Noncrystalline candies are homogeneous and may be chewy or hard; they include hard candies, caramels, toffees, and nougats. Crystalline candies incorporate small crystals in their structure, are creamy that melt in the mouth or are easily chewed; they include fondant and fudge.<ref name=\"potter1999\">Norman Potter and Joseph Hotchkiss (1999), Food Science: Fifth Edition, {{ISBN|978-0834212657}}, Springer, Chapter 20</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{Main|Candy making}}\n\n[[File: Batasha sweets.jpg|thumb|''Batasha'' are one of the many traditional candies found in South Asia. Flavored varieties include nuts and mint|alt=White disk-shaped candies]]\n\n[[Sugar candy]] is made by dissolving sugar in water or milk to form a [[syrup]], which is boiled until it reaches the desired concentration or starts to [[Caramelization|caramelize]]. Candy comes in a wide variety of textures, from soft and chewy to hard and brittle. The texture of candy depends on the ingredients and the temperatures that the candy is processed at.\n\n{{anchor|Sugar stages}}The final texture of sugar candy depends primarily on the sugar concentration. As the syrup is heated, it boils, water evaporates, the sugar concentration increases and the [[boiling point]] rises. A given temperature corresponds to a particular sugar concentration.  These are called [[sugar stage]]s.  In general, higher temperatures and greater sugar concentrations result in hard, brittle candies, and lower temperatures result in softer candies.<ref>[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/sugar-stages.html The Cold Water Candy Test], Exploratorium; [http://www.baking911.com/candy/chart.htm Sugar Syrup Chart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128103614/http://www.baking911.com/candy/chart.htm# |date=2007-01-28 }} at Baking911</ref>  Once the syrup reaches {{convert|171|\u00b0C}} or higher, the sucrose molecules break down into many simpler sugars, creating an [[amber]]-colored substance known as [[caramel]]. This should not be confused with [[caramel candy]], although it is the candy's main flavoring.\n\n[[File:Liquorice.jpg|thumb|''[[Liquorice (confectionery)|Liquorice]]'' is a candy flavored with the extract of the roots of the [[Glycyrrhiza glabra|liquorice plant]].  It is popular in [[Finland]].|alt=A booth selling candy|left]]\n\nMost candies are made commercially.  The industry relies significantly on [[trade secret]] protection, because candy recipes cannot be copyrighted or patented effectively, but are very difficult to duplicate exactly.

Wholesale Candy Store. Retrieved on November 2, 2011.</ref>\n\n===Purposes of packaging===\nPackaging preserves aroma and flavor and eases shipping and dispensation. [[Wax paper]] seals against air, moisture, dust, and germs, while [[cellophane]] is valued by packagers for its transparency and resistance to grease, odors and moisture. In addition, it is often resealable. [[Polyethylene]] is another form of film sealed with heat, and this material is often used to make bags in bulk packaging. Plastic wraps are also common. Aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight, non-toxic and odor proof. Vegetable parchment lines boxes of high-quality confections like gourmet chocolates. [[Cardboard (paper product)|Cardboard]] cartons are less common, though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil.\n\nPackages are often sealed with a starch-based adhesive derived from tapioca, potato, wheat, sago, or sweet potato. Occasionally, glues are made from the bones and skin of cattle and hogs for a stronger and more flexible product, but this is not as common because of the expense.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Trends in Food Packaging Technology|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=October 1953|volume=1|issue=16|pages=978\u2013986|doi=10.1021/jf60016a002}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nPrior to the 1900s, candy was commonly sold unwrapped from carts in the street, where it was exposed to dirt and insects. By 1914, there were some machines to wrap [[Chewing gum|gum]] and stick candies, but this was not the common practice. After the [[polio]] outbreak in 1916, unwrapped candies garnered widespread censure because of the dirt and germs. At the time, only upscale candy stores used [[glass]] jars. With advancements in technology, wax paper was adopted, and foil and cellophane were imported to the U.S. from [[France]] by [[DuPont]] in 1925. [[Necco]] packagers were one of the first companies to package without human touch.<ref name=\"Kawash 2012\">{{cite journal|last=Kawash|first=Samira|title=The Candy Prophylactic: Danger, Disease, and Children's Candy around 1916|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=September 2012|volume=33|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nCandy packaging played a role in its adoption as the most popular treat given away during [[trick-or-treating]] for [[Halloween]] in the US.  In the 1940s, most treats were homemade.  During the 1950s, small, individually wrapped candies were recognized as convenient and inexpensive.  By the 1970s, after widely publicized but largely false stories of [[poisoned candy myths]] circulating in the popular press, factory-sealed packaging with a recognizable name brand on it became a sign of safety.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber & Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|pages = 271\u2013276}}</ref>\n\n===Marketing and design===\nPackaging helps market the product as well. Manufacturers know that candy must be hygienic and attractive to customers. In the children's market quantity, novelty, large size and bright colors are the top sellers.<ref name=\"Kawash 2012\"/> Many companies redesign the packaging to maintain consumer appeal.\n\n==Shelf life==\nBecause of its high sugar concentration, bacteria are not usually able to grow in candy. As a result, the [[shelf life]] is longer for candy than for many other foods. Most candies can be safely stored in their original packaging at [[room temperature]] in a dry, dark cupboard for months or years. As a rule, the softer the candy or the damper the storage area, the sooner it goes stale.<ref name=Candycrate />\n\nShelf life considerations with most candies are focused on appearance, taste, and texture, rather than about the potential for [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]; that is, old candy may not look appealing or taste very good, even though it is very unlikely to make the eater sick. Candy can be made [[food safety|unsafe]] by storing it badly, such as in a wet, [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]y area. Typical recommendations are these:<ref name=Candycrate>[http://www.candycrate.com/shelf-life-of-candy.html The Shelf Life of Candy] from The Candy Crate</ref>\n* [[Hard candy]] may last indefinitely in good storage conditions.\n*[[Dark chocolate]] lasts up to two years.\n*[[Milk chocolate]]s and caramels usually become stale after about one year.\n* Soft or creamy candies, like [[candy corn]], may last 8 to 10 months in ideal conditions.\n* [[Chewing gum]] and gumballs may stay fresh as long as 8 months after manufacture.\n\n==Nutrition==\n[[File:Caramels.jpg|thumb|right|Caramels, candy made from butter, milk and sugar, have little nutritional value.]]\nMost sugar candies are defined in US law as a food of [[minimal nutritional value]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/foods-minimal-nutritional-value|title=Foods of Minimal Nutritional Value|last=|first=|date=13 September 2013|website=www.fns.usda.gov|series=Appendix B of 7 CFR Part 210|publisher=[[Food and Nutrition Service]], United States Department of Agriculture|language=en|access-date=2017-08-04}}</ref>\n\nEven in a culture that eats sweets frequently, candy is not a significant source of nutrition or food energy for most people.

At the start of the 20th century, when [[undernutrition]] was a serious problem, especially among poor and working-class people, and when nutrition science was a new field, the high calorie content was promoted as a virtue.  Researchers suggested that candy, especially candy made with milk and nuts, was a low-cost alternative to normal meals.  To get the food energy necessary for a day of labor, candy might cost half as much as eggs.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber & Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|page = 98}}</ref>  During the 1920s and 1930s, candy bars selling for five cents were often marketed as replacements for lunch.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber & Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|pages = 310\u2013318}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1904 World Fair, the Quaker Oats Company made a candy-coated puffed cereal, a wheat-based product similar to [[Cracker Jack]]'s candy-coated popcorn.

[[Post Foods]] introduced their own version in 1948, originally called [[Happy Jax]] and later [[Sugar Crisp]].  They marketed it as both a replacement for unsweetened breakfast cereals and also for eating as a snack or as candy, using three animated cartoon bears as the mascots:  Candy, Handy, and Dandy.  The early slogans said, \"As a cereal it's dandy\u2014for snacks it's so handy\u2014or eat it like candy!\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g_5DAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA287|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2013-10-15|isbn = 9780865477568|first = Samira|last = Kawash|pages = 287\u2013289 and color plate #15}}</ref>\n\nIn more recent times, a variety of [[snack bar (food)|snack bars]] have been marketed.  These include bars that are intended as [[meal replacement]]s as well as snack bars that are marketed as having nutritional advantages when compared to candy bars, such as [[granola bars]].  However, the actual nutritional value is often not very different from candy bars, except for usually a higher sodium content, and the flavors (most popularly, chocolate, fudge, and caramel) and the presentation mimic candy bars.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[File:Sesame Seed Ball (Candy).jpg|thumb|Sesame Seed Ball (Candy)]]\n\nAmong the [[Bengali people]], candy may be eaten for an entire meal, especially during festivals.

The category, called ''[[sugar confectionery]]'', encompasses any sweet confection, including [[chocolate]], [[chewing gum]], and [[sugar candy]].

Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces.  However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food.  Unlike sweet pastries served for a [[dessert]] course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals.

In the Middle Ages candy appeared on the tables of only the most wealthy at first. At that time, it began as a combination of spices and sugar that was used as an aid to digestive problems. Digestive problems were very common during this time due to the constant consumption of food that was neither fresh nor well balanced. Banquet hosts would typically serve these types of 'candies' at banquets for their guests. One of these candies, sometimes called ''chamber spice'', was made with [[cloves]], ginger, [[aniseed]], [[juniper berries]], almonds and [[pine kernels]] dipped in melted sugar.<ref name=\"History of Food\" />\n\nThe [[Middle English]] word ''candy'' began to be used in the late 13th century.<ref name=\"OED-candy\">{{OEtymD|candy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sugarcane: Saccharum Officinarum |publisher=USAID, Govt of United States |year=2006 |page=1 (Chapter 7) |url=http://www1.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag&environ/Sugarcane.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106015828/http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag%26environ/Sugarcane.pdf |archivedate=November 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe first candy came to America in the early 18th century from Britain and France.

The new market was not only for the enjoyment of the rich but also for the pleasure of the working class. There was also an increasing market for children. While some fine confectioners remained, the [[candy store]] became a staple of the child of the [[Working class in the United States|American working class]]. Penny candies epitomized this transformation of candy. [[Penny candy]] became the first material good that children spent their own money on. For this reason, candy store-owners relied almost entirely on the business of children to keep them running. Even penny candies were directly descended from medicated lozenges that held bitter medicine in a hard sugar coating.<ref name=\"Refined Tastes\">{{cite book|last=Woloson|first=Wendy|title=Refined Tastes|year=2002|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}</ref>\n\nIn 1847, the invention of the [[candy press]] (also known as a toy machine) made it possible to produce multiple shapes and sizes of candy at once. In 1851, confectioners began to use a revolving steam pan to assist in boiling sugar. This transformation meant that the candy maker was no longer required to continuously stir the boiling sugar. The heat from the surface of the pan was also much more evenly distributed and made it less likely the sugar would burn. These innovations made it possible for only one or two people to successfully run a candy business.<ref name=Encyclopedia />\n\n[[File:Our Mutual Friend by Joseph Keppler 1885 Puck 2017011.tif|thumb |right|''Our Mutual Friend'', January 7, 1885, satirical cartoon by [[Joseph Keppler]], warning of the dangers of color additives used in candy.]]\nAs the path from producer to market became increasingly complicated, many foods were affected by [[adulteration]] and the addition of [[Food additive|additives]] which ranged from relatively harmless ingredients, such as cheap [[Corn starch|cornstarch]] and [[corn syrup]], to poisonous ones.  Some manufacturers produced bright colors in candy by the addition of hazardous substances for which there was no legal regulation: green ([[chromium oxide]] and [[copper acetate]]), red ([[lead oxide]] and [[mercury sulfide]]), yellow ([[lead chromate]]) and  white ([[chalk]], [[arsenic trioxide]]).<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nIn an 1885 cover cartoon for ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', [[Joseph Keppler]] satirized the dangers of additives in candy by depicting the \"mutual friendship\" between striped candy, doctors, and [[Sexton (office)|gravediggers]].

Candy comes in a wide variety of textures, from soft and chewy to hard and brittle. The texture of candy depends on the ingredients and the temperatures that the candy is processed at.\n\n{{anchor|Sugar stages}}The final texture of sugar candy depends primarily on the sugar concentration. As the syrup is heated, it boils, water evaporates, the sugar concentration increases and the [[boiling point]] rises. A given temperature corresponds to a particular sugar concentration.  These are called [[sugar stage]]s.  In general, higher temperatures and greater sugar concentrations result in hard, brittle candies, and lower temperatures result in softer candies.<ref>[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/sugar-stages.html The Cold Water Candy Test], Exploratorium; [http://www.baking911.com/candy/chart.htm Sugar Syrup Chart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128103614/http://www.baking911.com/candy/chart.htm# |date=2007-01-28 }} at Baking911</ref>  Once the syrup reaches {{convert|171|\u00b0C}} or higher, the sucrose molecules break down into many simpler sugars, creating an [[amber]]-colored substance known as [[caramel]].

Wholesale Candy Store. Retrieved on November 2, 2011.</ref>\n\n===Purposes of packaging===\nPackaging preserves aroma and flavor and eases shipping and dispensation. [[Wax paper]] seals against air, moisture, dust, and germs, while [[cellophane]] is valued by packagers for its transparency and resistance to grease, odors and moisture. In addition, it is often resealable. [[Polyethylene]] is another form of film sealed with heat, and this material is often used to make bags in bulk packaging. Plastic wraps are also common. Aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight, non-toxic and odor proof. Vegetable parchment lines boxes of high-quality confections like gourmet chocolates. [[Cardboard (paper product)|Cardboard]] cartons are less common, though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil.\n\nPackages are often sealed with a starch-based adhesive derived from tapioca, potato, wheat, sago, or sweet potato. Occasionally, glues are made from the bones and skin of cattle and hogs for a stronger and more flexible product, but this is not as common because of the expense.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Trends in Food Packaging Technology|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=October 1953|volume=1|issue=16|pages=978\u2013986|doi=10.1021/jf60016a002}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nPrior to the 1900s, candy was commonly sold unwrapped from carts in the street, where it was exposed to dirt and insects. By 1914, there were some machines to wrap [[Chewing gum|gum]] and stick candies, but this was not the common practice. After the [[polio]] outbreak in 1916, unwrapped candies garnered widespread censure because of the dirt and germs. At the time, only upscale candy stores used [[glass]] jars. With advancements in technology, wax paper was adopted, and foil and cellophane were imported to the U.S. from [[France]] by [[DuPont]] in 1925. [[Necco]] packagers were one of the first companies to package without human touch.<ref name=\"Kawash 2012\">{{cite journal|last=Kawash|first=Samira|title=The Candy Prophylactic: Danger, Disease, and Children's Candy around 1916|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=September 2012|volume=33|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nCandy packaging played a role in its adoption as the most popular treat given away during [[trick-or-treating]] for [[Halloween]] in the US.  In the 1940s, most treats were homemade.  During the 1950s, small, individually wrapped candies were recognized as convenient and inexpensive.  By the 1970s, after widely publicized but largely false stories of [[poisoned candy myths]] circulating in the popular press, factory-sealed packaging with a recognizable name brand on it became a sign of safety.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber & Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|pages = 271\u2013276}}</ref>\n\n===Marketing and design===\nPackaging helps market the product as well. Manufacturers know that candy must be hygienic and attractive to customers. In the children's market quantity, novelty, large size and bright colors are the top sellers.<ref name=\"Kawash 2012\"/> Many companies redesign the packaging to maintain consumer appeal.\n\n==Shelf life==\nBecause of its high sugar concentration, bacteria are not usually able to grow in candy. As a result, the [[shelf life]] is longer for candy than for many other foods. Most candies can be safely stored in their original packaging at [[room temperature]] in a dry, dark cupboard for months or years. As a rule, the softer the candy or the damper the storage area, the sooner it goes stale.<ref name=Candycrate />\n\nShelf life considerations with most candies are focused on appearance, taste, and texture, rather than about the potential for [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]; that is, old candy may not look appealing or taste very good, even though it is very unlikely to make the eater sick. Candy can be made [[food safety|unsafe]] by storing it badly, such as in a wet, [[mold]]y area. Typical recommendations are these:<ref name=Candycrate>[http://www.candycrate.com/shelf-life-of-candy.html The Shelf Life of Candy] from The Candy Crate</ref>\n* [[Hard candy]] may last indefinitely in good storage conditions.\n*[[Dark chocolate]] lasts up to two years.\n*[[Milk chocolate]]s and caramels usually become stale after about one year.\n* Soft or creamy candies, like [[candy corn]], may last 8 to 10 months in ideal conditions.\n* [[Chewing gum]] and gumballs may stay fresh as long as 8 months after manufacture.\n\n==Nutrition==\n[[File:Caramels.jpg|thumb|right|Caramels, candy made from butter, milk and sugar, have little nutritional value.]]\nMost sugar candies are defined in US law as a food of [[minimal nutritional value]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/foods-minimal-nutritional-value|title=Foods of Minimal Nutritional Value|last=|first=|date=13 September 2013|website=www.fns.usda.gov|series=Appendix B of 7 CFR Part 210|publisher=[[Food and Nutrition Service]], United States Department of Agriculture|language=en|access-date=2017-08-04}}</ref>\n\nEven in a culture that eats sweets frequently, candy is not a significant source of nutrition or food energy for most people.

At the start of the 20th century, when [[undernutrition]] was a serious problem, especially among poor and working-class people, and when nutrition science was a new field, the high calorie content was promoted as a virtue.  Researchers suggested that candy, especially candy made with milk and nuts, was a low-cost alternative to normal meals.  To get the food energy necessary for a day of labor, candy might cost half as much as eggs.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber & Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|page = 98}}</ref>  During the 1920s and 1930s, candy bars selling for five cents were often marketed as replacements for lunch.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber & Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|pages = 310\u2013318}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1904 World Fair, the Quaker Oats Company made a candy-coated puffed cereal, a wheat-based product similar to [[Cracker Jack]]'s candy-coated popcorn.  The product concept was re-introduced unsuccessfully in 1939 by another business as [[Ranger Joe]], the first pre-sweetened, candy-coated [[breakfast cereal]].  [[Post Foods]] introduced their own version in 1948, originally called [[Happy Jax]] and later [[Sugar Crisp]].  They marketed it as both a replacement for unsweetened breakfast cereals and also for eating as a snack or as candy, using three animated cartoon bears as the mascots:  Candy, Handy, and Dandy.  The early slogans said, \"As a cereal it's dandy\u2014for snacks it's so handy\u2014or eat it like candy!\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g_5DAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA287|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2013-10-15|isbn = 9780865477568|first = Samira|last = Kawash|pages = 287\u2013289 and color plate #15}}</ref>\n\nIn more recent times, a variety of [[snack bar (food)|snack bars]] have been marketed.  These include bars that are intended as [[meal replacement]]s as well as snack bars that are marketed as having nutritional advantages when compared to candy bars, such as [[granola bars]].  However, the actual nutritional value is often not very different from candy bars, except for usually a higher sodium content, and the flavors (most popularly, chocolate, fudge, and caramel) and the presentation mimic candy bars.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[File:Sesame Seed Ball (Candy).jpg|thumb|Sesame Seed Ball (Candy)]]\n\nAmong the [[Bengali people]], candy may be eaten for an entire meal, especially during festivals.
