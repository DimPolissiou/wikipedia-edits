An equal rights meeting led by both illegal and legalized foreign aliens, mostly Latino and Italian, were met with force by the LAPD under the order of [[Frank L. Shaw]]. Rather than disband the rally, the LAPD brutalized them, spilling blood on the streets of Griffin, Mozart, Car, and Baldwin. Thirty-three protesters were injured, nineteen dead, five LAPD officers were recorded wounded, with one dead. While many of the deaths and injuries fell onto the equal rights protesters, there was an unnamed casualty at the time in order to cover the law-breaking of the police force. Sandra Vespucci, an Italian youth living on Baldwin street at the time, was killed by a stray bullet in front of her home. Shortly after the bloodshed, many of the officers involved were forced to resign by Mayor Shaw.\n\n== Battle of Sunset Strip (1947\u20131956) ==\nDuring the early 1930s-early 1940s, during the [[Prohibition Era]], organized crime in Los Angeles as well as [[Las Vegas]] was ruled by Jewish-American east coast mobster [[Benjamin Siegel|Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]] and Italian-American crime boss [[Jack Dragna]], who was boss of the [[Los Angeles crime family]], who succeeded as boss of the family after the disappearance of former Los Angeles crime boss [[Joseph Ardizzone]] in 1931.\n\nAfter Siegel's murder on June 20, 1947, his lieutenant [[Mickey Cohen]] inherited Siegel's rackets, creating his own [[Cohen crime family|crime family]] and a turf war began with [[Jack Dragna]] and the Los Angeles crime family for control of Siegel's former territories and organized crime in Los Angeles in general. The war lasted nine years, with shootouts and violent confrontations occurring on a daily basis on both the [[Sunset Strip]] and [[Hollywood Blvd]], as well as other neighborhoods and regions in Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. Many mobsters were killed during the war, particularly on Cohen's side, as well as many attempts on Cohen's life, including the bombing of Cohen's home in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. Several Mafia families from the Midwest and East Coast backed either Cohen or Dragna. In 1956, Dragna died of a heart attack and ultimately led Cohen to win the war. Mickey Cohen himself would die from stomach cancer in 1976.\n\n== Watts Riots (1965) ==\n{{Main|Watts Riots}}\nThe riots began on August 11, 1965, in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], when Lee Minikus, a [[California Highway Patrol]] motorcycle officer, pulled Marquette Frye over. Minikus believed Frye was intoxicated because of observing his driving which Minikus believed to be erratic. While police questioned Marquette Frye and his brother Ronald Frye, a group of people began to gather. The mob began to throw rocks and other objects and shout at the police officers. A struggle ensued shortly after Frye's mother, Rena, arrived on the scene, resulting in the arrest of all three family members.\n\nAs a result of the riots, 34 people were officially reported killed (28 of those were African American), 1,032 people were injured, and 4,000 people were arrested. Among the dead were a fireman, an L.A. County deputy sheriff and a Long Beach police officer. The injured included 773 civilians, 90 Los Angeles police officers, 136 firefighters, 10 national guardsmen, and 23 persons from other governmental agencies. 118 of those injured were injured by firearms.\n\nSix-hundred buildings were damaged or destroyed, and an estimated $35 million in damage was caused. Most of the physical damage was confined to businesses that were said to have caused resentment in the neighbourhood due to perceived unfairness. Homes were not attacked, although some caught fire due to proximity to other fires.\n\n== The crack epidemic (1984\u20131990) ==\n{{Main|Crack epidemic}}\nCrack cocaine first began to be used on a massive scale in [[Los Angeles]] in 1984.<ref name=CrackDEA85>\"[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] History Book, 1876\u20131990 (drug usage & enforcement), [[US Department of Justice]], 1991, USDoJ.gov webpage: [http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html DoJ-DEA-History-1985-1990] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823024931/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |date=August 23, 2006 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol1/cia_body.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427025121/http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol1/cia_body.html|title=The CIA, Contras, Gangs, and Crack|archivedate=27 April 2008}}</ref> Between February and July 1984 cocaine abuse and related violence had exploded to unprecedented levels in the city, and by 1985, crack was available in most of the major American cities. [[South Central Los Angeles|South Central]], where the crack cocaine problem was the worst in the country, became the site of many police raids. Previously unknown gangs were growing and new ones were emerging. The [[rap music]] genre, TV shows and movies portrayed that part of Los Angeles as a [[no-go area|no-go zone]] and a highly violent area.\n\n== 1992 Riots ==\n{{Main|1992 Los Angeles riots}}\nThe 1992 Los Angeles Riots, also known as the Rodney King uprising or the Rodney King riots, were sparked on April 29, 1992 when a jury acquitted four police officers accused in the videotaped violent and brutal beating of black motorist [[Rodney King]] when he allegedly resisted arrest following a high-speed car chase. Thousands in the Los Angeles area joined in a race riot involving acts of law-breaking, including looting, assault, arson and murder, seeing in King an example of injustice against minorities in the United States. The situation became too difficult to be handled by local police, and the [[California Army National Guard]] as well as [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[U.S. Army|soldiers]] and [[U.S. Marines|Marines]] were called in. About 5 National Guardsmen were injured during the riots. Overall, 63 people died during the riots.\n\n== 1997 North Hollywood shootout ==\n{{Main|North Hollywood shootout}}\nThe 1997 North Hollywood shootout was an armed confrontation between two heavily armed and armored bank robbers, Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr. and Emil M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu, and patrol and SWAT officers of the Los Angeles Police Department in [[North Hollywood]], California on February 28, 1997. It occurred when responding patrol officers engaged Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu leaving the robbed bank. Seventeen officers and civilians were wounded before both robbers were killed. Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu had previously robbed several banks prior to their attempt in North Hollywood and were notorious for their heavy armament, which included automatic rifles.\n\n== C.R.A.S.H. ==\n{{Main|C.R.A.S.H.}}\nCommunity Resources Against Street Hoodlums, usually known as C.R.A.S.H., was a special unit of the Los Angeles Police Department established in the early 1970s to combat the rising problem of gangs in Los Angeles, California. Each of the 18 divisions had a C.R.A.S.H. unit whose primary goal was to suppress the influx of gang-related crimes in Los Angeles that came about primarily due to the increase in narcotics trade. C.R.A.S.H was also used in the popular game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' as an [[antagonist]] organization.\n\n=== Rampart scandal ===\n{{Main|Rampart scandal}}\nThe Rampart scandal refers to widespread corruption in the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (C.R.A.S.H.) anti-gang unit of the LAPD Rampart Division in the late 1990s. More than 70 police officers in the CRASH unit were implicated in misconduct, making it one of the most widespread cases of documented police misconduct in United States history. The convicted offenses include unprovoked shootings, unprovoked beatings, planting of evidence, frameups, stealing and dealing narcotics, bank robbery, perjury, and covering up evidence of these activities.\n\n== The Los Angeles May Day m\u00eal\u00e9e ==\n{{Main|2007 MacArthur Park rallies}}\nOn May 1, 2007, at [[MacArthur Park]], a rally formed to raise awareness of prejudice against, and demands for amnesty for undocumented workers. As the rally continued, police attempted to break up the rally. Most rally participants dispersed peacefully, but some attacked the police with bottles and rocks. The police utilized less-than-lethal weapons and engaged in pushing and kicking in ways that many viewed as excessive.\n\n== South Central L.A. ==\n{{Main|South Los Angeles}}\nSouth Los Angeles, formally known as South Central Los Angeles was once a notoriously dangerous region of the City of Los Angeles which has had an extensive history of gang violence started in the 1920s with white gangs being replaced by [[African American|black]] and [[Hispanic]] gangs for decades. However gang activity and crime has rapidly declined in the entire [[South Los Angeles]] region since the mid 2000s and is continuing to drop to this day, due to current [[redevelopment]] and heavy [[gentrification]].\n\nSouth Central had become a byword for [[urban decay]]; its former bad reputation was spread by numerous movies such as ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'', ''[[South Central (film)|South Central]]'', ''[[Menace II Society]]'', ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'', ''[[Tales from the Hood]]'', ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', ''[[Thicker Than Water (1999 film)|Thicker Than Water]]'', ''[[Training Day]]'' and in particular, South Central native John Singleton's ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. Even more recent films such as ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'', ''[[Harsh Times]]'', ''[[Dirty (film)|Dirty]]'', ''[[Gridiron Gang]]'', ''[[Waist Deep]]'', ''[[Belly 2: Millionaire Boyz Club]]'', ''[[Street Kings]]'' and ''[[End of Watch]]'', including drama series such as ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'', ''[[Law & Order: LA]]'' and ''[[The Closer]]'' had continued the poor image. Those images of South Central; along with [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Compton, California|Compton]], and even [[Watts, California|Watts]]; had been portrayed in [[West Coast Hip-Hop|West Coast]] [[Gangsta Rap]] and [[G-Funk]] songs,  as well as in video games such as ''[[Call of Juarez: The Cartel]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''.\n\n=== Crips and Bloods feud ===\nAfter the [[FBI]] cracked down on black political organizations in the late 1960s, a social vacuum formed among black adolescents living in former South Central Los Angeles. Into this vacuum came two new gangs: the [[Crips]] and the [[Bloods]]. Conflict immediately arose between the two rival gangs.  In the next 40 years, fighting between the two gangs took more than 15,000 lives to date.<ref name=Peralta>PBS Independent Lens Documentary \"Crips and Bloods\" Made in America, Produced by Baron Davis, Directed by Stacy Peralta and Written by Stacy Peralta and Sam George</ref>  The cause of the feud is best expressed as a \"kill or be killed\" culture described by T. Rodgers of the Black P Stones, as \"You better respect me.  You better fear me.\"  Speaking in a 2007 film documentary, a former Crip, named Pete, who survived to his middle years, said,\n\n:''These wars go farther back than most of these kids been around.  A lot of 'em [are] not sure about why the war was goin' on.  They [simply] STARTED DOIN' WHAT WAS BEIN' DONE. ''<ref name=Peralta />\n\nThe problem began with poverty and segregation, but had worsened with drugs, family separation and parental incarceration. The key to improving things, according to former LA mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, is education.<ref>Interview with Tavis Smiley, aired on PBS on May 18, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Social impact ===\nA 2003 comparison of twin psychological studies by the Lancet and Rand corporations discovered that the average child in [[South Los Angeles]] exhibits greater levels of post-traumatic stress disorder than children of a similar age in war-torn [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].<ref>Marlene Wong, PhD, Sheryl Kataoka, MSHS, Lisa Jaycox, PhD, University of California Los Angeles Center for Research in Managed Care, Cognitive Behavior Intervention for Trauma in Schools, (CBITS) [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9443/index1.html]</ref><ref>Stein, B., Jaycox, L., Kataoka, S., Wong, M., Tu, W., Elliot, M., & Fink, A.

Crimes related to gang violence have generally declined over the mid 2000s however, since 2014, gang-related crime has increased in the west San Fernando Valley by 63% according to Charles Crumpley, publisher and editor of the San Fernando Valley Business Journal.<ref>Crumpley, Charles. \"Since 2014, gang-related crime is up 63 percent in the west San Fernando Valley.\" ''San Fernando Valley Business Journal'', 7 Aug. 2017, p. 38.

Accessed 4 Dec. 2018.</ref> In order to combat the gang violence, the Los Angeles Police Department launched a campaign of gang injunctions across the Valley. [[Gang injunction]] is a variation of a restraining order issued by U.S. courts that prohibits gang members in a certain area from participating in specific activities.\n\n=== Early '90s to Mid 2000s: Gang Injunctions and its Implications ===\nAt the turn of the century, gang-related crime that includes murder, robbery, rape, burglary, aggravated assault, larceny and theft, were a frequent occurrence in the San Fernando Valley. In order to combat the increase in violent crimes, the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division deployed a campaign of gang injunction across the Valley. In April of 1993, the Department embarked on the Blythe Street gang injunction that encompassed sections of the Devonshire and Van Nuys police divisions.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/PACOIMA+GANG+LATEST+TARGETED+FOR+INJUNCTION.-a079079285|title=PACOIMA GANG LATEST TARGETED FOR INJUNCTION.|last=Goldberg|first=Orith|date=October 6, 2001|work=Daily News|access-date=May 31, 2019|location=(Los Angeles)|via=The Free Library}}</ref> Although not made permanent until February of 2000, between 1993 and 2001, there have been a total of 60 arrests; 40 of which were related to a direct violation of the injunction and the rest were indirect arrests due to the discovery of another crime while investigating a violation of the injunction.<ref name=\":02\" /> The gang injunctions in the early 2000s were successful in reducing violent crimes in the San Fernando Valley however, many are convinced that the injunctions against the gangs of the Valley are the reason for the expansion of gang-related crimes in surrounding areas.<ref name=\":12\">Tamaki, J.

An equal rights meeting led by both illegal and legalized foreign aliens, mostly Latino and Italian, were met with force by the LAPD under the order of [[Frank L. Shaw]]. Rather than disband the rally, the LAPD brutalized them, spilling blood on the streets of Griffin, Mozart, Car, and Baldwin. Thirty-three protesters were injured, nineteen dead, five LAPD officers were recorded wounded, with one dead. While many of the deaths and injuries fell onto the equal rights protesters, there was an unnamed casualty at the time in order to cover the law-breaking of the police force. Sandra Vespucci, an Italian youth living on Baldwin street at the time, was killed by a stray bullet in front of her home. Shortly after the bloodshed, many of the officers involved were forced to resign by Mayor Shaw.\n\n== Battle of Sunset Strip (1947\u20131956) ==\nDuring the early 1930s-early 1940s, during the [[Prohibition Era]], organized crime in Los Angeles as well as [[Las Vegas]] was ruled by Jewish-American east coast mobster [[Benjamin Siegel|Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]] and Italian-American crime boss [[Jack Dragna]], who was boss of the [[Los Angeles crime family]], who succeeded as boss of the family after the disappearance of former Los Angeles crime boss [[Joseph Ardizzone]] in 1931.\n\nAfter Siegel's murder on June 20, 1947, his lieutenant [[Mickey Cohen]] inherited Siegel's rackets, creating his own [[Cohen crime family|crime family]] and a turf war began with [[Jack Dragna]] and the Los Angeles crime family for control of Siegel's former territories and organized crime in Los Angeles in general. The war lasted nine years, with shootouts and violent confrontations occurring on a daily basis on both the [[Sunset Strip]] and [[Hollywood Blvd]], as well as other neighborhoods and regions in Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. Many mobsters were killed during the war, particularly on Cohen's side, as well as many attempts on Cohen's life, including the bombing of Cohen's home in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. Several Mafia families from the Midwest and East Coast backed either Cohen or Dragna. In 1956, Dragna died of a heart attack and ultimately led Cohen to win the war. Mickey Cohen himself would die from stomach cancer in 1976.\n\n== Watts Riots (1965) ==\n{{Main|Watts Riots}}\nThe riots began on August 11, 1965, in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], when Lee Minikus, a [[California Highway Patrol]] motorcycle officer, pulled Marquette Frye over. Minikus believed Frye was intoxicated because of observing his driving which Minikus believed to be erratic. While police questioned Marquette Frye and his brother Ronald Frye, a group of people began to gather. The mob began to throw rocks and other objects and shout at the police officers. A struggle ensued shortly after Frye's mother, Rena, arrived on the scene, resulting in the arrest of all three family members.\n\nAs a result of the riots, 34 people were officially reported killed (28 of those were African American), 1,032 people were injured, and 4,000 people were arrested. Among the dead were a fireman, an L.A. County deputy sheriff and a Long Beach police officer. The injured included 773 civilians, 90 Los Angeles police officers, 136 firefighters, 10 national guardsmen, and 23 persons from other governmental agencies. 118 of those injured were injured by firearms.\n\nSix-hundred buildings were damaged or destroyed, and an estimated $35 million in damage was caused. Most of the physical damage was confined to businesses that were said to have caused resentment in the neighbourhood due to perceived unfairness. Homes were not attacked, although some caught fire due to proximity to other fires.\n\n== The crack epidemic (1984\u20131990) ==\n{{Main|Crack epidemic}}\nCrack cocaine first began to be used on a massive scale in [[Los Angeles]] in 1984.<ref name=CrackDEA85>\"[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] History Book, 1876\u20131990 (drug usage & enforcement), [[US Department of Justice]], 1991, USDoJ.gov webpage: [http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html DoJ-DEA-History-1985-1990] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823024931/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |date=August 23, 2006 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol1/cia_body.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427025121/http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol1/cia_body.html|title=The CIA, Contras, Gangs, and Crack|archivedate=27 April 2008}}</ref> Between February and July 1984 cocaine abuse and related violence had exploded to unprecedented levels in the city, and by 1985, crack was available in most of the major American cities. [[South Central Los Angeles|South Central]], where the crack cocaine problem was the worst in the country, became the site of many police raids. Previously unknown gangs were growing and new ones were emerging. The [[rap music]] genre, TV shows and movies portrayed that part of Los Angeles as a [[no-go area|no-go zone]] and a highly violent area.\n\n== 1992 Riots ==\n{{Main|1992 Los Angeles riots}}\nThe 1992 Los Angeles Riots, also known as the Rodney King uprising or the Rodney King riots, were sparked on April 29, 1992 when a jury acquitted four police officers accused in the videotaped violent and brutal beating of black motorist [[Rodney King]] when he allegedly resisted arrest following a high-speed car chase. Thousands in the Los Angeles area joined in a race riot involving acts of law-breaking, including looting, assault, arson and murder, seeing in King an example of injustice against minorities in the United States. The situation became too difficult to be handled by local police, and the [[California Army National Guard]] as well as [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[U.S. Army|soldiers]] and [[U.S. Marines|Marines]] were called in. About 5 National Guardsmen were injured during the riots. Overall, 63 people died during the riots.\n\n== 1997 North Hollywood shootout ==\n{{Main|North Hollywood shootout}}\nThe 1997 North Hollywood shootout was an armed confrontation between two heavily armed and armored bank robbers, Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr. and Emil M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu, and patrol and SWAT officers of the Los Angeles Police Department in [[North Hollywood]], California on February 28, 1997. It occurred when responding patrol officers engaged Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu leaving the robbed bank. Seventeen officers and civilians were wounded before both robbers were killed. Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu had previously robbed several banks prior to their attempt in North Hollywood and were notorious for their heavy armament, which included automatic rifles.\n\n== C.R.A.S.H. ==\n{{Main|C.R.A.S.H.}}\nCommunity Resources Against Street Hoodlums, usually known as C.R.A.S.H., was a special unit of the Los Angeles Police Department established in the early 1970s to combat the rising problem of gangs in Los Angeles, California. Each of the 18 divisions had a C.R.A.S.H. unit whose primary goal was to suppress the influx of gang-related crimes in Los Angeles that came about primarily due to the increase in narcotics trade. C.R.A.S.H was also used in the popular game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' as an [[antagonist]] organization.\n\n=== Rampart scandal ===\n{{Main|Rampart scandal}}\nThe Rampart scandal refers to widespread corruption in the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (C.R.A.S.H.) anti-gang unit of the LAPD Rampart Division in the late 1990s. More than 70 police officers in the CRASH unit were implicated in misconduct, making it one of the most widespread cases of documented police misconduct in United States history. The convicted offenses include unprovoked shootings, unprovoked beatings, planting of evidence, frameups, stealing and dealing narcotics, bank robbery, perjury, and covering up evidence of these activities.\n\n== The Los Angeles May Day m\u00eal\u00e9e ==\n{{Main|2007 MacArthur Park rallies}}\nOn May 1, 2007, at [[MacArthur Park]], a rally formed to raise awareness of prejudice against, and demands for amnesty for undocumented workers. As the rally continued, police attempted to break up the rally. Most rally participants dispersed peacefully, but some attacked the police with bottles and rocks. The police utilized less-than-lethal weapons and engaged in pushing and kicking in ways that many viewed as excessive.\n\n== South Central L.A. ==\n{{Main|South Los Angeles}}\nSouth Los Angeles, formally known as South Central Los Angeles was once a notoriously dangerous region of the City of Los Angeles which has had an extensive history of gang violence started in the 1920s with white gangs being replaced by [[African American|black]] and [[Hispanic]] gangs for decades. However gang activity and crime has rapidly declined in the entire [[South Los Angeles]] region since the mid 2000s and is continuing to drop to this day, due to current [[redevelopment]] and heavy [[gentrification]].\n\nSouth Central had become a byword for [[urban decay]]; its former bad reputation was spread by numerous movies such as ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'', ''[[South Central (film)|South Central]]'', ''[[Menace II Society]]'', ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'', ''[[Tales from the Hood]]'', ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', ''[[Thicker Than Water (1999 film)|Thicker Than Water]]'', ''[[Training Day]]'' and in particular, South Central native John Singleton's ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. Even more recent films such as ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'', ''[[Harsh Times]]'', ''[[Dirty (film)|Dirty]]'', ''[[Gridiron Gang]]'', ''[[Waist Deep]]'', ''[[Belly 2: Millionaire Boyz Club]]'', ''[[Street Kings]]'' and ''[[End of Watch]]'', including drama series such as ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'', ''[[Law & Order: LA]]'' and ''[[The Closer]]'' had continued the poor image. Those images of South Central; along with [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Compton, California|Compton]], and even [[Watts, California|Watts]]; had been portrayed in [[West Coast Hip-Hop|West Coast]] [[Gangsta Rap]] and [[G-Funk]] songs,  as well as in video games such as ''[[Call of Juarez: The Cartel]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''.\n\n=== Crips and Bloods feud ===\nAfter the [[FBI]] cracked down on black political organizations in the late 1960s, a social vacuum formed among black adolescents living in former South Central Los Angeles. Into this vacuum came two new gangs: the [[Crips]] and the [[Bloods]]. Conflict immediately arose between the two rival gangs.  In the next 40 years, fighting between the two gangs took more than 15,000 lives to date.<ref name=Peralta>PBS Independent Lens Documentary \"Crips and Bloods\" Made in America, Produced by Baron Davis, Directed by Stacy Peralta and Written by Stacy Peralta and Sam George</ref>  The cause of the feud is best expressed as a \"kill or be killed\" culture described by T. Rodgers of the Black P Stones, as \"You better respect me.  You better fear me.\"  Speaking in a 2007 film documentary, a former Crip, named Pete, who survived to his middle years, said,\n\n:''These wars go farther back than most of these kids been around.  A lot of 'em [are] not sure about why the war was goin' on.  They [simply] STARTED DOIN' WHAT WAS BEIN' DONE. ''<ref name=Peralta />\n\nThe problem began with poverty and segregation, but had worsened with drugs, family separation and parental incarceration. The key to improving things, according to former LA mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, is education.<ref>Interview with Tavis Smiley, aired on PBS on May 18, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Social impact ===\nA 2003 comparison of twin psychological studies by the Lancet and Rand corporations discovered that the average child in [[South Los Angeles]] exhibits greater levels of post-traumatic stress disorder than children of a similar age in war-torn [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].<ref>Marlene Wong, PhD, Sheryl Kataoka, MSHS, Lisa Jaycox, PhD, University of California Los Angeles Center for Research in Managed Care, Cognitive Behavior Intervention for Trauma in Schools, (CBITS) [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9443/index1.html]</ref><ref>Stein, B., Jaycox, L., Kataoka, S., Wong, M., Tu, W., Elliot, M., & Fink, A.

[[Gang injunction]] is a variation of a restraining order issued by U.S. courts that prohibits gang members in a certain area from participating in specific activities.\n\n=== Early '90s to Mid 2000s: Gang Injunctions and its Implications ===\nAt the turn of the century, gang-related crime that includes murder, robbery, rape, burglary, aggravated assault, larceny and theft, were a frequent occurrence in the San Fernando Valley. In order to combat the increase in violent crimes, the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division deployed a campaign of gang injunction across the Valley. In April of 1993, the Department embarked on the Blythe Street gang injunction that encompassed sections of the Devonshire and Van Nuys police divisions.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/PACOIMA+GANG+LATEST+TARGETED+FOR+INJUNCTION.-a079079285|title=PACOIMA GANG LATEST TARGETED FOR INJUNCTION.|last=Goldberg|first=Orith|date=October 6, 2001|work=Daily News|access-date=May 31, 2019|location=(Los Angeles)|via=The Free Library}}</ref> Although not made permanent until February of 2000, between 1993 and 2001, there have been a total of 60 arrests; 40 of which were related to a direct violation of the injunction and the rest were indirect arrests due to the discovery of another crime while investigating a violation of the injunction.<ref name=\":02\" /> The gang injunctions in the early 2000s were successful in reducing violent crimes in the San Fernando Valley however, many are convinced that the injunctions against the gangs of the Valley are the reason for the expansion of gang-related crimes in surrounding areas.<ref name=\":12\">Tamaki, J.

In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].

Phase 1, \"the preparatory phase\", glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in the Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as \"Priming Steps\". In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates . In Step 7, two ATP are produced. In addition, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs are formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.\n\n=====Regulation=====\nIn glycolysis, [[hexokinase]] is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and [[pyruvate kinase]] is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is [[phosphofructokinase]] (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two [[binding site]]s for ATP&nbsp;\u2013 the [[active site]] is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.<ref name=\"Voet\" /> A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including [[cyclic AMP]], [[ammonium]] ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.<ref name=\"Voet\" />\n\n====Citric acid cycle====\n{{Main|Citric acid cycle|oxidative phosphorylation}}\n\nIn the [[mitochondrion]], pyruvate is oxidized by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] to the [[acetyl]] group, which is fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] by the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every \"turn\" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[succinyl-CoA synthetase]], as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate,  three equivalents of [[NADH]], and one equivalent of [[Flavin group|FADH<sub>2</sub>]]. NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are recycled (to NAD<sup>+</sup> and [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], respectively), generating additional ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2\u20133 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH<sub>2</sub> yields between 1\u20132 equivalents of ATP.<ref name=\"Rich\" /> The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular [[oxygen]], it is an obligately [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] process because O<sub>2</sub> is used to recycle the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> and provides the chemical energy driving the process.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\"> Schmidt-Rohr, K.

Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a [[malate dehydrogenase]] enzyme converts [[oxaloacetate]] to [[malate]], which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD<sup>+</sup>. A [[transaminase]] converts the oxaloacetate to [[aspartate]] for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.<ref name=\"Lodish\" /><!--will put the antiporter/full cycle in the shuttle article-->\n\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> through the electron transport chain releases the chemical energy of O<sub>2</sub> <ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\"/> to pump [[proton]]s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space.

After completing glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, approximately 30\u201338 ATP molecules are produced per glucose.\n\n=====Regulation=====\nThe citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH and the concentrations of [[calcium]], inorganic phosphate, ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and AMP.

The pathway is called [[beta-oxidation]]. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH<sub>2</sub>. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are used  by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.

Ketone bodies cannot be used as fuel by the liver, because the liver lacks the enzyme \u03b2-ketoacyl-CoA transferase, also called thiophorase.  [[Acetoacetate]] in low concentrations is taken up by the liver and undergoes detoxification through the methylglyoxal pathway which ends with lactate. [[Acetoacetate]] in high concentrations is absorbed by cells other than those in the liver and enters a different pathway via [[1,2-propanediol]].

In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].

Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through [[substrate-level phosphorylation|substrate phosphorylation]] catalyzed by two enzymes, [[Phosphoglycerate kinase|PGK]] and [[pyruvate kinase]]. Two equivalents of [[NADH]] are also produced, which can be oxidized via the [[electron transport chain]] and result in the generation of additional ATP by [[ATP synthase]].

Phase 1, \"the preparatory phase\", glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in the Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as \"Priming Steps\". In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates . In Step 7, two ATP are produced. In addition, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs are formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.\n\n=====Regulation=====\nIn glycolysis, [[hexokinase]] is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and [[pyruvate kinase]] is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is [[phosphofructokinase]] (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two [[binding site]]s for ATP&nbsp;\u2013 the [[active site]] is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.<ref name=\"Voet\" /> A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including [[cyclic AMP]], [[ammonium]] ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.<ref name=\"Voet\" />\n\n====Citric acid cycle====\n{{Main|Citric acid cycle|oxidative phosphorylation}}\n\nIn the [[mitochondrion]], pyruvate is oxidized by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] to the [[acetyl]] group, which is fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] by the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every \"turn\" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[succinyl-CoA synthetase]], as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate,  three equivalents of [[NADH]], and one equivalent of [[Flavin group|FADH<sub>2</sub>]]. NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are recycled (to NAD<sup>+</sup> and [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], respectively), generating additional ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2\u20133 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH<sub>2</sub> yields between 1\u20132 equivalents of ATP.<ref name=\"Rich\" /> The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular [[oxygen]], it is an obligately [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] process because O<sub>2</sub> is used to recycle the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> and provides the chemical energy driving the process.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\"> Schmidt-Rohr, K.

Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a [[malate dehydrogenase]] enzyme converts [[oxaloacetate]] to [[malate]], which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD<sup>+</sup>.

Therefore, making and exporting one ATP requires  4H<sup>+.</sup> The inner membrane contains an [[antiporter]], the [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]/ATP translocase, which is an [[integral membrane protein]] used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] in the intermembrane space.<ref name=\"Brandolin\">{{cite journal |last1=Dahout-Gonzalez |first1=C. |last2=Nury |first2=H. |last3=Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet |first3=V. |last4=Lauquin |first4=G. |last5=Pebay-Peyroula |first5=E. |last6=Brandolin |first6=G. | title = Molecular, functional, and pathological aspects of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier | journal = Physiology | volume = 21 | pages = 242\u2013249 | year = 2006| pmid = 16868313 | doi=10.1152/physiol.00005.2006 | issue = 4 }}</ref> This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out across the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient. After completing glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, approximately 30\u201338 ATP molecules are produced per glucose.\n\n=====Regulation=====\nThe citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH and the concentrations of [[calcium]], inorganic phosphate, ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and AMP. [[Citrate]]&nbsp;\u2013 the ion that gives its name to the cycle&nbsp;\u2013 is a feedback inhibitor of [[citrate synthase]] and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.<ref name=\"Voet\" />\n\n====Beta oxidation====\n{{Main|Beta-oxidation}}\nIn the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are converted to [[acetyl-CoA]]. The pathway is called [[beta-oxidation]]. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH<sub>2</sub>. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are used  by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.  Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ronnett |first1=G. |last2=Kim |first2=E. |last3=Landree |first3=L. |last4=Tu |first4=Y. | title = Fatty acid metabolism as a target for obesity treatment | journal = Physiol.

Ketone bodies are transported from the [[liver]] to other tissues, where [[acetoacetate]] and [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|''beta''-hydroxybutyrate]] can be reconverted to [[acetyl-CoA]] to produce reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>), via the [[citric acid cycle]]. Ketone bodies cannot be used as fuel by the liver, because the liver lacks the enzyme \u03b2-ketoacyl-CoA transferase, also called thiophorase.  [[Acetoacetate]] in low concentrations is taken up by the liver and undergoes detoxification through the methylglyoxal pathway which ends with lactate. [[Acetoacetate]] in high concentrations is absorbed by cells other than those in the liver and enters a different pathway via [[1,2-propanediol]].  Though the pathway follows a different series of steps requiring ATP, 1,2-propanediol can be turned into pyruvate.<ref name=\"Environmental Protection Agency; TOXICOLOGICAL REVIEW OF ACETONE (CAS No. 67-64-1)\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0128tr.pdf| title=Integrated Risk Information System| date=2013-03-15| access-date=2019-02-01| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924074331/http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0128tr.pdf| archive-date=2015-09-24| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Production, anaerobic conditions===\n[[fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] is the metabolism of organic compounds in the absence of air. It involves [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] in the absence of a respiratory [[electron transport chain]].

Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]], and carbon dioxide.\n\n===ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases===\nATP can also be synthesized through several so-called \"replenishment\" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]s (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the [[ATP:guanido phosphotransferase family|ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase]] family.\n\n===ATP production during photosynthesis===\nIn plants, ATP is synthesized in the [[thylakoid membrane]] of the [[chloroplast]].  The process is called photophosphorylation. The \"machinery\" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force.

However, Taiwan does not actively pursue these claims in practice; the remaining claims that Taiwan is actively seeking are of uninhabited islands: the [[Senkaku Islands]], whose sovereignty is also asserted by [[Japan]] and the PRC.

An example of such territories was the 1961 [[Indian annexation of Goa]]. An example of annexation of a territory from the British Raj was the [[Indian integration of Junagadh]].\n\n[[Akhand Bharat]], literally Undivided India or Whole India, is an irredentist call to reunite [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] (and for some Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal and Bhutan) with [[India]] to form an ''Undivided India'' as it existed before [[Partition of India|partition]] in 1947 during the [[British Raj]] (and before that, during other periods of political unity in [[South Asia]] when most of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] was under the rule of one power, such as during the [[Maurya Empire]], the [[Gupta Empire]], the [[Mughal Empire]] or the [[Maratha Empire]]).

Multiple wars have been fought over the issue, the first one immediately upon independence and partition in 1947 itself. To stave off a Pakistani and tribal invasion, [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] signed the [[Instrument of Accession]] with India. Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part. All modern Indian political parties support the return of the entirety of Kashmir to India, and all official maps of India show the entire Kashmir (including parts under Pakistani or Chinese administration after 1947) as an integral part of India.\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{Main|Greater Indonesia}}\n[[File:Westpapua.png|thumb|[[Western New Guinea]] was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969]]\nIndonesia claimed all territories of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], and previously viewed British plans to group the [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] into a new independent federation of [[Malaysia]] as a threat to its objective to create a united state called [[Greater Indonesia]].

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests. From 1995 to 2017, every president delayed the move. However, President [[Donald Trump]] in December 2017 declared his intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and in May 2018 the embassy officially did so.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Landler |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}</ref>\n\nA number of Israelis and Jews regard the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank of the Jordan river]] (which is today the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]) as the eastern parts of the [[Land of Israel]] (following the [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] idea) because, according to the Bible, the [[Tribes of Israel|Israelite tribes]] of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and allege that the area was designated a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] by the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cited as an explicit basis not to create, but to reconstitute the historical homeland of the Jewish people as a nation-state roughly analogous to the former Kingdom of Israel subject to change by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means, it forms a basis for claims of sovereign jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{main|Japanese nationalism}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\nJapan claims the two southernmost islands of the [[Russia]]n-administered [[Kuril Islands]], the island chain north of [[Hokkaido]], annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] following World War II.

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation.

Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz.

Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory.

The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Idre]]-[[S\u00e4rna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]]), and [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].\n\n====Poland====\n{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}\n\n[[Kresy]] (\"Borderlands\") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]].

Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary.

It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]].

Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests.

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref>\nSome sources say that Somalia has also laid a claim to the [[Socotra]] archipelago, which is currently governed by [[Yemen]].\n\n====North Africa====\nIn North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf</ref> While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to claim [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its \"[[Southern Provinces]]\".\n\n=== Asia ===\n====East Asia====\n=====China=====\n{{Main|Chinese nationalism|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Transfer of sovereignty over Macau}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nWhen [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories, respectively, China considered these two territories to be Chinese territories under British and Portuguese administration.

Parliament met on 28 January 1920 and published their decisions on 12 February 1920. These decisions worried the occupying [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], resulting in the [[Occupation of Constantinople]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], [[French Third Republic|French]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] troops on 16 March 1920 and the establishment of a new [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalist]] parliament, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]], in [[Ankara Government|Ankara]].\n\nThe Ottoman Minister of Internal Affairs, [[Damat Ferid Pasha]], made the opening speech of parliament due to [[Mehmed VI]]'s illness. A group of parliamentarians called ''Fel\u00e2h-\u0131 Vatan'' was established by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]]'s friends to acknowledge the decisions taken at the [[Erzurum Congress]] and the [[Sivas Congress]]. Mustafa Kemal said \"It is the nation's iron fist that writes the Nation's Oath which is the main principle of our independence to the annals of history.\" Decisions taken by this parliament were used as the basis for the new [[Turkish Republic]]'s claims in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n=====United Arab Emirates=====\nThe [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] are disputed by the [[United Arab Emirates]] against [[Iran]].\n\n=====Yemen=====\n{{Main|Greater Yemen}}\n\n[[File:Rasulid_1264.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Rasulid Kingdom encompassing [[Greater Yemen]] around 1264 AD]]\n\nGreater Yemen is a theory giving Yemen claim to former territories that were held by various predecessor states that existed between the [[Himyarite]] period and 18th century.

Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nScholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. In 1998, Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha, then the Governor of Assam, claimed that massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh was directly linked with \"the long-cherished design of Greater Bangladesh\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=====India=====\n{{Main|Indian nationalism|Greater India|Akhand Bharat}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe call for creation of ''Akhanda Bharata'' or ''Akhand Hindustan'' has on occasion been raised by some [[India]]n right wing [[Hindutva]]di cultural and political organisations, such as the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha|Hindu Mahasabha]], [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).<ref name=\"Ferguson\"/><ref name=\"Majumder\"/><ref name=\"Martensson\"/><ref name=\"Suda1953\">{{cite book|last=Suda|first=Jyoti Prasad|title=India, Her Civic Life and Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVsNAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2014|year=1953|publisher=Jai Prakash Nath & Co.|quote=Its members still swear by the ideal of Akhand Hindustan.}}</ref> The name of one organisation sharing this goal, the [[Akhand Hindustan Morcha]], bears the term in its name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hindu Political Parties|date=30 May 2010|publisher=General Books|isbn=9781157374923}}</ref> Other major Indian non-sectarian political parties, such as the [[Indian National Congress]], maintain a position against the [[partition of India]] .\n\n=====Iran=====\n{{Main|Pan-Iranism|Greater Iran}}\n\n[[Pan-Iranism]] is an [[ideology]] that advocates solidarity and reunification of [[Iranian people]]s living in the [[Iranian plateau]] and other regions that have significant Iranian cultural influence, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Ossetians]], [[Kurds]], [[Zazas]], [[Tajiks]] of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] of [[Pakistan]].

Greater Serbia consists of [[Serbia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line|large parts of Croatia]].\n\n====France====\n{{Main|Natural borders of France}}\n\n====Finland====\n{{Main|Karelian question|Greater Finland}}\n\n====Germany====\n{{Main|German Question|Pan-Germanism|Anschluss|Munich Agreement}}\n\nDuring the debate of what was then called the [[German Question]] (''die deutsche Frage'') in the 19th century prior to the [[unification of Germany]] (1871), the term ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'', \"Greater Germany\", referred to a possible German nation consisting of the states that later comprised the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria]]. The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia. The United Macedonia concept aims to unify the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] in the [[Balkans]] (which they claim as their homeland and which they assert was wrongfully divided under the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] in 1913), into a single state under Macedonian domination, with the [[Greece|Greek]] city of [[Thessaloniki]] (''Solun'' in the [[Slavic languages]]) as its capital.<ref name=\"Times\">Greek Macedonia \"not a problem\", ''The Times'' (London), August 5, 1957</ref><ref>{{YouTube|t2GMihoOmF8|A large assembly of people during the inauguration of the Statue of Alexander the Great in Skopje}}, {{YouTube|Kh25jfXxY2w|the players of the national basketball team of the Republic of Macedonia during the European Basketball Championship in Lithuania}}, {{YouTube|97ucJP97Sto|and a little girl}}, singing a nationalistic tune called Izlezi Mom\u010de (\u0418\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435, \"Get out boy\").

Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Idre]]-[[S\u00e4rna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]]), and [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].\n\n====Poland====\n{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}\n\n[[Kresy]] (\"Borderlands\") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]]. In 1921, Polish troops crossed the [[Curzon Line]] and [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|seized large Ukrainian and Belorussian territories]], and also [[\u017beligowski's Mutiny|seized 7 percent of Lithuania's territory in 1920]]. These territories were re-annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939 under the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], and include major cities, like [[Lviv]] (Ukraine), [[Vilnius]] (the capital of Lithuania), and [[Hrodna]] (Belarus). Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy. It turned out that almost 15% of the population of Poland (4.3\u20134.6 million people) declared that they had either been born in the Kresy, or had a parent or a grandparent who came from that region. Numerous treasures of Polish culture remain and there are numerous Kresy-oriented organizations. There are Polish sports clubs ([[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w (2009)|Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], and formerly [[FK Polonia Vilnius]]), newspapers ([[Gazeta Lwowska]], [[Kurier Wile\u0144ski]]), radio stations (in Lviv and Vilnius), numerous theatres, schools, choirs and folk ensembles. Poles living in ''Kresy'' are helped by [[Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie]], a Polish government-sponsored organization, as well as other organizations, such as The ''Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy'' (see also [[Karta Polaka]]). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in the ''Kresy'', and there are several annual events, such as a ''Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy'', and ''Summer with Poland'', sponsored by the [[Association \"Polish Community\"]], in which Polish children from ''Kresy'' are invited to visit Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/wakacje/432777,dzieci-z-kresow-zwiedzaja-lodz-zdjecia,id,t.html|title=Dzieci z Kres\u00f3w zwiedzaj\u0105 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [ZDJ\u0118CIA]|first=Micha\u0142|last=Meksa|publisher=}}</ref> Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to ''Kresy''.

[[Moldovan language]] is the Soviet name for the [[Romanian language]]. There is some (but not universal) support by Moldovans for a peaceful and voluntary reunion with Romania, not least because (having joined the [[European Union]]), the economy has burgeoned and Romanian citizens have gained freedom of movement in Europe. Also Russian irredentism in [[Transnistria]] has caused alarm and resentment.\n\n====Russia====\n[[File:2014 Russo-ukrainian-conflict map.svg|thumb|[[Crimea]], which is under Russian control, is shown in pink. Pink in the [[Donbass]] area represents areas held by pro-Russian [[Separatism|separatists]] in September 2014]]\n\n{{Main|Russian irredentism}}\n\n{{See also|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] in 2014 was based on a claim of protecting [[Ethnic Russians in post-Soviet states|ethnic Russians]] residing there. Crimea was part of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1783 to 1917, after which it enjoyed a few years of autonomy until it was made part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (which was a part of the Soviet Union) from 1921 to 1954 and then [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] (which also was a part of the Soviet Union) in 1954. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced. The Russian regional status is not currently recognised by the UN General Assembly and by many countries.\n\nRussian irredentism also includes southeastern and coastal Ukraine, known as ''[[Novorossiya]]'', a term from the Russian Empire.\n\n====Serbia====\n{{Main|Greater Serbia}}\n\n[[File:Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, 1981.png|thumb|The distribution of Serbs and Montenegrins in Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Slovenia) in 1981.]]\n\nSerbian irredentism is manifested in \"[[Greater Serbia]]\".

Some intellectuals sought to unite all South Slavs (regardless of religion) into a Serbian state. [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary. A government policy sought to incorporate all Serb-inhabited areas, and other South Slavic areas, thereby laying the foundation of [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Danver2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War. Bosnia and Herzegovina was established as a federal republic, made up by two separate entities, one being Serb-inhabited [[Republika Srpska]]. There has since been calls by Bosnian Serb politicians for the [[Proposed secession of Republika Srpska|secession of Republika Srpska]], and possible unification with Serbia.\n\nAfter the [[Kosovo War]] (1998\u201399), Kosovo became a [[UNSCR 1244|UN protectorate]], still ''de jure'' part of Serbia.

Afghan claims over Pakistani territory have negatively affected [[Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan relations]].\n\n===Korea===\n{{main|Korean reunification}}\n\nSince their founding, both Korean states have disputed the legitimacy of the other. [[North Korea]]'s constitution stresses the importance of reunification, but, while it makes no similar formal provision for administering the South, it effectively claims its territory as it does not [[Diplomatic recognition|diplomatically recognise]] the Republic of Korea, deeming it an \"entity occupying the Korean territory\".\n\n[[South Korea]]'s constitution also claims jurisdiction over the entire Korean peninsula. It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]]. However the body is purely symbolic and largely tasked with dealing with Northern defectors; if reunification were to occur the Committee would be dissolved and new administrators appointed by the [[Ministry of Unification]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/18/south-koreas-governors-in-theory-for-north-korea/|title=South Korea's Governors-in-Theory for North Korea|date=March 18, 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nPakistan has from its inception sought to have the territory of [[Kashmir]] incorporated into it. This singular demand has predominated Pakistan's policy strategy and decision-making as well as its diplomacy, throughout its existence. Pakistan's dispute with India over the territory of Kashmir stems from events leading up to the 1948 war between the 2 countries.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[List of irredentist claims or disputes]]\n* [[Ethnic nationalism]]\n* [[Expansionism]]\n* [[Lebensraum]]\n* [[Separatism]]\n* [[Secession]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Pan-nationalism]]\n* [[Phyletism]]\n* [[Revanchism]]\n* [[Rump State]]\n* [[Status quo ante bellum]]\n* [[Territorial dispute]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Willard, Charles Arthur 1996 \u2014 ''Liberalism and the Problem of Knowledge: A New Rhetoric for Modern Democracy'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-89845-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-89845-2}}; {{OCLC|260223405}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{commons category|Irredentism}}\n* {{Cite NIE|short=x|wstitle=Irredentism}}\n\n{{Irredentism}}\n{{Pan-nationalist concepts}}\n{{Nationalism}}\n{{Autonomous types of first-tier administration}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Divided regions]]\n[[Category:International relations theory]]\n[[Category:Irredentism| ]]\n[[Category:Pan-nationalism]]\n[[Category:Causes of war]]\n", "name_user": "Kenwick", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irredentism"}

However, traditionally Muslims believe that certain acts invalidate the wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be (often referred to as \"breaking wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be\" and \"losing wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be\") and these can be stated generically thus, although the Quran does not explain most of these:\n\n===According to Sunni Muslims===\n*Defecation or urination\n*Odorous or audible emissions of flatulence\n*Emission of semen ([[ghusl]] is required)\n*[[Slow-wave sleep]] while reclining\n*Vomiting\n*Loss of senses\n*Fainting\n*Sexual contact with another person (ghusl is required)\n*Touching the [[Intimate part|private parts]] with the bare hands (not according to Hanafi Madhhab)\n*Blood or pus leaving the body so that it leaves the point of exit (however if the blood or pus exits from the private parts then any amount breaks wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be). Note that bleeding except from private parts does not invalidate wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be according to Shafi'i Madhhab.\n\n=== According to Shia Muslims ===\nIn Shia theology, wudhu is invalidated when waste or matter exits the lower most extremities of the body, the anus and [[urethra]], as either feces, urine, semen or gas.  For wudhu to be invalid through flatulence, one must actually hear or smell the passing, otherwise it is not considered void. In addition, wudhu is considered void when someone falls into a deep sleep in which they have no alert consciousness. <ref name=\"Kulayni\" />\n\nBelching and vomiting do not invalidate wudhu, however it is strongly recommended that the individual rinses his or her mouth following the latter. Bleeding is not considered to invalidate wudhu either, as [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] made it clear in Hadith that a bad wound is not cause to repeat wudhu. This concept further extends to parasites that may exit the body through the two extremities.<ref name=\"Kulayni\" /> Cutting one's hair or nails does not invalidate wudhu but he or she should wipe the area with water.<ref name=\"Kulayni\" />\n\n==Tayammum==\n{{main|Tayammum}}\n[[File:Monastir89.jpg|thumbnail|Stone of [[Tayammum]]]]\n\nTayammum is a \"dry ablution\" using clean soil or dust, to be performed when water is not readily available to perform ablution or when one is defiled (on ''janabah'') and could not perform ''ghusl'', and is authorised under specific circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://majalla.org/books/law/79.html |title=Tayammum |publisher=Majalla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\n==Wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be description in Hadith==\nWu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be in Hadith [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayra]], in reference to the Day of Resurrection, reported that Muhammad, when asked if he would be able to recognise Muslims, said, \"Yes, you would have a mark which other people will not have.

However, traditionally Muslims believe that certain acts invalidate the wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be (often referred to as \"breaking wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be\" and \"losing wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be\") and these can be stated generically thus, although the Quran does not explain most of these:\n\n===According to Sunni Muslims===\n*Defecation or urination\n*Odorous or audible emissions of flatulence\n*Emission of semen ([[ghusl]] is required)\n*[[Slow-wave sleep]] while reclining\n*Vomiting\n*Loss of senses\n*Fainting\n*Sexual contact with another person (ghusl is required)\n*Touching the [[Intimate part|private parts]] with the bare hands (not according to Hanafi Madhhab)\n*Blood or pus leaving the body so that it leaves the point of exit (however if the blood or pus exits from the private parts then any amount breaks wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be). Note that bleeding except from private parts does not invalidate wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be according to Shafi'i Madhhab.\n\n=== According to Shia Muslims ===\nIn Shia theology, wudhu is invalidated when waste or matter exits the lower most extremities of the body, the anus and [[urethra]], as either feces, urine, semen or gas.  For wudhu to be invalid through flatulence, one must actually hear or smell the passing, otherwise it is not considered void. In addition, wudhu is considered void when someone falls into a deep sleep in which they have no alert consciousness. <ref name=\"Kulayni\" />\n\nBelching and vomiting do not invalidate wudhu, however it is strongly recommended that the individual rinses his or her mouth following the latter. Bleeding is not considered to invalidate wudhu either, as [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] made it clear in Hadith that a bad wound is not cause to repeat wudhu. This concept further extends to parasites that may exit the body through the two extremities.<ref name=\"Kulayni\" /> Cutting one's hair or nails does not invalidate wudhu but he or she should wipe the area with water.<ref name=\"Kulayni\" />\n\n==Tayammum==\n{{main|Tayammum}}\n[[File:Monastir89.jpg|thumbnail|Stone of [[Tayammum]]]]\n\nTayammum is a \"dry ablution\" using clean soil or dust, to be performed when water is not readily available to perform ablution or when one is defiled (on ''janabah'') and could not perform ''ghusl'', and is authorised under specific circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://majalla.org/books/law/79.html |title=Tayammum |publisher=Majalla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\n==Wu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be description in Hadith==\nWu\u1e0d\u016b\u02be in Hadith [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayra]], in reference to the Day of Resurrection, reported that Muhammad, when asked if he would be able to recognise Muslims, said, \"Yes, you would have a mark which other people will not have.
