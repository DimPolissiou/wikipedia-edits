The word ''[[carabao]]'' means \"buffalo\", a symbol of fighting, hard work, and patience.\n\nThey are known for their [[Phleng phuea chiwit]] (\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15) or 'songs for life'.  This kind of [[music]] came to prominence through the [[protest song]]s of the 1970s political upheaval in Thailand, especially from the band [[Caravan (Thai band)|Caravan]].  Carabao have blended the acoustic/folk style of 'peua chiwit' with other forms of [[Music of Thailand|Thai music]], western rock and country music, and various kinds of world music like [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and [[reggae]], earning such labels as 'ethnic rockers' and 'Kings of 3Cha' or 'Rolling Stones of Asia'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mopo.de/2005/20051006/plan7/veranstaltungstipps/clubs-szene/musikalische_wasserbueffel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109151000/http://www.mopo.de/2005/20051006/plan7/veranstaltungstipps/clubs-szene/musikalische_wasserbueffel.html |archivedate=2006-01-09 }} (in German)</ref> ''MTV Asia'' calls them \"veteran\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200112/17006903.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902192521/http://mtvasia.com/News/200112/17006903.html |archivedate=2006-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nCarabao's songs often tackle social and political issues, demanding social justice and taking on the causes of the ordinary Thai people, but they have also created love songs and more philosophical songs that carry messages for people everywhere. Lead singer/songwriter [[Aed Carabao]] is loved by many and is also famous for his sharp tongue and open criticism of corrupt politicians, big business, and environmental destruction. At least one or two songs on most albums up to the mid-'90s were banned by the government and coverage of the band rarely appeared on government TV and radio stations. Despite this, Carabao is the most popular Thai rock group of all time. Carabao reached cult status long ago and is now one of the most successful legendary rock groups in the world. They have been compared to the rock band U2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.der-farang.com/index.php?article=2005%2F24%2F|title=DER FARANG - Zeitung f\u00fcr Urlauber und Residenten in Thailand|date=2011-07-09|access-date=2017-11-20|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709013621/http://www.der-farang.com/index.php?article=2005%2F24%2F|archivedate=2011-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==History overview==\nCarabao has a long and complex history, with multiple lineups and several members who have left and rejoined the band numerous times.  Leader/guitarist/vocalist Aed is the only member who has participated in all their albums and tours, although most of their lineups have featured bassist Ot and guitarist Lek.\n\n==Prehistory==\nCarabao was originally formed in the Philippines with three members, Aed, Keo, and a third member named Khai, all of whom sang and played guitar. They stopped playing together when Aed returned to Thailand. However, Aed continued to play music and write songs, contributing a song to the popular songs for the Thai Muslim life band \"Hammer,\" and playing as a backing member of the band \"Hope.\" After the experience of playing with other bands, he decided that he wanted to revive Carabao so that he could have his own band. He persuaded Keo to return and switch to bass.\n\n==The early albums==\nCarabao released their first album, [[Lung Khii Maw]] ('''\u0e25\u0e38\u0e07\u0e02\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e21\u0e32''' - \"The Drunken Old Man\"), in 1981, with Aed and Khiao backed by a member of \"Hope\", as the fledgling band lacked a drummer, lead guitarist or keyboardist.  This album featured a simple, primitive folky sound, not drastically different from other Songs for Life bands from that era, although it did feature a noticeable rock influence, something that earlier Songs for Life bands like Caravan and Hammer had lacked.  Some of the melodies were borrowed from Asian or Thai folk or rock songs, with the title track based on a Filipino folk melody.  The album did not sell many copies, but Aed set about recruiting other members so that the band could effectively perform live.\n\nA major breakthrough came with the recruitment of guitarist/vocalist Preecha Chanapai (Lek).  Lek had a distinctive, powerful Santana-like style, and Aed has said that this gave him more confidence in the band.  At the time, Lek was playing in a band called \"The President Band\", and on the band's 2nd album members of that band backed Aed, Lek and Keo, the latter who had by then switched back to guitar. The bass parts were played by President Band bassist Anupong Prathompatama (Ot), who has since gone on to be one of Carabao's longest running members.  The resulting album had noticeably more rock-oriented arrangements as compared to their debut, and also had a great deal of influence of American roots music styles.\n\nCarabao first came into the national spotlight with their third album, [[Waniphok]] ('''\u0e27\u0e13\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e01''' - \"The Wandering Minstrel\"), the title song of which told the story of a blind street musician and became a major hit.  The song featured the distinctive \"Samcha\" rhythm, a kind of mix of Northeastern Thai folk rhythms like [[Mor lam|Mo Lam]] and [[Luk Thung]] with Latin beats.  Future Carabao albums would feature many songs done in this style.  Aed has noted with pride that before Waniphok was released, discos in Thailand played only Western songs, but the catchy indigenous rhythms of the song managed to break down those barriers.  While no other songs on the album featured songs done in this style, it featured a strong influence of traditional Thai melodies.  Like the second album, Wanipok featured Aed, Khiao and Lek backed by members of the President Band, including Ot on bass.\n\nBy their 4th album, they had also added a permanent drummer, Amnaat Luukjan (Pao).  At the same time, Aed invited Ot to become the band's official bassist, but since The President Band had plans to go on a US tour, he was unavailable.  In his place, the band added Phairat Phoemchalat (Rat) on bass.  The album also featured contributions from woodwind player Thanit Siiklindii (Ajaan), as well as backing vocals from Thierry (Ri), both of whom would soon become an official members of the band as well.  The album continued to feature the folkier sound of their early albums, but also showcased their growing eclecticism.\n\n==Stardom==\nCarabao's most popular album, [[Made In Thailand]] ('''\u0e40\u0e21\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e41\u0e25\u0e19\u0e14\u0e4c'''), was released in 1984 and sold over four million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://der-farang.com/?article=2005/24/cover|title=DER FARANG|website=der-farang.com}}</ref> The title track became a hit in several neighboring countries as well.  The album featured a remarkable variety of musical styles, mixing rock, folk, regional Thai styles like Luk Thung and Mo Lam, some reggae and Latin beats, and even some classical Thai music with the song \"Refugee.\"\n\nBy this time, woodwind player Thanit Siiklindii (Ajaan) had become a permanent member of the band, and guitarist/vocalist Thierry Mekwattana had joined as well.  Meanwhile, Keo's role changed again, becoming a backing vocalist and live multi-instrumentalist.  Before touring for 'Made in Thailand,' Rat left and Ot rejoined the band, this time as an official member.  The resulting 7 member band, consisting of Aed, Keo, Lek, Ot, Pao, Ajaan and Thierry, is regarded by many fans as their classic lineup.\n\nThis lineup recorded several more hit albums in the 1980s, resulting in a powerful, eclectic and increasingly political body of work, with hit songs like \"Welcome to Thailand,\" \"Khon Jon Phuyingyai\" \"Mae Sai\" and \"Thaplang\".  The latter song was written about the theft of a holy Thai lintel, the Phra Narai, that later appeared in an American museum, and became the subject of Thai protests in order to regain the lintel.  The song's chorus translates as \"Take back Michael Jackson, give us back the Phra Narai!\"\n\nDuring this period, Carabao consolidated their position as Thailand's most popular musical group of all time.  In terms of musical style, the band remained extremely eclectic, mixing a wide range of Thai and international styles.\n\n==Fragmentation==\nAfter the \"Thaplang\" album in 1988, the band began to disintegrate, as members left to start solo careers.  First to go were Thierry, Ajan, and Pao, who briefly formed a spinoff band.  Reduced to 4 members, on their 10th album, Ham Jot Khwai (\"\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e32\u0e21\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22\") the band returned to playing with backing musicians, this time members of the Thai band 'Tawan.'  After recording and touring for the album, Khiao became the next member of the classic lineup to leave, and the band announced a breakup.\n\nHowever, soon Aed, Lek and Ot were back playing together with some new backing musicians, including Luechai Ngamsom (Duk) on keyboards, vocals and trumpet and Chuchat Nuduang (Ko) on drums.  Originally, this band was not called \"Carabao,\" but rather just 'Aed, Lek, Ot,' going by the remaining classic lineup members' nicknames.  However, Aed was soon persuaded to revive the Carabao name, and the band continued with the new lineup.  With Keo (Khiao) gone, Aed was now technically the band's only original member, although Lek and Ot had also been playing with the band almost from the start.\n\nAfter their 12th album, Satja 10 Prakan, Carabao fans got another shock with the departure of Lek, who was replaced by Kajonsak Hutawatthana (Mee) on guitar.  Although many of the band's fans were unhappy with the band's lineup changes, this version of the band released 3 albums in the early-mid 1990s, with a lower degree of commercial success than before, but still remaining one of Thailand's most dominant bands, and with hit singles like \"Raeng Koi\" 'Yai Samang' and \"Luang Phaw Khun\" still getting major airplay on Thailand's radio stations. The new lineup soon added a 6th live member, percussionalist/backing vocalist, Sayaaphoon Singthoong (Nong), who would later become an official member of the band.  During this period of time, the classic lineup of the band occasionally reunited for live shows.\n\n==Reunion==\nIn 1995, the \"classic\" lineup of the band decided to reunite to celebrate the band's 15th anniversary.  They recorded a double album, Hak Huajai Yang Rak Khwai (\"\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e43\u0e08\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22\" - \"If You Still Love Buffaloes\"), which became the band's biggest hit in years, and re-established them as Thailand's biggest band.  However, the reunion did not last, and the Aed-Ot-Duk-Mi-Ko-Nong lineup resumed activities, this time with some production help from Keo.\n\nFor their 18th album, Amerikan Anthaphaan, Lek, Thierry and Keo rejoined the band again.  While Keo's return to the band did not last, Lek and Thierry continued as Carabao members.   The result was a new lineup that combined 4 members of the \"classic\" band (Aed, Lek, Thierry and Ot) with 4 later members (Duk, Ko, Mee, and Nong), along with a new recruit, percussionalist/flutist/drummer named Thepajon Phanthuphongthai (Uan).\n\n==The 25th anniversary==\nSince then, the band has recorded several more albums, with another recent upsurge in critical and commercial success.  They have now released a total of 28 official studio albums (Vol. 1 - Vol. 28 / 1981 - 2013), with some special albums, numerous live albums and compilations bringing the total to more than 60.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carabao.net|title=\u0e27\u0e07\u0e14\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e27|website=www.carabao.net|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> The lineup has also remained stable, although percussionalist Nong left the band due to illness after their 25th albums, and later died.  Additionally,  classic-era members Keo (Khiao) and Ajaan have occasionally appeared on their post-millennium albums and live shows, though they have not been official members for years.\n\n==30th anniversary celebration and beyond== \nIn 2011, there were a series of 30th anniversary concerts all around Thailand and beyond, the biggest being \u201cVelodrome Returns.\u201d The band played nearly 50 songs during this concert, including a twenty-minute medley of 17 sam cha favorites, with time for only one or two verses of each song.(\u201cVelodrome Returns.\u201d 2011. of Carabao 30th Anniversary Concert, DVD.  Warner Music. Available at eThaiCD.com.)\n\nA Carabao convention, the Carabao New Year Expo (7 Days, 7 Themes), was held December 21\u201327, that same year. During the day, convention goers viewed displays of Carabao memorabilia, attended music workshops, sang karaoke, and bought Carabao merchandise from the vendors. Each evening of the Expo, for seven nights, there was a Carabao concert on a different theme. (There are easily 500 Carabao songs, not counting Aed Carabao's solo work). Some band members said they had to look up and relearn many of the songs on the playlist, as they had never played them outside a studio. Keo, Ajaan, and others from the classic lineup were back for both Expo and the big 30th Anniversary concert.(Carabao New Year Expo (7 Days, 7 Themes), was held December 21\u201327. Available on DVD at eThaiCD.com)\n\nA 30th Anniversary album of new songs was released titled \u201cGamlang Jai\u201d (\u201cStrength of Spirit\u201d or \u201cMoral Support\u201d), with the theme that the fans and the band provide each other strength of spirit and moral support. This album also included a DVD with music videos of some songs. (\u201cGamlang Jai\u201d (\u0e01\u0e33\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e43\u0e08). 2011. Carabao 30th Anniversary Album, CD/DVD set. Available at eThaiCD.com) All previous Carabao albums were rereleased for the 30th anniversary.\n\nSince then, Carabao has released one more album, 'Sawadii Phrathet Thai' (Hello Thailand) and has continued to play live with their long-running 8 man lineup, abetted at times with other classic-era members.\n\n==Film, TV series, and other developments==\n[[File:HS-ABJ (10551935004).jpg|thumb|A [[Thai AirAsia]] [[Airbus A320]] in a livery celebrating the band's 30th anniversary, seen here at [[Khon Kaen Airport]] in October 2013.]]\nIn 2013 produced a movie \u201cYoung Bao\u201d (\u2018Bao being short for \u201cCarabao\u201d) purporting to tell the origins of the band.  (This was actually the second movie to tell this story, the first being \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e35\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e \u201cSiang Playng Heeng Seripaap\u201d meaning \"Music of Freedom\" released in 1985, in which the band members played themselves.) In \u201cYoung Bao,\u201d most of the actors who played the Carabao band members as young people were themselves famous musicians. For instance, Thierry was played by both his own son Jessie Mekwatanna (for the teenager) and by [[Hugo (musician)|Hugo]] (for the young adult).(\u201cYoung Bao.\u201d 2013. Movie. Produced by Grand Big Bang. Available on DVD from eThaiCD.com)\n\nIn 2013, the band members were able to fulfill their dream of playing with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], one of their biggest musical influences. Whether this did or did not go as hoped (both bands played Santana songs with no discussion beforehand and Aed was too starstruck to sing more than a few words), it did lead to the band's Santana-inspired 28th Official Carabao Album (28th in the official series of studio albums, not counting compilations, live albums, and special albums such the collaboration with Parn). The 28th Carabao album \u201cSawadee Prathet Thai\u201d (\u201cHello Thailand\u201d) released November 2013 contains a song called \u201cSantana Carabao\u201d that is a 50/50 blend of the Santana and Carabao signature sounds. (\u201cSawadee Prathet Thai\u201d(\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22). 2013. Carabao 28th Album. CD Available at eThaiCD.com.)\n\nA weekly hour-long TV show \u201cCarabao The Series\u201d(\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e40\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e4c) started up September  2013, and continues to the present (March 2014), with each episode based on the lyrics of a different Carabao song. Carabao songs are famous for their vivid themes and story-telling, with some song subjects, such as the blind street musician of \u201cWanipok\u201d and or the kind-hearted soldier \u201cBua Loi\u201d achieving mythical status. So each episode of \u201cCarabao The Series\u201d takes a different Carabao song and turns it into a 40-minute drama. While the dramas may deviate from the plot of the original lyrics, they stick closely to the spirit of the song. Three of the band members, Aed, Lek, and Thierry, introduce each drama by briefly discussing the song for the week, followed by the drama itself, then each episode concludes with a cover of the song by a younger band. (\u201cCarabao The Series\u201d(\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e27 \u0e40\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e4c). TV show.

(By Thai custom a band member, will often (informally) use his band's name as his last name.)\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Carabao discography}}\n\n==Membership timeline==\n<timeline>\nImageSize =

({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e27}}) is a [[Thai rock]] band that is very popular in [[Thailand]] and other Asian countries.<ref>{{Cite

university students Yuenyong Opakul ([[Aed Carabao|Aed]]) and Kirati Promsaka Na Sakon Nakhon (Keo or Khiao) who met while studying at [[Map\u00faa Institute of Technology]] in the [[Philippines]]. The word ''[[carabao]]'' means \"buffalo\", a symbol of fighting, hard work, and patience.\n\nThey are known for their [[Phleng phuea chiwit]] (\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15) or 'songs for life'.  This kind of [[music]] came to prominence through the [[protest song]]s of the 1970s political upheaval in Thailand, especially from the band [[Caravan (Thai band)|Caravan]].  Carabao have blended the acoustic/folk style of 'peua chiwit' with other forms of [[Music of Thailand|Thai music]], western rock and country music, and various kinds of world music like [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and [[reggae]], earning such labels as 'ethnic rockers' and 'Kings of 3Cha' or 'Rolling Stones of Asia'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mopo.de/2005/20051006/plan7/veranstaltungstipps/clubs-szene/musikalische_wasserbueffel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109151000/http://www.mopo.de/2005/20051006/plan7/veranstaltungstipps/clubs-szene/musikalische_wasserbueffel.html |archivedate=2006-01-09 }} (in German)</ref> ''MTV Asia'' calls them \"veteran\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200112/17006903.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902192521/http://mtvasia.com/News/200112/17006903.html |archivedate=2006-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nCarabao's songs often tackle social and political issues, demanding social justice and taking on the causes of the ordinary Thai people, but they have also created love songs and more philosophical songs that carry messages for people everywhere. Lead singer/songwriter [[Aed Carabao]] is loved by many and is also famous for his sharp tongue and open criticism of corrupt politicians, big business, and environmental destruction. At least one or two songs on most albums up to the mid-'90s were banned by the government and coverage of the band rarely appeared on government TV and radio stations. Despite this, Carabao is the most popular Thai rock group of all time. Carabao reached cult status long ago and is now one of the most successful legendary rock groups in the world. They have been compared to the rock band U2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.der-farang.com/index.php?article=2005%2F24%2F|title=DER FARANG - Zeitung f\u00fcr Urlauber und Residenten in Thailand|date=2011-07-09|access-date=2017-11-20|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709013621/http://www.der-farang.com/index.php?article=2005%2F24%2F|archivedate=2011-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==History overview==\nCarabao has a long and complex history, with multiple lineups and several members who have left and rejoined the band numerous times.  Leader/guitarist/vocalist Aed is the only member who has participated in all their albums and tours, although most of their lineups have featured bassist Ot and guitarist Lek.\n\n==Prehistory==\nCarabao was originally formed in the Philippines with three members, Aed, Keo, and a third member named Khai, all of whom sang and played guitar. They stopped playing together when Aed returned to Thailand. However, Aed continued to play music and write songs, contributing a song to the popular songs for the Thai Muslim life band \"Hammer,\" and playing as a backing member of the band \"Hope.\" After the experience of playing with other bands, he decided that he wanted to revive Carabao so that he could have his own band. He persuaded Keo to return and switch to bass.\n\n==The early albums==\nCarabao released their first album, [[Lung Khii Maw]] ('''\u0e25\u0e38\u0e07\u0e02\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e21\u0e32''' - \"The Drunken Old Man\"), in 1981, with Aed and Khiao backed by a member of \"Hope\", as the fledgling band lacked a drummer, lead guitarist or keyboardist.  This album featured a simple, primitive folky sound, not drastically different from other Songs for Life bands from that era, although it did feature a noticeable rock influence, something that earlier Songs for Life bands like Caravan and Hammer had lacked.  Some of the melodies were borrowed from Asian or Thai folk or rock songs, with the title track based on a Filipino folk melody.  The album did not sell many copies, but Aed set about recruiting other members so that the band could effectively perform live.\n\nA major breakthrough came with the recruitment of guitarist/vocalist Preecha Chanapai (Lek).  Lek had a distinctive, powerful Santana-like style, and Aed has said that this gave him more confidence in the band.  At the time, Lek was playing in a band called \"The President Band\", and on the band's 2nd album members of that band backed Aed, Lek and Keo, the latter who had by then switched back to guitar. The bass parts were played by President Band bassist Anupong Prathompatama (Ot), who has since gone on to be one of Carabao's longest running members.  The resulting album had noticeably more rock-oriented arrangements as compared to their debut, and also had a great deal of influence of American roots music styles.\n\nCarabao first came into the national spotlight with their third album, [[Waniphok]] ('''\u0e27\u0e13\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e01''' - \"The Wandering Minstrel\"), the title song of which told the story of a blind street musician and became a major hit.  The song featured the distinctive \"Samcha\" rhythm, a kind of mix of Northeastern Thai folk rhythms like [[Mor lam|Mo Lam]] and [[Luk Thung]] with Latin beats.  Future Carabao albums would feature many songs done in this style.  Aed has noted with pride that before Waniphok was released, discos in Thailand played only Western songs, but the catchy indigenous rhythms of the song managed to break down those barriers.  While no other songs on the album featured songs done in this style, it featured a strong influence of traditional Thai melodies.  Like the second album, Wanipok featured Aed, Khiao and Lek backed by members of the President Band, including Ot on bass.\n\nBy their 4th album, they had also added a permanent drummer, Amnaat Luukjan (Pao).  At the same time, Aed invited Ot to become the band's official bassist, but since The President Band had plans to go on a US tour, he was unavailable.  In his place, the band added Phairat Phoemchalat (Rat) on bass.  The album also featured contributions from woodwind player Thanit Siiklindii (Ajaan), as well as backing vocals from Thierry (Ri), both of whom would soon become an official members of the band as well.  The album continued to feature the folkier sound of their early albums, but also showcased their growing eclecticism.\n\n==Stardom==\nCarabao's most popular album, [[Made In Thailand]] ('''\u0e40\u0e21\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e41\u0e25\u0e19\u0e14\u0e4c'''), was released in 1984 and sold over four million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://der-farang.com/?article=2005/24/cover|title=DER FARANG|website=der-farang.com}}</ref> The title track became a hit in several neighboring countries as well.  The album featured a remarkable variety of musical styles, mixing rock, folk, regional Thai styles like Luk Thung and Mo Lam, some reggae and Latin beats, and even some classical Thai music with the song \"Refugee.\"\n\nBy this time, woodwind player Thanit Siiklindii (Ajaan) had become a permanent member of the band, and guitarist/vocalist Thierry Mekwattana had joined as well.  Meanwhile, Keo's role changed again, becoming a backing vocalist and live multi-instrumentalist.  Before touring for 'Made in Thailand,' Rat left and Ot rejoined the band, this time as an official member.  The resulting 7 member band, consisting of Aed, Keo, Lek, Ot, Pao, Ajaan and Thierry, is regarded by many fans as their classic lineup.\n\nThis lineup recorded several more hit albums in the 1980s, resulting in a powerful, eclectic and increasingly political body of work, with hit songs like \"Welcome to Thailand,\" \"Khon Jon Phuyingyai\" \"Mae Sai\" and \"Thaplang\".  The latter song was written about the theft of a holy Thai lintel, the Phra Narai, that later appeared in an American museum, and became the subject of Thai protests in order to regain the lintel.  The song's chorus translates as \"Take back Michael Jackson, give us back the Phra Narai!\"\n\nDuring this period, Carabao consolidated their position as Thailand's most popular musical group of all time.  In terms of musical style, the band remained extremely eclectic, mixing a wide range of Thai and international styles.\n\n==Fragmentation==\nAfter the \"Thaplang\" album in 1988, the band began to disintegrate, as members left to start solo careers.  First to go were Thierry, Ajan, and Pao, who briefly formed a spinoff band.  Reduced to 4 members, on their 10th album, Ham Jot Khwai (\"\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e32\u0e21\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22\") the band returned to playing with backing musicians, this time members of the Thai band 'Tawan.'  After recording and touring for the album, Khiao became the next member of the classic lineup to leave, and the band announced a breakup.\n\nHowever, soon Aed, Lek and Ot were back playing together with some new backing musicians, including Luechai Ngamsom (Duk) on keyboards, vocals and trumpet and Chuchat Nuduang (Ko) on drums.  Originally, this band was not called \"Carabao,\" but rather just 'Aed, Lek, Ot,' going by the remaining classic lineup members' nicknames.  However, Aed was soon persuaded to revive the Carabao name, and the band continued with the new lineup.  With Keo (Khiao) gone, Aed was now technically the band's only original member, although Lek and Ot had also been playing with the band almost from the start.\n\nAfter their 12th album, Satja 10 Prakan, Carabao fans got another shock with the departure of Lek, who was replaced by Kajonsak Hutawatthana (Mee) on guitar.  Although many of the band's fans were unhappy with the band's lineup changes, this version of the band released 3 albums in the early-mid 90's, with a lower degree of commercial success than before, but still remaining one of Thailand's most dominant bands, and with hit singles like \"Raeng Koi\" 'Yai Samang' and \"Luang Phaw Khun\" still getting major airplay on Thailand's radio stations. The new lineup soon added a 6th live member, percussionalist/backing vocalist, Sayaaphoon Singthoong (Nong), who would later become an official member of the band.  During this period of time, the classic lineup of the band occasionally reunited for live shows.\n\n==Reunion==\nIn 1995, the \"classic\" lineup of the band decided to reunite to celebrate the band's 15th anniversary.  They recorded a double album, Hak Huajai Yang Rak Khwai (\"\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e43\u0e08\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e22\" - \"If You Still Love Buffaloes\"), which became the band's biggest hit in years, and re-established them as Thailand's biggest band.  However, the reunion did not last, and the Aed-Ot-Duk-Mi-Ko-Nong lineup resumed activities, this time with some production help from Keo.\n\nFor their 18th album, Amerikan Anthaphaan, Lek, Thierry and Keo rejoined the band again.  While Keo's return to the band did not last, Lek and Thierry continued as Carabao members.   The result was a new lineup that combined 4 members of the \"classic\" band (Aed, Lek, Thierry and Ot) with 4 later members (Duk, Ko, Mee, and Nong), along with a new recruit, percussionalist/flutist/drummer named Thepajon Phanthuphongthai (Uan).\n\n==The 25th anniversary==\nSince then, the band has recorded several more albums, with another recent upsurge in critical and commercial success.  They have now released a total of 28 official studio albums (Vol. 1 - Vol. 28 / 1981 - 2013), with some special albums, numerous live albums and compilations bringing the total to more than 60.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carabao.net|title=\u0e27\u0e07\u0e14\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e27|website=www.carabao.net|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> The lineup has also remained stable, although percussionalist Nong left the band due to illness after their 25th albums, and later died.  Additionally,  classic-era members Keo (Khiao) and Ajaan have occasionally appeared on their post-millennium albums and live shows, though they have not been official members for years.\n\n==30th anniversary celebration and beyond== \nIn 2011, there were a series of 30th anniversary concerts all around Thailand and beyond, the biggest being \u201cVelodrome Returns.\u201d The band played nearly 50 songs during this concert, including a twenty-minute medley of 17 sam cha favorites, with time for only one or two verses of each song.(\u201cVelodrome Returns.\u201d 2011. of Carabao 30th Anniversary Concert, DVD.  Warner Music. Available at eThaiCD.com.)\n\nA Carabao convention, the Carabao New Year Expo (7 Days, 7 Themes), was held December 21\u201327, that same year. During the day, convention goers viewed displays of Carabao memorabilia, attended music workshops, sang karaoke, and bought Carabao merchandise from the vendors. Each evening of the Expo, for seven nights, there was a Carabao concert on a different theme. (There are easily 500 Carabao songs, not counting Aed Carabao's solo work). Some band members said they had to look up and relearn many of the songs on the playlist, as they had never played them outside a studio. Keo, Ajaan, and others from the classic lineup were back for both Expo and the big 30th Anniversary concert.(Carabao New Year Expo (7 Days, 7 Themes), was held December 21\u201327. Available on DVD at eThaiCD.com)\n\nA 30th Anniversary album of new songs was released titled \u201cGamlang Jai\u201d (\u201cStrength of Spirit\u201d or \u201cMoral Support\u201d), with the theme that the fans and the band provide each other strength of spirit and moral support. This album also included a DVD with music videos of some songs. (\u201cGamlang Jai\u201d (\u0e01\u0e33\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e43\u0e08). 2011. Carabao 30th Anniversary Album, CD/DVD set. Available at eThaiCD.com) All previous Carabao albums were rereleased for the 30th anniversary.\n\nSince then, Carabao has released one more album, 'Sawadii Phrathet Thai' (Hello Thailand) and has continued to play live with their long-running 8 man lineup, abetted at times with other classic-era members.\n\n==Film, TV series, and other developments==\n[[File:HS-ABJ (10551935004).jpg|thumb|A [[Thai AirAsia]] [[Airbus A320]] in a livery celebrating the band's 30th anniversary, seen here at [[Khon Kaen Airport]] in October 2013.]]\nIn 2013 produced a movie \u201cYoung Bao\u201d (\u2018Bao being short for \u201cCarabao\u201d) purporting to tell the origins of the band.  (This was actually the second movie to tell this story, the first being \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e35\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e \u201cSiang Playng Heeng Seripaap\u201d meaning \"Music of Freedom\" released in 1985, in which the band members played themselves.) In \u201cYoung Bao,\u201d most of the actors who played the Carabao band members as young people were themselves famous musicians. For instance, Thierry was played by both his own son Jessie Mekwatanna (for the teenager) and by [[Hugo (musician)|Hugo]] (for the young adult).(\u201cYoung Bao.\u201d 2013. Movie. Produced by Grand Big Bang. Available on DVD from eThaiCD.com)\n\nIn 2013, the band members were able to fulfill their dream of playing with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], one of their biggest musical influences. Whether this did or did not go as hoped (both bands played Santana songs with no discussion beforehand and Aed was too starstruck to sing more than a few words), it did lead to the band's Santana-inspired 28th Official Carabao Album (28th in the official series of studio albums, not counting compilations, live albums, and special albums such the collaboration with Parn). The 28th Carabao album \u201cSawadee Prathet Thai\u201d (\u201cHello Thailand\u201d) released November 2013 contains a song called \u201cSantana Carabao\u201d that is a 50/50 blend of the Santana and Carabao signature sounds. (\u201cSawadee Prathet Thai\u201d(\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22). 2013. Carabao 28th Album.

Carabao songs are famous for their vivid themes and story-telling, with some song subjects, such as the blind street musician of \u201cWanipok\u201d and or the kind-hearted soldier \u201cBua Loi\u201d achieving mythical status. So each episode of \u201cCarabao The Series\u201d takes a different Carabao song and turns it into a 40-minute drama. While the dramas may deviate from the plot of the original lyrics, they stick closely to the spirit of the song. Three of the band members, Aed, Lek, and Thierry, introduce each drama by briefly discussing the song for the week, followed by the drama itself, then each episode concludes with a cover of the song by a younger band.

(By Thai custom a band member, will often (informally) use his band's name as his last name.)\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Carabao discography}}\n\n==Membership timeline==\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:18\nPlotArea = left:120 bottom:120 top:10 right:30\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1981 till:31/12/2018\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1981\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1981\n\nColors =\n  id:vocals   value:red    legend:Lead_Vocals\n  id:choirs   value:pink legend:Backing_Vocals\n  id:guitar   value:green legend:Guitars\n  id:bass     value:blue   legend:Bass\n  id:drums    value:orange legend:Drums\n  id:keys     value:purple   legend:Keyboards\n  id:perc    value:Yellow    legend:Percussion \n  id:Lines    value:black  legend:Studio_Albums\n  id:bars      value:gray(0.9)\n\nBackgroundColors =  bars:bars\n\nBarData =\n  bar:Aed  text:\"Aed\"\n  bar:Khiao  text:\"Khiao\"\n  bar:Lek  text:\"Lek\"\n  bar:Ajaan    text:\"Ajaan\"  \n  bar:Pao  text:\"Pao\"\n  bar:Rat    text:\"Rat\"\n  bar:Thierry   text:\"Thierry\"\n  bar:Ot    text:\"Ot\"  \n  bar:Duk   text:\"Duk\"\n  bar:Ko      text:\"Ko\"\n  bar:Mee   text:\"Mee\"\n  bar:Nong text:\"Nong\"\n  bar:Uan    text:\"Uan\"\n  \nPlotData=\n  width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\n  bar:Aed  from:01/01/1981 till:end color:guitar\n  bar:Aed  from:01/01/1981 till:end color:vocals width:3\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/01/1981 till:31/03/1990 color:guitar\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/01/1981 till:31/03/1990 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 color:guitar\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/10/1998 till:01/12/2000 color:guitar\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/10/1998 till:01/12/2000 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/08/2007 till:01/09/2007 color:guitar\n  bar:Khiao  from:01/08/2007 till:01/09/2007 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Lek  from:01/06/1982 till:12/12/1992 color:guitar\n  bar:Lek  from:01/06/1982 till:12/12/1992 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Lek  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 color:guitar\n  bar:Lek  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Lek  from:01/10/1998 till:end color:guitar\n  bar:Lek  from:01/10/1998 till:end color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Pao  from:01/12/1983 till:31/12/1989 color:drums\n  bar:Pao  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 color:drums\n  bar:Rat  from:01/12/1983 till:31/12/1984 color:bass\n  bar:Ot  from:01/12/1985 till:end color:bass\n  bar:Thierry  from:01/12/1984 till:30/11/1988 color:guitar\n  bar:Thierry  from:01/12/1984 till:30/11/1988 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Thierry  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 color:guitar\n  bar:Thierry  from:01/07/1995 till:01/08/1995 color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Thierry  from:01/10/1998 till:end color:guitar\n  bar:Thierry  from:01/10/1998 till:end color:choirs width:3\n  bar:Ajaan  from:01/01/1983 till:31/12/1989 color:keys\n  bar:Ajaan  from:01/01/1995 till:31/12/1996 color:keys\n  bar:Ajaan  from:01/01/2011 till:31/12/2012 color:keys\n  bar:Duk from:01/12/1992 till:end color:keys\n  bar:Ko  from:01/12/1992 till:end color:drums\n  bar:Mee  from:01/09/1993 till:end color:guitar\n  bar:Nong from:01/08/1995 till:01/07/2007 color:perc\n  bar:Uan  from:01/01/2002 till:end color:drums\n\nLineData=\n\n  at:01/11/1981 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/06/1982 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/03/1983 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/1983 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/1984 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/1985 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/10/1987 color:black layer:back\n  at:09/11/1988 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/03/1990 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/1991 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/1992 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/09/1993 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/10/1994 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/08/1995 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/1995 color:black layer:back \n  at:01/07/1997 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/10/1997 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/10/1998 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/1998 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/2000 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/2001 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/2002 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/2005 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/2007 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/2009 color:black layer:back\n  at:01/12/2011 color:black layer:back\n\n</timeline>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.carabao.net Official web site] (in Thai only)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carabao}}\n[[Category:Thai rock music groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1976]]\n[[Category:1976 establishments in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Carabao (band)| ]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabao_(band)"}
{"title_page": "Mass communication", "text_new": "{{Cleanup|reason=the article contains some incessant paragraphs and inaccurate claims.|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{short description|Large-scale dissemination of information}}\n{{about|the academic field of study|the actual means of mass communication|Mass media}}\n\n'''Mass communication''' is the process of imparting and exchanging [[information]] through [[mass media]] to large segments of the population. It is usually understood for relating to various forms of media, as these technologies are used for the dissemination of information, of which [[journalism]] and [[advertising]] are part of. Mass communication differs from other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] and [[organizational communication]], because it focuses on particular resources transmitting information to numerous receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the people receiving the information.\n\nNormally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called mass communication. But in a complete sense, mass communication can be understood as the process of extensive circulation of information within regions and across the globe.\n\nThrough mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to many people who generally stay far away from the sources of information. Mass communication is practiced multiple mediums, such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[social networking]], [[billboards]], [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[film]], and the [[Internet]].\n\n==Field of study==\nIn social science, mass communication is a sub-field of [[communication studies]]. Mass communication is \"the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience.\"<ref>Pearce 2009, p. 624</ref> This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior, and [[belief system]]s. Mass communication is commonly associated with [[media studies]]. \n\nIn the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of [[journalism]], [[television broadcasting|television]] and [[radio broadcasting]], [[film]], [[public relations]], or [[advertising]]. With the diversification of media forms, the study of mass communication has extended to include [[social media]] and [[new media]], which have stronger [[feedback]] models than traditional media sources.\n\nThe [[history of communication]] stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the [[Internet]]. Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers. Mass communication has moved from theories such as the [[hypodermic needle model]] (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as [[computer-mediated communication]].\n\n== Types of mass communication ==\n=== Advertising ===\n\n{{Main|Advertising}}\n\n'''Advertising''', in relation to mass communication, is [[marketing]] a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service. &nbsp;Because advertising generally takes place through some form of [[mass media]], such as [[television]], studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of products or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Journalism ===\n\n{{Main|Journalism}}'''Journalism''', is the production and distribution of [[Report|reports]] on events for presentation through the media. &nbsp;The study of journalism involves analyzing the dissemination of information to the public through [[mass media|media outlets]] such as [[newspapers]], [[news channel]], [[radio station]], [[television station]], and more recently, [[e-readers]] and [[smartphones]].\n\n'''Alternative Journalism''' deviates from established or dominant types of media in terms of their content, production, or distribution. Alternative journalism utilizes the same media outlets as mainstream journalism, to advocate the \"interests of those excluded from the mainstream.\n\n'''Civic journalism''' (also known as public journalism) is the idea of integrating journalism into the democratic process. The media not only informs the public, but it also works towards engaging citizens and creating public debate.\n\n'''Citizen journalism''' is based upon public citizens actively producing news and information. Citizen journalism deals with the distribution of news by the public, often through the Internet.\n\n=== Public relations ===\n\n{{Main|Public relations}}'''Public relations''' is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or [[organization]]. &nbsp;Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape [[public opinion]].

His failure to patent it resulted in two brothers, Louis and Auguste Lumiere creating a portable camera that could process film and project images.<ref name=\":0\" /> The invention quickly gained notoriety when the Lumiere brothers debuted a series of 60 second clips screened outdoors to a Parisian audience. Despite the ever-growing popularity of moving images, the Lumiere Brothers did not seek to revolutionize the style of film, but stuck to documenting daily life in France.

[[Communication theory]] addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.\n\n*[[Cultivation theory]], developed by [[George Gerbner]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]], discusses the long-term effects of watching television, and hypothesizes that the more television an individual consumes, the more likely that person is to believe the real world is similar to what they have seen on television.<ref>Gerbner, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., & Signorielli, N. (1986). \"Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process\" in J. Bryant & D. Zillman (Eds.), Perspectives on media effects (pp. 17\u201340) Hilldale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates</ref> Cultivation is closely related to the idea of the [[mean world syndrome]].\n*[[Agenda setting theory]] centers around the idea that media outlets tell the public \"not what to think, but what to think about.\" Agenda setting hypothesizes that media have the power to influence the public discourse, and tell people what are important issues facing society.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E.; Donald L. Shaw (1972). \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media\". Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176</ref>\n*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast. This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.<ref>Noelle-Neumann, E. (1974). The spiral of silence: a theory of public opinion. Journal of Communication, 24, 43-51</ref>\n*[[Media ecology]] hypothesizes that individuals are shaped by their interaction with media,<ref>Postman, Neil. \"The Humanism of Media Ecology\". Retrieved 9 November 2012</ref> and that communication and media profoundly affect how individuals view and interact with their environment.<ref>McLuhan, M.; Fiore Q.; Agel J. (1996).

San Francisco: HardWired. {{ISBN|978-1-888869-02-6}}</ref>\n*According to the [[Semiotic]] theory, communication characteristics such as words, images, gestures, and situations are always interpretive. All sign systems, entitled to be \u201cread\u201d or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as \u201ctexts.\u201d In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.<ref>Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies</ref>\n\n==Methods of study==\n\nCommunication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes. Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication. The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message. Several prominent methods of study are as follows:<ref>Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}</ref>\n\n*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions. To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.\n*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.\n*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script. This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.\n*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n\nThe [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}</ref> is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}</ref> and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations. Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Communication]]\n* [[Communication studies]]\n* [[Communication theory as a field]]\n* [[History of communication]]\n* [[Media influence]]\n* [[Media studies]]\n* [[Social science]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* Pearce, K.J.

It is usually understood for relating to various forms of media, as these technologies are used for the dissemination of information, of which [[journalism]] and [[advertising]] are part of. Mass communication differs from other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] and [[organizational communication]], because it focuses on particular resources transmitting information to numerous receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the people receiving the information.\n\nNormally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called mass communication. But in a complete sense, mass communication can be understood as the process of extensive circulation of information within regions and across the globe.\n\nThrough mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to many people who generally stay far away from the sources of information. Mass communication is practiced multiple mediums, such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[social networking]], [[billboards]], [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[film]], and the [[Internet]].\n\n==Field of study==\nIn social science, mass communication is a sub-field of [[communication studies]]. Mass communication is \"the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience.\"<ref>Pearce 2009, p. 624</ref> This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior, and [[belief system]]s. Mass communication is commonly associated with [[media studies]]. \n\nIn the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of [[journalism]], [[television broadcasting|television]] and [[radio broadcasting]], [[film]], [[public relations]], or [[advertising]]. With the diversification of media forms, the study of mass communication has extended to include [[social media]] and [[new media]], which have stronger [[feedback]] models than traditional media sources.\n\nThe [[history of communication]] stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the [[Internet]]. Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers. Mass communication has moved from theories such as the [[hypodermic needle model]] (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as [[computer-mediated communication]].\n\n== Types of mass communication ==\n=== Advertising ===\n\n{{Main|Advertising}}\n\n'''Advertising''', in relation to mass communication, is [[marketing]] a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service. &nbsp;Because advertising generally takes place through some form of [[mass media]], such as [[television]], studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of products or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Journalism ===\n\n{{Main|Journalism}}'''Journalism''', is the production and distribution of [[Report|reports]] on events for presentation through the media. &nbsp;The study of journalism involves analyzing the dissemination of information to the public through [[mass media|media outlets]] such as [[newspapers]], [[news channel]], [[radio station]], [[television station]], and more recently, [[e-readers]] and [[smartphones]].\n\n'''Alternative Journalism''' deviates from established or dominant types of media in terms of their content, production, or distribution. Alternative journalism utilizes the same media outlets as mainstream journalism, to advocate the \"interests of those excluded from the mainstream.\n\n'''Civic journalism''' (also known as public journalism) is the idea of integrating journalism into the democratic process. The media not only informs the public, but it also works towards engaging citizens and creating public debate.\n\n'''Citizen journalism''' is based upon public citizens actively producing news and information. Citizen journalism deals with the distribution of news by the public, often through the Internet.\n\n=== Public relations ===\n\n{{Main|Public relations}}'''Public relations''' is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or [[organization]]. &nbsp;Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape [[public opinion]]. Unlike advertising, public relations professionals only have control until the message is related to media gatekeepers who decide where to pass the information on to the audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Social media &nbsp;===\n\n{{Main|Social media}}\n\n'''Social media''', in its modern use, refers to platforms used on both mobile devices and home computers that allow users to interact through the use of words, images, sounds, and video.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social media includes popular sites such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as sites that can aid in business networking such as LinkedIn.The use and importance of social media in communications and public relations has grown drastically throughout the years and is now a staple in advertisements to mass audiences.

His failure to patent it resulted in two brothers, Louis and Auguste Lumiere creating a portable camera that could process film and project images.<ref name=\":0\" /> The invention quickly gained notoriety when the Lumiere brothers debuted a series of 60 second clips screened outdoors to a Parisian audience. Despite the ever-growing popularity of moving images, the Lumiere Brothers did not seek to revolutionize the style of film, but stuck to documenting daily life in France. This set the grounds for future film revolutionaries, including George Melies, who sought to create narrative sequences in his films through the use of special effects.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Television ====\n\n{{Main|Television}}\n\nIn the 1970s, television began to change to include more complicated and three-dimensional characters and plots. [[PBS]] launched in 1970, and was the home for programming that would not be suitable for network television. It operates on donations and little government funding, rather than having commercials. On January 12, 1971, the sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' premiered on [[CBS]], and covered the issues of the day and portrayed a bigot named [[Archie Bunker]].<ref name=\":0\" /> By 1972, the sales of color television sets surpassed that of black-and-white sets. In the 1980s, television became geared towards what has become known as the [[MTV]] Generation, with a surge in the number of cable channels.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Laura|date=June 22, 2009|title=A Brief History Of: Television|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=41555303&site=ehost-live&scope=site|journal=Time|volume=173|issue=24|pages=18|via=EBSCO Host}}</ref>\n\n=== Photography ===\n\n{{Main|Photography}}\n\nPhotography plays a role in the field of technology and mass communication by demonstrating facts or reinforcing ideas. &nbsp;Although the photos are altered digitally, it is still considered{{By whom|date=December 2018}} a proof to expose and communicate.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== History of photography ====\n\n[[Camera obscura|Camera Obscura]] one of the first techniques that lead to creating photos. It could create an image on a wall or piece of paper. &nbsp;[[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce|Joseph Niepce]] was a French inventor that took the first photo in the 1827 that required 8 hours of exposure. In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] introduced the daguerreotype that reduced exposure time to about thirty minutes. As the years progressed so did photography techniques, including creating better image quality, adding color to an imagine and reduced exposure time.\n\n==== Contemporary photography industry====\n\nThe modern industry has dramatically changed with the development of digital, as phones and digital cameras have made film-based cameras a niche product. Kodak discounted making color film in 1999 and declared Bankruptcy in 2012. Other companies like Fujifilm adapted despite a downturn in sales.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Interactive media ===\n==== Video games ====\n\n{{main|List of video game genres}}\n\nVideo game genres are a classification assigned to a video game based on its game play rather than a visual or storytelling differences. A video game genre is defined by a set of game play challenges and are classified independently of when and where the game takes place.\n\n==== Ethics in interactive media ====\n\nInteractive Media is a form of communication technique that refers to services on digital computer-based systems. This requires two or more parties who respond to each other through text, moving images, animation, video, audio, and video games.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Converging Media; A New Introduction to Mass Communication|last=Pavlik|first=John;|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York: Oxford University Press|pages=185}}</ref> The ethics in interactive media mainly focus on the violence of video games, advertising being influenced in different ways and [[behavioral targeting]].\n\nThe violence of video games relates to ethics in interactive media because it brings on aggressive attitude and behavior that impacts the social lives of the people playing these video games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=31654390-234a-4f36-9a4b-4b784bd45139%40pdc-v-sessmgr05&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=132015122&db=a9h|title=Violent Video Games, Externalizing Behavior, and Prosocial Behavior: A Five-Year Longitudinal Study During Adolescence.|last=Coyne|first=Sarah M|website=EBSCO}}</ref> Furthermore, behavioral targeting ties into the ethics of interactive media because these websites and apps on our phones contain our personal information which allow the owners or the ones running the companies to receive it and use them for themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=63353de8-598d-4bf0-9cd0-f6117d0a4e5c%40sdc-v-sessmgr04&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN=114334448|title=Protecting Personal Information: Achieving a Balance Between User Privacy and Behavioral Targeting|last=Myers|first=Patrick|website=EBSCO}}</ref> Interactive media influences advertising because by society using social media or any websites, we are able to see that there's advertising in everything we view especially when your scrolling through Instagram or those pop up ads that come up on your screen reading an article on your computer.\n\n=== EBooks ===\n\n{{main|E-book}}\n\neBooks have changed how people read.

In addition, the Kindle has added accessories including games, movies, and music.\n\n==Major theories==\nCommunication researchers have identified several major theories associated with the study of mass communication. [[Communication theory]] addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.\n\n*[[Cultivation theory]], developed by [[George Gerbner]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]], discusses the long-term effects of watching television, and hypothesizes that the more television an individual consumes, the more likely that person is to believe the real world is similar to what they have seen on television.<ref>Gerbner, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., & Signorielli, N. (1986). \"Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process\" in J. Bryant & D. Zillman (Eds.), Perspectives on media effects (pp. 17\u201340) Hilldale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates</ref> Cultivation is closely related to the idea of the [[mean world syndrome]].\n*[[Agenda setting theory]] centers around the idea that media outlets tell the public \"not what to think, but what to think about.\" Agenda setting hypothesizes that media have the power to influence the public discourse, and tell people what are important issues facing society.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E.; Donald L. Shaw (1972). \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media\". Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176</ref>\n*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast. This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.<ref>Noelle-Neumann, E. (1974). The spiral of silence: a theory of public opinion. Journal of Communication, 24, 43-51</ref>\n*[[Media ecology]] hypothesizes that individuals are shaped by their interaction with media,<ref>Postman, Neil. \"The Humanism of Media Ecology\". Retrieved 9 November 2012</ref> and that communication and media profoundly affect how individuals view and interact with their environment.<ref>McLuhan, M.; Fiore Q.; Agel J. (1996). The medium is the massage: an inventory of effects. San Francisco: HardWired. {{ISBN|978-1-888869-02-6}}</ref>\n*According to the [[Semiotic]] theory, communication characteristics such as words, images, gestures, and situations are always interpretive. All sign systems, entitled to be \u201cread\u201d or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as \u201ctexts.\u201d In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.<ref>Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies</ref>\n\n==Methods of study==\n\nCommunication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes. Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication. The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message. Several prominent methods of study are as follows:<ref>Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}</ref>\n\n*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions. To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.\n*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.\n*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script. This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.\n*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n\nThe [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}</ref> is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}</ref> and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations. Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Communication]]\n* [[Communication studies]]\n* [[Communication theory as a field]]\n* [[History of communication]]\n* [[Media influence]]\n* [[Media studies]]\n* [[Social science]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* Pearce, K.J.

In the [[liner notes]] to the 1993 reissue of ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]'', it was said by an unnamed member of the group that they \"nailed\" the album.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> By this point, Aerosmith had matured as a band, and Steven Tyler made [[sexual intercourse|sex]] the primary focus of his songwriting on the album.\n\nAccording to Douglas, \"Aerosmith was a different band when we started the third album. They'd been playing ''Get Your Wings'' on the road for a year and had become better players - different. It showed in the riffs that Joe [Perry] and Brad [Whitford] brought back from the road for the next album. ''Toys in the Attic'' was a much more sophisticated record than the other stuff they'd done.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=226}} In the band memoir ''Walk This Way'', guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] stated, \"When we started to make ''Toys in the Attic'', our confidence was built up from constant touring.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=227}} In his autobiography, Perry elaborated:\n\n{{quote|Our first two albums were basically {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} songs we'd been playing for years live in the clubs. With ''Toys'', we started from scratch. Making this record, we learned to be recording artists and write songs on a deadline. In the process, we began to see just what Aerosmith could accomplish. With everyone throwing in ideas, ''Toys'' was our breakthrough. That breakthrough was facilitated by Jack Douglas{{nbsp}}... In the studio he moved into the slot of the sixth member of the band.{{sfn|Perry|Ritz|p=146|2014}}}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{listen\n| type = music\n| filename = Walk This Way (Aerosmith) sample.ogg \n| title = \"Walk This Way\" \n| description = 20-second sample}}\n\nAerosmith's third album includes some of their best-known songs, including \"Walk This Way\", \"Sweet Emotion\" and the rollicking title track. \"Walk This Way\" starts with a two-measure drum beat intro by [[Joey Kramer]], followed by the well-known guitar riff by Perry. The song proceeds with the main riff made famous by Perry and [[Brad Whitford]] on guitar with [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] on an early 1960\u2019s Fender Jazz bass. The song continues with rapid-fire lyrics by [[Steven Tyler]]. The song originated in December 1974 during a sound check when Aerosmith was opening for [[the Guess Who]] in Honolulu, Hawaii. During the sound check, Perry was \"fooling around with riffs and thinking about [[the Meters]]\", a group guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] had turned him on to. Loving \"their riffy New Orleans [[funk]], especially '[[Cissy Strut]]' and 'People Say'\", he asked the drummer \"to lay down something flat with a groove on the drums.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The guitar [[riff]] to what would become \"Walk This Way\" just \"came off [his] hands.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Needing a bridge, he: {{quote|played another riff and went there. But I didn't want the song to have a typical, boring 1, 4, 5 chord progression. After playing the first riff in the key of C, I shifted to E before returning to C for the verse and chorus. By the end of the sound check, I had the basics of a song.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nWhen singer Steven Tyler heard Perry playing that riff he \"ran out and sat behind the drums and [they] jammed.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Tyler [[scat singing|scatted]] \"nonsensical words initially to feel where the lyrics should go before adding them later.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} When the group was halfway through recording ''Toys in the Attic'' in early 1975 at Record Plant in New York City, they found themselves stuck for material. They had written three or four songs for the album, having \"to write the rest in the studio.\" They decided to give the song Perry had come up with in Hawaii a try, but it didn't have lyrics or a title yet.{{sfn|Myers|2016}} In 1997, Perry recalled that the idea for the funky, [[James Brown]]-influenced \"Walk This Way\" was inspired by the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', which the band had gone to see around the time they were working on the track:\n\n{{quote|We were working on that song and we took a break to go see the movie in [[Times Square]]... and we came to the part where [[Marty Feldman]] as Igor limps down the steps of the train platform and says to [[Gene Wilder]], \"Walk this way,\" which Gene does with the same hideous limp. We fell over ourselves because it was so funny in a recognizably [[Three Stooges]] mode.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nAt the hotel that night, Tyler wrote lyrics for the song, but left them in the cab on the way to the studio next morning. He says: \"I must have been stoned. All the blood drained out of my face, but no one believed me. They thought I never got around to writing them.\" Upset, he took a cassette tape with the instrumental track we had recorded and a portable tape player with headphones and \"disappeared into the stairwell.\" He \"grabbed a few No. 2 pencils\" but forgot to take paper. He wrote the lyrics on the wall at \"the Record Plant's top floor and then down a few stairs of the back stairway.\" After \"two or three hours\" he \"ran downstairs for a legal pad and ran back up and copied them down.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The lyrics, which tell the story of a high-school boy losing his virginity, are sung quite fast by Tyler, with heavy emphasis being placed on the rhyming lyrics.\n\nIt was bassist Tom Hamilton who came up with the main lick on \"Sweet Emotion\". In 1997 during a band interview with Alan Di Perna of ''[[Guitar World]]'' the members discussed the evolution of the song, which owes a debt to the [[Jeff Beck]] composition \"Rice Pudding\" from the album ''[[Beck-Ola]]''.<ref name=\"diperna\"/> Hamilton recalled:\n\n{{quote|I wrote that line on bass, and I realized I should think of some guitar parts for it if I was ever going to get a chance to present it to the band. I didn't think I ever would{{nbsp}}... Steven had the idea of taking that intro riff, which became the chorus bass line under the \"sweet emotion\" part, and transposing it into the key of E, and making it a really heavy [[Led Zeppelin]]esque thing.<ref name=\"diperna\"/>}}\n\nMany Aerosmith fans believe that Tyler wrote all of the lyrics to \"Sweet Emotion\" about the tension and hatred between the band members and Joe Perry's wife. Tyler himself has said that only some of the lyrics were inspired by Perry's wife. It was stated in Aerosmith's tell-all autobiography ''[[Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith|Walk This Way]]'' and in an episode of ''[[Behind the Music]]'' that growing feuds between the band members' wives (including an incident involving \"spilt milk\" where Elyssa Perry threw milk over Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry) may have helped lead to the band's original lineup dissolving in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"VH1\"/>\n\nHamilton and Tyler also collaborated on \"Uncle Salty\", with Tyler recalling in his 2001 autobiography, \"Here I was thinking about an orphanage when I wrote those lyrics. I'd try to make the melody weep from the sadness felt when a child is abandoned.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}} Of the title track, Tyler added, \"Joe was jamming a riff and I started yelling, 'Toys, toys, toys{{nbsp}}...' Organic, immediate, infectious{{nbsp}}... I just started singing and it fit like chocolate and peanut butter. Joe plays his ass off on that song.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}}\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious recording on the album is \"You See Me Crying\", a complex piano ballad that was heavily orchestrated. Jack Douglas brought in a [[symphony orchestra]] for the song, which was conducted by [[Mike Mainieri]]. The song itself was written by Tyler and outside collaborator Don Solomon. Some of the band members became frustrated with the song, which took a long time to complete, due to the many complex drum and guitar parts. The band's label, [[Columbia Records]], was nonetheless very impressed with the song and the recording process. [[Bruce Lundvall]], then-president of Columbia Records walked in on the recording sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' when the band was working on the song and remarked: \"You guys got an incredible thing going here. I just came from a [[Herbie Hancock]] session and this is much more fun.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}} While Aerosmith were planning the \"Back in the Saddle\" concert tour and recording the ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'' album during 1984, a radio DJ played the song. Tyler, who was suffering memory loss at the time from years of drug use, liked \"You See Me Crying\" so much, he suggested his group record a cover version, only to be told by his bandmate Perry, \"It's ''us'', fuckhead.\"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011|p=119}}\n\nThe album also features a cover of [[Bullmoose Jackson]]'s \"Big Ten-Inch Record,\" originally an old R&B song recorded in 1952 and first heard by the band on a tape from [[Dr. Demento]]'s radio show on [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]]. Rather than produce a rock reimagining, Aerosmith's cover largely stays true to the original song, down to its jazz-style instrumentation. In the liner notes to ''[[Pandora's Box (album)|Pandora's Box]]'', Tyler insists that he sings \"'''cept'' on my big ten inch...\" not ''suck'' on my big ten inch,\" but laments that no one on earth believes him.<ref name=\"Pandora\"/>\n\nIn the 1997, Tyler shared his memories about writing and recording several of the LP's tracks with author [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]]:\n\n*\"No More No More\": \"On a song like 'No More No More', the lyrics came from my verbal diarrhea, a mishmash that I made up and eventually changed the lyrics to something cool{{nbsp}}... about life on the road: boredom, disillusion, [[Holiday Inn]]s, stalemate, jailbait. My diary.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=230}}\n*\"You See Me Crying\": \"This was when we had a string orchestra in to work on 'You See Me Crying', which I wrote with Don Solomon, a big production conducted by Mike Maineri.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}}\n*\"Sweet Emotion\": \"Frank Connally sold us to Leber-Krebs for what{{snd}}I don't know{{nbsp}}... On 'Sweet Emotion', we used these backward handclaps and four of us in the studio chanting, 'Fuck you, Frank.' If you play it backward, you can hear this.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=233}}\n*\"Uncle Salty\": \"Salty worked in a home for lost children and had his way with this little girl. That's what it's about. I'm the little girl, the orphaned boy. I put myself in that place. I'm Uncle Salty too.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n*\"Adam's Apple\": I don't remember anything except I arranged it and must have fought for credit. And I originally wanted to call the album ''Love at First Bite'' after the line in the song.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1975, the band started working at [[Record Plant Studios|The Record Plant]] in New York City for the album that became ''Toys in the Attic''. The sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' were produced by Douglas without Colcord{{snd}}the album was [[audio engineering|engineered]] by Jay Messina with assistant engineers Rod O'Brien, Corky Stasiak and Dave Thoener. The songs for ''Toys in the Attic'' were recorded with a Spectrasonics mixing board and a [[multitrack recording|16-track]] tape recorder.<ref name=\"notes1\" />\n\nPerry has stated that he wanted to call the LP ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'', which would be used for their next studio album.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AM1\" />\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n|rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev3score = (B+)<ref name=\"Christgau\" />\n|rev4 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"RS\" />\n}}\nContemporary reviews were originally mixed. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Gordon Fletcher compared negatively ''Toys in the Attic'' to ''Get Your Wings'' which, in his opinion, was \"testimony to the band\u2019s raw abilities\"; he criticised Douglas' production and wrote that, despite \"some good moments,\" the band did not avoid \"instances of directionless meandering and downright weak material.\"<ref name=\"RS 1975\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] was more positive and remarked the progress Aerosmith had done in such a short time, both musically and lyrically.<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> [[Greg Kot]] called the album a landmark of hard rock.<ref name=\"RS\" />\n\nReviews have become more positive over time. [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] remarked how Aerosmith \"finally perfected their mix of Stonesy raunch and Zeppelin-esque riffing\", thanks to \"a combination of an increased sense of songwriting skills and purpose\", creating on the album a new style which \"fully embraced sleaziness\" in Tyler's lyrics, backed by \"an appropriately greasy\" music.<ref name=\"AM1\" /> In his review for ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', Ben Mitchell found \"Aerosmith firing on all coke-clogged cylinders\" on ''Toys in the Attic'', he lauded all the songs in the album and called the arrangement of \"You See Me Crying\" \"a typical \u201970s rock extravagance.\"<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n\nWhen ''Toys in the Attic'' was released in April 1975,{{sfn|Huxley|2005|loc=eBook}} it eventually peaked at No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, 63 positions higher than ''Get Your Wings''.<ref name=\"AM2\" /> The single release of \"Sweet Emotion\" became a minor hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] reaching No. 36 in 1975 and \"Walk This Way\" reached No. 10 on the Hot 100 in 1977.<ref name=\"AM3\" />\n\nThe album would gain renewed attention in 1986, 11 years after its release, when [[hip-hop]] group [[Run DMC]] covered \"Walk This Way,\" which helped revive Aerosmith's then-flagging career as well as propel rap music to the mainstream.\n\nAerosmith make reference to the album and its lyrics in the song \"[[Legendary Child]]\" recorded in 2011. The line \"But we traded them toys for other joys\" refers to the title of the album and their struggles with addiction. It may also be referring to the title track of the same name. The line \"I took a chance at the high school dance never knowing wrong from right\" references lyrics from the songs \"Walk This Way\" and \"Adam's Apple\" respectively.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side one\n| title1 = [[Toys in the Attic (song)|Toys in the Attic]]\n| writer1 = [[Steven Tyler]], [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]\n| length1 = 3:07\n| title2 = Uncle Salty\n| writer2 = Tyler, [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]]\n| length2 = 4:09\n| title3 = Adam's Apple\n| writer3 = Tyler\n| length3 = 4:33\n| title4 = [[Walk This Way]]\n| writer4 = Tyler, Perry\n| length4 = 3:40\n| title5 = Big Ten Inch Record\n| writer5 = Fred Weismantel\n| length5 = 2:16\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side two\n| title1 = [[Sweet Emotion]]\n| writer1 = Tyler, Hamilton\n| length1 = 4:34\n| title2 = No More No More\n| writer2 = Tyler, Perry\n| length2 = 4:34\n| title3 = Round and Round\n| writer3 = Tyler, [[Brad Whitford]]\n| length3 = 5:03\n| title4 = [[You See Me Crying]]\n| writer4 = Tyler, Don Solomon\n| length4 = 5:12\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nPer liner notes.<ref name=\"notes1\" />  Track numbers refer to CD and digital releases of the album.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''Aerosmith'''\n*[[Steven Tyler]]{{snd}}vocals, keyboards, harmonica, percussion\n*[[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]{{snd}}lead guitar (except track 8, second solo on track 9), rhythm guitar on track 8, acoustic guitar, [[slide guitar]], backing vocals, percussion\n*[[Brad Whitford]]{{snd}}rhythm guitar (except tracks 8-9), lead guitar (track 8, first and coda solo on track 9)\n*[[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]]{{snd}}bass guitar, rhythm guitar (track 2)\n*[[Joey Kramer]]{{snd}}drums, percussion\n\n'''Additional musicians'''\n*Scott Cushnie \u2013 [[piano]] on \"Big Ten Inch Record\", and \"No More No More\"\n*Jay Messina \u2013 [[marimba|bass marimba]] on \"Sweet Emotion\"\n*[[Mike Mainieri]] -

In the [[liner notes]] to the 1993 reissue of ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]'', it was said by an unnamed member of the group that they \"nailed\" the album.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> By this point, Aerosmith had matured as a band, and Steven Tyler made [[sexual intercourse|sex]] the primary focus of his songwriting on the album.\n\nAccording to Douglas, \"Aerosmith was a different band when we started the third album. They'd been playing ''Get Your Wings'' on the road for a year and had become better players - different. It showed in the riffs that Joe [Perry] and Brad [Whitford] brought back from the road for the next album. ''Toys in the Attic'' was a much more sophisticated record than the other stuff they'd done.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=226}} In the band memoir ''Walk This Way'', guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] stated, \"When we started to make ''Toys in the Attic'', our confidence was built up from constant touring.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=227}} In his autobiography, Perry elaborated:\n\n{{quote|Our first two albums were basically {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} songs we'd been playing for years live in the clubs. With ''Toys'', we started from scratch. Making this record, we learned to be recording artists and write songs on a deadline. In the process, we began to see just what Aerosmith could accomplish. With everyone throwing in ideas, ''Toys'' was our breakthrough. That breakthrough was facilitated by Jack Douglas{{nbsp}}... In the studio he moved into the slot of the sixth member of the band.{{sfn|Perry|Ritz|p=146|2014}}}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{listen\n| type = music\n| filename = Walk This Way (Aerosmith) sample.ogg \n| title = \"Walk This Way\" \n| description = 20-second sample}}\n\nAerosmith's third album includes some of their best-known songs, including \"Walk This Way\", \"Sweet Emotion\" and the rollicking title track. \"Walk This Way\" starts with a two-measure drum beat intro by [[Joey Kramer]], followed by the well-known guitar riff by Perry. The song proceeds with the main riff made famous by Perry and [[Brad Whitford]] on guitar with [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] on an early 1960\u2019s Fender Jazz bass. The song continues with rapid-fire lyrics by [[Steven Tyler]]. The song originated in December 1974 during a sound check when Aerosmith was opening for [[the Guess Who]] in Honolulu, Hawaii. During the sound check, Perry was \"fooling around with riffs and thinking about [[the Meters]]\", a group guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] had turned him on to. Loving \"their riffy New Orleans [[funk]], especially '[[Cissy Strut]]' and 'People Say'\", he asked the drummer \"to lay down something flat with a groove on the drums.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The guitar [[riff]] to what would become \"Walk This Way\" just \"came off [his] hands.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Needing a bridge, he: {{quote|played another riff and went there. But I didn't want the song to have a typical, boring 1, 4, 5 chord progression. After playing the first riff in the key of C, I shifted to E before returning to C for the verse and chorus. By the end of the sound check, I had the basics of a song.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nWhen singer Steven Tyler heard Perry playing that riff he \"ran out and sat behind the drums and [they] jammed.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Tyler [[scat singing|scatted]] \"nonsensical words initially to feel where the lyrics should go before adding them later.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} When the group was halfway through recording ''Toys in the Attic'' in early 1975 at Record Plant in New York City, they found themselves stuck for material. They had written three or four songs for the album, having \"to write the rest in the studio.\" They decided to give the song Perry had come up with in Hawaii a try, but it didn't have lyrics or a title yet.{{sfn|Myers|2016}} In 1997, Perry recalled that the idea for the funky, [[James Brown]]-influenced \"Walk This Way\" was inspired by the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', which the band had gone to see around the time they were working on the track:\n\n{{quote|We were working on that song and we took a break to go see the movie in [[Times Square]]... and we came to the part where [[Marty Feldman]] as Igor limps down the steps of the train platform and says to [[Gene Wilder]], \"Walk this way,\" which Gene does with the same hideous limp. We fell over ourselves because it was so funny in a recognizably [[Three Stooges]] mode.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nAt the hotel that night, Tyler wrote lyrics for the song, but left them in the cab on the way to the studio next morning. He says: \"I must have been stoned. All the blood drained out of my face, but no one believed me. They thought I never got around to writing them.\" Upset, he took a cassette tape with the instrumental track we had recorded and a portable tape player with headphones and \"disappeared into the stairwell.\" He \"grabbed a few No. 2 pencils\" but forgot to take paper. He wrote the lyrics on the wall at \"the Record Plant's top floor and then down a few stairs of the back stairway.\" After \"two or three hours\" he \"ran downstairs for a legal pad and ran back up and copied them down.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The lyrics, which tell the story of a high-school boy losing his virginity, are sung quite fast by Tyler, with heavy emphasis being placed on the rhyming lyrics.\n\nIt was bassist Tom Hamilton who came up with the main lick on \"Sweet Emotion\". In 1997 during a band interview with Alan Di Perna of ''[[Guitar World]]'' the members discussed the evolution of the song, which owes a debt to the [[Jeff Beck]] composition \"Rice Pudding\" from the album ''[[Beck-Ola]]''.<ref name=\"diperna\"/> Hamilton recalled:\n\n{{quote|I wrote that line on bass, and I realized I should think of some guitar parts for it if I was ever going to get a chance to present it to the band. I didn't think I ever would{{nbsp}}... Steven had the idea of taking that intro riff, which became the chorus bass line under the \"sweet emotion\" part, and transposing it into the key of E, and making it a really heavy [[Led Zeppelin]]esque thing.<ref name=\"diperna\"/>}}\n\nMany Aerosmith fans believe that Tyler wrote all of the lyrics to \"Sweet Emotion\" about the tension and hatred between the band members and Joe Perry's wife. Tyler himself has said that only some of the lyrics were inspired by Perry's wife. It was stated in Aerosmith's tell-all autobiography ''[[Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith|Walk This Way]]'' and in an episode of ''[[Behind the Music]]'' that growing feuds between the band members' wives (including an incident involving \"spilt milk\" where Elyssa Perry threw milk over Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry) may have helped lead to the band's original lineup dissolving in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"VH1\"/>\n\nHamilton and Tyler also collaborated on \"Uncle Salty\", with Tyler recalling in his 2001 autobiography, \"Here I was thinking about an orphanage when I wrote those lyrics. I'd try to make the melody weep from the sadness felt when a child is abandoned.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}} Of the title track, Tyler added, \"Joe was jamming a riff and I started yelling, 'Toys, toys, toys{{nbsp}}...' Organic, immediate, infectious{{nbsp}}... I just started singing and it fit like chocolate and peanut butter. Joe plays his ass off on that song.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}}\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious recording on the album is \"You See Me Crying\", a complex piano ballad that was heavily orchestrated. Jack Douglas brought in a [[symphony orchestra]] for the song, which was conducted by [[Mike Mainieri]]. The song itself was written by Tyler and outside collaborator Don Solomon. Some of the band members became frustrated with the song, which took a long time to complete, due to the many complex drum and guitar parts. The band's label, [[Columbia Records]], was nonetheless very impressed with the song and the recording process. [[Bruce Lundvall]], then-president of Columbia Records walked in on the recording sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' when the band was working on the song and remarked: \"You guys got an incredible thing going here. I just came from a [[Herbie Hancock]] session and this is much more fun.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}} While Aerosmith were planning the \"Back in the Saddle\" concert tour and recording the ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'' album during 1984, a radio DJ played the song. Tyler, who was suffering memory loss at the time from years of drug use, liked \"You See Me Crying\" so much, he suggested his group record a cover version, only to be told by his bandmate Perry, \"It's ''us'', fuckhead.\"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011|p=119}}\n\nThe album also features a cover of [[Bullmoose Jackson]]'s \"Big Ten-Inch Record,\" originally an old R&B song recorded in 1952 and first heard by the band on a tape from [[Dr. Demento]]'s radio show on [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]]. Rather than produce a rock reimagining, Aerosmith's cover largely stays true to the original song, down to its jazz-style instrumentation. In the liner notes to ''[[Pandora's Box (album)|Pandora's Box]]'', Tyler insists that he sings \"'''cept'' on my big ten inch...\" not ''suck'' on my big ten inch,\" but laments that no one on earth believes him.<ref name=\"Pandora\"/>\n\nIn the 1997, Tyler shared his memories about writing and recording several of the LP's tracks with author [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]]:\n\n*\"No More No More\": \"On a song like 'No More No More', the lyrics came from my verbal diarrhea, a mishmash that I made up and eventually changed the lyrics to something cool{{nbsp}}... about life on the road: boredom, disillusion, [[Holiday Inn]]s, stalemate, jailbait. My diary.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=230}}\n*\"You See Me Crying\": \"This was when we had a string orchestra in to work on 'You See Me Crying', which I wrote with Don Solomon, a big production conducted by Mike Maineri.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}}\n*\"Sweet Emotion\": \"Frank Connally sold us to Leber-Krebs for what{{snd}}I don't know{{nbsp}}... On 'Sweet Emotion', we used these backward handclaps and four of us in the studio chanting, 'Fuck you, Frank.' If you play it backward, you can hear this.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=233}}\n*\"Uncle Salty\": \"Salty worked in a home for lost children and had his way with this little girl. That's what it's about. I'm the little girl, the orphaned boy. I put myself in that place. I'm Uncle Salty too.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n*\"Adam's Apple\": I don't remember anything except I arranged it and must have fought for credit. And I originally wanted to call the album ''Love at First Bite'' after the line in the song.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1975, the band started working at [[Record Plant Studios|The Record Plant]] in New York City for the album that became ''Toys in the Attic''. The sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' were produced by Douglas without Colcord{{snd}}the album was [[audio engineering|engineered]] by Jay Messina with assistant engineers Rod O'Brien, Corky Stasiak and Dave Thoener. The songs for ''Toys in the Attic'' were recorded with a Spectrasonics mixing board and a [[multitrack recording|16-track]] tape recorder.<ref name=\"notes1\" />\n\nPerry has stated that he wanted to call the LP ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'', which would be used for their next studio album.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}} <ref Name=AM1>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000189017 |label=Review |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate=7 April 2020 }}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n|rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev3score = (B+)<ref name=\"Christgau\" />\n|rev4 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"RS\" />\n}}\nContemporary reviews were originally mixed. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Gordon Fletcher compared negatively ''Toys in the Attic'' to ''Get Your Wings'' which, in his opinion, was \"testimony to the band\u2019s raw abilities\"; he criticised Douglas' production and wrote that, despite \"some good moments,\" the band did not avoid \"instances of directionless meandering and downright weak material.\"<ref name=\"RS 1975\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] was more positive and remarked the progress Aerosmith had done in such a short time, both musically and lyrically.<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> [[Greg Kot]] called the album a landmark of hard rock.<ref name=\"RS\" />\n\nReviews have become more positive over time. [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] remarked how Aerosmith \"finally perfected their mix of Stonesy raunch and Zeppelin-esque riffing\", thanks to \"a combination of an increased sense of songwriting skills and purpose\", creating on the album a new style which \"fully embraced sleaziness\" in Tyler's lyrics, backed by \"an appropriately greasy\" music.<ref name=\"AM1\" /> In his review for ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', Ben Mitchell found \"Aerosmith firing on all coke-clogged cylinders\" on ''Toys in the Attic'', he lauded all the songs in the album and called the arrangement of \"You See Me Crying\" \"a typical \u201970s rock extravagance.\"<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n\nWhen ''Toys in the Attic'' was released in April 1975,{{sfn|Huxley|2005|loc=eBook}} it eventually peaked at No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, 63 positions higher than ''Get Your Wings''.<ref name=\"AM2\" /> The single release of \"Sweet Emotion\" became a minor hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] reaching No. 36 in 1975 and \"Walk This Way\" reached No. 10 on the Hot 100 in 1977.<ref name=\"AM3\" />\n\nThe album would gain renewed attention in 1986, 11 years after its release, when [[hip-hop]] group [[Run DMC]] covered \"Walk This Way,\" which helped revive Aerosmith's then-flagging career as well as propel rap music to the mainstream.\n\nAerosmith make reference to the album and its lyrics in the song \"[[Legendary Child]]\" recorded in 2011.

Later he discovered and explored the music of [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] and [[Leo Kottke]], and further broadened his musical horizons by listening to [[Keith Jarrett]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Sun Ra]].<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\nWhile attending Colorado's Holy Cross Abbey, Gulezian studied [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Carl Jung]], and [[James Joyce]], who became a significant influence on his perception of language, music, linear time, Roman [[Catholicism]], and temporal reality.  While still in high school, Gulezian was introduced to John Fahey through [[Robbie Basho]].  After recording his first self-published album ''Snow'' on his own Aardvark Records imprint, Gulezian signed to John Fahey's [[Takoma Records]] label.  ''Snow'' was re-released in 1980 (with minor modifications) to a global audience on Takoma/Chrysalis as ''Unspoken Intentions.'' It received international critical acclaim, and established Gulezian as a visionary artist;  musicians such as [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] and [[Michael Hedges]] cited ''Unspoken Intentions'' as a major influence.<ref name=\"bio\" /> In the midst of Gulezian's accelerating professional success, the Takoma label went bankrupt.<ref name=\"amg-bio\" /> Disillusioned with the music industry, Gulezian returned to college and graduated with honors, with degrees in entrepreneurship and marketing from the [[University of Arizona]]\u2019s Eller Center for the Study of the Private Market Economy.<ref>[http://entrepreneurship.eller.arizona.edu/alumni/profiles/mgulezian.aspx ''Distinguished Alumni: Michael Gulezian''.

He founded the ''Timbreline Music'' label, releasing his third album ''Distant Memories & Dreams'' in 1992. He began touring again and released his fourth CD ''The Dare of an Angel'' in 1994. In 1997 Gulezian moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"republic\" /> In 2002 ''Unspoken Intentions'' was reissued on CD by [[Fantasy Records]]. His fifth CD was released in 2003 - the incendiary ''Language of the Flame,'' and followed in 2005 by the live recording ''Concert at St. Olaf College.''\n\nIn recent years Gulezian has played hundreds of concerts, and continues to present guitar workshops and master classes at colleges and universities across the United States. In addition to his live concerts, Gulezian has been featured in the United States on many radio and television broadcasts, and is regularly heard on [[NPR]].\n<!-- == Style and Technique == -->\n\n== Discography ==\n\n*  ''Snow'' (1979, Aardvark Records)\n*  ''Unspoken Intentions'' (1980, Takoma/Fantasy)\n*  ''Distant Memories and Dreams'' (1992, Timbreline Music)\n*  ''The Dare Of An Angel'' (1996, Timbreline Music)\n*  ''Language of the Flame'' (2003, Timbreline Music)\n*  ''Concert at St. Olaf College'' (2005, Timbreline Music)\n\n=== Collaborations, Compilations ===\n\n* ''Lights Out 5'' (1995, KINK FM 102)\n* ''L\u00e1grimas de arpa y luna'' (1996, Resistencia)\n* ''Takoma Eclectic Vol. 2'' (1998, Takoma Records)\n* ''Takoma Slide'' (1999, Takoma Records)\n* ''156 Strings: Nineteen Totally Original Acoustic Guitarists'' (2002, Cuneiform)\n* ''Bridges 9'' (2003, Pennsylvania Public Radio Associates)\n* ''The KUMD Sessions: Live from the Music Room #2'' (2003, KUMD)\n* ''Lights Out 9'' (2004, KINK FM 102/Boyd Coffee Company)\n* ''[[The Revenge of Blind Joe Death: The John Fahey Tribute Album]]'' (2006, Fantasy Records)\n\n=== Books, Sheet Music ===\n\n* ''Ian and Nisa''.

Later he discovered and explored the music of [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] and [[Leo Kottke]], and further broadened his musical horizons by listening to [[Keith Jarrett]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Sun Ra]].<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\nWhile attending Colorado\u2019s Holy Cross Abbey, Gulezian studied [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Carl Jung]], and [[James Joyce]], who became a significant influence on his perception of language, music, linear time, Roman [[Catholicism]], and temporal reality.  While still in high school, Gulezian was introduced to John Fahey through [[Robbie Basho]].  After recording his first self-published album ''Snow'' on his own Aardvark Records imprint, Gulezian signed to John Fahey\u2019s [[Takoma Records]] label.  ''Snow'' was re-released in 1980 (with minor modifications) to a global audience on Takoma/Chrysalis as ''Unspoken Intentions.'' It received international critical acclaim, and established Gulezian as a visionary artist;  musicians such as [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] and [[Michael Hedges]] cited ''Unspoken Intentions'' as a major influence.<ref name=\"bio\" /> In the midst of Gulezian's accelerating professional success, the Takoma label went bankrupt.<ref name=\"amg-bio\" /> Disillusioned with the music industry, Gulezian returned to college and graduated with honors, with degrees in entrepreneurship and marketing from the [[University of Arizona]]\u2019s Eller Center for the Study of the Private Market Economy.<ref>[http://entrepreneurship.eller.arizona.edu/alumni/profiles/mgulezian.aspx ''Distinguished Alumni: Michael Gulezian''.

He founded the ''Timbreline Music'' label, releasing his third album ''Distant Memories & Dreams'' in 1992. He began touring again and released his fourth CD ''The Dare of an Angel'' in 1994. In 1997 Gulezian moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"republic\" /> In 2002 ''Unspoken Intentions'' was reissued on CD by [[Fantasy Records]]. His fifth CD was released in 2003 - the incendiary ''Language of the Flame,'' and followed in 2005 by the live recording ''Concert at St. Olaf College.''\n\nIn recent years Gulezian has played hundreds of concerts, and continues to present guitar workshops and master classes at colleges and universities across the United States. In addition to his live concerts, Gulezian has been featured in the United States on many radio and television broadcasts, and is regularly heard on [[NPR]].\n<!-- == Style and Technique == -->\n\n== Discography ==\n\n*  ''Snow'' (1979, Aardvark Records)\n*  ''Unspoken Intentions'' (1980, Takoma/Fantasy)\n*  ''Distant Memories and Dreams'' (1992, Timbreline Music)\n*  ''The Dare Of An Angel'' (1996, Timbreline Music)\n*  ''Language of the Flame'' (2003, Timbreline Music)\n*  ''Concert at St. Olaf College'' (2005, Timbreline Music)\n\n=== Collaborations, Compilations ===\n\n* ''Lights Out 5'' (1995, KINK FM 102)\n* ''L\u00e1grimas de arpa y luna'' (1996, Resistencia)\n* ''Takoma Eclectic Vol. 2'' (1998, Takoma Records)\n* ''Takoma Slide'' (1999, Takoma Records)\n* ''156 Strings: Nineteen Totally Original Acoustic Guitarists'' (2002, Cuneiform)\n* ''Bridges 9'' (2003, Pennsylvania Public Radio Associates)\n* ''The KUMD Sessions: Live from the Music Room #2'' (2003, KUMD)\n* ''Lights Out 9'' (2004, KINK FM 102/Boyd Coffee Company)\n* ''[[The Revenge of Blind Joe Death: The John Fahey Tribute Album]]'' (2006, Fantasy Records)\n\n=== Books, Sheet Music ===\n\n* ''Ian and Nisa''.
