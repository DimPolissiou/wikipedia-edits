Its original name was UDMC Seafood Centre, which was later changed in 2000 to its current name. Popularised for housing several major local seafood restaurants, the seafood centre serves local favourites such as [[chilli crab]], [[black pepper crab]] and [[mee goreng]]. In 2005, the Seafood Centre was upgraded to give it a modernised look, and better facilities. Many of the features were revamped, and a number of old tenants vacated for new tenants to take their place.\n\nPlans for the seafood centre were first announced in July 1977, with five seafood restaurants from Upper East Coast Road.<ref name=\":1\"/> The owners of the restaurants were initially unhappy with the offer to move, citing reduced seating and patronage at the new site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Move to E.

For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the new location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a ''Straits Times'' reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre generally did well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the previous two years. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{Center|Marine Cove}}]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area&nbsp;C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located.

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.

Many of the features were revamped, and a number of old tenants vacated for new tenants to take their place.\n\nPlans for the seafood centre were first announced in July 1977, with five seafood restaurants from Upper East Coast Road.<ref name=\":1\"/> The owners of the restaurants were initially unhappy with the offer to move, citing reduced seating and patronage at the new site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Move to E.

Tenders for the restaurants were called in February 1985.<ref>{{cite news |title=New $5.4 m haunt for seafood lovers |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19850223-1.2.24.16 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1985 |accessdate=1 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=9 }}</ref>\n\nAfter renovations, the first six restaurants at the seafood centre opened for business in October 1985. For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the new location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a ''Straits Times'' reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre generally did well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the previous two years. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{Center|Marine Cove}}]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area&nbsp;C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located. It also used to have a [[bowling alley]] and a [[billiards]] saloon.\n\nConstruction of the East Coast Recreation Centre began in April 1980, and it was completed in early 1982 at a cost of $3.5&nbsp;million. Touted by its developer to have something for each member of the family, <ref>{{cite news |title=East Coast centre for recreation coming up |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19800119-1.2.54 |work=Business Times |location=Singapore |date=19 January 1980 |accessdate=15 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=12 }}</ref> it featured a computer library offering computer classes, a music school, an amusement room with video games, restaurants and sports facilities.<ref name=\":3\"/> Because of insufficient available parking spaces, an additional car park was initially opened on a grass verge; a permanent car park was eventually built.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where the grass is greener |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19821104-1.2.48 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=4 November 1982 |accessdate=15 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, as part of the new E-zone theme park, the complex underwent an eight-month renovation in 1996. Among the changes were the construction of a room and a building to house [[Sega]] gaming machines. With the renovation, all tenants but [[McDonalds]] moved out.<ref name=\":A\"/>\n\nThe location was sold to Rock Productions, [[New Creation Church]]'s business arm, in 2002, and it was subsequently renamed Marine Cove. With the land handed back to NParks in 2011, the area was closed for redevelopment the following year.<ref name=\":5\"/> The new Marine Cove featuring a greater variety of dining options and a {{cvt|3,500|m2}} children's playground at the redeveloped facility, reopened on 28&nbsp;June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marine Cove at East Coast Park to reopen end-June|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/marine-cove-at-east-coast/2900694.html}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|title = 2 new developments to offer visitors more recreational options at East Coast park|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast|website = The Straits Times|access-date = 13 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716011727/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast |archive-date=16 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Bedok Jetty===\n'''Bedok Jetty''' is the longest fishing jetty\u2014{{cvt|250|m}}\u2014in [[Singapore]]. It is located in [https://web.archive.org/web/20120330094954/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/images/park_images/ECP_MAP_E_F.JPG Area&nbsp;F] of East Coast Park.\n\nIt is the most popular jetty for fishing in Singapore, but it is also frequented by cyclists, [[rollerblade|rollerbladers]], joggers or park visitors since it is part of the East Coast Park.\n\nBedok Jetty was originally built by a local businessman Mr Yap Swee Hong at a cost of $1.5&nbsp;million in 1966. He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space. The enhancements were carried out with drainage upgrading for a {{cvt|230|m}} section of the Siglap Canal to the sea.\n\n===Parkland Green===\nParkland Green is a {{convert|4|ha|acres|abbr=on}} cluster of restaurants, cafes and shops next to Carpark C1. \n\nParkland Green opened to much fanfare in September 2014, and in its first few months of operation, experienced high footfall, especially on weekends. However, with the imposition of parking fees for its carpark and the opening of Marine Cove in June 2016, customer numbers and revenues decreased sharply in the second half of 2016.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |last=Singh |first=Bryna |date=11 December 2016 |title=Where are the crowds? |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808142457/https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |archive-date=8 August 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe park is accessible by East Coast Park Service Road with numerous exits along the [[East Coast Parkway]]. The place provides ample parking space with many carparks situated along with various areas of the park. [[SBS Transit]] Bus Service 401 stops along the East Coast Park Service Road from [[Bedok Bus Interchange]] during weekends and public holidays. [[Underpass]]es link the park to the nearby [[Marine Parade]] housing estate.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe park is also connected to other parks in Singapore through the Park Connector Network, being part of the Eastern Coastal Park Connector Network.

With a cast of one man, it was written for Northern Irish actor [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] and first titled \"Magee [[monologue]]\". It was inspired by Beckett's experience of listening\nto Magee reading extracts from ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' and ''[[From an Abandoned Work]]'' on the [[BBC Third Programme]] in December 1957.<ref>[[University of Reading]] Library MS 1227/7/7/1, as cited in James Knowlson, [http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm  \"''Krapp's Last Tape'': the evolution of a play\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424084731/http://english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}, ''[[Journal of Beckett Studies]]'' 1.1. <!--Needs date of publication and page numbers, inclusive-->: \"The first known holograph is contained in the ''\u00c9t\u00e9 56'' notebook in [[University of Reading|Reading University]] Library. It is headed ''Magee monologue'' and is dated 20 February 1958.\"</ref>\n\nIt is considered to be among Beckett\u2019s major dramas.\n\n==History==\n\n===First publication===\nIn a letter to a London bookseller Jake Schwartz on 15 March 1958, Beckett wrote that he had \"'four states, in typescript, with copious notes and dirty corrections, of a short stage monologue I have just written (in English) for Pat Magee. This was composed on the machine from a tangle of old notes, so I have not the [[Manuscript|MS]] to offer you.\"<ref>Letter to [[Jacob Schwartz (bookseller)|Jake Schwartz]], a bookseller in London, as qtd. in Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett\u2019s Drama: 1956\u20131976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 136; the quoted letter is held at the Beckett Collection, Humanities Research Center, [[University of Texas at Austin]], along with the typescript to which it refers.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ackerley and Gontarski, \"It was first published in ''[[Evergreen Review]]'' 2.5 (summer 1958), then in ''Krapp's Last Tape and Embers'' (Faber, 1959), and ''Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces'' (Grove, 1960).\"<ref>C. J. Ackerley, and S. E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 302.</ref> Beckett\u2019s own translation of the play into French, ''La Derni\u00e8re Bande'', was published in ''Les Lettres Nouvelles'' on 4 March 1959.\n\nThe available printed texts must not be taken as definitive. \"By the mid-1950s Beckett was already talking and working like a director. In a letter to [[Barney Rosset|Rosset's]] editorial assistant, Judith Schmidt, on 11 May 1959, Beckett referred to the ''staging'' of ''Krapp's Last Tape'' as its 'creation',\" and he made numerous significant changes to the text over the years as he was involved in directing the play.<ref>Stanley E. Gontarski, \"Beckett in Performance\" 200, in Lois Oppenheim, ed., ''Palgrave Advances in Samuel Beckett Studies'' (London: Palgrave, 2004).</ref>\n\n===Others===\nThe first German performance, on 28 September 1959, was directed by Walter Henn at Berlin's ''Schillertheater'', where 10 years later, on 5 October 1969, Samuel Beckett himself staged his text in a most successful performance (with [[Martin Held]] as Krapp).<br />\nThe first American performance, on 14 January 1960, was directed by [[Alan Schneider]] and starred [[Donald George Davis|Donald Davis]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Plot|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe curtain rises on \"[a] late evening in the future.\"<ref name=\"Samuel Beckett 1984\">[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 55.</ref> It is Krapp\u2019s 69th birthday and he hauls out his old tape recorder, reviews one of the earlier years \u2013  the recording he made when he was 39 \u2013 and makes a new recording commenting on the last 12 months.\n\nKrapp is sitting in his den, lit by the white light above his desk. Black-and-white imagery continues throughout.<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 486.</ref><ref>\"Martin Held talks to [[Ronald Hayman]]\", in ''[[The Times]]'', Saturday Review, 25 April 1970, as qtd. in James Knowlson and [[John Pilling]], ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 82.</ref>\n\nOn his desk are a tape-recorder and a number of tins containing reels of recorded tape.  He consults a  ledger. The tape he is looking to review is the fifth tape in Box 3. He reads aloud from the ledger but it is obvious that words alone are not jogging his memory. He takes childish pleasure in saying the word \u2018spool\u2019.\n\nThe tape dates from when he turned 39. His taped voice is strong and rather self-important.\n\nThe voice mentions that he\u2019s just celebrated his birthday alone \"at the wine house\" jotting down notes in preparation for the recording session later. His [[Intestine|bowel]] trouble is still a problem and one obviously exacerbated by eating too many bananas. \"The new light above my table is a great improvement,\"<ref>[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 57</ref> reports the 39-year-old Krapp, before describing how much he enjoys leaving it, wandering off into the darkness, so that he can return to the zone of light which he identifies with his essential self. He notes how quiet the night is.\n\nThe voice reports that he has just reviewed an old tape from when he was in his late twenties. It amuses him to comment on his impressions of what he was like in his twenties and even the 69-year-old Krapp joins in the derisory laughter. The young man he was back then is described as idealistic, even unrealistic in his expectations. The 39-year-old Krapp looks back on the 20-odd-year-old Krapp with the same level of contempt as the 20-odd-year-old Krapp appears to have displayed for the young man he saw himself for in his late teens. Each can see clearly the fool he was but only time will reveal what kind of fool he has become.\n\nThe voice reviews his last year, when his mother died. He talks about sitting on a bench outside the [[nursing home]] waiting for the news that she had died, but Krapp at 69 is more interested in his younger self's use of the rather archaic word \"viduity\" (Beckett had originally used \"widowhood\" in early drafts) than in the reaction of the voice on the tape to their mother's passing. He stops listening to look up the word in a large dictionary. He returns to the tape; when the moment comes, his younger self is in the process of throwing a rubber ball to a dog. He ends up simply leaving the ball with the creature even though a part of him regrets not hanging onto it as some kind of memento, but states that he will forever remember its feel in his hand.\n\nThe voice starts to describe the revelation he experienced at the end of a pier.<ref>Vivian Mercier, ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990) 6.</ref> Krapp grows impatient and gets worked up when his younger self starts enthusing about this. He fast-forwards almost to the end of the tape to escape the onslaught of words. Suddenly the mood has changed and he finds himself in the middle of a description of a romantic liaison between himself and a woman in a punt. Krapp lets it play out and then rewinds the tape to hear the complete episode. Throughout it he remains transfixed and visibly relives the moment while it is retold.\n\nAfterwards, Krapp carefully removes this tape, locates a fresh one, loads it, checks the back of an envelope where he has made notes earlier, discards them and starts. He is scathing when it comes to his assessment of his thirty-nine-year-old self and is glad to see the back of him. He finds he has nothing he wants to record for posterity, save the fact he \"Revelled in the word ''spool''.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 62.</ref>  But he does mention a trip to the park and attending [[Vespers]], where he dozed off and fell off the pew. He also mentions his recent literary disappointments: \"seventeen copies sold\", presumably of his last book, eleven of which have gone not to interested readers but to foreign libraries; \"Getting known,\" he sarcastically summarises. His sex life has been reduced to periodic visits by an old prostitute recalling the jibes made in ''[[Eh Joe]]'': \"That slut that comes on Saturday, you pay her, don't you? ... [[History of the British penny (1901-1970)|Penny]] a hoist tuppence as long as you like.\"<ref>[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 203.</ref>\n\nUnlike his younger selves, Krapp has nothing good to say about the man he has become and even the idea of making one \"last effort\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 63.</ref> when it comes to his writing upsets him. He retreats into memories from his dim and distant past, gathering holly and walking the dog of a Sunday morning. He then remembers the girl on the punt, wrenches off the tape he has been recording, throws it away and replays the entire section again from the previous tape. It is a scene of masochism reminiscent of Croak in ''Words and Music'', tormenting himself with an image of a woman\u2019s face. This time he allows the tape to play out. It ends with the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp determinedly not regretting the choices he has made, certain that what he would produce in the years to come would more than compensate him for any potential loss of happiness.\n\nKrapp makes no response to this but allows the tape to play on until the final curtain. \"Krapp\u2019s spool of life is almost wound, and the silent tape is both the time it has left to run and the silence into which he must pass.\"<ref>Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett\u2019s Drama: 1956\u20131976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 171.</ref> Whereas the younger Krapp talks about the \"fire in me\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> the tired old man who sits listening is simply \"burning to be gone.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The title of the play seems obvious, that what we have witnessed is the recording of Krapp\u2019s final tape, \"yet there is an [[ambiguity]]: 'last' can mean 'most recent' as well as 'ultimate'.  The speaker in [[Robert Browning|Browning's]] ''[[My Last Duchess]]'' is already planning to marry his next duchess ... Still, one hopes for Krapp's sake that he will be gone before another year is over.\"<ref>Vivian Mercier, ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990) 184.</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nIn ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', Beckett uses aspects of [[Judeo-Christian]]ity as the template for his play, in ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' the template is the writings of [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]], and in ''Krapp's Last Tape'', according to [[Anthony Cronin]], he uses [[Manichaeism]] as a structural device: <blockquote>The [[dichotomy]] of light and dark ... is central to Manichaean doctrine ... Its adherents believed that the world was ruled by evil powers, against which the god of the whole of creation struggled as yet in vain ... Krapp is in violation of the three seals or prohibitions of Manichaeism for the elect: the seal of the hands, forbidding engagement in a profession, the seal of the breast against sexual desire, and the seal of the mouth, which forbids the drinking of wine ... Beckett [however] seems to have known no more about Manichaeism than is contained in the eleventh edition of the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], which he possessed.<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 485, 486.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Characters==\nAlthough there is only one person onstage, there are a number of 'characters' mentioned throughout. The play is considered to be Beckett at his most autobiographical, and it does draw heavily on biographical detail. He once told the scholar Lawrence Harvey, though, that his \"work does not depend on experience \u2013 [it is] not a record of experience. Of course you use it.\"<ref>Undated interview with Lawrence Harvey, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 371, 372.</ref> Beckett takes elements from his own life, his failed love life, his drinking, his \u2013 at the time \u2013 literary failures and looks where things might have gone. \"When, in 1956, [[Vivian Mercier]] saw him in Paris, he told him that he felt 'all dried up, with nothing left but self-translation.'\"<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 472</ref>\n\n;Krapp\nKrapp was originally designated simply \u2018A\u2019 in the first draft. The first appearance of a title was \"a manuscript edition to Typescript 2: ''Crapp\u2019s Last Tape''\";<ref>Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett\u2019s Drama: 1956\u20131976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 138.</ref> the more familiar Germanic spelling came later. The name Krapp with its [[wikt:crap|excremental connotations]] had been used before by Beckett however. In his first play, ''[[Eleutheria (play)|Eleutheria]]'', dating back to 1947, the protagonist is Victor Krap, a young man who has decided to retreat from life and do nothing. He has been described as a world-weary [[anti-hero]], a failed writer and seedy [[Solipsism|solipsist]], a clear prototype for the later Krapp.<ref>Marius Buning (President, Dutch Samuel Beckett Society), ''[http://samuel-beckett.net/Eleutheria_Revisited.html Eleutheria Revisited]'', public lecture delivered at Teatro Quijano, [[Ciudad Real]], Spain, 2 December 1997.</ref>\n\n;Krapp (as a boy)\nWhen the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp is talking about his neighbour's ritual singing in the evening he tries to remember if he sang as a boy and is unable to do so. He does recall attending [[Vespers]] but it would be unusual for him to attend [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] without participating in the singing of the hymn. The sixty-nine-year-old Krapp sings a few lines from the \"Now the Day is Over\" in early performances of the play but Beckett excised this as being \"too clumsily explicit\".<ref>James Knowlson, [http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm \"''Krapp's Last Tape'': The Evolution of a play, 1958\u201375\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424084731/http://english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}, ''[[Journal of Beckett Studies]]'' 1 (Winter 1976): 54.</ref>\n\nAlthough no time frame is given, it is likely that sixty-nine-year-old Krapp's memories of being \"again in the dingle at Christmas Eve, gathering holly ...

All we learn about Krapp at this age comes from the tape. Like a lot of young men he is full of \"aspirations\" \u2013 his work is starting to take shape \u2013 and \"resolutions\" \u2013 he is already aware that his drinking needs to be curbed. He is becoming resigned to the fact that he might well have let true love \u2013 represented by the image of a \"girl in a shabby green coat, on a railway-station platform\" \u2013 get away from him. He has settled for an on/off relationship with a \"Bianca\" but even there his future plans do not feature her. We learn that his problem with constipation has been ongoing since at least this time. He disparages his youth and is glad it is over. The thirty-nine-year-old Krapp estimates that the tape he had been listening to was made some ten or twelve years earlier. If it was twelve then he would have been twenty-seven at the time it was recorded.\n\n;Bianca\n\"In the earlier drafts the woman with whom the young Krapp lived [later named \"Bianca\"] was first named 'Alba' (a character in ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'' modelled on Ethna MacCarthy whom he had loved when he was a young man), then 'Celia' (the name of the green-eyed prostitute with whom Murphy cohabits in ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''), then 'Furry' (nickname of Anne Rudmose-Brown, the wife of Beckett's French Professor at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity]], who was himself satirised as 'the Polar Bear' in ''Dream of Fair to Middling Women'').\".<ref>C. J. Ackerley, and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 303</ref>\n\nHe settled on 'Bianca', who was most likely based on another lecturer, Bianca Esposito, who (along with [[Walter Starkie]]) taught him Italian and cultivated his lifelong passion for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]].  He took private lessons from Signorina Esposito as well.  Those lessons at 21 Ely Place were then caricatured in the short story '[[More Pricks Than Kicks|Dante and the Lobster]]'.

His voice is contained on Tape 5 from Box 3. His voice is strong and rather pompous. He has celebrated his birthday alone in an empty wine house before returning home to consume three bananas. As has become his practice on his birthday he makes a tape looking back at who he was, assessing who he is and anticipating what might be to come.

Although not an obvious symbol of death, this ball is a significant [[Motif (literature)|motif]] of childhood grief for Beckett though none of his biographers propose that the presence of the dog is anything more than artistic license.\n\n;The girl in the punt\nBeckett makes the relationship of this woman to Krapp clear when \"[i]n 1975, directing Pierre Chabert in Paris, Beckett said: 'I thought of writing a play on the opposite situation, with ''Mrs Krapp, the girl in the punt'', nagging away behind him, in which case his failure and his solitude would be exactly the same.'\"<ref>C.

Summer, traditionally the time for light reading, found Peggy tearfully engrossed in [[Theodor Fontane]]'s novel, ''[[Effi Briest]]''. Beckett read it too, but with more detachment than Peggy, who wept and suffered as Effi's infidelity ended her marriage.\"<ref>[[Deirdre Bair]], ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990) 91.</ref> Talking to James Knowlson, a few days before his death, Beckett said that he \"did not remember the scene this way, however, denying that girl in the boat ... had anything at all to do with his cousin, Peggy.\"<ref>Interview with James Knowlson, 17 November 1989, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 443. From the emendations made by James Knowlson in ''Beckett Remembering / Remembering Beckett'' published in 2006, it appears that Beckett\u2019s memory about those events could have been inaccurate.</ref> Knowlson feels \"that there is little doubt the source for the girl with the haunting eyes is Ethna MacCarthy. For, as ''Dream of Fair to Middling Women'' had made clear ... the 'Alba', who, on Beckett\u2019s own admission, was closely modelled on Ethna, had eyes like dark, deep pools.\"<ref>Interview with James Knowlson, 13 September 1989, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 443.</ref> Beckett left no doubt however when he told Jean Martin, whilst rehearsing the play in 1970, that the girl was modelled on Ethna.<ref>James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 576.</ref> On 11 December 1957 Beckett learned that Ethna was terminally ill and regularly wrote uncharacteristically long letters until her death. When he completed the play he wrote her: \"I\u2019ve written in English a stage monologue for Pat Magee which I think you will like if no one else.\"<ref>Letter to Ethna MacCarthy, 2 June 1958, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 442.</ref>\n\nAt one point in the recollection, the young Krapp leans over the young woman to shade her from the sun. \"Let me in,\" he says. This caused the [[Lord Chamberlain]] some concerns when the play was first presented before him to grant a [[Lord Chamberlain#Theatre censorship|license]]. He believed that what was being suggested was a desire for sexual penetration and was not convinced that Beckett was simply alluding to her eyes. It was not until a mere three weeks before the play's opening that the objection was dropped. In 1982 Beckett, in response to a similar suggestion from one of James Knowlson's [[Graduate school|postgraduate students]], \"said with a chuckle, 'Tell her to read her texts more carefully. She'll see that Krapp would need to have a penis at an angle of a hundred and eighty degrees to make coitus possible in the position he is in!'\"<ref>James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 451.</ref>\u2013\u2013a position that Rosette Lamont proposes also \"suggests that of a [[Breastfeeding|suckling babe]].\"<ref>Rosette Lamont, \"Beckett's ''Eh Joe'': Lending an Ear to the Anima\", 234 in ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'', ed.

The first line of the play explicitly sets it 'in the future',<ref>Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett\u2019s Drama: 1956\u20131976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 137:  \"A specific date variously tried out at the opening of Typescript 3 is ... subsequently omitted: '<s>April 1986</s>. A late evening [sic] <s>in 1985</s> the nineteen eighties' [amended to simply] 'in the future' in the final text.\"</ref> although nothing onstage reveals this. Beckett wrote this play shortly before he turned 52 years old. As it happens, with ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', success had found him but, at 39, the future must have seemed a lot bleaker for the writer, the Second World War was ending and all Beckett had had published were a few poems, a collection of short stories and the novel, ''Murphy''. Beckett had this to say about the drained old man we see onstage: \"Krapp sees very clearly that he\u2019s through with his work, with love and religion.\"<ref>\"Martin Held talks to [[Ronald Hayman]]\", ''[[The Times]]'' 25 April 1970, Saturday Review; qtd. in James Knowlson and John Pilling, ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 82.</ref> He told [[Rick Cluchey]], whom he directed in 1977, that Krapp was \"in no way senile [but has] something frozen about him [and is] filled up to his teeth with bitterness.\"<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 484, 485.</ref>  \"Habit, the great deadener\"<ref>[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Waiting for Godot'', (1956; London: Faber and Faber, 1988) 91.</ref> has proven more tenacious than inspiration. His \"present concerns revolve around the gratification of those very bodily appetites that, earlier, he had resolved should be out of his life. Eating bananas and drinking have become a [daily routine]. Of the physical activities that he once considered excesses only sex has come to play a reduced part in his lonely existence\"<ref>James Knowlson and John Pilling, ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 81.</ref> in the form of periodic visits from an old prostitute.\n\nAlthough this is a play about memory, the sixty-nine-year-old Krapp himself remembers very little. Virtually all the recollections come from the tape. As evidenced most clearly in the novel ''Murphy'', Beckett had a decent understanding of a variety of mental illnesses including [[Korsakoff's syndrome|Korsakoff's Alcoholic Syndrome]]\u2013\u2013\"A [[hypomania]]c teaching slosh to a Korsakow's syndrome.\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, ''Murphy'', (London: John Calder, 1963) 96</ref>\u2013\u2013which is characterised by powerful [[Amnesia|amnesic]] symptoms accompanied by [[Bowel obstruction|intestinal obstruction]].\n\nIn his focus on [[Alcoholism|chronic alcohol consumption]], Narinder Kapur explains in ''Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice'' that it can lead to marked memory loss and generalised cognitive defects, as well as \"disorientation for time and also place\". More recent memories are likely to be forgotten than remote memories, for \"memory loss shows a temporal gradient with greater sparing of items from earlier years.\"<ref>N. Kapur, ''Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice'' (London: Butterworth, 1988) 158.</ref> Krapp's gathering of red-berried [[holly]] in the dingle could be an example of the \"relatively intact remote memory\"<ref>P. Whitehouse, ed., ''Dementia'' (Philadelphia: F A Davis, 1998) 328.</ref> that preceded Krapp's apparent addiction to alcohol.\n\nKrapp is not a textbook case. He is an individual with his own individual symptomology but he is more than a list of symptoms. Bananas contain [[pectin]], a soluble fibre that can help normalise movement through the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] and ease constipation. Bananas can also aggravate constipation especially in young children. It depends what the root cause of the problem is. They are also high in Vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]] and [[Vitamin C|C]] as well as [[niacin]], [[riboflavin]] and [[thiamine]] and one of the root causes of Korsakoff's Syndrome is thiamine deficiency; eating bananas would be good for him. It is easy to get caught up in this kind of over-analysis to the detriment of the play as a whole. \"[A]ttempts to demonstrate that Beckett's characters conform to specific psychological syndromes so often turn into [[Will-o'-the-wisp|will-o-the-wisp]] pursuits. Certainly, Beckett would not deny that psychologists have offered very useful descriptions of mental activity. But their theories are typically no more than initial steps in an understanding of mental processes, fragmented bits of knowledge which should not be taken for universal principles.\"<ref>R.

In a letter to [[Barney Rosset|Rosset's]] editorial assistant, Judith Schmidt, on 11 May 1959, Beckett referred to the ''staging'' of ''Krapp's Last Tape'' as its 'creation',\" and he made numerous significant changes to the text over the years as he was involved in directing the play.<ref>Stanley E.

Black-and-white imagery continues throughout.<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 486.</ref><ref>\"Martin Held talks to [[Ronald Hayman]]\", in ''[[The Times]]'', Saturday Review, 25 April 1970, as qtd. in James Knowlson and [[John Pilling]], ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 82.</ref>\n\nOn his desk are a tape-recorder and a number of tins containing reels of recorded tape.  He consults a  ledger. The tape he is looking to review is the fifth tape in Box 3. He reads aloud from the ledger but it is obvious that words alone are not jogging his memory. He takes childish pleasure in saying the word \u2018spool\u2019.\n\nThe tape dates from when he turned 39. His taped voice is strong and rather self-important.\n\nThe voice mentions that he\u2019s just celebrated his birthday alone \"at the wine house\" jotting down notes in preparation for the recording session later. His [[Intestine|bowel]] trouble is still a problem and one obviously exacerbated by eating too many bananas. \"The new light above my table is a great improvement,\"<ref>[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 57</ref> reports the 39-year-old Krapp, before describing how much he enjoys leaving it, wandering off into the darkness, so that he can return to the zone of light which he identifies with his essential self. He notes how quiet the night is.\n\nThe voice reports that he has just reviewed an old tape from when he was in his late twenties. It amuses him to comment on his impressions of what he was like in his twenties and even the 69-year-old Krapp joins in the derisory laughter. The young man he was back then is described as idealistic, even unrealistic in his expectations. The 39-year-old Krapp looks back on the 20-odd-year-old Krapp with the same level of contempt as the 20-odd-year-old Krapp appears to have displayed for the young man he saw himself for in his late teens. Each can see clearly the fool he was but only time will reveal what kind of fool he has become.\n\nThe voice reviews his last year, when his mother died. He talks about sitting on a bench outside the [[nursing home]] waiting for the news that she had died, but Krapp at 69 is more interested in his younger self's use of the rather archaic word \"viduity\" (Beckett had originally used \"widowhood\" in early drafts) than in the reaction of the voice on the tape to their mother's passing. He stops listening to look up the word in a large dictionary. He returns to the tape; when the moment comes, his younger self is in the process of throwing a rubber ball to a dog. He ends up simply leaving the ball with the creature even though a part of him regrets not hanging onto it as some kind of memento, but states that he will forever remember its feel in his hand.\n\nThe voice starts to describe the revelation he experienced at the end of a pier.<ref>Vivian Mercier, ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990) 6.</ref> Krapp grows impatient and gets worked up when his younger self starts enthusing about this. He fast-forwards almost to the end of the tape to escape the onslaught of words. Suddenly the mood has changed and he finds himself in the middle of a description of a romantic liaison between himself and a woman in a punt. Krapp lets it play out and then rewinds the tape to hear the complete episode. Throughout it he remains transfixed and visibly relives the moment while it is retold.\n\nAfterwards, Krapp carefully removes this tape, locates a fresh one, loads it, checks the back of an envelope where he has made notes earlier, discards them and starts. He is scathing when it comes to his assessment of his thirty-nine-year-old self and is glad to see the back of him. He finds he has nothing he wants to record for posterity, save the fact he \"Revelled in the word ''spool''.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 62.</ref>  But he does mention a trip to the park and attending [[Vespers]], where he dozed off and fell off the pew. He also mentions his recent literary disappointments: \"seventeen copies sold\", presumably of his last book, eleven of which have gone not to interested readers but to foreign libraries; \"Getting known,\" he sarcastically summarises. His sex life has been reduced to periodic visits by an old prostitute recalling the jibes made in ''[[Eh Joe]]'': \"That slut that comes on Saturday, you pay her, don't you? ...

It is a scene of masochism reminiscent of Croak in ''Words and Music'', tormenting himself with an image of a woman\u2019s face. This time he allows the tape to play out. It ends with the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp determinedly not regretting the choices he has made, certain that what he would produce in the years to come would more than compensate him for any potential loss of happiness.\n\nKrapp makes no response to this but allows the tape to play on until the final curtain. \"Krapp\u2019s spool of life is almost wound, and the silent tape is both the time it has left to run and the silence into which he must pass.\"<ref>Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett\u2019s Drama: 1956\u20131976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 171.</ref> Whereas the younger Krapp talks about the \"fire in me\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> the tired old man who sits listening is simply \"burning to be gone.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The title of the play seems obvious, that what we have witnessed is the recording of Krapp\u2019s final tape, \"yet there is an [[ambiguity]]: 'last' can mean 'most recent' as well as 'ultimate'.

Its adherents believed that the world was ruled by evil powers, against which the god of the whole of creation struggled as yet in vain ... Krapp is in violation of the three seals or prohibitions of Manichaeism for the elect: the seal of the hands, forbidding engagement in a profession, the seal of the breast against sexual desire, and the seal of the mouth, which forbids the drinking of wine ... Beckett [however] seems to have known no more about Manichaeism than is contained in the eleventh edition of the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], which he possessed.<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 485, 486.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Characters==\nAlthough there is only one person onstage, there are a number of 'characters' mentioned throughout. The play is considered to be Beckett at his most autobiographical, and it does draw heavily on biographical detail. He once told the scholar Lawrence Harvey, though, that his \"work does not depend on experience \u2013 [it is] not a record of experience. Of course you use it.\"<ref>Undated interview with Lawrence Harvey, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 371, 372.</ref> Beckett takes elements from his own life, his failed love life, his drinking, his \u2013 at the time \u2013 literary failures and looks where things might have gone. \"When, in 1956, [[Vivian Mercier]] saw him in Paris, he told him that he felt 'all dried up, with nothing left but self-translation.'\"<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 472</ref>\n\n;Krapp\nKrapp was originally designated simply \u2018A\u2019 in the first draft.

The name Krapp with its [[wikt:crap|excremental connotations]] had been used before by Beckett however. In his first play, ''[[Eleutheria (play)|Eleutheria]]'', dating back to 1947, the protagonist is Victor Krap, a young man who has decided to retreat from life and do nothing. He has been described as a world-weary [[anti-hero]], a failed writer and seedy [[Solipsism|solipsist]], a clear prototype for the later Krapp.<ref>Marius Buning (President, Dutch Samuel Beckett Society), ''[http://samuel-beckett.net/Eleutheria_Revisited.html Eleutheria Revisited]'', public lecture delivered at Teatro Quijano, [[Ciudad Real]], Spain, 2 December 1997.</ref>\n\n;Krapp (as a boy)\nWhen the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp is talking about his neighbour's ritual singing in the evening he tries to remember if he sang as a boy and is unable to do so. He does recall attending [[Vespers]] but it would be unusual for him to attend [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] without participating in the singing of the hymn. The sixty-nine-year-old Krapp sings a few lines from the \"Now the Day is Over\" in early performances of the play but Beckett excised this as being \"too clumsily explicit\".<ref>James Knowlson, [http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm \"''Krapp's Last Tape'': The Evolution of a play, 1958\u201375\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424084731/http://english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Knowlson2.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}, ''[[Journal of Beckett Studies]]'' 1 (Winter 1976): 54.</ref>\n\nAlthough no time frame is given, it is likely that sixty-nine-year-old Krapp's memories of being \"again in the dingle at Christmas Eve, gathering holly ...

All we learn about Krapp at this age comes from the tape. Like a lot of young men he is full of \"aspirations\" \u2013 his work is starting to take shape \u2013 and \"resolutions\" \u2013 he is already aware that his drinking needs to be curbed. He is becoming resigned to the fact that he might well have let true love \u2013 represented by the image of a \"girl in a shabby green coat, on a railway-station platform\" \u2013 get away from him. He has settled for an on/off relationship with a \"Bianca\" but even there his future plans do not feature her. We learn that his problem with constipation has been ongoing since at least this time. He disparages his youth and is glad it is over. The thirty-nine-year-old Krapp estimates that the tape he had been listening to was made some ten or twelve years earlier. If it was twelve then he would have been twenty-seven at the time it was recorded.\n\n;Bianca\n\"In the earlier drafts the woman with whom the young Krapp lived [later named \"Bianca\"] was first named 'Alba' (a character in ''[[Dream of Fair to Middling Women]]'' modelled on Ethna MacCarthy whom he had loved when he was a young man), then 'Celia' (the name of the green-eyed prostitute with whom Murphy cohabits in ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]''), then 'Furry' (nickname of Anne Rudmose-Brown, the wife of Beckett's French Professor at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity]], who was himself satirised as 'the Polar Bear' in ''Dream of Fair to Middling Women'').\".<ref>C. J. Ackerley, and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 303</ref>\n\nHe settled on 'Bianca', who was most likely based on another lecturer, Bianca Esposito, who (along with [[Walter Starkie]]) taught him Italian and cultivated his lifelong passion for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]].  He took private lessons from Signorina Esposito as well.  Those lessons at 21 Ely Place were then caricatured in the short story '[[More Pricks Than Kicks|Dante and the Lobster]]'. Kedar Street is not a real location but an [[anagram]] of 'darke' or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for 'black'.<ref>C. J. Ackerley, and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 182.</ref>  Keeping this in mind, the name may simply have been selected because \"''bianca''\" means \"white woman\" in Italian. Little is recorded about her other than \"'a tribute to her eyes. Very warm.'\"<ref>[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), 58.</ref>  [[Vivian Mercier]], who knew Beckett personally, writes: \"Although I do not recall his ever using the phrase, Beckett unquestionably regards the eyes as the windows of the soul.\"<ref>Mercier, V., ''Beckett/Beckett'' (London: Souvenir Press, 1990), p 131</ref>\n\n;Krapp's father\nKrapp\u2019s father, the only other man mentioned in the play, is spoken of only very briefly. The expression \"Last illness\" suggests he has not been a well man for some time and dies while Krapp is in his twenties.

Knowlson, eds, ''Beckett Remembering / Remembering Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2006) 37.</ref>\n\n;Krapp (aged 39)\nThis character does the majority of the talking throughout the play. His voice is contained on Tape 5 from Box 3. His voice is strong and rather pompous. He has celebrated his birthday alone in an empty wine house before returning home to consume three bananas. As has become his practice on his birthday he makes a tape looking back at who he was, assessing who he is and anticipating what might be to come. His is as disparaging of the young man he was in his twenties as he was then of the youth he had been thinking about when he made that earlier tape. He records the death of his mother, an epiphany at the end of a pier and an idyllic moment in a [[Punt (boat)|punt]].\n\n;Old Mrs McGlome\nThis character is based on Miss Beamish, an eccentric novelist from [[Connacht]] whom Beckett had met in [[Roussillon]], while hiding during [[World War II]]. \"Whether the real Miss Beamish did actually sing regularly every evening is ... debatable. Beckett did not remember this.\"<ref>Interview with James Knowlson, July 1989, cited in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 330, 331.</ref>\n\n;The dark young beauty\nThere appears to be no direct correlation between this character and anyone living.

Beckett had made the trip over in the early summer to be with her. By 24 July medical opinion confirmed that she was dying. During that last long month he used \"to walk disconsolately alone along the [[towpath]] of the Grand Canal.\"<ref>James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 382.</ref>\n\nTowards the end she was oblivious to his presence. Her death took place while he was sitting on a bench by the canal. \"At a certain point he happened to look up. The blinds of his mother\u2019s window, a dirty red-brown affair, was down. She was dead.\"<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 407.</ref>  A drawn blind, an old custom signifying death, also makes an appearance in ''[[Rockaby]]'': \"let down the blind and down\".<ref>Cronin, citing Samuel Beckett, ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 281.</ref>\n\n;The little white dog\nWhen Krapp\u2019s mother died, he was throwing a ball for a little white dog. He says he will keep it forever: \"But I gave it away to the dog.\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 60.</ref> Significantly the ball is black to contrast with the white of the dog. In ''All Strange Away'' a \"small grey punctured rubber ball\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, \"All Strange Away\", in ''Beckett Short No 3'' (London: Calder Publication [1976] 1999) 33.</ref> is the last object contemplated before Fancy dies. The ball had already appeared in ''[[All That Fall]]'': Jerry returns \"a kind of ball\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, ''Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1984) 38.</ref> to Mr. Rooney.  Although not an obvious symbol of death, this ball is a significant [[Motif (literature)|motif]] of childhood grief for Beckett though none of his biographers propose that the presence of the dog is anything more than artistic license.\n\n;The girl in the punt\nBeckett makes the relationship of this woman to Krapp clear when \"[i]n 1975, directing Pierre Chabert in Paris, Beckett said: 'I thought of writing a play on the opposite situation, with ''Mrs Krapp, the girl in the punt'', nagging away behind him, in which case his failure and his solitude would be exactly the same.'\"<ref>C. J. Ackerley and Stanley E. Gontarski, eds., ''The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 303.</ref> In her biography of Beckett, [[Deirdre Bair]] deduces that \"the girl in the punt\" may be [[Peggy Sinclair]] because of the references to \"Effi\" and to \"the [[Baltic states|Baltic]]\": in July 1929 Beckett vacationed with the Sinclairs \"in one of the smaller resort towns along the [[Baltic Sea]]. Summer, traditionally the time for light reading, found Peggy tearfully engrossed in [[Theodor Fontane]]'s novel, ''[[Effi Briest]]''. Beckett read it too, but with more detachment than Peggy, who wept and suffered as Effi's infidelity ended her marriage.\"<ref>[[Deirdre Bair]], ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990) 91.</ref> Talking to James Knowlson, a few days before his death, Beckett said that he \"did not remember the scene this way, however, denying that girl in the boat ... had anything at all to do with his cousin, Peggy.\"<ref>Interview with James Knowlson, 17 November 1989, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 443. From the emendations made by James Knowlson in ''Beckett Remembering / Remembering Beckett'' published in 2006, it appears that Beckett\u2019s memory about those events could have been inaccurate.</ref> Knowlson feels \"that there is little doubt the source for the girl with the haunting eyes is Ethna MacCarthy. For, as ''Dream of Fair to Middling Women'' had made clear ... the 'Alba', who, on Beckett\u2019s own admission, was closely modelled on Ethna, had eyes like dark, deep pools.\"<ref>Interview with James Knowlson, 13 September 1989, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 443.</ref> Beckett left no doubt however when he told Jean Martin, whilst rehearsing the play in 1970, that the girl was modelled on Ethna.<ref>James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 576.</ref> On 11 December 1957 Beckett learned that Ethna was terminally ill and regularly wrote uncharacteristically long letters until her death. When he completed the play he wrote her: \"I\u2019ve written in English a stage monologue for Pat Magee which I think you will like if no one else.\"<ref>Letter to Ethna MacCarthy, 2 June 1958, qtd. in James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 442.</ref>\n\nAt one point in the recollection, the young Krapp leans over the young woman to shade her from the sun. \"Let me in,\" he says. This caused the [[Lord Chamberlain]] some concerns when the play was first presented before him to grant a [[Lord Chamberlain#Theatre censorship|license]]. He believed that what was being suggested was a desire for sexual penetration and was not convinced that Beckett was simply alluding to her eyes. It was not until a mere three weeks before the play's opening that the objection was dropped. In 1982 Beckett, in response to a similar suggestion from one of James Knowlson's [[Graduate school|postgraduate students]], \"said with a chuckle, 'Tell her to read her texts more carefully. She'll see that Krapp would need to have a penis at an angle of a hundred and eighty degrees to make coitus possible in the position he is in!'\"<ref>James Knowlson, ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996) 451.</ref>\u2013\u2013a position that Rosette Lamont proposes also \"suggests that of a [[Breastfeeding|suckling babe]].\"<ref>Rosette Lamont, \"Beckett's ''Eh Joe'': Lending an Ear to the Anima\", 234 in ''Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives'', ed.

The first line of the play explicitly sets it 'in the future',<ref>Rosemary Pountney, ''Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett\u2019s Drama: 1956\u20131976'' (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988) 137:  \"A specific date variously tried out at the opening of Typescript 3 is ... subsequently omitted: '<s>April 1986</s>. A late evening [sic] <s>in 1985</s> the nineteen eighties' [amended to simply] 'in the future' in the final text.\"</ref> although nothing onstage reveals this. Beckett wrote this play shortly before he turned 52 years old. As it happens, with ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', success had found him but, at 39, the future must have seemed a lot bleaker for the writer, the Second World War was ending and all Beckett had had published were a few poems, a collection of short stories and the novel, ''Murphy''. Beckett had this to say about the drained old man we see onstage: \"Krapp sees very clearly that he\u2019s through with his work, with love and religion.\"<ref>\"Martin Held talks to [[Ronald Hayman]]\", ''[[The Times]]'' 25 April 1970, Saturday Review; qtd. in James Knowlson and John Pilling, ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 82.</ref> He told [[Rick Cluchey]], whom he directed in 1977, that Krapp was \"in no way senile [but has] something frozen about him [and is] filled up to his teeth with bitterness.\"<ref>[[Anthony Cronin]], ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997) 484, 485.</ref>  \"Habit, the great deadener\"<ref>[[Samuel Beckett]], ''Waiting for Godot'', (1956; London: Faber and Faber, 1988) 91.</ref> has proven more tenacious than inspiration. His \"present concerns revolve around the gratification of those very bodily appetites that, earlier, he had resolved should be out of his life. Eating bananas and drinking have become a [daily routine]. Of the physical activities that he once considered excesses only sex has come to play a reduced part in his lonely existence\"<ref>James Knowlson and John Pilling, ''Frescoes of the Skull'' (London: John Calder, 1979) 81.</ref> in the form of periodic visits from an old prostitute.\n\nAlthough this is a play about memory, the sixty-nine-year-old Krapp himself remembers very little. Virtually all the recollections come from the tape. As evidenced most clearly in the novel ''Murphy'', Beckett had a decent understanding of a variety of mental illnesses including [[Korsakoff's syndrome|Korsakoff's Alcoholic Syndrome]]\u2013\u2013\"A [[hypomania]]c teaching slosh to a Korsakow's syndrome.\"<ref>Samuel Beckett, ''Murphy'', (London: John Calder, 1963) 96</ref>\u2013\u2013which is characterised by powerful [[Amnesia|amnesic]] symptoms accompanied by [[Bowel obstruction|intestinal obstruction]].\n\nIn his focus on [[Alcoholism|chronic alcohol consumption]], Narinder Kapur explains in ''Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice'' that it can lead to marked memory loss and generalised cognitive defects, as well as \"disorientation for time and also place\". More recent memories are likely to be forgotten than remote memories, for \"memory loss shows a temporal gradient with greater sparing of items from earlier years.\"<ref>N. Kapur, ''Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice'' (London: Butterworth, 1988) 158.</ref> Krapp's gathering of red-berried [[holly]] in the dingle could be an example of the \"relatively intact remote memory\"<ref>P. Whitehouse, ed., ''Dementia'' (Philadelphia: F A Davis, 1998) 328.</ref> that preceded Krapp's apparent addiction to alcohol.\n\nKrapp is not a textbook case. He is an individual with his own individual symptomology but he is more than a list of symptoms. Bananas contain [[pectin]], a soluble fibre that can help normalise movement through the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] and ease constipation. Bananas can also aggravate constipation especially in young children. It depends what the root cause of the problem is. They are also high in Vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]] and [[Vitamin C|C]] as well as [[niacin]], [[riboflavin]] and [[thiamine]] and one of the root causes of Korsakoff's Syndrome is thiamine deficiency; eating bananas would be good for him. It is easy to get caught up in this kind of over-analysis to the detriment of the play as a whole. \"[A]ttempts to demonstrate that Beckett's characters conform to specific psychological syndromes so often turn into [[Will-o'-the-wisp|will-o-the-wisp]] pursuits. Certainly, Beckett would not deny that psychologists have offered very useful descriptions of mental activity. But their theories are typically no more than initial steps in an understanding of mental processes, fragmented bits of knowledge which should not be taken for universal principles.\"<ref>R.

Kelly had first performed the play in Dublin in 1959 and the original recordings of his \u2018young self\u2019 were discovered. These were painstakingly remastered by Noel Storey at Beacon Studios in Dublin to be used on stage. It is believed to be the only time that real 30 year old recordings have been used.\nThe NY Times broke their own rules by saying in their review that \"Kelly\u2019s performance is the best that will ever be\".\n\n===Patrick Magee===\nBeckett told [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], the original Krapp, that his \"voice was the one which he heard inside his mind. Thus it seems likely that the return to English was a matter of expediency because of the English-speaking actor.\"<ref>[[Deirdre Bair]], ''Samuel Beckett: A Biography'' (London: Vintage, 1990) 521.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Magee had a harsh, gravely voice which had little [[superficial charm]] but had a [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] effect on the listener ... He was grey-haired but ageless and could combine [[debility (medical)|debility]] with menace, as Beckett characters with their suppressed violence often do ... [H]e had developed a rather strange [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] with only faint Irish overtones and prolonged [[vowel]] sounds, The general effect was strangely [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/declasse d\u00e9class\u00e9] but still indubitably Irish and thus ideally fitted for the performance of Beckett ...
