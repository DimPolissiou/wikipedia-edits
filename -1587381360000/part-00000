The original version was designed by [[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] and released at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1964. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s tended to learn.\n\nIn addition to the language itself, Kemeny and Kurtz developed the [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]] (DTSS), which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time. This general model became very popular on [[minicomputer]] systems like the [[PDP-11]] and [[Data General Nova]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [[Hewlett-Packard]] produced an entire computer line for this method of operation, introducing the [[HP2000]] series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s. Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC.\n\nThe emergence of early [[microcomputer]]s in the mid-1970s led to the development of the original [[Microsoft BASIC]] in 1975. Due to the tiny [[main memory]] available on these machines, often 4&nbsp;kB, a variety of [[Tiny BASIC]] dialects was also created. BASIC was available for almost any system of the era, and naturally became the ''de facto'' programming language for the [[home computer]] systems that emerged in the late 1970s. These machines almost always had a BASIC interpreter installed by default, often in the machine's [[firmware]] or sometimes on a [[read only memory|ROM]] cartridge.\n\nBASIC fell from use during the later 1980s as newer machines with far greater capabilities came to market and other programming languages (such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]) became tenable. In 1991, [[Microsoft]] released [[Visual Basic]], combining a greatly updated version of BASIC with a [[Graphical user interface builder|visual forms builder]]. This reignited use of the language and \"VB\" remains a major programming language in the form of [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.NET]].\n\n==Origin==\n[[John G. Kemeny]] was the math department chairman at Dartmouth College. Based largely on his reputation as an innovator in math teaching, in 1959 the school won an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] award for $500,000 to build a new department building.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,825616,00.html |title= High Math at Hanover |date=23 February 1959 |magazine=Time}}</ref> [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] had joined the department in 1956, and from the 1960s Kemeny and Kurtz agreed on the need for programming literacy among students outside the traditional STEM fields. Kemeny later noted that \"Our vision was that every student on campus should have access to a computer, and any faculty member should be able to use a computer in the classroom whenever appropriate. It was as simple as that.\"{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nKemeny and Kurtz had made two previous experiments with simplified languages, [[DARSIMCO]] (Dartmouth Simplified Code) and DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment). These did not progress past a single freshman class. New experiments using [[Fortran]] and [[ALGOL]] followed, but Kurtz concluded these languages were too tricky for what they desired. As Kurtz noted, Fortran had numerous oddly-formed commands, notably an \"almost impossible-to-memorize convention for specifying a loop: 'DO 100, I = 1, 10, 2'. Is it '1, 10, 2' or '1, 2, 10', and is the comma after the line number required or not?\"{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nMoreover, the lack of any sort of immediate feedback was a key problem; the machines of the era used [[batch processing]] and took a long time to complete a run of a program. Kurtz suggested that [[time-sharing]] offered a solution; a single machine could divide up its processing time among many users, giving them the illusion of having a slow computer to themselves. Small programs would return results in a few seconds. This led to increasing interest in a system using time-sharing and a new language specifically for use by non-STEM students.{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nKemeny wrote the first version of BASIC. The [[acronym]] ''BASIC'' comes from the name of an unpublished paper by Thomas Kurtz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/BASIC.html|title=BASIC|website=[[Jargon File]]|access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> The new language was heavily patterned on FORTRAN II; statements were one-to-a-line, numbers were used to indicate the target of loops and branches, and many of the commands were similar or identical. However, the [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] was changed wherever it could be improved. For instance, the difficult to remember <code>DO</code> loop was replaced by the much easier to remember <code>FOR I = 1 TO 10 STEP 2</code>, and the line number used in the DO was instead indicated by the <code>NEXT I</code>.{{efn|Fortran's DO had a <code>continue</code> for this purpose, but still required the line number to be entered.}} Likewise, the cryptic <code>IF</code> statement of Fortran, whose syntax matched a particular instruction of the machine on which it was originally written, became the simpler <code>IF I=5 THEN GOTO 100</code>. These changes made the language much less idiosyncratic while still having an overall structure and feel similar to the original FORTRAN.{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nThe project received a $300,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]], which was used to purchase a [[GE-225]] computer for processing, and a Datanet-30 realtime processor to handle the [[Teletype Model 33]] [[teleprinter]]s used for input and output. A team of a dozen undergraduates worked on the project for about a year, writing both the DTSS system and the BASIC compiler.{{sfn|Time|2014}} The main CPU was later replaced by a GE-235,{{sfn|Time|2014}} and still later by a GE-635.\n\nThe first version BASIC language was released on 1 May 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cis-alumni.org/TKurtz.html|title=Thomas E.

(In the 1960s, software became a chargeable commodity; until then, it was provided without charge as a service with the very expensive computers, usually available only to lease.) They also made it available to high schools in the [[Hanover, New Hampshire]] area and regionally throughout New England on Teletype Model 33 and Model 35 teleprinter terminals connected to Dartmouth via dial-up phone lines, and they put considerable effort into promoting the language. In the following years, as other dialects of BASIC appeared, Kemeny and Kurtz's original BASIC dialect became known as ''[[Dartmouth BASIC]]''.\n\nNew Hampshire recognized the accomplishment in 2019 when it erected a highway historical marker recognizing the creation of BASIC.<ref name = \"Brooks, Concord Monitor, 2019\" >{{ Cite web | url = https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2019/06/11/finally-a-historical-marker-that-talks-about-something-important/ | title = Finally, a historical marker that talks about something important | access-date = 11 August 2019 | first = David | last = Brooks | date = 11 June 2019 | website = [[Concord Monitor]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190611180750/https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2019/06/11/finally-a-historical-marker-that-talks-about-something-important/ | archive-date = 11 June 2019  | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Spread on minicomputers==\n[[File:Pn-pravez-class-5.jpg|thumb|right|\"Train Basic every day!\"\u2014reads a poster (bottom center) in a Russian school (c. 1985\u20131986).]]\n\nKnowledge of the relatively simple BASIC became widespread for a computer language, and it was implemented by a number of manufacturers, becoming fairly popular on newer [[minicomputer]]s, such as the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series, where [[BASIC-PLUS]] was an extended dialect for use on the [[RSTS/E]] time-sharing operating system. The BASIC language was available for the [[Data General Nova]], and also central to the [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]] system in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where the language was implemented as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. A version was a core part of the [[Pick operating system]] from 1973 onward, where a compiler renders it into [[bytecode]], able to be interpreted by a virtual machine.\n\nDuring this period a number of simple [[text-based game]]s were written in BASIC, most notably Mike Mayfield's ''[[Star Trek (text game)|Star Trek]]''. A number of these were collected by DEC employee [[David H. Ahl]] and published in a newsletter he compiled. He later collected a number of these into book form, ''101 BASIC Computer Games'', published in 1973.<ref name=\"basicgames\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/|title=101 Basic computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1973|publisher=Creative Computing Press|location=Morristown, N.J. |language=English|oclc=896774158}}</ref> During the same period, Ahl was involved in the creation of a small computer for education use, an early [[personal computer]]. When management refused to support the concept, Ahl left DEC in 1974 to found the seminal computer magazine, ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]''. The book remained popular, and was re-published on several occasions.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=May 11, 1981|title=Computer Games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44|magazine=[[InfoWorld]]|issn=0199-6649|volume=3|issue=9|page=44}}</ref>\n\n==Explosive growth: the home computer era==\n\n[[File:CommodoreBasic.JPG|thumb|[[Commodore BASIC]] v2.0 on the [[Commodore 64]]]]\n[[File:Msxbasic.png|thumb|[[MSX BASIC]] version 3.0]]\nThe introduction of the first [[microcomputer]]s in the mid-1970s was the start of explosive growth for BASIC. It had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers. Despite [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]]'s famous judgement in 1975, \"It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration\",<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD498.PDF|chapter=How do we tell truths that might hurt|title=Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective|first=Edsger W.|last=Dijkstra|date=June 18, 1975|publication-date=1982|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|isbn=978-0387906522|oclc=693424350|pages=[https://archive.org/details/selectedwritings0000dijk/page/129 129\u2013131]|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedwritings0000dijk/page/129}}</ref> BASIC was one of the few languages that was both high-level enough to be usable by those without training and small enough to fit into the microcomputers of the day, making it the de facto standard programming language on early microcomputers.\n\nThe first microcomputer version of BASIC was co-written by Gates, Allen, and [[Monte Davidoff]] for their newly-formed company, Micro-Soft. This was released by MITS in [[punch tape]] format for the [[Altair 8800]] shortly after the machine itself,<ref>{{Cite web|title=We have a BASIC|publisher=[[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]]|url=http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/story.php?ii=20&sid=4|access-date=April 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130051115/http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/story.php?ii=20&sid=4|archivedate=November 30, 2012}}</ref> immediately cementing BASIC as the primary language of early microcomputers. Members of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] began circulating copies of the program, causing Gates to write his [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]], complaining about this early example of [[software piracy]].\n\nPartially in response, [[Bob Albrecht]] urged [[Dennis Allison]] to write their own variation of the language. Albrecht had seen BASIC on [[minicomputer]]s and felt it would be the perfect match for new machines. How to design and implement a stripped-down version of an [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] for the BASIC language was covered in articles by Allison in the first three quarterly issues of the ''[[People's Computer Company]]'' newsletter published in 1975 and implementations with source code published in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte]]''. This led to a wide variety of versions with added features or other improvements, with versions from Tom Pittman and [[Li-Chen Wang]] becoming particularly well known.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/iNotes.html#TinyBasic|title=you had to pay $5 up front to get it\u2026 |last=Pittman |first=Tom |website=www.ittybittycomputers.com |access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMicro-Soft, by this time [[Microsoft]], ported their interpreter for the [[MOS 6502]], which quickly become one of the most popular microprocessors of the 8-bit era. When new microcomputers began to appear, notably the \"1977 trinity\" of the [[TRS-80]], [[Commodore PET]] and [[Apple II]], they either included a version of the MS code, or quickly introduced new models with it. By 1978, MS BASIC was a ''de facto'' standard and practically every [[home computer]] of the 1980s included it in [[read-only memory|ROM]]. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in [[direct mode]] was presented.\n\n[[Commodore Business Machines]] included [[Commodore BASIC]], based on Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each had two versions of BASIC, a smaller introductory version introduced with the initial releases of the machines and a more advanced version developed as interest in the platforms increased. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The [[Atari 8-bit family]] had its own [[Atari BASIC]] that was modified in order to fit on an 8&nbsp;kB ROM cartridge. [[Sinclair BASIC]] was introduced in 1980 with the [[Sinclair ZX-80]], and was later extended for the [[Sinclair ZX-81]] and the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. The [[BBC]] published [[BBC BASIC]], developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]], incorporating many extra [[structured programming]] keywords and advanced floating-point operation features.\n\nAs the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, computer magazines published complete source code in BASIC for video games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to [[Type-in program|type in the code]] from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from ''Creative Computing'' as ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of ready-to-go programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform.<ref name=\"basicgames\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/|title=More basic computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1979|publisher=Creative Computing Press|isbn=978-0894801372|oclc=839377789|location=Morristown|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/|title=Big computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1984|publisher=Creative Computing Press|isbn=978-0916688400|oclc=872675092|location=Morris Plains, N.J.|language=English}}</ref> The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the [[home computer]] market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as [[Learn to Program BASIC]] would also have gaming as an introductory focus. On the business-focused [[CP/M]] computers which soon became widespread in small business environments, [[Microsoft BASIC]] ([[MBASIC]]) was one of the leading applications.<ref name=\"oldcomputer\">{{Cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/osborne-1.html|title=Osborne 1|website=oldcomputers.net|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==IBM PC and compatibles==\n\n[[File:IBM Cassette BASIC.png|thumb|[[IBM Cassette BASIC]] 1.10]]\n\nWhen IBM was designing the [[IBM PC]] they followed the paradigm of existing home computers in wanting to have a built-in BASIC. They sourced this from Microsoft \u2013 [[IBM Cassette BASIC]] \u2013 but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS]] including [[IBM Disk BASIC]] (BASIC D), [[IBM BASICA]] (BASIC A), [[GW-BASIC]] (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and [[QBasic]], all typically bundled with the machine. In addition they produced the Microsoft BASIC Compiler aimed at professional programmers. Turbo [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-publisher [[Borland]] published [[Turbo Basic]] 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name [[PowerBASIC]]). Microsoft wrote the windowed [[AmigaBASIC]] that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985 / early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks.\n\nThese later variations introduced many extensions, such as improved [[string manipulation]] and graphics support, access to the [[file system]] and additional [[data type]]s. More important were the facilities for [[structured programming]], including additional [[control structures]] and proper [[subroutine]]s supporting [[local variable]]s. However, by the latter half of the 1980s, users were increasingly using pre-made applications written by others rather than learning programming themselves; while professional programmers now had a wide range of more advanced languages available on small computers. [[C (programming language)|C]] and later [[C++]] became the languages of choice for professional [[Shrink wrap contract|\"shrink wrap\"]] application development.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGRpeBZQYPoC|title=The Class Of Java|last=Pravin|first=Jain|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9788131755440|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fysh.org/~zefram/gne/c_programming_language/|title=GNE: the C programming language|website=fysh.org|access-date=June 14, 2017|quote=During the 1980s, C compilers spread widely, and C became an extremely popular language.}}</ref>\n\n==Visual Basic==\n\nIn 1991 Microsoft introduced  [[Visual Basic]], an evolutionary development of QuickBasic. It included constructs from that language such as block-structured control statements, parameterized subroutines, and optional [[Type system#STATIC|static typing]], as well as [[object oriented language|object-oriented]] constructs from other languages such as \"With\" and \"For Each\". The language retained some compatibility with its predecessors, such as the Dim keyword for declarations, \"Gosub\"/Return statements, and optional line numbers which could be used to locate errors. An important driver for the development of Visual Basic was as the new [[macro language]] for [[Microsoft Excel]], a [[spreadsheet]] program. To the surprise of many at Microsoft who still initially marketed it as a language for hobbyists, the language came into widespread use for small custom business applications shortly after the release of VB version 3.0, which is widely considered the first relatively stable version.\n\nWhile many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of [[small business]]es efficiently as by that time, computers running Windows 3.1 had become fast enough that many business-related processes could be completed \"in the blink of an eye\" even using a \"slow\" language, as long as large amounts of data were not involved. Many small business owners found they could create their own small, yet useful applications in a few evenings to meet their own specialized needs. Eventually, during the lengthy lifetime of VB3, knowledge of Visual Basic had become a marketable job skill. Microsoft also produced [[VBScript]] in 1996 and [[Visual Basic .NET]] in 2001. The latter has essentially the same power as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] but with syntax that reflects the original Basic language.\n[[File:TriBasicExample.png|thumb|Three modern Basic variants: [[Mono (software)|Mono]] Basic, [[OpenOffice.org Basic]] and [[Gambas]]]]\n\n== Post-1990 versions and dialects ==\n\nMany other BASIC dialects have also sprung up since 1990, including the [[Open-source software|open source]] [[QB64]] and [[FreeBASIC]], inspired by QBasic, and the Visual Basic-styled [[RapidQ]], [[Basic For Qt]] and [[Gambas]]. Modern commercial incarnations include [[PureBasic]], [[PowerBASIC]], [[Xojo]], Monkey X and [[True BASIC]] (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company controlled by Kurtz).\n\nSeveral web-based simple BASIC interpreters also now exist, including [http://www.quitebasic.com/ Quite BASIC] and Microsoft's [[Microsoft Small Basic|Small Basic]]. Many versions of BASIC are also now available for  [[smartphone]]s and tablets via the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], or [[Google Play]] store for Android. On game consoles, an application for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo DSi]] called ''[[Petit Computer]]'' allows for programming in a slightly modified version of BASIC with DS button support.\n\n==Calculators==\n\nVariants of BASIC are available on graphing and otherwise [[programmable calculator]]s made by [[Texas Instruments]], HP, Casio, and others.\n\n==Windows command line==\n\n[[QBasic]], a version of Microsoft [[QuickBASIC]] without the linker to make EXE files, is present in the [[Windows NT]] and DOS-[[Windows 95]] streams of operating systems and can be obtained for more recent releases like [[Windows 7]] which do not have them. Prior to DOS 5, the Basic interpreter was [[GW-BASIC|GW-Basic]]. QuickBasic is part of a series of three languages issued by Microsoft for the home and office power user and small-scale professional development; QuickC and QuickPascal are the other two. For [[Windows 95]] and 98, which do not have QBasic installed by default, they can be copied from the installation disc, which will have a set of directories for old and optional software; other missing commands like Exe2Bin and others are in these same directories.\n\n==Other==\n\n[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Family-Basic-Keyboard-wCart.jpg|thumb|right|BASIC came to some video game systems, such as the Nintendo [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].]]\nThe various Microsoft, Lotus, and Corel office suites and related products are programmable with Visual Basic in one form or another, including [[LotusScript]], which is very similar to VBA 6. The Host Explorer terminal emulator uses WWB as a macro language; or more recently the programme and the suite in which it is contained is programmable in an in-house Basic variant known as Hummingbird Basic. The VBScript variant is used for programming web content, Outlook 97, Internet Explorer, and the Windows Script Host. WSH also has a [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA) engine installed as the third of the default engines along with VBScript, JScript, and the numerous proprietary or open source engines which can be installed like [[PerlScript]], a couple of Rexx-based engines, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Delphi, XLNT, PHP, and others; meaning that the two versions of Basic can be used along with the other mentioned languages, as well as LotusScript, in a WSF file, through the component object model, and other WSH and VBA constructions. VBScript is one of the languages that can be accessed by the 4Dos, 4NT, and Take Command enhanced shells. SaxBasic and WWB are also very similar to the Visual Basic line of Basic implementations. The pre-Office 97 macro language for Microsoft Word is known as [[WordBASIC]]. Excel 4 and 5 use Visual Basic itself as a macro language. [[Chipmunk Basic]], an old school interpreter similar to BASICs of the 1970s, is available for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]].\n\n==Nostalgia==\n\nThe ubiquity of BASIC interpreters on personal computers was such that textbooks once included simple \"Try It In BASIC\" exercises that encouraged students to experiment with mathematical and computational concepts on classroom or home computers.

THEN ... {ELSE}</code> : used to perform comparisons or make decisions.\n; <code>FOR ... TO ... {STEP} ... NEXT</code> : repeat a section of code a given number of times. A variable that acts as a counter is available within the [[Control flow#Loops|loop]].\n; <code>WHILE ... WEND</code> and <code>REPEAT ... UNTIL</code> : repeat a section of code while the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.\n; <code>DO ... LOOP {WHILE}</code> or <code>{UNTIL}</code> : repeat a section of code indefinitely or while/until the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.\n; <code>[[Goto|GOTO]]</code> : jumps to a numbered or labelled line in the program.\n; <code>GOSUB</code> : jumps to a numbered or labelled line, executes the code it finds there until it reaches a <code>RETURN</code> command, on which it jumps back to the statement following the <code>GOSUB</code>, either after a colon, or on the next line. This is used to implement [[subroutine]]s.\n; <code>ON ... GOTO/GOSUB</code> : chooses where to jump based on the specified conditions. See [[Switch statement]] for other forms.\n; <code>DEF FN</code> : a pair of keywords introduced in the early 1960s to define functions. The original BASIC functions were modelled on FORTRAN single-line functions. BASIC functions were one expression with variable arguments, rather than [[subroutine]]s, with a syntax on the model of <code>DEF FND(x) = x*x</code> at the beginning of a program. Function names were originally restricted to FN, plus one letter, ''i.e.'', FNA, FNB&nbsp;...\n\n==== Input and output ====\n; <code>LIST</code> : displays the full source code of the current program.\n; <code>PRINT</code> : displays a message on the screen or other output device.\n; <code>INPUT</code> : asks the user to enter the value of a variable. The statement may include a prompt message.\n; <code>TAB</code> or <code>AT</code>: used with <code>PRINT</code> to set the position where the next character will be shown on the screen or printed on paper.\n\n==== Mathematical functions ====\n; <code>ABS</code> : Absolute value\n; <code>ATN</code> : Arctangent (result in [[radian]]s)\n; <code>COS</code> : Cosine (argument in [[radian]]s)\n; <code>EXP</code> : Exponential function\n; <code>INT</code> : Integer part (typically [[floor function]])\n; <code>LOG</code> : Natural logarithm\n; <code>RND</code> : [[Random number generation]]\n; <code>SIN</code> : Sine (argument in [[radian]]s)\n; <code>SQR</code> : Square root\n; <code>TAN</code> : Tangent (argument in [[radian]]s)\n\n==== Miscellaneous ====\n; <code>REM</code> : holds a programmer's comment or REMark; often used to give a title to the program and to help identify the purpose of a given section of code.\n; <code>USR</code> : transfers program control to a [[Machine code|machine language]] subroutine, usually entered as an alphanumeric [[String (computer science)|string]] or in a list of DATA statements.\n; <code>TRON</code> : turns on display of each line number as it is run (\"TRace ON\"). This was useful for [[debugging]] or correcting of problems in a program. \n; <code>TROFF</code> : turns off the display of line numbers.\n; <code>ASM</code> : some compilers such as Freebasic,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebasic.net/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=KeyPgAsm|title=KeyPgAsm|website=FreeBasic Wiki|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> Purebasic,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.purebasic.com/documentation/reference/inlinedasm.html|title=Inline x86 ASM|website=Pure Basic|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> and Powerbasic<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerbasic.com/help/pbcc/using_assembly-language_in_your_code.htm|title=Using assembly-language in your code|website=Power Basic|access-date=August 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802164032/https://www.powerbasic.com/help/pbcc/using_assembly-language_in_your_code.htm|archive-date=August 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> also support [[Inline assembler|inline assembly]] language, allowing the programmer to intermix high-level and low-level code, typically prefixed with \"ASM\" or \"!\" statements.\n\n===Data types and variables===\nMinimal versions of BASIC had only integer variables and one- or two-letter variable names, which minimized requirements of limited and expensive memory (RAM). More powerful versions had floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long. There were some problems and restrictions in early implementations; for example, Applesoft BASIC allowed variable names to be several characters long, but only the first two were significant, thus it was possible to inadvertently write a program with variables \"LOSS\" and \"LOAN\", which would be treated as being the same; assigning a value to \"LOAN\" would silently overwrite the value intended as \"LOSS\". Keywords could not be used in variables in many early BASICs; \"SCORE\" would be interpreted as \"SC\" OR \"E\", where OR was a keyword. [[String (computer science)|String]] variables are usually distinguished in many microcomputer dialects by having $ suffixed to their name, and values are often identified as strings by being delimited by \"double quotation marks\". Arrays in BASIC could contain integers, floating point or string variables.\n\nSome dialects of BASIC supported [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices and matrix operations]], useful for the solution of sets of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These dialects would directly support matrix operations such as assignment, addition, multiplication (of compatible matrix types), and evaluation of a determinant. Many microcomputer BASICs did not support this data type; matrix operations were still possible, but had to be programmed explicitly on array elements.\n\n===Examples===\n\n==== Unstructured BASIC ====\nThe original Dartmouth Basic was unusual in having a matrix keyword, MAT.{{efn|From version 3 onwards.}} Although not implemented by most later microprocessor derivatives, it is used in this example from the 1968 manual<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dartmouth/BASIC_4th_Edition_Jan68.pdf|title=Basic: a manual for BASIC, the elementary algebraic language designed for use with the Dartmouth Time Sharing System|last=Kemeny|first=John G.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Thomas E.|date=January 1968|publisher=Dartmouth College Computation Center|location=Hanover, N.H.|language=English|edition=4th|page=53}}</ref> which averages the numbers that are input:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n5 LET S = 0\n10 MAT INPUT V \n20 LET N = NUM \n30 IF N = 0 THEN 99 \n40 FOR I = 1 TO N \n45 LET S = S + V(I) \n50 NEXT I \n60 PRINT S/N \n70 GO TO 5 \n99 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNew BASIC programmers on a home computer might start with a simple program, perhaps using the language's PRINT statement to display a message on the screen; a well-known and often-replicated example is [[The C Programming Language|Kernighan and Ritchie]]'s [[\"Hello, World!\" program]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n10 PRINT \"Hello, World!\"\n20 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn [[infinite loop]] could be used to fill the display with the message.\n\nMost first-generation BASIC versions, such as [[MSX BASIC]] and [[GW-BASIC]], supported simple data types, loop cycles, and arrays. The following example is written for GW-BASIC, but will work in most versions of BASIC with minimal changes:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n10 INPUT \"What is your name: \"; U$\n20 PRINT \"Hello \"; U$\n30 INPUT \"How many stars do you want: \"; N\n40 S$ = \"\"\n50 FOR I = 1 TO N\n60 S$ = S$ + \"*\"\n70 NEXT I\n80 PRINT S$\n90 INPUT \"Do you want more stars? \"; A$\n100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90\n110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)\n120 IF A$ = \"Y\" OR A$ = \"y\" THEN GOTO 30\n130 PRINT \"Goodbye \"; U$\n140 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe resulting dialog might resemble:\n\n What is your name: Mike\n Hello Mike\n How many stars do you want: 7\n *******\n Do you want more stars? yes\n How many stars do you want: 3\n ***\n Do you want more stars? no\n Goodbye Mike\n\n==== Structured BASIC ====\nSecond-generation BASICs (for example, [[HP BASIC for OpenVMS|VAX Basic]], [[SuperBASIC]], [[True BASIC]], [[QuickBASIC]], [[BBC BASIC]], [[Pick operating system|Pick BASIC]], [[PowerBASIC]] and (arguably) [[COMAL]]) introduced a number of features into the language, primarily related to structured and procedure-oriented programming. Usually, [[line number]]ing is omitted from the language and replaced with [[label (computer science)|labels]] (for [[GOTO]]) and [[subroutine|procedures]] to encourage easier and more flexible design.<ref name=\"GBvsQB\">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|title=Differences Between GW-BASIC and QBasic|date=2003-05-12|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019181140/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|archivedate=2013-10-19}}</ref> In addition keywords and structures to support repetition, selection and procedures with local variables were introduced.\n\nThe following example is in Microsoft QuickBASIC:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"QBasic\">\nREM QuickBASIC example\n\nREM Forward declaration - allows the main code to call a\nREM    subroutine that is declared later in the source code\nDECLARE SUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount!)\n\nREM Main program follows\nINPUT \"What is your name: \", UserName$\nPRINT \"Hello \"; UserName$\nDO\n   INPUT \"How many stars do you want: \", NumStars\n   CALL PrintSomeStars(NumStars)\n   DO\n      INPUT \"Do you want more stars? \", Answer$\n   LOOP UNTIL Answer$ <> \"\"\n   Answer$ = LEFT$(Answer$, 1)\nLOOP WHILE UCASE$(Answer$) = \"Y\"\nPRINT \"Goodbye \"; UserName$\nEND\n\nREM subroutine declaration\nSUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount)\n   REM This procedure uses a local variable called Stars$\n   Stars$ = STRING$(StarCount, \"*\")\n   PRINT Stars$\nEND SUB\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Object-oriented BASIC ====\nThird-generation BASIC dialects such as [[Visual Basic]], [[Xojo]], [[StarOffice Basic]] and [[BlitzMax]] introduced features to support object-oriented and [[event-driven programming]] paradigm. Most built-in procedures and functions are now represented as ''methods'' of standard objects rather than ''operators''. Also, the [[operating system]] became increasingly accessible to the BASIC language.\n\nThe following example is in [[Visual Basic .NET]]:\n\n<!-- needs a better (event-driven?) example -->\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"vbnet\">\nPublic Module StarsProgram\n   Private Function Ask(prompt As String) As String\n      Console.Write(prompt)\n      Return Console.ReadLine()\n   End Function\n\n   Public Sub Main()\n      Dim userName = Ask(\"What is your name: \")\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Hello {0}\", userName)\n\n      Dim answer As String\n\n      Do\n         Dim numStars = CInt(Ask(\"How many stars do you want: \"))\n         Dim stars As New String(\"*\"c, numStars)\n         Console.WriteLine(stars)\n\n         Do\n            answer = Ask(\"Do you want more stars? \")\n         Loop Until answer <> \"\"\n      Loop While answer.StartsWith(\"Y\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)\n\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Goodbye {0}\", userName)\n   End Sub\nEnd Module\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Standards==\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard for Minimal BASIC:\n** ANSI X3.60-1978 \"For minimal BASIC\"\n** ISO/IEC 6373:1984 \"Data Processing\u2014Programming Languages\u2014Minimal BASIC\"\n* [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-55 Minimal BASIC ''(withdrawn, similar to ANSI X3.60-1978)''\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard for Full BASIC:\n** ANSI X3.113-1987 \"Programming Languages Full BASIC\"\n** INCITS/ISO/IEC 10279-1991 (R2005) \"Information Technology \u2013 Programming Languages \u2013 Full BASIC\"\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Addendum Defining Modules:\n** ANSI X3.113 Interpretations-1992 \"BASIC Technical Information Bulletin # 1 Interpretations of ANSI 03.113-1987\"\n** ISO/IEC 10279:1991/ Amd 1:1994 \"Modules and Single Character Input Enhancement\"\n* [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-116 BASIC ''(withdrawn, similar to ANSI X3.113-1987)''\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of BASIC dialects]]\n* [[List of Computers With On-Board BASIC]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===General references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Programming languages: history and fundamentals|last=Sammet|first=Jean E.|date=1969|publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]]|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|language=English|oclc=819683527}}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia |chapter-url  = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800025.1198404\n |chapter      = BASIC\n |encyclopedia = History of Programming Languages I\n |last         = Kurtz\n |first        = Thomas E.\n |date         = 1981\n |publisher    = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n |isbn         = 978-0127450407\n |doi          = 10.1145/800025.1198404<!-- (currently broken, reported to issuer) -->\n |editor-last  = Wexelblat\n |editor-first = Richard\n |location     = New York\n |pages        = [https://archive.org/details/historyofprogram0000hist/page/515 515\u2013537]\n |ref          = harv\n |title        = History of programming languages\n |url          = https://archive.org/details/historyofprogram0000hist/page/515\n}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Back To BASIC: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language|last=Kemeny|first=John G.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Thomas E.|date=1985|publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=9780201134339|oclc=11399298|pages=141}}\n* {{Cite book|title=The Basic Handbook: Encyclopedia of the BASIC Computer Language|last=Lien|first=David A.|date=1986|publisher=Compusoft Publishing|isbn=9780932760333|oclc=12548310|edition=3rd}}\n* {{cite magazine |magazine=Time |date=29 April 2014 |title= Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal |url=http://time.com/69316/basic/ |ref=CITEREFTime2014}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Programming:BASIC}}\n* {{dmoz|Computers/Programming/Languages/BASIC|BASIC}}\n* {{HOPL-lang|176|BASIC\u2014Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code}}\n* {{YouTube|WYPNjSoDrqw|The Birth of Basic}}\n<!-- Please do not add any links for specific implementations of BASIC here.

ISBN: 0-675-20772-X</ref>) is a family of [[General-purpose programming language|general-purpose]], [[high-level programming language]]s whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. The original version was designed by [[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] and released at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1964. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s tended to learn.\n\nIn addition to the language itself, Kemeny and Kurtz developed the [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]] (DTSS), which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time. This general model became very popular on [[minicomputer]] systems like the [[PDP-11]] and [[Data General Nova]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [[Hewlett-Packard]] produced an entire computer line for this method of operation, introducing the [[HP2000]] series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s. Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC.\n\nThe emergence of early [[microcomputer]]s in the mid-1970s led to the development of the original [[Microsoft BASIC]] in 1975. Due to the tiny [[main memory]] available on these machines, often 4&nbsp;kB, a variety of [[Tiny BASIC]] dialects was also created. BASIC was available for almost any system of the era, and naturally became the ''de facto'' programming language for the [[home computer]] systems that emerged in the late 1970s. These machines almost always had a BASIC interpreter installed by default, often in the machine's [[firmware]] or sometimes on a [[read only memory|ROM]] cartridge.\n\nBASIC fell from use during the later 1980s as newer machines with far greater capabilities came to market and other programming languages (such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]) became tenable. In 1991, [[Microsoft]] released [[Visual Basic]], combining a greatly updated version of BASIC with a [[Graphical user interface builder|visual forms builder]]. This reignited use of the language and \"VB\" remains a major programming language in the form of [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.NET]].\n\n==Origin==\n[[John G. Kemeny]] was the math department chairman at Dartmouth College. Based largely on his reputation as an innovator in math teaching, in 1959 the school won an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] award for $500,000 to build a new department building.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,825616,00.html |title= High Math at Hanover |date=23 February 1959 |magazine=Time}}</ref> [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] had joined the department in 1956, and from the 1960s Kemeny and Kurtz agreed on the need for programming literacy among students outside the traditional STEM fields. Kemeny later noted that \"Our vision was that every student on campus should have access to a computer, and any faculty member should be able to use a computer in the classroom whenever appropriate. It was as simple as that.\"{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nKemeny and Kurtz had made two previous experiments with simplified languages, [[DARSIMCO]] (Dartmouth Simplified Code) and DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment). These did not progress past a single freshman class. New experiments using [[Fortran]] and [[ALGOL]] followed, but Kurtz concluded these languages were too tricky for what they desired. As Kurtz noted, Fortran had numerous oddly-formed commands, notably an \"almost impossible-to-memorize convention for specifying a loop: 'DO 100, I = 1, 10, 2'. Is it '1, 10, 2' or '1, 2, 10', and is the comma after the line number required or not?\"{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nMoreover, the lack of any sort of immediate feedback was a key problem; the machines of the era used [[batch processing]] and took a long time to complete a run of a program. Kurtz suggested that [[time-sharing]] offered a solution; a single machine could divide up its processing time among many users, giving them the illusion of having a slow computer to themselves. Small programs would return results in a few seconds. This led to increasing interest in a system using time-sharing and a new language specifically for use by non-STEM students.{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nKemeny wrote the first version of BASIC. The [[acronym]] ''BASIC'' comes from the name of an unpublished paper by Thomas Kurtz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/BASIC.html|title=BASIC|website=[[Jargon File]]|access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> The new language was heavily patterned on FORTRAN II; statements were one-to-a-line, numbers were used to indicate the target of loops and branches, and many of the commands were similar or identical. However, the [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] was changed wherever it could be improved. For instance, the difficult to remember <code>DO</code> loop was replaced by the much easier to remember <code>FOR I = 1 TO 10 STEP 2</code>, and the line number used in the DO was instead indicated by the <code>NEXT I</code>.{{efn|Fortran's DO had a <code>continue</code> for this purpose, but still required the line number to be entered.}} Likewise, the cryptic <code>IF</code> statement of Fortran, whose syntax matched a particular instruction of the machine on which it was originally written, became the simpler <code>IF I=5 THEN GOTO 100</code>. These changes made the language much less idiosyncratic while still having an overall structure and feel similar to the original FORTRAN.{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nThe project received a $300,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]], which was used to purchase a [[GE-225]] computer for processing, and a Datanet-30 realtime processor to handle the [[Teletype Model 33]] [[teleprinter]]s used for input and output. A team of a dozen undergraduates worked on the project for about a year, writing both the DTSS system and the BASIC compiler.{{sfn|Time|2014}} The main CPU was later replaced by a GE-235,{{sfn|Time|2014}} and still later by a GE-635.\n\nThe first version BASIC language was released on 1 May 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cis-alumni.org/TKurtz.html|title=Thomas E.

(In the 1960s, software became a chargeable commodity; until then, it was provided without charge as a service with the very expensive computers, usually available only to lease.) They also made it available to high schools in the [[Hanover, New Hampshire]] area and regionally throughout New England on Teletype Model 33 and Model 35 teleprinter terminals connected to Dartmouth via dial-up phone lines, and they put considerable effort into promoting the language. In the following years, as other dialects of BASIC appeared, Kemeny and Kurtz's original BASIC dialect became known as ''[[Dartmouth BASIC]]''.\n\nNew Hampshire recognized the accomplishment in 2019 when it erected a highway historical marker recognizing the creation of BASIC.<ref name = \"Brooks, Concord Monitor, 2019\" > {{ Cite web | url = https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2019/06/11/finally-a-historical-marker-that-talks-about-something-important/ | title = Finally, a historical marker that talks about something important | access-date = 11 August 2019 | first = David | last = Brooks | date = 11 June 2019 | website = [[Concord Monitor]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190611180750/https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2019/06/11/finally-a-historical-marker-that-talks-about-something-important/ | archive-date = 11 June 2019  | df = dmy-all }} </ref>\n\n==Spread on minicomputers==\n[[File:Pn-pravez-class-5.jpg|thumb|right|\"Train Basic every day!\"\u2014reads a poster (bottom center) in a Russian school (c. 1985\u20131986).]]\n\nKnowledge of the relatively simple BASIC became widespread for a computer language, and it was implemented by a number of manufacturers, becoming fairly popular on newer [[minicomputer]]s, such as the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series, where [[BASIC-PLUS]] was an extended dialect for use on the [[RSTS/E]] time-sharing operating system. The BASIC language was available for the [[Data General Nova]], and also central to the [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]] system in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where the language was implemented as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. A version was a core part of the [[Pick operating system]] from 1973 onward, where a compiler renders it into [[bytecode]], able to be interpreted by a virtual machine.\n\nDuring this period a number of simple [[text-based game]]s were written in BASIC, most notably Mike Mayfield's ''[[Star Trek (text game)|Star Trek]]''. A number of these were collected by DEC employee [[David H. Ahl]] and published in a newsletter he compiled. He later collected a number of these into book form, ''101 BASIC Computer Games'', published in 1973.<ref name=\"basicgames\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/|title=101 Basic computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1973|publisher=Creative Computing Press|location=Morristown, N.J. |language=English|oclc=896774158}}</ref> During the same period, Ahl was involved in the creation of a small computer for education use, an early [[personal computer]]. When management refused to support the concept, Ahl left DEC in 1974 to found the seminal computer magazine, ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]''. The book remained popular, and was re-published on several occasions.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=May 11, 1981|title=Computer Games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44|magazine=[[InfoWorld]]|issn=0199-6649|volume=3|issue=9|page=44}}</ref>\n\n==Explosive growth: the home computer era==\n\n[[File:CommodoreBasic.JPG|thumb|[[Commodore BASIC]] v2.0 on the [[Commodore 64]]]]\n[[File:Msxbasic.png|thumb|[[MSX BASIC]] version 3.0]]\nThe introduction of the first [[microcomputer]]s in the mid-1970s was the start of explosive growth for BASIC. It had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers. Despite [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]]'s famous judgement in 1975, \"It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration\",<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD498.PDF|chapter=How do we tell truths that might hurt|title=Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective|first=Edsger W.|last=Dijkstra|date=June 18, 1975|publication-date=1982|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|isbn=978-0387906522|oclc=693424350|pages=[https://archive.org/details/selectedwritings0000dijk/page/129 129\u2013131]|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedwritings0000dijk/page/129}}</ref> BASIC was one of the few languages that was both high-level enough to be usable by those without training and small enough to fit into the microcomputers of the day, making it the de facto standard programming language on early microcomputers.\n\nThe first microcomputer version of BASIC was co-written by Gates, Allen, and [[Monte Davidoff]] for their newly-formed company, Micro-Soft. This was released by MITS in [[punch tape]] format for the [[Altair 8800]] shortly after the machine itself,<ref>{{Cite web|title=We have a BASIC|publisher=[[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]]|url=http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/story.php?ii=20&sid=4|access-date=April 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130051115/http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/story.php?ii=20&sid=4|archivedate=November 30, 2012}}</ref> immediately cementing BASIC as the primary language of early microcomputers. Members of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] began circulating copies of the program, causing Gates to write his [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]], complaining about this early example of [[software piracy]].\n\nPartially in response, [[Bob Albrecht]] urged [[Dennis Allison]] to write their own variation of the language. Albrecht had seen BASIC on [[minicomputer]]s and felt it would be the perfect match for new machines. How to design and implement a stripped-down version of an [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] for the BASIC language was covered in articles by Allison in the first three quarterly issues of the ''[[People's Computer Company]]'' newsletter published in 1975 and implementations with source code published in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte]]''. This led to a wide variety of versions with added features or other improvements, with versions from Tom Pittman and [[Li-Chen Wang]] becoming particularly well known.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/iNotes.html#TinyBasic|title=you had to pay $5 up front to get it\u2026 |last=Pittman |first=Tom |website=www.ittybittycomputers.com |access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMicro-Soft, by this time [[Microsoft]], ported their interpreter for the [[MOS 6502]], which quickly become one of the most popular microprocessors of the 8-bit era. When new microcomputers began to appear, notably the \"1977 trinity\" of the [[TRS-80]], [[Commodore PET]] and [[Apple II]], they either included a version of the MS code, or quickly introduced new models with it. By 1978, MS BASIC was a ''de facto'' standard and practically every [[home computer]] of the 1980s included it in [[read-only memory|ROM]]. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in [[direct mode]] was presented.\n\n[[Commodore Business Machines]] included [[Commodore BASIC]], based on Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each had two versions of BASIC, a smaller introductory version introduced with the initial releases of the machines and a more advanced version developed as interest in the platforms increased. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The [[Atari 8-bit family]] had its own [[Atari BASIC]] that was modified in order to fit on an 8&nbsp;kB ROM cartridge. [[Sinclair BASIC]] was introduced in 1980 with the [[Sinclair ZX-80]], and was later extended for the [[Sinclair ZX-81]] and the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. The [[BBC]] published [[BBC BASIC]], developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]], incorporating many extra [[structured programming]] keywords and advanced floating-point operation features.\n\nAs the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, computer magazines published complete source code in BASIC for video games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to [[Type-in program|type in the code]] from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from ''Creative Computing'' as ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of ready-to-go programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform.<ref name=\"basicgames\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/|title=More basic computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1979|publisher=Creative Computing Press|isbn=978-0894801372|oclc=839377789|location=Morristown|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/|title=Big computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1984|publisher=Creative Computing Press|isbn=978-0916688400|oclc=872675092|location=Morris Plains, N.J.|language=English}}</ref> The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the [[home computer]] market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as [[Learn to Program BASIC]] would also have gaming as an introductory focus. On the business-focused [[CP/M]] computers which soon became widespread in small business environments, [[Microsoft BASIC]] ([[MBASIC]]) was one of the leading applications.<ref name=\"oldcomputer\">{{Cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/osborne-1.html|title=Osborne 1|website=oldcomputers.net|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==IBM PC and compatibles==\n\n[[File:IBM Cassette BASIC.png|thumb|[[IBM Cassette BASIC]] 1.10]]\n\nWhen IBM was designing the [[IBM PC]] they followed the paradigm of existing home computers in wanting to have a built-in BASIC. They sourced this from Microsoft \u2013 [[IBM Cassette BASIC]] \u2013 but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS]] including [[IBM Disk BASIC]] (BASIC D), [[IBM BASICA]] (BASIC A), [[GW-BASIC]] (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and [[QBasic]], all typically bundled with the machine. In addition they produced the Microsoft BASIC Compiler aimed at professional programmers. Turbo [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-publisher [[Borland]] published [[Turbo Basic]] 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name [[PowerBASIC]]). Microsoft wrote the windowed [[AmigaBASIC]] that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985 / early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks. \n\nThese later variations introduced many extensions, such as improved [[string manipulation]] and graphics support, access to the [[file system]] and additional [[data type]]s. More important were the facilities for [[structured programming]], including additional [[control structures]] and proper [[subroutine]]s supporting [[local variable]]s. However, by the latter half of the 1980s, users were increasingly using pre-made applications written by others rather than learning programming themselves; while professional programmers now had a wide range of more advanced languages available on small computers. [[C (programming language)|C]] and later [[C++]] became the languages of choice for professional [[Shrink wrap contract|\"shrink wrap\"]] application development.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGRpeBZQYPoC|title=The Class Of Java|last=Pravin|first=Jain|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9788131755440|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fysh.org/~zefram/gne/c_programming_language/|title=GNE: the C programming language|website=fysh.org|access-date=June 14, 2017|quote=During the 1980s, C compilers spread widely, and C became an extremely popular language.}}</ref>\n\n==Visual Basic==\n\nIn 1991 Microsoft introduced  [[Visual Basic]], an evolutionary development of QuickBasic. It included constructs from that language such as block-structured control statements, parameterized subroutines, and optional [[Type system#STATIC|static typing]], as well as [[object oriented language|object-oriented]] constructs from other languages such as \"With\" and \"For Each\". The language retained some compatibility with its predecessors, such as the Dim keyword for declarations, \"Gosub\"/Return statements, and optional line numbers which could be used to locate errors. An important driver for the development of Visual Basic was as the new [[macro language]] for [[Microsoft Excel]], a [[spreadsheet]] program. To the surprise of many at Microsoft who still initially marketed it as a language for hobbyists, the language came into widespread use for small custom business applications shortly after the release of VB version 3.0, which is widely considered the first relatively stable version. \n\nWhile many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of [[small business]]es efficiently as by that time, computers running Windows 3.1 had become fast enough that many business-related processes could be completed \"in the blink of an eye\" even using a \"slow\" language, as long as large amounts of data were not involved. Many small business owners found they could create their own small, yet useful applications in a few evenings to meet their own specialized needs. Eventually, during the lengthy lifetime of VB3, knowledge of Visual Basic had become a marketable job skill. Microsoft also produced [[VBScript]] in 1996 and [[Visual Basic .NET]] in 2001. The latter has essentially the same power as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] but with syntax that reflects the original Basic language.\n[[File:TriBasicExample.png|thumb|Three modern Basic variants: [[Mono (software)|Mono]] Basic, [[OpenOffice.org Basic]] and [[Gambas]]]]\n\n== Post-1990 versions and dialects ==\n\nMany other BASIC dialects have also sprung up since 1990, including the [[Open-source software|open source]] [[QB64]] and [[FreeBASIC]], inspired by QBasic, and the Visual Basic-styled [[RapidQ]], [[Basic For Qt]] and [[Gambas]]. Modern commercial incarnations include [[PureBasic]], [[PowerBASIC]], [[Xojo]], Monkey X and [[True BASIC]] (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company controlled by Kurtz). \n\nSeveral web-based simple BASIC interpreters also now exist, including [http://www.quitebasic.com/ Quite BASIC] and Microsoft's [[Microsoft Small Basic|Small Basic]]. Many versions of BASIC are also now available for  [[smartphone]]s and tablets via the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], or [[Google Play]] store for Android. On game consoles, an application for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo DSi]] called ''[[Petit Computer]]'' allows for programming in a slightly modified version of BASIC with DS button support.\n\n==Calculators==\n\nVariants of BASIC are available on graphing and otherwise [[programmable calculator]]s made by [[Texas Instruments]], HP, Casio, and others.\n\n==Windows command line==\n\n[[QBasic]], a version of Microsoft [[QuickBASIC]] without the linker to make EXE files, is present in the [[Windows NT]] and DOS-[[Windows 95]] streams of operating systems and can be obtained for more recent releases like [[Windows 7]] which do not have them. Prior to DOS 5, the Basic interpreter was [[GW-BASIC|GW-Basic]]. QuickBasic is part of a series of three languages issued by Microsoft for the home and office power user and small-scale professional development; QuickC and QuickPascal are the other two. For [[Windows 95]] and 98, which do not have QBasic installed by default, they can be copied from the installation disc, which will have a set of directories for old and optional software; other missing commands like Exe2Bin and others are in these same directories.\n\n==Other==\n\n[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Family-Basic-Keyboard-wCart.jpg|thumb|right|BASIC came to some video game systems, such as the Nintendo [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].]]\nThe various Microsoft, Lotus, and Corel office suites and related products are programmable with Visual Basic in one form or another, including [[LotusScript]], which is very similar to VBA 6. The Host Explorer terminal emulator uses WWB as a macro language; or more recently the programme and the suite in which it is contained is programmable in an in-house Basic variant known as Hummingbird Basic. The VBScript variant is used for programming web content, Outlook 97, Internet Explorer, and the Windows Script Host. WSH also has a [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA) engine installed as the third of the default engines along with VBScript, JScript, and the numerous proprietary or open source engines which can be installed like [[PerlScript]], a couple of Rexx-based engines, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Delphi, XLNT, PHP, and others; meaning that the two versions of Basic can be used along with the other mentioned languages, as well as LotusScript, in a WSF file, through the component object model, and other WSH and VBA constructions. VBScript is one of the languages that can be accessed by the 4Dos, 4NT, and Take Command enhanced shells. SaxBasic and WWB are also very similar to the Visual Basic line of Basic implementations. The pre-Office 97 macro language for Microsoft Word is known as [[WordBASIC]]. Excel 4 and 5 use Visual Basic itself as a macro language. [[Chipmunk Basic]], an old school interpreter similar to BASICs of the 1970s, is available for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]].\n\n==Nostalgia==\n\nThe ubiquity of BASIC interpreters on personal computers was such that textbooks once included simple \"Try It In BASIC\" exercises that encouraged students to experiment with mathematical and computational concepts on classroom or home computers. Popular computer magazines of the day typically included [[type-in program]]s.\n\nFuturist and sci-fi writer [[David Brin]] mourned the loss of ubiquitous BASIC in a 2006 ''Salon'' article<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2006/09/14/basic_2/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918213750/http://www.salon.com/2006/09/14/basic_2/singleton/|archive-date=September 18, 2013|url-status=dead|title=Why Johnny Can't Code|last=Brin|first=David|date=September 14, 2006|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref> as have others who first used computers during this era.

THEN ... {ELSE}</code> : used to perform comparisons or make decisions.\n; <code>FOR ... TO ... {STEP} ... NEXT</code> : repeat a section of code a given number of times. A variable that acts as a counter is available within the [[Control flow#Loops|loop]].\n; <code>WHILE ... WEND</code> and <code>REPEAT ... UNTIL</code> : repeat a section of code while the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.\n; <code>DO ... LOOP {WHILE}</code> or <code>{UNTIL}</code> : repeat a section of code indefinitely or while/until the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.\n; <code>[[Goto|GOTO]]</code> : jumps to a numbered or labelled line in the program.\n; <code>GOSUB</code> : jumps to a numbered or labelled line, executes the code it finds there until it reaches a <code>RETURN</code> command, on which it jumps back to the statement following the <code>GOSUB</code>, either after a colon, or on the next line. This is used to implement [[subroutine]]s.\n; <code>ON ... GOTO/GOSUB</code> : chooses where to jump based on the specified conditions. See [[Switch statement]] for other forms.\n; <code>DEF FN</code> : a pair of keywords introduced in the early 1960s to define functions. The original BASIC functions were modelled on FORTRAN single-line functions. BASIC functions were one expression with variable arguments, rather than [[subroutine]]s, with a syntax on the model of <code>DEF FND(x) = x*x</code> at the beginning of a program. Function names were originally restricted to FN, plus one letter, ''i.e.'', FNA, FNB&nbsp;...\n\n==== Input and output ====\n; <code>LIST</code> : displays the full source code of the current program.\n; <code>PRINT</code> : displays a message on the screen or other output device.\n; <code>INPUT</code> : asks the user to enter the value of a variable. The statement may include a prompt message.\n; <code>TAB</code> or <code>AT</code>: used with <code>PRINT</code> to set the position where the next character will be shown on the screen or printed on paper.\n\n==== Mathematical functions ====\n; <code>ABS</code> : Absolute value\n; <code>ATN</code> : Arctangent (result in [[radian]]s)\n; <code>COS</code> : Cosine (argument in [[radian]]s)\n; <code>EXP</code> : Exponential function\n; <code>INT</code> : Integer part (typically [[floor function]])\n; <code>LOG</code> : Natural logarithm\n; <code>RND</code> : [[Random number generation]]\n; <code>SIN</code> : Sine (argument in [[radian]]s)\n; <code>SQR</code> : Square root\n; <code>TAN</code> : Tangent (argument in [[radian]]s)\n\n==== Miscellaneous ====\n; <code>REM</code> : holds a programmer's comment or REMark; often used to give a title to the program and to help identify the purpose of a given section of code.\n; <code>USR</code> : transfers program control to a [[Machine code|machine language]] subroutine, usually entered as an alphanumeric [[String (computer science)|string]] or in a list of DATA statements.\n; <code>TRON</code> : turns on display of each line number as it is run (\"TRace ON\"). This was useful for [[debugging]] or correcting of problems in a program. \n; <code>TROFF</code> : turns off the display of line numbers.\n; <code>ASM</code> : some compilers such as Freebasic,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebasic.net/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=KeyPgAsm|title=KeyPgAsm|website=FreeBasic Wiki|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> Purebasic,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.purebasic.com/documentation/reference/inlinedasm.html|title=Inline x86 ASM|website=Pure Basic|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> and Powerbasic<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerbasic.com/help/pbcc/using_assembly-language_in_your_code.htm|title=Using assembly-language in your code|website=Power Basic|access-date=August 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802164032/https://www.powerbasic.com/help/pbcc/using_assembly-language_in_your_code.htm|archive-date=August 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> also support [[Inline assembler|inline assembly]] language, allowing the programmer to intermix high-level and low-level code, typically prefixed with \"ASM\" or \"!\" statements.\n\n===Data types and variables===\nMinimal versions of BASIC had only integer variables and one- or two-letter variable names, which minimized requirements of limited and expensive memory (RAM). More powerful versions had floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long. There were some problems and restrictions in early implementations; for example, Applesoft BASIC allowed variable names to be several characters long, but only the first two were significant, thus it was possible to inadvertently write a program with variables \"LOSS\" and \"LOAN\", which would be treated as being the same; assigning a value to \"LOAN\" would silently overwrite the value intended as \"LOSS\". Keywords could not be used in variables in many early BASICs; \"SCORE\" would be interpreted as \"SC\" OR \"E\", where OR was a keyword. [[String (computer science)|String]] variables are usually distinguished in many microcomputer dialects by having $ suffixed to their name, and values are often identified as strings by being delimited by \"double quotation marks\". Arrays in BASIC could contain integers, floating point or string variables.\n\nSome dialects of BASIC supported [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices and matrix operations]], useful for the solution of sets of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These dialects would directly support matrix operations such as assignment, addition, multiplication (of compatible matrix types), and evaluation of a determinant. Many microcomputer BASICs did not support this data type; matrix operations were still possible, but had to be programmed explicitly on array elements.\n\n===Examples===\n\n==== Unstructured BASIC ====\nThe original Dartmouth Basic was unusual in having a matrix keyword, MAT.{{efn|From version 3 onwards.}} Although not implemented by most later microprocessor derivatives, it is used in this example from the 1968 manual<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dartmouth/BASIC_4th_Edition_Jan68.pdf|title=Basic: a manual for BASIC, the elementary algebraic language designed for use with the Dartmouth Time Sharing System|last=Kemeny|first=John G.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Thomas E.|date=January 1968|publisher=Dartmouth College Computation Center|location=Hanover, N.H.|language=English|edition=4th|page=53}}</ref> which averages the numbers that are input:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n5 LET S = 0\n10 MAT INPUT V \n20 LET N = NUM \n30 IF N = 0 THEN 99 \n40 FOR I = 1 TO N \n45 LET S = S + V(I) \n50 NEXT I \n60 PRINT S/N \n70 GO TO 5 \n99 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNew BASIC programmers on a home computer might start with a simple program, perhaps using the language's PRINT statement to display a message on the screen; a well-known and often-replicated example is [[The C Programming Language|Kernighan and Ritchie]]'s [[\"Hello, World!\" program]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n10 PRINT \"Hello, World!\"\n20 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn [[infinite loop]] could be used to fill the display with the message.\n\nMost first-generation BASIC versions, such as [[MSX BASIC]] and [[GW-BASIC]], supported simple data types, loop cycles, and arrays. The following example is written for GW-BASIC, but will work in most versions of BASIC with minimal changes:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n10 INPUT \"What is your name: \"; U$\n20 PRINT \"Hello \"; U$\n30 INPUT \"How many stars do you want: \"; N\n40 S$ = \"\"\n50 FOR I = 1 TO N\n60 S$ = S$ + \"*\"\n70 NEXT I\n80 PRINT S$\n90 INPUT \"Do you want more stars? \"; A$\n100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90\n110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)\n120 IF A$ = \"Y\" OR A$ = \"y\" THEN GOTO 30\n130 PRINT \"Goodbye \"; U$\n140 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe resulting dialog might resemble:\n\n What is your name: Mike\n Hello Mike\n How many stars do you want: 7\n *******\n Do you want more stars? yes\n How many stars do you want: 3\n ***\n Do you want more stars? no\n Goodbye Mike\n\n==== Structured BASIC ====\nSecond-generation BASICs (for example, [[HP BASIC for OpenVMS|VAX Basic]], [[SuperBASIC]], [[True BASIC]], [[QuickBASIC]], [[BBC BASIC]], [[Pick operating system|Pick BASIC]], [[PowerBASIC]] and (arguably) [[COMAL]] introduced a number of features into the language, primarily related to structured and procedure-oriented programming. Usually, [[line number]]ing is omitted from the language and replaced with [[label (computer science)|labels]] (for [[GOTO]]) and [[subroutine|procedures]] to encourage easier and more flexible design.<ref name=\"GBvsQB\">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|title=Differences Between GW-BASIC and QBasic|date=2003-05-12|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019181140/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|archivedate=2013-10-19}}</ref> In addition keywords and structures to support repetition, selection and procedures with local variables were introduced.\n\nThe following example is in Microsoft QuickBASIC:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"QBasic\">\nREM QuickBASIC example\n\nREM Forward declaration - allows the main code to call a\nREM    subroutine that is declared later in the source code\nDECLARE SUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount!)\n\nREM Main program follows\nINPUT \"What is your name: \", UserName$\nPRINT \"Hello \"; UserName$\nDO\n   INPUT \"How many stars do you want: \", NumStars\n   CALL PrintSomeStars(NumStars)\n   DO\n      INPUT \"Do you want more stars? \", Answer$\n   LOOP UNTIL Answer$ <> \"\"\n   Answer$ = LEFT$(Answer$, 1)\nLOOP WHILE UCASE$(Answer$) = \"Y\"\nPRINT \"Goodbye \"; UserName$\nEND\n\nREM subroutine declaration\nSUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount)\n   REM This procedure uses a local variable called Stars$\n   Stars$ = STRING$(StarCount, \"*\")\n   PRINT Stars$\nEND SUB\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Object-oriented BASIC ====\nThird-generation BASIC dialects such as [[Visual Basic]], [[Xojo]], [[StarOffice Basic]] and [[BlitzMax]] introduced features to support object-oriented and [[event-driven programming]] paradigm. Most built-in procedures and functions are now represented as ''methods'' of standard objects rather than ''operators''. Also, the [[operating system]] became increasingly accessible to the BASIC language.\n\nThe following example is in [[Visual Basic .NET]]:\n\n<!-- needs a better (event-driven?) example -->\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"vbnet\">\nPublic Module StarsProgram\n   Private Function Ask(prompt As String) As String\n      Console.Write(prompt)\n      Return Console.ReadLine()\n   End Function\n\n   Public Sub Main()\n      Dim userName = Ask(\"What is your name: \")\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Hello {0}\", userName)\n\n      Dim answer As String\n\n      Do\n         Dim numStars = CInt(Ask(\"How many stars do you want: \"))\n         Dim stars As New String(\"*\"c, numStars)\n         Console.WriteLine(stars)\n\n         Do\n            answer = Ask(\"Do you want more stars? \")\n         Loop Until answer <> \"\"\n      Loop While answer.StartsWith(\"Y\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)\n\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Goodbye {0}\", userName)\n   End Sub\nEnd Module\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Standards==\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard for Minimal BASIC:\n** ANSI X3.60-1978 \"For minimal BASIC\"\n** ISO/IEC 6373:1984 \"Data Processing\u2014Programming Languages\u2014Minimal BASIC\"\n* [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-55 Minimal BASIC ''(withdrawn, similar to ANSI X3.60-1978)''\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard for Full BASIC:\n** ANSI X3.113-1987 \"Programming Languages Full BASIC\"\n** INCITS/ISO/IEC 10279-1991 (R2005) \"Information Technology \u2013 Programming Languages \u2013 Full BASIC\"\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Addendum Defining Modules:\n** ANSI X3.113 Interpretations-1992 \"BASIC Technical Information Bulletin # 1 Interpretations of ANSI 03.113-1987\"\n** ISO/IEC 10279:1991/ Amd 1:1994 \"Modules and Single Character Input Enhancement\"\n* [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-116 BASIC ''(withdrawn, similar to ANSI X3.113-1987)''\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of BASIC dialects]]\n* [[List of Computers With On-Board BASIC]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===General references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Programming languages: history and fundamentals|last=Sammet|first=Jean E.|date=1969|publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]]|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|language=English|oclc=819683527}}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia |chapter-url  = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800025.1198404\n |chapter      = BASIC\n |encyclopedia = History of Programming Languages I\n |last         = Kurtz\n |first        = Thomas E.\n |date         = 1981\n |publisher    = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n |isbn         = 978-0127450407\n |doi          = 10.1145/800025.1198404<!-- (currently broken, reported to issuer) -->\n |editor-last  = Wexelblat\n |editor-first = Richard\n |location     = New York\n |pages        = [https://archive.org/details/historyofprogram0000hist/page/515 515\u2013537]\n |ref          = harv\n |title        = History of programming languages\n |url          = https://archive.org/details/historyofprogram0000hist/page/515\n}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Back To BASIC: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language|last=Kemeny|first=John G.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Thomas E.|date=1985|publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=9780201134339|oclc=11399298|pages=141}}\n* {{Cite book|title=The Basic Handbook: Encyclopedia of the BASIC Computer Language|last=Lien|first=David A.|date=1986|publisher=Compusoft Publishing|isbn=9780932760333|oclc=12548310|edition=3rd}}\n* {{cite magazine |magazine=Time |date=29 April 2014 |title= Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal |url=http://time.com/69316/basic/ |ref=CITEREFTime2014}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Programming:BASIC}}\n* {{dmoz|Computers/Programming/Languages/BASIC|BASIC}}\n* {{HOPL-lang|176|BASIC\u2014Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code}}\n* {{YouTube|WYPNjSoDrqw|The Birth of Basic}}\n<!-- Please do not add any links for specific implementations of BASIC here.

In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written [[Play (theatre)|script]].\n\nImprovisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.\n\nImprovisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts. This practice, known as [[applied improvisation]], is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hainselin|first=Mathieu|last2=Aubry|first2=Alexandre|last3=Bourdin|first3=B\u00e9atrice|date=2018|title=Improving Teenagers' Divergent Thinking With Improvisational Theater|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=9|pages=1759|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759|pmid=30319485|pmc=6167459|issn=1664-1078}}</ref> It is sometimes used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest well-documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the [[Atellan Farce]] of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and the French [[Jacques Copeau]], founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in apeins cting training and rehearsal.<ref>''Twentieth Century Acting Training''. ed.

Improvisation exercises were developed further by [[Viola Spolin]] in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book ''Improvisation For The Theater'',<ref name=\"Spolin\">{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8101-4008-0}}</ref> the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director [[Keith Johnstone]] wrote ''[[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre]]'', a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented [[Theatresports]], which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''\n\nSpolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at [[The Compass Players]] in [[Chicago]], which led to [[The Second City]]. Her son, [[Paul Sills]], along with [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.<ref name=Wonderful>The story of the Compass Players and its development into The Second City is told by first-hand interviews in Jeffrey Sweet's book \"Something Wonderful Right Away\" (Limelight Editions, 2004)</ref><ref name=Compass>Janet Coleman's \"The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy\" (Centennial Publications of The University of Chicago Press, 1991).</ref>\n\nMany of the current \"rules\" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while [[Elaine May]] was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. [[Mike Nichols]], Ted Flicker, and [[Del Close]] were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Josephine Forsberg|Jo Forsberg]], who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became [[The Players Workshop]], the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.<ref name=Wonderful /><ref name=Compass />\n\nMany of the original cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]].\n[[File:Ligue d'improvisation montr\u00e9alaise (LIM) 20110306.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the Montreal Improvisation League]]\nSimultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in [[London]], was touring Europe. This work gave birth to [[Theatresports]], at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. [[Toronto]] has been home to a rich improv tradition.\n\nIn 1984, [[Dick Chudnow]] (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.\n\nIn San Francisco, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]] theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, [[Alan Myerson]] and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's [[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]] was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's [[Old Spaghetti Factory]] in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at [[Jacksons Lane]] Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at [[The Comedy Store, London]], above a Soho strip club.\n\nModern political improvisation's roots include [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Peter Brook]]'s \"happenings\" in England during the late 1960s, [[Augusto Boal]]'s \"Forum Theatre\" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, [[avant-garde]] experiments.\n\n[[Joan Littlewood]], an English actress and director who was active from the 1950s to 1960s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.\n\nIn 1987, [[Annoyance Theatre]] began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theannoyance.com/about-the-annoyance/history-of-the-annoyance/|title=History of the Annoyance {{!}} The Annoyance Theatre & Bar|website=theannoyance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Lebanese writer and director [[Lucien Bourjeily]] used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled ''66 Minutes in Damascus''. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/66-minutes-in-damascus/|title=Review of 66 Minutes in Damascus at Shoreditch Town Hall - Exeunt Magazine|author=Lois Jeary|work=exeuntmagazine.com}}</ref>\n\nRob Wittig and Mark C.

Many short form exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theatre games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert [[Neva Boyd]].<ref name=\"Spolin\"/> The short-form improv comedy television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has familiarized American and British viewers with short-form.\n\nLongform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style [[musical theater|musical]] such as [[Spontaneous Broadway]]. One of the better-known longform structures is [[Harold (improvisation)|the Harold]], developed by [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] co-founder [[Del Close]]. Many such longform structures now exist. \n\nLongform improvisation is especially performed in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles; has a strong presence in [[Austin]], Boston, [[Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], San Francisco, Seattle, [[Detroit]], Toronto, [[Vancouver]], Washington, D.C.; and is building a growing following in [[Baltimore]]<ref>https://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs-fe-comedy-20170522-story.html</ref>, [[Denver]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Montreal, [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], New Orleans, [[Omaha]], [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |title=Fall Back Comedy Festival this weekend |accessdate=2015-01-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103093553/http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |archivedate=November 3, 2012}}</ref> and Hawaii. Outside the United States, longform improv has a growing presence in the United Kingdom, especially in cities such as London,<ref>[[List of improvisational theatre companies]]{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}</ref> [[Bristol]], and at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].\n\n\n==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==\nOther forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and avant-garde<ref>Experimental Theatre from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook by James Roose Evans</ref> in nature and not necessarily intended to be [[comedy|comedic]]. These include [[Playback Theatre]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], the [[Jerzy Grotowski|Poor Theatre]], [[the Open Theatre]], to name only a few.\n\n[[The Open Theatre]] was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by director [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as \"sound and movement\" and \"transformations\", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s \"[[poor theater]]\" in Poland.[1]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason=\"[1]\"? Was someone trying to make a citation there?}} During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.\n\nLongform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.\n\n==Applying improv principles in life==\nMany people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embracing-the-dark-side/200908/everything-i-need-know-i-learned-improv|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Improv|work=Psychology Today}}</ref> For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] in a commencement address said,<ref>Stephen Colbert 2006 Commencement Address at Knox College [http://departments.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12547.html Transcript]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all.

In a New York Times article titled [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02unbox.html \"Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?\"], Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, \"executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves.\"\n\n==In film and television==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\nMany directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many [[silent film]]makers such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]] used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] to fit. The [[Marx Brothers]] were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their [[ad lib]]s often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/improvise-v-ad-lib.2495051/|title=improvise v. ad-lib|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe British director [[Mike Leigh]] makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and other [[mockumentary]] films of director [[Christopher Guest]] were created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material. ''[[Blue in the Face]]'' is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.\n\nSome of the best known American film directors who used improvisation in their work with actors are [[John Cassavetes]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Christopher Guest]], and [[Rob Reiner]].\n\nImprov comedy techniques have also been used in hit television shows such as [[HBO|HBO's]] ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' created by [[Larry David]], the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway]]'' (and its spinoffs ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' and ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. A very early American improv television program was the weekly half-hour \u201cWhat Happens Now?\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archive.org/details/radiodailyoctdec49unse/page/n134|title=Tele Topics|work=Television Daily}}</ref> which premiered on New York's [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]] on October 15, 1949 and ran for 22 episodes. \u201cThe Improvisers\u201d were six actors (including [[Larry Blyden]], [[Ross Martin]], and Jean Alexander \u2013 Jean Pugsley at the time) who improvised skits based on situations suggested by viewers.  In Canada, the series ''[[Train 48]]'' was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series ''[[This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated]]'' incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show ''Reno 911!'' also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'' is an improvisational game show, much like ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''. The BBC sitcoms ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/06/television-bbc|title=BBC sitcom lets kids improvise|author=Ben Dowell|work=the Guardian}}</ref> and ''[[The Thick of It]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-thick-of-it-back-in-the-loop-1805589.html|title=The Thick of It: Back in the loop|work=The Independent}}</ref> also had some improvised elements in them.\n\n==Psychology==\nIn the field of the psychology of [[consciousness]], Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper ''Acting: an altered state of consciousness''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scheiffele |first1=Eberhard |journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance |title=an altered state of consciousness |date=2001 |volume= 6 |issue=2 |doi=10.1080/13569780120070722 |pages=179\u2013191}}</ref> According to G. William Farthing in ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sci-con.org/2004/12/levels-of-consciousness/ |title=Levels of Consciousness |work=sci-con.org }}</ref> Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.\n\nIn the growing field of [[Drama Therapy]], [[psychodrama]]tic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for [[Drama Therapy]], are used extensively. The ''[[Yes, and...|\"Yes, and\"]]'' rule has been compared to [[Milton Erickson]]'s ''utilization'' process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for [[couples therapy]] and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of [[social anxiety disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/yes,_and.pdf|title=Yes, and: Acceptance, Resistance, and Change in Improv, Aikido, and Psychotherapy|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05xcvc2|title=BBC World Service - People Fixing The World, Improvising Your Way Out of Anxiety|website=[[BBC]]|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Structure and process==\nImprovisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.\n\nIn order for an improvised [[scene (fiction)|scene]] to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of [[co-creation]]. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[Mime artist|mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect\u2014this is known as ''gagging''\u2014but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''[[Yes, and...|\"Yes, And...\"]]'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The ''\"Yes, And...\"'' rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a \"base (or shared) reality\" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the ''\"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)\"'' practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' members.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/upright-citizens-brigade-writes-its-book-on-improv.html?_r=0 Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2014</ref>\n\nThe unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[Theatrical property|props]] that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime artist|mime]]. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin.<ref name=\"Spolin\"/> As with all improv ''offers'', improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or \"miraculously\" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.\n\nBecause improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.\n\nIn improv formats with multiple scenes, an agreed-upon signal is used to denote scene changes. Most often, this takes the form of a performer running in front of the scene, known as a \"wipe.\" Tapping a character in or out can also be employed. The performers not currently part of the scene often stand at the side or back of the stage, and can enter or exit the scene by stepping into or out of the stage center.\n\n==Community==\nMany theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.\n\nIn addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.\n\nIn Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European [[Improv groups]] have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.\n\n==Notable contributors to the field==\nSome key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and originator of [[Theater Games]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as [[The Harold]]. Other luminaries include [[Keith Johnstone]], the British teacher and writer\u2013author of ''[[Impro]]'', who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform [[Theatresports]] format, [[Dick Chudnow]], founder of [[ComedySportz]] which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115124528/http://magicmeathands.com/ The Magic Meathands], who pioneered the concept of \"Commun-edy Outreach\" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.\n\n[[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded [[The Compass Players]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true \"people's Theatre\", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of \"That Movie In Your Head\", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the [[Canadian Improv Games]]. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name \"ImprovOlympic\" and now as \"IO\"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's \"Time Dash\" game with Del Close's \"Harold\" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.<ref>An account of this process which lead up to the development of modern longform improvisation, as seen through first-person accounts of Shepherd and Halpern, can be found in the following documentary film: {{cite AV media |people=Mike Fly |date= |year=2010 |title=David Shepherd: A Lifetime in Improvisational Theatre |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wgtkgCH3A |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 Jonathan Fox founded [[Playback Theatre]], a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.\n\n[[The Groundlings]] is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in [[Los Angeles]], California. The late [[Gary Austin]], founder of The Groundlings, taught improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He was widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work was grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the \"second generation\" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the \"Clap-In\" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] founded the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school.

In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written [[Play (theatre)|script]].\n\nImprovisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.\n\nImprovisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts. This practice, known as [[applied improvisation]], is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hainselin|first=Mathieu|last2=Aubry|first2=Alexandre|last3=Bourdin|first3=B\u00e9atrice|date=2018|title=Improving Teenagers' Divergent Thinking With Improvisational Theater|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=9|pages=1759|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759|pmid=30319485|pmc=6167459|issn=1664-1078}}</ref> It is sometimes used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest well-documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the [[Atellan Farce]] of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and the French [[Jacques Copeau]], founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.<ref>''Twentieth Century Acting Training''. ed.

Improvisation exercises were developed further by [[Viola Spolin]] in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book ''Improvisation For The Theater'',<ref name=\"Spolin\">{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8101-4008-0}}</ref> the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director [[Keith Johnstone]] wrote ''[[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre]]'', a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented [[Theatresports]], which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''\n\nSpolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at [[The Compass Players]] in [[Chicago]], which led to [[The Second City]]. Her son, [[Paul Sills]], along with [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.<ref name=Wonderful>The story of the Compass Players and its development into The Second City is told by first-hand interviews in Jeffrey Sweet's book \"Something Wonderful Right Away\" (Limelight Editions, 2004)</ref><ref name=Compass>Janet Coleman's \"The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy\" (Centennial Publications of The University of Chicago Press, 1991).</ref>\n\nMany of the current \"rules\" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while [[Elaine May]] was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. [[Mike Nichols]], Ted Flicker, and [[Del Close]] were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Josephine Forsberg|Jo Forsberg]], who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became [[The Players Workshop]], the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.<ref name=Wonderful /><ref name=Compass />\n\nMany of the original cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]].\n[[File:Ligue d'improvisation montr\u00e9alaise (LIM) 20110306.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the Montreal Improvisation League]]\nSimultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in [[London]], was touring Europe. This work gave birth to [[Theatresports]], at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. [[Toronto]] has been home to a rich improv tradition.\n\nIn 1984, [[Dick Chudnow]] (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.\n\nIn San Francisco, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]] theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, [[Alan Myerson]] and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's [[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]] was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's [[Old Spaghetti Factory]] in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at [[Jacksons Lane]] Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at [[The Comedy Store, London]], above a Soho strip club.\n\nModern political improvisation's roots include [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Peter Brook]]'s \"happenings\" in England during the late 1960s, [[Augusto Boal]]'s \"Forum Theatre\" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, [[avant-garde]] experiments.\n\n[[Joan Littlewood]], an English actress and director who was active from the 1950s to 1960s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.\n\nIn 1987, [[Annoyance Theatre]] began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theannoyance.com/about-the-annoyance/history-of-the-annoyance/|title=History of the Annoyance {{!}} The Annoyance Theatre & Bar|website=theannoyance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Lebanese writer and director [[Lucien Bourjeily]] used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled ''66 Minutes in Damascus''. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/66-minutes-in-damascus/|title=Review of 66 Minutes in Damascus at Shoreditch Town Hall - Exeunt Magazine|author=Lois Jeary|work=exeuntmagazine.com}}</ref>\n\nRob Wittig and Mark C.

Many short form exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theatre games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert [[Neva Boyd]].<ref name=\"Spolin\"/> The short-form improv comedy television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has familiarized American and British viewers with short-form.\n\nLongform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style [[musical theater|musical]] such as [[Spontaneous Broadway]]. One of the better-known longform structures is [[Harold (improvisation)|the Harold]], developed by [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] co-founder [[Del Close]]. Many such longform structures now exist. \n\nLongform improvisation is especially performed in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles; has a strong presence in [[Austin]], Boston, [[Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], San Francisco, Seattle, [[Detroit]], Toronto, [[Vancouver]], Washington, D.C.; and is building a growing following in [[Baltimore]]<ref>https://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs-fe-comedy-20170522-story.html</ref>, [[Denver]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Montreal, [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], New Orleans, [[Omaha]], [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |title=Fall Back Comedy Festival this weekend |accessdate=2015-01-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103093553/http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |archivedate=November 3, 2012}}</ref> and Hawaii. Outside the United States, longform improv has a growing presence in the United Kingdom, especially in cities such as London,<ref>[[List of improvisational theatre companies]]{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}</ref> [[Bristol]], and at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].\n\n\n==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==\nOther forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and avant-garde<ref>Experimental Theatre from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook by James Roose Evans</ref> in nature and not necessarily intended to be [[comedy|comedic]]. These include [[Playback Theatre]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], the [[Jerzy Grotowski|Poor Theatre]], [[the Open Theatre]], to name only a few.\n\n[[The Open Theatre]] was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by director [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as \"sound and movement\" and \"transformations\", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s \"[[poor theater]]\" in Poland.[1]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason=\"[1]\"? Was someone trying to make a citation there?}} During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.\n\nLongform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.\n\n==Applying improv principles in life==\nMany people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embracing-the-dark-side/200908/everything-i-need-know-i-learned-improv|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Improv|work=Psychology Today}}</ref> For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] in a commencement address said,<ref>Stephen Colbert 2006 Commencement Address at Knox College [http://departments.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12547.html Transcript]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all. With no script. No idea what's going to happen, often with people and places you have never seen before. And you are not in control. So say \"yes.\" And if you're lucky, you'll find people who will say \"yes\" back.}}\n\n[[Tina Fey]] in her book ''[[Bossypants]]'' lists several rules of improv that apply in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109232959/http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-01-09 |title=Tina Fey's Rules For Improv\u2026 And Your Career |work=Women 2.0}}</ref> There has been much interest in bringing lessons from improv into the corporate world. In a New York Times article titled [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02unbox.html \"Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?\"], Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, \"executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves.\"\n\n==In film and television==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\nMany directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many [[silent film]]makers such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]] used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] to fit. The [[Marx Brothers]] were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their [[ad lib]]s often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/improvise-v-ad-lib.2495051/|title=improvise v. ad-lib|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe British director [[Mike Leigh]] makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and other [[mockumentary]] films of director [[Christopher Guest]] were created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material. ''[[Blue in the Face]]'' is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.\n\nSome of the best known American film directors who used improvisation in their work with actors are [[John Cassavetes]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Christopher Guest]], and [[Rob Reiner]].\n\nImprov comedy techniques have also been used in hit television shows such as [[HBO|HBO's]] ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' created by [[Larry David]], the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway]]'' (and its spinoffs ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' and ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. A very early American improv television program was the weekly half-hour \u201cWhat Happens Now?\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archive.org/details/radiodailyoctdec49unse/page/n134|title=Tele Topics|work=Television Daily}}</ref> which premiered on New York's [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV]] on October 15, 1949 and ran for 22 episodes. \u201cThe Improvisers\u201d were six actors (including [[Larry Blyden]], [[Ross Martin]], and Jean Alexander \u2013 Jean Pugsley at the time) who improvised skits based on situations suggested by viewers.  In Canada, the series ''[[Train 48]]'' was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series ''[[This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated]]'' incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show ''Reno 911!'' also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'' is an improvisational game show, much like ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''. The BBC sitcoms ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/06/television-bbc|title=BBC sitcom lets kids improvise|author=Ben Dowell|work=the Guardian}}</ref> and ''[[The Thick of It]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-thick-of-it-back-in-the-loop-1805589.html|title=The Thick of It: Back in the loop|work=The Independent}}</ref> also had some improvised elements in them.\n\n==Psychology==\nIn the field of the psychology of [[consciousness]], Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper ''Acting: an altered state of consciousness''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scheiffele |first1=Eberhard |journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance |title=an altered state of consciousness |date=2001 |volume= 6 |issue=2 |doi=10.1080/13569780120070722 |pages=179\u2013191}}</ref> According to G. William Farthing in ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sci-con.org/2004/12/levels-of-consciousness/ |title=Levels of Consciousness |work=sci-con.org }}</ref> Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.\n\nIn the growing field of [[Drama Therapy]], [[psychodrama]]tic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for [[Drama Therapy]], are used extensively. The ''[[Yes, and...|\"Yes, and\"]]'' rule has been compared to [[Milton Erickson]]'s ''utilization'' process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for [[couples therapy]] and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of [[social anxiety disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/yes,_and.pdf|title=Yes, and: Acceptance, Resistance, and Change in Improv, Aikido, and Psychotherapy|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05xcvc2|title=BBC World Service - People Fixing The World, Improvising Your Way Out of Anxiety|website=[[BBC]]|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Structure and process==\nImprovisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.\n\nIn order for an improvised [[scene (fiction)|scene]] to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of [[co-creation]]. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[Mime artist|mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect\u2014this is known as ''gagging''\u2014but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''[[Yes, and...|\"Yes, And...\"]]'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The ''\"Yes, And...\"'' rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a \"base (or shared) reality\" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the ''\"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)\"'' practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' members.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/upright-citizens-brigade-writes-its-book-on-improv.html?_r=0 Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2014</ref>\n\nThe unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[Theatrical property|props]] that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime artist|mime]]. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin.<ref name=\"Spolin\"/> As with all improv ''offers'', improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or \"miraculously\" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.\n\nBecause improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.\n\nIn improv formats with multiple scenes, an agreed-upon signal is used to denote scene changes. Most often, this takes the form of a performer running in front of the scene, known as a \"wipe.\" Tapping a character in or out can also be employed. The performers not currently part of the scene often stand at the side or back of the stage, and can enter or exit the scene by stepping into or out of the stage center.\n\n==Community==\nMany theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.\n\nIn addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.\n\nIn Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European [[Improv groups]] have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.\n\n==Notable contributors to the field==\nSome key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and originator of [[Theater Games]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as [[The Harold]]. Other luminaries include [[Keith Johnstone]], the British teacher and writer\u2013author of ''[[Impro]]'', who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform [[Theatresports]] format, [[Dick Chudnow]], founder of [[ComedySportz]] which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115124528/http://magicmeathands.com/ The Magic Meathands], who pioneered the concept of \"Commun-edy Outreach\" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.\n\n[[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded [[The Compass Players]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true \"people's Theatre\", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of \"That Movie In Your Head\", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the [[Canadian Improv Games]]. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name \"ImprovOlympic\" and now as \"IO\"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's \"Time Dash\" game with Del Close's \"Harold\" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.<ref>An account of this process which lead up to the development of modern longform improvisation, as seen through first-person accounts of Shepherd and Halpern, can be found in the following documentary film: {{cite AV media |people=Mike Fly |date= |year=2010 |title=David Shepherd: A Lifetime in Improvisational Theatre |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wgtkgCH3A |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 Jonathan Fox founded [[Playback Theatre]], a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.\n\n[[The Groundlings]] is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in [[Los Angeles]], California. The late [[Gary Austin]], founder of The Groundlings, taught improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He was widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work was grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the \"second generation\" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the \"Clap-In\" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] founded the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City's East Village, known as UCBeast.\n\n[[Hoopla Impro]] are the founders of the UK and London's 1st improv theatre.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Paskett |first1=Zoe |title=London's Best Improv Comedy Clubs and Nights |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/londons-best-improv-comedy-clubs-and-nights-a3834651.html |publisher=[[Evening Standard]] |date=10 May 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Improv Comedy Club |url=https://www.hooplaimpro.com/improv-comedy-club-london-bridge.html}}</ref> They also run an annual UK improv festival<ref>{{cite web |title=Improv has got big! |url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/live/features/improv_has_got_big/ |publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]] |date=25 April 2019}}</ref> and improv marathon.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Holmes |first1=Paul |title=Hoopla Improv Marathon |url=https://thevelvetonion.com/2017/10/17/hoopla-improv-marathon/amp/ |work=The Velvet Onion |date=17 October 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Hoopla Improv Marathon |url=https://www.hooplaimpro.com/the-hoopla-improv-marathon}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[The Free Association]] opened in London as a counterpart to American improv schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/culture/improvised-comedy-the-free-association-1103011.html|title=The Rise Of Improvised Comedy By Sarah Powell|last=October 2017|first=31|website=www.femalefirst.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nGunter L\u00f6sel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (from Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, Close...), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.<ref>''Das Spiel mit dem Chaos - Zur Performativit\u00e4t des Improvisationstheaters''.

It has a population of around 6,200. Most local amenities are shared with the adjacent villages of [[Carfin]], [[Holytown]] and [[New Stevenston]] which have a combined population of around 20,000 across the four localities.\n\n==History==\nSituated on rich tracts of [[coal]] and other minerals, the original settlement of Newarthill occurred in the early to mid-nineteenth century. Originally thought to have been named after the larger and more northerly [[Harthill, Scotland|Harthill]], it has recently been discovered that historical mentions of Newarthill actually pre-date Harthill. One quoted, but unproven, derivation is the Gaelic Nuadh-Ard, meaning New Hill, with a tautological \"hill\" added in the English translation.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town of Newarthill is roughly bounded by the Legbrannock Burn to the north, the railway line connecting [[Carfin]] and [[Cleland, North Lanarkshire|Cleland]] to the south, the junction of the [[B7066 road|B7066]] with Biggar Road to the east and the [[A723 road|A723]] to the west. Situated on the northern side of the [[Clyde Valley]], the town rises highest in the north east and slopes downward to the west. The higher land was the centre of initial settlement and holds most of the town's oldest and most significant buildings. Several modern housing estates have appeared on the outskirts and greenbelt areas of the village, rendering it less distinct from the surrounding conurbation.\n\nThere is no town centre as such, with residents chiefly relying on the amenities provided by neighbouring places such as [[Motherwell]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], [[Wishaw]], [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] and [[Glasgow]]. It is generally considered to consist of two schemes, the older, formerly coal-heated east and the more recent, gas-powered west. This perception has altered in light of large new housing estates encircling the village.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe local schools are Newarthill Primary, St Teresa's Primary, Keir Hardie Memorial Primary and [[Brannock High School]]. The local authority-funded community centre, also on High Street, offers a range of activities from nursery care to computing classes. The library on Kirkhall Road offers a modern range of books and other media despite the distinctly 1970s exterior. Sports facilities are few and far between, with the existing pitches within school grounds long since closed to the general public.\n\nThe local police station lies near the centre of the village, while fire brigade and hospital facilities have to be sought outwith Newarthill. The nearest hospitals are [[Wishaw General Hospital|Wishaw General]] and [[Monklands Hospital|Monklands Infirmary]] in [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]]. There are two main places of worship, St. Teresa's Chapel and Newarthill Parish Church, with the nearest [[mosque]] in [[New Stevenston]].\n\n===Travel and transport facilities===\nNewarthill is situated in close proximity to the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]], offering road connections to Glasgow, Edinburgh, between and beyond. The B7066 is the major connecting route to Carfin and Motherwell, while those heading west on minor roads will generally do so through [[Holytown]], [[Mossend]] and beyond. These roads are well served by regular bus services by companies including [[First Glasgow]] 254 and united 1 These services generally operate until 5pm. Service is limited on Sundays. There are several local taxi companies with varying levels of service.\n\nThe closest railway stations, depending on your position in Newarthill, are to be found at {{rws|Carfin}} and {{rws|Holytown}} (rather confusingly, Carfin Station is geographically within Newarthill and Holytown Station is within the adjacent village of New Stevenston) which are served by regularly timetabled trains operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]], connecting [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. There is a two-hourly service on Sundays. The nearest mainline station, connecting to services on the [[East Coast Main Line]] and [[West Coast Main Line]] travelling towards cities such as [[London]], is {{rws|Motherwell}}.\n\n===Sports and Leisure===\nNewarthill Bowling Club exists just off High Street and adjacent to Newarthill Primary School, however it remains a members-only facility. On Mosshall Street, there are several football pitches and an amateur boxing club.\n\nNewarthill has few leisure facilities of note, excepting the facilities within [[Brannock High School]] and at Mosshall Street (where the boxing club is located). The village is, however, situated very close to several large sports facilities in the surrounding area, with [[Dalziel Park]] (sports fields and golf club), [[Jerviston|Colville Park Golf Club]] and [[Ravenscraig Sports Centre]]. The residents of Newarthill make use largely of the [[Aquatec]] Leisure Centre which is located on the outskirts of nearby Motherwell Town Centre. The facilities available here include a family friendly swimming pool and a well equipped gym.\n\nThe ''Torrance Park'' golf course and leisure facility between Newarthill and [[Newhouse, North Lanarkshire|Newhouse]] was completed in 2019<ref>[https://www.torranceparkgolf.co.uk/course/ The Course], Torrance Park Golf Club</ref> - this forms part of a wider residential development, based off the main road to [[Holytown]] and nominally linked to that village in documentation,<ref>[https://www.motherwelltimes.co.uk/business/plans-submitted-for-phase-two-of-torrance-park-1-4882854 Plans submitted for phase two of Torrance Park], Motherwell Times, 4 March 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.scottishconstructionnow.com/article/green-light-for-more-than-600-new-homes-at-torrance-park Green light for more than 600 new homes at Torrance Park], Scottish Construction Now, 29 October 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.murray-estates.co.uk/our-portfolio/torrance-park/phase/torrance-park-phase-2 Torrance Park - Phase 2], Murray Estates, 2019</ref> but sharing the ''ML1 5'' postcode with Newarthill and being counted alongside it in some statistics.\n\nThere is also a local amateur football team, Newarthill Athletic AFC, who were founded in 2015. They follow a long list of teams from the area.\n\n===Public houses and takeaways===\n[[File:Newarthill Main Street.jpg|thumb|Main Street in Newarthill]]\nNewarthill, like several surrounding villages, boasts its fair share of public houses and licensed establishments. These are concentrated in the High Street area and have consistently closed and reopened at the mercy of the drinking public. Currently these include Bar Mango, the Cottage Inn, Newarthill Bowling Club, The Club (formerly Newarthill Working Men's Club), The Oranger, and the Hibernian Social Club.\n\nThere is a similar volume of fast food takeaways of the more traditional variety - there are Indian and fish and chip restaurants, but no multinational brands. The Bakers Oven, a small cafe, has a small sit-in area, 'Taste' (a Coffee and Sandwich bar) was situated on the High Street but recently closed and the premises have been converted to an extension for the next door veterinary surgery.\n\nThere used to be a local Post Office and Spar store, but it was demolished after a fire burned it down on Christmas Day 2009. A [[Nisa (retailer)|Nisa Local]] convenience store (opened Nov 2010) has been built on the Spar site, which does have a Post Office, and is one of only a few small food stores in the village. The main tourist accommodation, the Silverburn Hotel was recently damaged in a fire and having been foreclosed for over a year, has recently been demolished.\n\nChanda best takeaway\n\n==Notable figures==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n* [[Damian Barr]], journalist\n*[[Charlie Flynn]], boxer\n* [[Rhonda Jones]], footballer\n* [[Christopher Kane]], fashion designer\n* [[Liz Lochhead]], playwright, author and former [[Poet Laureate]] of Scotland\n* [[Gary McAllister]],  Scotland international midfielder\n* [[Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert McAlpine]], construction industry figure\n* [[Hugh McJarrow]], footballer\n*[[Leigh Nicol|Leigh Nicol,]] footballer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/budding-scotland-star-leigh-nicols-2549035|title=Budding Scotland star Leigh Nicol\u2019s dream move to Arsenal Ladies hit by funding snag|last=Paterson|first=Colin|date=2012-08-28|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n*[[Elaine C.

There are two main places of worship, St. Teresa's Chapel and Newarthill Parish Church, with the nearest [[mosque]] in [[New Stevenston]].\n\n===Travel and transport facilities===\nNewarthill is situated in close proximity to the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]], offering road connections to Glasgow, Edinburgh, between and beyond. The B7066 is the major connecting route to Carfin and Motherwell, while those heading west on minor roads will generally do so through [[Holytown]], [[Mossend]] and beyond. These roads are well served by regular bus services by companies including [[First Glasgow]] 254 and united 1 These services generally operate until 5pm. Service is limited on Sundays. There are several local taxi companies with varying levels of service.\n\nThe closest railway stations, depending on your position in Newarthill, are to be found at {{rws|Carfin}} and {{rws|Holytown}} (rather confusingly, Carfin Station is geographically within Newarthill and Holytown Station is within the adjacent village of New Stevenston) which are served by regularly timetabled trains operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]], connecting [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. There is a two-hourly service on Sundays. The nearest mainline station, connecting to services on the [[East Coast Main Line]] and [[West Coast Main Line]] travelling towards cities such as [[London]], is {{rws|Motherwell}}.\n\n===Sports and Leisure===\nNewarthill Bowling Club exists just off High Street and adjacent to Newarthill Primary School, however it remains a members-only facility. On Mosshall Street, there are several football pitches and an amateur boxing club.\n\nNewarthill has few leisure facilities of note, excepting the facilities within [[Brannock High School]] and at Mosshall Street (where the boxing club is located). The village is, however, situated very close to several large sports facilities in the surrounding area, with [[Dalziel Park]] (sports fields and golf club), [[Jerviston|Colville Park Golf Club]] and [[Ravenscraig Sports Centre]]. The residents of Newarthill make use largely of the [[Aquatec]] Leisure Centre which is located on the outskirts of nearby Motherwell Town Centre. The facilities available here include a family friendly swimming pool and a well equipped gym.\n\nThe ''Torrance Park'' golf course and leisure facility between Newarthill and [[Newhouse, North Lanarkshire|Newhouse]] was completed in 2019<ref>[https://www.torranceparkgolf.co.uk/course/ The Course], Torrance Park Golf Club</ref> - this forms part of a wider residential development, based off the main road to [[Holytown]] and nominally linked to that village in documentation,<ref>[https://www.motherwelltimes.co.uk/business/plans-submitted-for-phase-two-of-torrance-park-1-4882854 Plans submitted for phase two of Torrance Park], Motherwell Times, 4 March 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.scottishconstructionnow.com/article/green-light-for-more-than-600-new-homes-at-torrance-park Green light for more than 600 new homes at Torrance Park], Scottish Construction Now, 29 October 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.murray-estates.co.uk/our-portfolio/torrance-park/phase/torrance-park-phase-2 Torrance Park - Phase 2], Murray Estates, 2019</ref> but sharing the ''ML1 5'' postcode with Newarthill and being counted alongside it in some statistics.\n\nThere is also a local amateur football team, Newarthill Athletic AFC, who were founded in 2015. They follow a long list of teams from the area.\n\n===Public houses and takeaways===\n[[File:Newarthill Main Street.jpg|thumb|Main Street in Newarthill]]\nNewarthill, like several surrounding villages, boasts its fair share of public houses and licensed establishments. These are concentrated in the High Street area and have consistently closed and reopened at the mercy of the drinking public. Currently these include Bar Mango, the Cottage Inn, Newarthill Bowling Club, The Club (formerly Newarthill Working Men's Club), The Oranger, and the Hibernian Social Club.\n\nThere is a similar volume of fast food takeaways of the more traditional variety - there are Indian and fish and chip restaurants, but no multinational brands. The Bakers Oven, a small cafe, has a small sit-in area, 'Taste' (a Coffee and Sandwich bar) was situated on the High Street but recently closed and the premises have been converted to an extension for the next door veterinary surgery.\n\nThere used to be a local Post Office and Spar store, but it was demolished after a fire burned it down on Christmas Day 2009. A [[Nisa (retailer)|Nisa Local]] convenience store (opened Nov 2010) has been built on the Spar site, which does have a Post Office, and is one of only a few small food stores in the village. The main tourist accommodation, the Silverburn Hotel was recently damaged in a fire and having been foreclosed for over a year, has recently been demolished.\n\n==Notable figures==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n* [[Damian Barr]], journalist\n*[[Charlie Flynn]], boxer\n* [[Rhonda Jones]], footballer\n* [[Christopher Kane]], fashion designer\n* [[Liz Lochhead]], playwright, author and former [[Poet Laureate]] of Scotland\n* [[Gary McAllister]],  Scotland international midfielder\n* [[Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert McAlpine]], construction industry figure\n* [[Hugh McJarrow]], footballer\n*[[Leigh Nicol|Leigh Nicol,]] footballer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/budding-scotland-star-leigh-nicols-2549035|title=Budding Scotland star Leigh Nicol\u2019s dream move to Arsenal Ladies hit by funding snag|last=Paterson|first=Colin|date=2012-08-28|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n*[[Elaine C.

Sea|Caribbean]] to the east, [[Costa Rica]] to the south, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the southwest. [[Managua]] is the country's capital and largest city and is also the third-largest city in [[Central America]], behind [[Tegucigalpa]] and [[Guatemala City]]. The multi-ethnic population of six million includes people of indigenous, European, African, and Asian heritage. The main language is Spanish. Indigenous tribes on the [[Mosquito Coast]] speak their own languages and English.\n\nOriginally inhabited by various indigenous cultures since ancient times, the region was conquered by the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 16th century. Nicaragua gained independence from Spain in 1821. The Mosquito Coast followed a different historical path, being colonized by the English in the 17th century and later coming under British rule. It became an autonomous territory of Nicaragua in 1860 and its northernmost part was transferred to [[Honduras]] in 1960. Since its independence, Nicaragua has undergone periods of political unrest, dictatorship, occupation and fiscal crisis, including the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] of the 1960s and 1970s and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] of the 1980s.\n\nThe mixture of cultural traditions has generated substantial diversity in folklore, cuisine, music, and literature, particularly the latter, given the literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and writers such as [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]].

[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Nicaragua|national assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Nicaragua's major political parties discussed the possibility of going from a presidential system to a parliamentary system. Their reason: there would be a clear differentiation between the [[head of government]] (prime minister) and the [[head of state]] (president). Nevertheless, it was later argued that the true reason behind this proposal was to find a legal way for President Ortega to stay in power after January 2012, when his second and last government period was expected to end. Ortega was reelected to a third term in November 2016.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Nicaragua}}\nNicaragua pursues an independent foreign policy. [[Territorial disputes of Nicaragua|Nicaragua is in territorial disputes]] with Colombia over the [[Archipelago de San Andr\u00e9s y Providencia]] and [[Quita Sue\u00f1o Bank]] and with Costa Rica over a boundary dispute involving the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]].\n\nThe [[International Court of Justice]], in regard to the case of [[Nicaragua v. United States]] in 1984, found that the United States was \"in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State\", \"not to intervene in its affairs\", \"not to violate its sovereignty\", \"not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce\".<ref name=\"icj-cij\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Military of Nicaragua}}\n[[File:Afghan MI-17 and AN-26.jpg|thumb|alt=Afghan MI-17 and An-26| [[An-26|AN-26]]  and [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17]] are used by the [[Nicaraguan Air Force]].]]\n\nThe [[Military of Nicaragua|armed forces of Nicaragua]] consists of various military contingents. Nicaragua has an [[Nicaraguan Army|army]], [[Nicaraguan Navy|navy]] and an [[Nicaraguan Air Force|air force]]. There are roughly 14,000 active duty personnel, which is much less compared to the numbers seen during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. Although the army has had a rough military history, a portion of its forces, which were known as the [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|national guard]], became integrated with what is now the [[Polic\u00eda Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Police of Nicaragua]]. In essence, the police became a ''[[gendarmerie]]''. The National Police of Nicaragua are rarely, if ever, labeled as a ''[[gendarmerie]]''. The other elements and manpower that were not devoted to the national police were sent over to cultivate the new Army of Nicaragua.\n\nThe age to serve in the armed forces is 17 and [[conscription]] is not imminent. {{As of|2006}}, the military budget was roughly 0.7% of Nicaragua's expenditures.\n\nIn 2017, Nicaragua signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\n\n[[File:600x400 1329442889 170212amb-nota2,photo01.jpg|thumb| [[National Police of Nicaragua]].]]\n\nThe [[National Police of Nicaragua]] Force (in Spanish: La Polic\u00eda Nacional Nicarag\u00fcense) is the national police of Nicaragua. The force is in charge of regular police functions and, at times, works in conjunction with the Nicaraguan military, making it an indirect and rather subtle version of a gendarmerie.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  However, the Nicaraguan National Police work separately and have a different established set of norms than the nation's military.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nNicaragua is the safest country in [[Central America]] and one of the safest in Latin America, according to the [[United Nations Development Program]], with a homicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000 inhabitants.<ref>Johnson, Stephen; Kareff, Samuel and Asvapromtada, Siremorn (July 10, 2012) [http://csis.org/files/publication/120710_Johnson_Nicaragua_HemFocus.pdf Nicaragua: Lessons from a Country with a Low Crime Rate]. csis.org</ref>\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main|Departments of Nicaragua|}}\nNicaragua is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] republic.

Almost all of the upper class and nearly a quarter of the middle class are substantial landowners.\n\nA 1985 government study classified 69.4 percent of the population as poor on the basis that they were unable to satisfy one or more of their basic needs in housing, sanitary services (water, sewage, and garbage collection), education, and employment. The defining standards for this study were very low; housing was considered substandard if it was constructed of discarded materials with dirt floors or if it was occupied by more than four persons per room.\n\nRural workers are dependent on agricultural wage labor, especially in coffee and cotton. Only a small fraction hold permanent jobs. Most are migrants who follow crops during the harvest period and find other work during the off-season. The \"lower\" peasants are typically smallholders without sufficient land to sustain a family; they also join the harvest labor force. The \"upper\" peasants have sufficient resources to be economically independent. They produce enough surplus, beyond their personal needs, to allow them to participate in the national and world markets.\n\n[[File:Rotonda Ruben dario.jpg|thumb|left| The capital city [[Managua]] at night]]The urban lower class is characterized by the informal sector of the economy. The informal sector consists of small-scale enterprises that utilize traditional technologies and operate outside the legal regime of labor protections and taxation. Workers in the informal sector are self-employed, unsalaried family workers or employees of small-enterprises, and they are generally poor.\n\nNicaragua's informal sector workers include tinsmiths, mattress makers, seamstresses, bakers, shoemakers, and carpenters; people who take in laundry and ironing or prepare food for sale in the streets; and thousands of peddlers, owners of small businesses (often operating out of their own homes), and market stall operators. Some work alone, but others labor in the small talleres   (workshops/factories) that are responsible for a large share of the country's industrial production. Because informal sector earnings are generally very low, few families can subsist on one income.<ref name=\"Nicaragua \u2013 SOCIETY\">{{cite web |title=Nicaragua \u2013 SOCIETY |quote=CITATION: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.

These families are oligarchical in nature and have ruled Nicaragua for generations and their wealth is politically and economically horizontally and vertically integrated.\n\nNicaragua is currently a member of the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], which is also known as ALBA. ALBA has proposed creating a new currency, the [[SUCRE (currency)|Sucre]], for use among its members. In essence, this means that the Nicaraguan c\u00f3rdoba will be replaced with the Sucre. Other nations that will follow a similar pattern include: [[Venezuela]], Ecuador, [[Bolivia]], Honduras, [[Cuba]], Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, [[Dominica]] and [[Antigua and Barbuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2009/12/13/nacionales/10246 |title=Primera prueba del sucre en enero \u2013 LA PRENSA \u2014 EL Diario de los Nicarag\u00fcenses |publisher=Laprensa.com.ni |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2010-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116202832/http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2009/12/13/nacionales/10246 |archivedate=2010-01-16 }}</ref>\n\nNicaragua is considering construction of a canal linking the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, which President Daniel Ortega has said will give Nicaragua its \"economic independence.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-25607757|title=Nicaragua canal construction 'will not begin until 2015'|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=2014-01-04|accessdate=2014-01-04|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> Scientists have raised concerns about environmental impacts, but the government has maintained that the canal will benefit the country by creating new jobs and potentially increasing its annual growth to an average of 8% per year.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Brian Clark|title=Nicaraguan Canal Could Wreck Environment, Scientists Say|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140220-nicaraguan-canal-environment-conservation/|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=22 February 2014}}</ref> The project was scheduled to begin construction in December 2014,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/business/13-Jan-2014/nicaragua-chinese-tycoon-say-canal-work-to-start-in-2014|title=Nicaragua, Chinese tycoon say canal work to start in 2014|magazine=The Nation|date=2014-01-13|accessdate=2014-01-14}}</ref> however the [[Nicaragua Canal]] has yet to be started.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://panampost.com/adriana-peralta/2017/05/08/four-years-later-china-backed-nicaragua-canal-struggles-to-take-off-the-ground/ |title=Four Years Later, China-Backed Nicaragua Canal Struggles to Take Off the Ground |date=2017-05-08 |website=PanAm Post |language=en-US |access-date=2017-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823160624/https://panampost.com/adriana-peralta/2017/05/08/four-years-later-china-backed-nicaragua-canal-struggles-to-take-off-the-ground/ |archive-date=2017-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Nicaragua}}\n[[File:Crucero en San Juan.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] [[Cruise ship]] docked near the beach at [[San Juan del Sur]] in Southern Nicaragua.]]\n\nBy 2006, tourism had become the second largest industry in Nicaragua.<ref>{{cite news|title=Travel And Tourism in Nicaragua|publisher=Euromonitor International|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/Travel_And_Tourism_in_Nicaragua|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> Previously, tourism had grown about 70% nationwide during a period of 7 years, with rates of 10%\u201316% annually.<ref name=C2>{{cite news|first=G |last=Alem\u00e1n |title=Turismo en Nicaragua: aportes y desafios parte I |url=http://www.canal2tv.com/Noticias/Marzo%202007/turismo%20con%20gran%20empuje%20en%20Nicaragua.html |work=Canal 2 |accessdate=2007-07-29 |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717184332/http://www.canal2tv.com/Noticias/Marzo%202007/turismo%20con%20gran%20empuje%20en%20Nicaragua.html |archivedate=2007-07-17 }}</ref> The increase and growth led to the income from tourism to rise more than 300% over a period of 10 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Dynamic Economy: Dynamic Sectors of the Economy; Tourism |url=http://www.pronicaragua.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=98 |work=ProNicaragua |accessdate=2007-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210500/http://www.pronicaragua.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=98 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> The growth in tourism has also positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry.

It was under British influence for nearly three centuries. [[Protestantism]] was brought to the [[Mosquito Coast]] mainly by British and German colonists in forms of [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Moravian Church]]. Other kinds of Protestant and other [[Christian denomination]]s were introduced to the rest of Nicaragua during the 19th century.\n\nPopular religion revolves around the saints, who are perceived as intercessors (but not mediators) between human beings and God. Most localities, from the capital of Managua to small rural communities, honour [[patron saint]]s, selected from the Roman Catholic calendar, with annual ''fiestas''. In many communities, a rich lore has grown up around the celebrations of patron saints, such as Managua's Saint Dominic (Santo Domingo), honoured in August with two colourful, often riotous, day-long processions through the city. The high point of Nicaragua's religious calendar for the masses is neither Christmas nor Easter, but La Pur\u00edsima, a week of festivities in early December dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]], during which elaborate altars to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] are constructed in homes and workplaces.<ref name=LOCR/>\n\nThe country's close political ties have encouraged religious ties.{{explain|date=March 2018}} [[Buddhism]] has increased with a steady influx of immigration.<ref>[http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/octubre/24-octubre-2004/mundo_oculto/mundo_oculto-20041020-01.html Con Todo el Poder de la Informmaci\u00f3n \u2013 El Nuevo Diario \u2013 Managua, Nicaragua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513110733/http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/octubre/24-octubre-2004/mundo_oculto/mundo_oculto-20041020-01.html |date=2011-05-13 }}.

The number of immigrants in Nicaragua, from other Latin American countries or other countries, never surpassed 1% of its total population before 1995. The 2005 census showed the foreign-born population at 1.2%, having risen a mere .06% in 10 years.<ref name=CN/>\n\nIn the 19th century, Nicaragua experienced modest waves of immigration from Europe. In particular, families from Germany, Italy, Spain, France and Belgium immigrated to Nicaragua, particularly the departments in the Central and Pacific region.\n\nAlso present is a small Middle Eastern-Nicaraguan community of [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Armenians]], [[History of the Jews of Nicaragua|Jewish Nicaraguans]], and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] people in Nicaragua. This community numbers about 30,000. There is an East Asian community mostly consisting of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]. The [[Chinese Nicaraguan]] population is estimated at around 12,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nicaragua: People groups|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=NU|work=Joshua Project|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> The Chinese arrived in the late 19th century but were unsubstantiated until the 1920s.\n\n=== Diaspora ===\n{{Main|Nicaraguan diaspora}}\nThe Civil War forced many Nicaraguans to start lives outside of their country. Many people emigrated during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century due to the lack of employment opportunities and poverty. The majority of the [[Nicaraguan Diaspora]] migrated to the United States and [[Costa Rica]]. Today one in six Nicaraguans live in these two countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedialogue.org/PublicationFiles/The%20Nicaragua%20case_M%20Orozco2%20REV.pdf |title=The Nicaragua case_M Orozco2 REV.doc |accessdate=2010-06-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104117/http://www.thedialogue.org/PublicationFiles/The%20Nicaragua%20case_M%20Orozco2%20REV.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-11 }}</ref>\n\nThe diaspora has seen Nicaraguans settling around in smaller communities in other parts of the world, particularly Western Europe. Small communities of Nicaraguans are found in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Norway, Sweden and the [[United Kingdom]]. Communities also exist in Australia and New Zealand. Canada, Brazil and Argentina host small groups of these communities. In Asia, Japan hosts a small Nicaraguan community.\n\nDue to extreme poverty at home, many Nicaraguans are now living and working in neighboring [[El Salvador]], a country that has the US dollar as currency.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/102550|title=El Salvador inicia plan para regularizar a nicarag\u00fcenses residentes|newspaper=[[El Nuevo Diario]]|date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706204153/http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/102550|archive-date=July 6, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/el-salvador/departamentos/214132-nicaragueenses-se-acogen-a-programa.html|title=Nicarag\u00fcenses se acogen a programa|author=Lazo, Flor |work=[[La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica]]|date=August 28, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427034529/http://www.laprensagrafica.com/el-salvador/departamentos/214132-nicaragueenses-se-acogen-a-programa.html|archivedate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Nicaragua}}Although Nicaragua's health outcomes have improved over the past few decades with the efficient utilization of resources relative to other Central American nations, [[healthcare in Nicaragua]] still confronts challenges responding to its populations' diverse healthcare needs.<ref name=\":0\">Angel-Urdinola D, Cortez R, Tanabe K.

It is regarded as one of [[Latin America]]'s most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theatre.]]\n\n[[Culture of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan culture]] has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] but also including Native American sounds and flavors. Nicaraguan culture can further be defined in several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by [[Iberian Peninsula|Europeans]]. It was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The indigenous groups that historically inhabited the Pacific coast have largely been assimilated into the [[mestizo]] culture.\n\nThe Caribbean coast of Nicaragua was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and [[Languages of Nicaragua|indigenous languages]]. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as [[Jamaica]], Belize, the [[Cayman Islands]], etc. Unlike on the west coast, the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean coast have maintained distinct identities, and some still speak their native languages as first languages.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Nicaragua}}\n[[Music of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan music]] is a mixture of indigenous and Spanish influences. Musical instruments include the [[marimba]] and others common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. He is usually accompanied by a bass [[fiddle]], guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a [[mandolin]]). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music.\n\nThe marimba is made with hardwood plates placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four [[hammer]]s. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of [[dance music]] called ''[[Palo de Mayo]]'' which is popular throughout the country. It is especially loud and celebrated during the Palo de Mayo festival in May. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] community (Afro-Native American) is known for its popular music called ''[[Punta (music)|Punta]]''.\n\n[[File:Nicaragua Mestizaje.jpg|thumb|upright|Nicaraguan women wearing the [[Mestizaje]] costume, which is a traditional costume worn to dance the Mestizaje dance.

[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], [[Merengue music|Merengue]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]] and [[Cumbia music|Cumbia]] have gained prominence in cultural centres such as Managua, Leon and [[Granada]]. Cumbia dancing has grown popular with the introduction of Nicaraguan artists, including Gustavo Leyton, on [[Ometepe Island]] and in Managua. [[Salsa dancing]] has become extremely popular in Managua's nightclubs. With various influences, the form of salsa dancing varies in Nicaragua. New York style and Cuban Salsa (Salsa Casino) elements have gained popularity across the country.\n\n=== Dance ===\n{{Further|Dance in Nicaragua}}\nDance in Nicaragua varies depending upon the region. Rural areas tend to have a stronger focus on movement of the hips and turns. The dance style in cities focuses primarily on more sophisticated footwork in addition to movement and turns. Combinations of styles from the [[Dominican Republic]] and the United States can be found throughout Nicaragua. [[Bachata (dance)|Bachata dancing]] is popular in Nicaragua. A considerable amount of Bachata dancing influence comes from Nicaraguans living abroad, in cities that include Miami, Los Angeles and, to a much lesser extent, New York City. [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] has also surfaced recently in cultural cities and ballroom dance occasions.\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Literature of Nicaragua}}\n[[File:Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], the founder of the [[modernismo]] literary movement in Latin America.]]\nThe origin of [[literature of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan literature]] can arguably be traced to [[pre-Columbian]] times. The myths and [[oral literature]] formed the cosmogenic view of the world of the indigenous people. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature has historically been an important source of poetry in the Spanish-speaking world, with internationally renowned contributors such as [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua.

Sea|Caribbean]] to the east, [[Costa Rica]] to the south, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the southwest. [[Managua]] is the country's capital and largest city and is also the third-largest city in [[Central America]], behind [[Tegucigalpa]] and [[Guatemala City]]. The multi-ethnic population of six million includes people of indigenous, European, African, and Asian heritage. The main language is Spanish. Indigenous tribes on the [[Mosquito Coast]] speak their own languages and English.\n\nOriginally inhabited by various indigenous cultures since ancient times, the region was conquered by the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 16th century. Nicaragua gained independence from Spain in 1821. The Mosquito Coast followed a different historical path, being colonized by the English in the 17th century and later coming under British rule. It became an autonomous territory of Nicaragua in 1860 and its northernmost part was transferred to [[Honduras]] in 1960. Since its independence, Nicaragua has undergone periods of political unrest, dictatorship, occupation and fiscal crisis, including the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] of the 1960s and 1970s and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] of the 1980s.\n\nThe mixture of cultural traditions has generated substantial diversity in folklore, cuisine, music, and literature, particularly the latter, given the literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and writers such as [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]].

Almost all of the upper class and nearly a quarter of the middle class are substantial landowners.\n\nA 1985 government study classified 69.4 percent of the population as poor on the basis that they were unable to satisfy one or more of their basic needs in housing, sanitary services (water, sewage, and garbage collection), education, and employment. The defining standards for this study were very low; housing was considered substandard if it was constructed of discarded materials with dirt floors or if it was occupied by more than four persons per room.\n\nRural workers are dependent on agricultural wage labor, especially in coffee and cotton. Only a small fraction hold permanent jobs. Most are migrants who follow crops during the harvest period and find other work during the off-season. The \"lower\" peasants are typically smallholders without sufficient land to sustain a family; they also join the harvest labor force. The \"upper\" peasants have sufficient resources to be economically independent. They produce enough surplus, beyond their personal needs, to allow them to participate in the national and world markets.\n\n[[File:Rotonda Ruben dario.jpg|thumb|left| The capital city [[Managua]] at night]]The urban lower class is characterized by the informal sector of the economy. The informal sector consists of small-scale enterprises that utilize traditional technologies and operate outside the legal regime of labor protections and taxation. Workers in the informal sector are self-employed, unsalaried family workers or employees of small-enterprises, and they are generally poor.\n\nNicaragua's informal sector workers include tinsmiths, mattress makers, seamstresses, bakers, shoemakers, and carpenters; people who take in laundry and ironing or prepare food for sale in the streets; and thousands of peddlers, owners of small businesses (often operating out of their own homes), and market stall operators. Some work alone, but others labor in the small talleres   (workshops/factories) that are responsible for a large share of the country's industrial production. Because informal sector earnings are generally very low, few families can subsist on one income.<ref name=\"Nicaragua \u2013 SOCIETY\">{{cite web |title=Nicaragua \u2013 SOCIETY |quote=CITATION: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.

Other kinds of Protestant and other [[Christian denomination]]s were introduced to the rest of Nicaragua during the 19th century.\n\nPopular religion revolves around the saints, who are perceived as intercessors (but not mediators) between human beings and God. Most localities, from the capital of Managua to small rural communities, honour [[patron saint]]s, selected from the Roman Catholic calendar, with annual ''fiestas''. In many communities, a rich lore has grown up around the celebrations of patron saints, such as Managua's Saint Dominic (Santo Domingo), honoured in August with two colourful, often riotous, day-long processions through the city. The high point of Nicaragua's religious calendar for the masses is neither Christmas nor Easter, but La Pur\u00edsima, a week of festivities in early December dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]], during which elaborate altars to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] are constructed in homes and workplaces.<ref name=LOCR/>\n\nThe country's close political ties have encouraged religious ties.{{explain|date=March 2018}} [[Buddhism]] has increased with a steady influx of immigration.<ref>[http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/octubre/24-octubre-2004/mundo_oculto/mundo_oculto-20041020-01.html Con Todo el Poder de la Informmaci\u00f3n \u2013 El Nuevo Diario \u2013 Managua, Nicaragua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513110733/http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/octubre/24-octubre-2004/mundo_oculto/mundo_oculto-20041020-01.html |date=2011-05-13 }}.

It is regarded as one of [[Latin America]]'s most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theatre.]]\n\n[[Culture of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan culture]] has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] but also including Native American sounds and flavors. Nicaraguan culture can further be defined in several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by [[Iberian Peninsula|Europeans]]. It was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The indigenous groups that historically inhabited the Pacific coast have largely been assimilated into the [[mestizo]] culture.\n\nThe Caribbean coast of Nicaragua was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and [[Languages of Nicaragua|indigenous languages]]. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as [[Jamaica]], Belize, the [[Cayman Islands]], etc. Unlike on the west coast, the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean coast have maintained distinct identities, and some still speak their native languages as first languages.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Nicaragua}}\n[[Music of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan music]] is a mixture of indigenous and Spanish influences. Musical instruments include the [[marimba]] and others common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. He is usually accompanied by a bass [[fiddle]], guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a [[mandolin]]). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music.\n\nThe marimba is made with hardwood plates placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four [[hammer]]s. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of [[dance music]] called ''[[Palo de Mayo]]'' which is popular throughout the country. It is especially loud and celebrated during the Palo de Mayo festival in May. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] community (Afro-Native American) is known for its popular music called ''[[Punta (music)|Punta]]''.\n\n[[File:Nicaragua Mestizaje.jpg|thumb|upright|Nicaraguan women wearing the [[Mestizaje]] costume, which is a traditional costume worn to dance the Mestizaje dance.

[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], [[Merengue music|Merengue]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]] and [[Cumbia music|Cumbia]] have gained prominence in cultural centres such as Managua, Leon and [[Granada]]. Cumbia dancing has grown popular with the introduction of Nicaraguan artists, including Gustavo Leyton, on [[Ometepe Island]] and in Managua. [[Salsa dancing]] has become extremely popular in Managua's nightclubs. With various influences, the form of salsa dancing varies in Nicaragua. New York style and Cuban Salsa (Salsa Casino) elements have gained popularity across the country.\n\n=== Dance ===\n{{Further|Dance in Nicaragua}}\nDance in Nicaragua varies depending upon the region. Rural areas tend to have a stronger focus on movement of the hips and turns. The dance style in cities focuses primarily on more sophisticated footwork in addition to movement and turns. Combinations of styles from the [[Dominican Republic]] and the United States can be found throughout Nicaragua. [[Bachata (dance)|Bachata dancing]] is popular in Nicaragua. A considerable amount of Bachata dancing influence comes from Nicaraguans living abroad, in cities that include Miami, Los Angeles and, to a much lesser extent, New York City. [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] has also surfaced recently in cultural cities and ballroom dance occasions.\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Literature of Nicaragua}}\n[[File:Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], the founder of the [[modernismo]] literary movement in Latin America.]]\nThe origin of [[literature of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan literature]] can arguably be traced to [[pre-Columbian]] times. The myths and [[oral literature]] formed the cosmogenic view of the world of the indigenous people. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature has historically been an important source of poetry in the Spanish-speaking world, with internationally renowned contributors such as [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in his recent Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\n==Exhibition History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Selected Solo Exhibitions !!

The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> \n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in his recent Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\", Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.
