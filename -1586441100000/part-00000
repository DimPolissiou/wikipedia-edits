It is the second installment of the [[Predator (franchise)|''Predator'' franchise]], serving as a sequel to 1987's ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', with Kevin Peter Hall reprising the title role of the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. Set ten years after the events of the first film, in [[Los Angeles]], the film focuses on the Predator, a technologically advanced alien hunter, and the efforts of a disgruntled police officer and his allies to defeat the malevolent creature. The film received generally mixed reviews, despite earning a moderate return at the box office, grossing $57 million worldwide, compared to the previous film's $98 million gross on a smaller production budget.\n\nThis would be the last film appearance of the Predator until 2004's [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|''Alien vs. Predator'']]. A sequel, [[Predators (film)|''Predators'']], was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1997, Los Angeles is suffering from both a [[heat wave]] and a turf war between heavily armed [[Medell\u00edn Cartel|Colombian]] and [[Jamaican posse|Jamaican drug cartels]]. A [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] watches a shootout between the police, Jamaicans and Colombians, observing as Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drive the Colombians back into their hideout.\n\nThe Predator assaults the Colombians causing a disturbance that prompts Harrigan and detectives Leona Cantrell and Danny Archuleta to defy orders and enter the hideout. They find the Colombians have been slaughtered. On the roof, Harrigan shoots the crazed gang leader and catches a glimpse of the camouflaged Predator but dismisses it as an effect of the extreme heat and his [[acrophobia]]. At the station, Harrigan is reprimanded by his superiors for his disobedience. He is introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes, leader of a task force investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert, the newest member of Harrigan's team.\n\nLater that evening, Jamaicans enter the Colombian drug lord's penthouse and murder him, but they are then slaughtered by the Predator. Harrigan's team sees the drug lord's body and the Jamaicans' skinned corpses suspended from the rafters, noting the similarity to the earlier Colombian massacre. Keyes arrives and kicks Harrigan's team out. Danny later returns to continue investigating. After he finds one of the Predator's speartip weapons in an air conditioning vent, the lurking Predator kills him. An enraged Harrigan vows to bring down Danny's killer. Forensic analysis reveals the speartip is not composed of any known element on the [[periodic table]]. Seeking answers, Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie, a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] practitioner. King Willie tells Harrigan that the killer is supernatural, and that he should prepare himself for battle against him. Harrigan leaves before the Predator kills King Willie, taking his head as a trophy.\n\nTracing a lead indicating Danny's killer had recently been in a slaughterhouse, Harrigan arranges to meet his team at a warehouse district to investigate. Cantrell and Lambert take the subway to the rendezvous when the Predator, hunting Harrigan's subordinates, suddenly attacks. Lambert is killed, but Cantrell is spared after the Predator's scan of her body reveals that she is pregnant. Arriving on the scene to see numerous armed civilians dead in addition to Cantrell, Harrigan chases the fleeing Predator but is intercepted by Keyes' men. Keyes reveals that the killer is an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] hunter with [[infrared]] vision that uses [[active camouflage]] and has been hunting humans for sport throughout armed conflicts, most recently in Central America (as depicted in [[Predator (film)|the previous film]]). Keyes and his team have set a trap in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits and [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] weapons to capture it for study.\n\nWhen the Predator arrives, the trap is sprung. However, the suspicious Predator uses its mask to scan through various [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wavelengths]] to identify the light from the team's flashlights. It easily outmaneuvers and slaughters the men. Harrigan then attacks the Predator, badly wounding it before it rallies, destroys his weapon, and closes in. Harrigan is saved by the sudden reappearance of Keyes who tries to freeze the alien but is decapitated by its throwing disc. The Predator chases Harrigan to a roof and the two foes clash, leaving them hanging from a ledge. The alien activates a self-destruct device on its forearm which Harrigan then severs using the throwing disc, rendering the device harmless. The Predator falls through an apartment window and flees.\n\nHarrigan follows it down an elevator shaft and finds a spacecraft in an underground chamber. Inside the ship, after discovering a trophy room with different skulls including a [[Alien_(creature_in_Alien_franchise)|Xenomorph]], Harrigan battles the predator in a final duel and finally kills him by impaling it with the throwing disc. A whole group of Predators suddenly appear and collect their dead comrade, while their [[leader]] greyback spares Harrigan and presents him with an antique [[flintlock]] pistol as a trophy. Harrigan escapes from the ship as it takes off. He reaches the surface just as the remainder of Keyes' team arrives. As Keyes' subordinate Garber curses their lost opportunity to capture the alien, Harrigan privately muses that the beings will return.\n\n==Cast==\n{{details|topic=individual characters|List of Predator characters}}\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Lieutenant Michael \"Mike\" R. Harrigan, an [[LAPD]] Officer who is investigating rival Jamaican and Colombian [[drug cartel]]s. He is stubborn and often is criticized by the superior officers for not obeying orders.\n* [[Kevin Peter Hall]] as [[List of Predator characters|City Hunter]] / [[Predator (alien)|The Predator]], a member of a warrior race which hunts aggressive members of other species for sport, uses [[active camouflage]], a plasma weapon and can see in the [[infrared]] spectrum.

The character is a replacement for \"Dutch,\" the protagonist of the first film, after [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] declined to reprise the role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-predator-2-movie-no-return-why/|title=Why Arnold Schwarzenegger Didn't Return for Predator 2|date=2020-02-04|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> \n* [[Ruben Blades]] as Detective Danny Archuleta, a member of Harrigan's team and a long time friend of his.\n* [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] as Detective Leona Cantrell, an LAPD cop involved in the Jamaican-Colombian gang wars.\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Detective Jerry Lambert, an LAPD cop, transferred from another precinct into Metro Command.

Carrillo filmed an additional scene in which she talks to the camera and describes the events of the first film, but this scene was cut.\n* [[Henry Kingi]] as El Scorpio, a violent member of the Colombian Scorpions.\n\n==Production==\nOnce [[20th Century Fox]] approached ''Predator'' screenwriters [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] to write a sequel, they pitched six ideas, one of which was \"putting the creature in an urban jungle\", which the studio liked.<ref name=\"starlog\">{{cite journal|author=Shapiro|first=Marc|date=December 1990|title=Predator Season|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-161/161_djvu.txt|journal=[[Starlog]]|volume=|issue=161|pages=|via=}}</ref> The eventual setting was Los Angeles, portrayed as a city blighted by gang warfare in the midst of a severe [[heat wave]], creating the ideal \"hot spot\" in which the Predator would search for hunting targets.

Given the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' franchise was also by Fox and featured effects work by Winston, the crew decided to add an [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Alien]] head among the trophy skulls in the Predator ship. \n\nThe writers decided to set ''Predator 2'' ten years after the original, which was the then-future of 1997, leading to some developments like new video technology and a then-nonexistent subway in Los Angeles (the [[Los Angeles Metro Rail]] started operating the same year the film hit theaters). For the set design, Paul aimed for a \"kind of retrograde future that's equal parts ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' mixed in with modern-day technology\", with \"big and outrageous\" structures but simpler prop design, such as boxy and colorless cars.<ref name=fangoria>{{cite journal|title=Predator 2 Stalks The Concrete Jungle|author=Shapiro, Marc|date=December 1990|issue=99|journal=[[Fangoria]]|url=https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_099_c2c_1990_Predator_2_FemaleBikerSweat-DREGS/Fangoria_099_c2c_1990_Predator_2_FemaleBikerSweat-DREGS_djvu.txt}}</ref>\n\nThe MPAA initially gave Predator 2 an NC-17 rating, so several cuts were made to bring it down to an R rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/movies-originally-rated-x-nc-17-shocking/|title=15 Movies That Were Originally NC-17|author=Byrd, Matthew|date=14 August 2017|website=[[Screen Rant]]|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{further|List of accolades received by the Predator film series#Predator 2}}\nThe film received mostly negative reviews, though reviewers were generally impressed by the casting of Danny Glover as an action hero.

It is the second installment of the [[Predator (franchise)|''Predator'' franchise]], serving as a sequel to 1987's ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', with Kevin Peter Hall reprising the title role of the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. Set ten years after the events of the first film, in [[Los Angeles]], the film focuses on the Predator, a technologically advanced alien hunter, and the efforts of a disgruntled police officer and his allies to defeat the malevolent creature. The film received generally mixed reviews, despite earning a moderate return at the box office, grossing $57 million worldwide, compared to the previous film's $98 million gross on a smaller production budget.\n\nThis would be the last film appearance of the Predator until 2004's [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|''Alien vs. Predator'']]. A sequel, [[Predators (film)|''Predators'']], was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1997, Los Angeles is suffering from both a [[heat wave]] and a turf war between heavily armed [[Medell\u00edn Cartel|Colombian]] and [[Jamaican posse|Jamaican drug cartels]]. A [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] watches a shootout between the police, Jamaicans and Colombians, observing as Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drive the Colombians back into their hideout.\n\nThe Predator assaults the Colombians causing a disturbance that prompts Harrigan and detectives Leona Cantrell and Danny Archuleta to defy orders and enter the hideout. They find the Colombians have been slaughtered. On the roof, Harrigan shoots the crazed gang leader and catches a glimpse of the camouflaged Predator but dismisses it as an effect of the extreme heat and his [[acrophobia]]. At the station, Harrigan is reprimanded by his superiors for his disobedience. He is introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes, leader of a task force investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert, the newest member of Harrigan's team.\n\nLater that evening, Jamaicans enter the Colombian drug lord's penthouse and murder him, but they are then slaughtered by the Predator. Harrigan's team sees the drug lord's body and the Jamaicans' skinned corpses suspended from the rafters, noting the similarity to the earlier Colombian massacre. Keyes arrives and kicks Harrigan's team out. Danny later returns to continue investigating. After he finds one of the Predator's speartip weapons in an air conditioning vent, the lurking Predator kills him. An enraged Harrigan vows to bring down Danny's killer. Forensic analysis reveals the speartip is not composed of any known element on the [[periodic table]]. Seeking answers, Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie, a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] practitioner. King Willie tells Harrigan that the killer is supernatural, and that he should prepare himself for battle against him. Harrigan leaves before the Predator kills King Willie, taking his head as a trophy.\n\nTracing a lead indicating Danny's killer had recently been in a slaughterhouse, Harrigan arranges to meet his team at a warehouse district to investigate. Cantrell and Lambert take the subway to the rendezvous when the Predator, hunting Harrigan's subordinates, suddenly attacks. Lambert is killed, but Cantrell is spared after the Predator's scan of her body reveals that she is pregnant. Arriving on the scene to see numerous armed civilians dead in addition to Cantrell, Harrigan chases the fleeing Predator but is intercepted by Keyes' men. Keyes reveals that the killer is an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] hunter with [[infrared]] vision that uses [[active camouflage]] and has been hunting humans for sport throughout armed conflicts, most recently in Central America (as depicted in [[Predator (film)|the previous film]]). Keyes and his team have set a trap in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits and [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] weapons to capture it for study.\n\nWhen the Predator arrives, the trap is sprung. However, the suspicious Predator uses its mask to scan through various [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wavelengths]] to identify the light from the team's flashlights. It easily outmaneuvers and slaughters the men. Harrigan then attacks the Predator, badly wounding it before it rallies, destroys his weapon, and closes in. Harrigan is saved by the sudden reappearance of Keyes who tries to freeze the alien but is decapitated by its throwing disc. The Predator chases Harrigan to a roof and the two foes clash, leaving them hanging from a ledge. The alien activates a self-destruct device on its forearm which Harrigan then severs using the throwing disc, rendering the device harmless. The Predator falls through an apartment window and flees.\n\nHarrigan follows it down an elevator shaft and finds a spacecraft in an underground chamber. Inside the ship, after discovering a trophy room with different skulls including a [[Alien_(creature_in_Alien_franchise)|Xenomorph]], Harrigan battles the predator in a final duel and finally kills him by impaling it with the throwing disc. A whole group of Predators suddenly appear and collect their dead comrade, while their [[leader]] greyback spares Harrigan and presents him with an antique [[flintlock]] pistol as a trophy. Harrigan escapes from the ship as it takes off. He reaches the surface just as the remainder of Keyes' team arrives. As Keyes' subordinate Garber curses their lost opportunity to capture the alien, Harrigan privately muses that the creatures will return.\n\n==Cast==\n{{details|topic=individual characters|List of Predator characters}}\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Lieutenant Michael \"Mike\" R. Harrigan, an [[LAPD]] Officer who is investigating rival Jamaican and Colombian [[drug cartel]]s. He is stubborn and often is criticized by the superior officers for not obeying orders.\n* [[Kevin Peter Hall]] as [[List of Predator characters|City Hunter]] / [[Predator (alien)|The Predator]], a member of a warrior race which hunts aggressive members of other species for sport, uses [[active camouflage]], a plasma weapon and can see in the [[infrared]] spectrum.

The character is a replacement for \"Dutch,\" the protagonist of the first film, after [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] declined to reprise the role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-predator-2-movie-no-return-why/|title=Why Arnold Schwarzenegger Didn't Return for Predator 2|date=2020-02-04|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> \n* [[Ruben Blades]] as Detective Danny Archuleta, a member of Harrigan's team and a long time friend of his.\n* [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] as Detective Leona Cantrell, an LAPD cop involved in the Jamaican-Colombian gang wars.\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Detective Jerry Lambert, an LAPD cop, transferred from another precinct into Metro Command.

She is seen aiding government agents in a video tape, showing the devastating after-effects of the first Predator's self-destruct device to the U.S. Army. Carrillo filmed an additional scene in which she talks to the camera and describes the events of the first film, but this scene was cut.\n* [[Henry Kingi]] as El Scorpio, a violent member of the Colombian Scorpions.\n\n==Production==\nOnce [[20th Century Fox]] approached ''Predator'' screenwriters [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] to write a sequel, they pitched six ideas, one of which was \"putting the creature in an urban jungle\", which the studio liked.<ref name=\"starlog\">{{cite journal|author=Shapiro|first=Marc|date=December 1990|title=Predator Season|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-161/161_djvu.txt|journal=[[Starlog]]|volume=|issue=161|pages=|via=}}</ref> The eventual setting was Los Angeles, portrayed as a city blighted by gang warfare in the midst of a severe [[heat wave]], creating the ideal \"hot spot\" in which the Predator would search for hunting targets.

Given the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' franchise was also by Fox and featured effects work by Winston, the crew decided to add an [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Alien]] head among the trophy skulls in the Predator ship. \n\nThe writers decided to set ''Predator 2'' ten years after the original, which was the then-future of 1997, leading to some developments like new video technology and a then-nonexistent subway in Los Angeles (the [[Los Angeles Metro Rail]] started operating the same year the film hit theaters). For the set design, Paul aimed for a \"kind of retrograde future that's equal parts ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' mixed in with modern-day technology\", with \"big and outrageous\" structures but simpler prop design, such as boxy and colorless cars.<ref name=fangoria>{{cite journal|title=Predator 2 Stalks The Concrete Jungle|author=Shapiro, Marc|date=December 1990|issue=99|journal=[[Fangoria]]|url=https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_099_c2c_1990_Predator_2_FemaleBikerSweat-DREGS/Fangoria_099_c2c_1990_Predator_2_FemaleBikerSweat-DREGS_djvu.txt}}</ref>\n\nThe MPAA initially gave Predator 2 an NC-17 rating, so several cuts were made to bring it down to an R rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/movies-originally-rated-x-nc-17-shocking/|title=15 Movies That Were Originally NC-17|author=Byrd, Matthew|date=14 August 2017|website=[[Screen Rant]]|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{further|List of accolades received by the Predator film series#Predator 2}}\nThe film received mostly negative reviews, though reviewers were generally impressed by the casting of Danny Glover as an action hero.

The English word comes via French from an old [[Catalan language|Catalan]] word \"barraca\" (hut), originally referring to temporary shelters or huts<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd. ed. barrack, n.1</ref><ref>[[Barracoon]]</ref> for various people and animals, but today barracks are usually permanent buildings for [[military]] accommodation. The word may apply to separate housing blocks or to complete complexes, and the plural form often refers to a single structure and may be [[English plurals#Plural in form but singular in construction|singular in construction]].\n\nThe main object of barracks is to separate soldiers from the civilian population and reinforce discipline, training, and ''esprit de corps''. They have been called \"discipline factories for soldiers\".<ref>Black, Jeremy,'' A Military Revolution?: Military Change and European Society, 1550-1800'' (London, 1991)</ref> Like industrial factories, some are considered to be shoddy or dull buildings, although others are known for their magnificent architecture such as [[Collins Barracks, Dublin|Collins Barracks]] in [[Dublin]] and others in Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, or London.<ref>Douet, James, ''British Barracks, their social and architectural importance, 1660-1914'' (London, 1997)</ref> From the rough barracks of 19th-century [[conscription|conscript]] armies, filled with [[hazing]] and illness and barely differentiated from the livestock pens that housed the [[draft animal]]s, to the clean and Internet-connected barracks of modern [[volunteer military|all-volunteer militaries]], the word can have a variety of connotations.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Koszary schronowe in Gda\u0144sk.jpg|thumb|Barracks in [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland.]]\n[[File:Caserne Chanzy.jpg|thumb|Barracks of the 117th infantry regiment in [[Le Mans]], France (c.1900).]]\nEarly barracks such as those of the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] were built to maintain elite forces. There are a number of remains of [[Roman army]] barracks in frontier forts such as [[Vercovicium]] and [[Vindolanda]]. From these and from contemporary Roman sources we can see that the basics of life in a [[military camp]] have remained constant for thousands of years. \nIn the [[Early Modern Period]], they formed part of the [[Military Revolution]] that scholars believe contributed decisively to the formation of the [[nation state]]<ref>Roberts, Michael ''The Military Revolution, 1660-1760'' (Belfast, 1856); reprinted with some amendments in Rogers, Clifford, ed., ''The Military Revolution Debate'' Rogers, Clifford, ed., ''The Military Revolution Debate: Readings on the Military Transformation of Early Modern Europe'' (Boulder, 1895)</ref> by increasing the expense of maintaining [[Standing army|standing armies]]. Large, permanent barracks were developed in the 18th century by the two dominant states of the period, France the \"caserne\" and Spain the \"cuartel\". The English term 'barrack', on the other hand, derives from the Spanish word for a temporary shelter erected by soldiers on [[Military campaign|campaign]], ''barraca''; (because of fears that a standing army in barracks would be a threat to the constitution, barracks were not generally built in Great Britain until 1790, on the eve of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]).<ref name=Douet1997 />\n\nEarly barracks were multi-story blocks, often grouped in a quadrangle around a [[courtyard]] or [[parade ground]]. A good example is [[Berwick Barracks]], which was among the first in England to be purpose-built and begun in 1717 to the design of the distinguished architect [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. During the 18th century, the increasing sophistication of military life led to separate housing for different ranks (officers always had larger rooms) and married quarters; as well as the provision of specialized buildings such as dining rooms and cook houses, bath houses, mess rooms, schools, hospitals, armories, gymnasia, riding schools and stables. The [[pavilion plan]] concept of hospital design was influential in barrack planning after the [[Crimean War]].\n\nThe first large-scale training camps were built in the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] during the early 18th century. The British Army built [[Aldershot]] camps from 1854.\n\nBy the First World War, [[infantry]], [[artillery]], and [[cavalry]] regiments had separate barracks. The first naval barracks were [[hulk (ship type)|hulk]]s, old wooden sailing vessels; but these insanitary lodgings were replaced with large [[naval]] barracks at the major dockyard towns of Europe and the United States, usually with [[hammock]]s instead of beds.\n\nThese were inadequate for the enormous armies mobilized after 1914. Hut camps were developed using variations of the eponymous [[Nissen hut]], made from timber or corrugated iron.\n\n==Military==\n[[Image:Barracks-sweden.jpg|thumb|160px|Barracks housing [[conscription|conscripts]] of [[Norrbotten Regiment]] in [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]], Sweden.]]\n[[Image:Homburgerland-bundespolizei002.jpg|thumb|German barracks for troops of [[German Federal Police|Bundespolizei]] (federal police) in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.]]\nIn many military forces, [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s and enlisted personnel will frequently be housed in barracks for service or training. Junior enlisted and sometimes junior NCOs will often receive less space and may be housed in bays, while senior NCOs and officers may share or have their own room.\nThe term \"[[Garrison]] town\" is a common expression for any town that has military barracks, i.e., a permanent military presence nearby.\n\n==Worldwide==\n{{Globalize|article|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Canada===\nBarracks blockhouses were used to house troops in forts in Upper Canada. The [[HMCS Stone Frigate|Stone Frigate]], completed in 1820, served as barracks briefly in 1837\u201338, and was refitted as a [[dormitory]] and classrooms to house the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] by 1876. The Stone frigate is a large stone building originally designed to hold gear and rigging from British warships dismantled to comply with the [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]].\n\n===Portugal===\nThe [[Portuguese Army]] bases is referred as a ''quartel'' (barracks). In a barracks, each of the dormitory buildings is referred as a ''caserna'' ([[casern]]). Most of them are regimental barracks, constituting the fixed component of the Army system of forces and being responsible for the training, sustenance and general support to the Army. In addition to the regimental administrative, logistic and training bodies, each barracks can lodge one or more operational units (operational battalions, independent companies or equivalent units). Although there are housing blocks within the perimeter of some regimental barracks, the Portuguese current practice is for the members of the Armed Forces to live out of the military bases with their families, inserted in the local civilian communities.\n\nMany of the Portuguese regimental barracks are of the CANIFA model (The CANIFA barracks were designed to lodge 1,000 or more soldiers). These type of barracks were built in the 1950s and 1960s, following a standardized architectural model, usually with an area of between 100,000 and 200,000 square metres, including a headquarters building, a guard house, a general mess building, an infirmary building, a workshop and garage building, an officer house building, a sergeant house building, three to ten rank and file caserns, fire ranges and sports facilities.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:Barracks of Hampton Court Palace.jpg|thumbnail|Barracks at [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1689), Greater London; these are Britain's oldest surviving purpose-built barracks.]]\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries there were concerns around the idea of a standing army housed in barracks; instead, the law provided for troops routinely to be [[billet]]ed in small groups in inns and other locations.<ref name=May2002>{{cite book|last1=May|first1=Trevor|title=Military Barracks|date=2002|publisher=Shire Books}}</ref> (The concerns were various: political, ideological and constitutional, provoked by memories of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s [[New Model Army]] and of the use of troops in reign of [[James II]] to intimidate areas of civil society. Furthermore, grand urban barracks were associated with absolutist monarchies, where they could be seen as emblematic of power sustained through military might; and there was an ongoing suspicion that gathering soldiers together in barracks might encourage sedition.)<ref name=Douet1997 />\n\nNevertheless, some \"soldiers' lodgings\" were built in Britain at this time, usually attached to coastal fortifications or royal palaces. The first recorded use of the word 'barracks' in this context was for the Irish Barracks, built in the precinct of the [[Tower of London]] in 1669. At the [[Ordnance Office]] (responsible for construction and upkeep of barracks) [[Bernard de Gomme]] played a key role in developing a 'domestic' style of barrack design in the latter half of the 17th century: he provided barrack blocks for such locations as [[Royal Citadel, Plymouth|Plymouth Citadel]] and [[Tilbury Fort]], each with rows of square rooms arranged in pairs on two stories, accommodating a [[Company (military unit)|Company]] of some sixty men, four to a room, two to a bed. Standard furnishings were provided, and each room had a grate used for heating and cooking.<ref name=Douet1997 />\n\n[[File:Parade Ground , Fort George - geograph.org.uk - 979337.jpg|thumbnail|left|Fort George barracks, 1753]]\nIn England, this domestic style continued to be used through the first half of the eighteenth century; most new barracks of this period were more or less hidden within the precincts of medieval castles and [[Device Forts|Henrician forts]]. In Scotland, however, a more demonstrative style was employed following the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]] (as at [[Ruthven Barracks]]) and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|that of 1745]] (as seen in the monumental [[Fort George, Scotland|Fort George]]). This bolder approach gradually began to be adopted south of the border during the eighteenth century (beginning with nearby [[Berwick Barracks|Berwick]], 1717). There was much building in and around the [[Royal Navy Dockyard|Royal Dockyard]]s at this time: during the [[Seven Years' War]], fears of a land attack led to defensive '[[Fortification|lines]]' being built around the dockyard towns, and infantry barracks were established within them (e.g. at Chatham, Upper and Lower Barracks, 1756, and Plymouth, six defensible square barracks, 1758\u201363). The newly constituted [[Royal Marines]] were also provided with accommodation in the vicinity of the Dockyards (e.g. [[Stonehouse Barracks]], 1779) becoming the first Corps in Britain to be fully provided with its own accommodation. Large urban barracks were still a rarity, though. In London there was a fair amount of barrack accommodation, but most of it was within the precincts of various royal palaces (as at [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]], 1753). The prominent [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] in Woolwich (1776) was one exception (but significantly the Artillery were under the command of the [[Board of Ordnance]] rather than of the Army).<ref name=Douet1997>{{cite book|last1=Douet|first1=James|title=British Barracks, 1660-1914|date=1997|publisher=English Heritage}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stable Block Christchurch Barracks Dorset.JPG|thumbnail|Cavalry barracks, [[Christchurch, Dorset]], 1795: officers' accommodation in the end blocks, ground-floor stables with men's accommodation over.]]\nIn the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], though, things changed. The size of the army grew from 40,000 to 225,000 between 1790 and 1814 (with the [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] adding a further 100,000).<ref name=May2002 /> Barrack accommodation at the time was provided for a mere 20,000. To deal with the situation, responsibility for building barracks was transferred in 1792 from the [[Board of Ordnance]] to a specialist Barracks Department overseen by the War Office. With a view to dealing with sedition, and perhaps quelling thoughts of revolution, several large cavalry barracks were built in the 1790s: first at [[Knightsbridge Barracks|Knightsbridge]] (close to the royal palaces), then in several provincial towns and cities: Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester, Norwich, Nottingham and Sheffield (as well as [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow|Hounslow Barracks]] just west of London). Several smaller cavalry and artillery barracks were established around this time, but very little was built for the infantry; instead, a number of large camps (with wooden huts) were set up, including at Chelmsford, [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester]] and [[Sunderland Barracks|Sunderland]], as well as at various locations along the south coast.<ref name=\"Douet1997\" />\n\n[[File:Portsmouth Grammar School seen from the High Street.jpg|thumbnail|left|Officers' accommodation at Cambridge Infantry Barracks in Portsmouth (1820s)]]\nIt was not until some years after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (and post-war [[recession]]) that barrack-building began again. [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] built four as part of his London improvements: [[Regent's Park Barracks|Regent's Park]] and [[St John's Wood Barracks|St John's Wood]] for the Cavalry, [[Wellington Barracks]] for the Guards, and [[St George's Barracks, London|St George's Barracks]] (since demolished) behind the [[National Gallery]]. In several instances elsewhere, buildings were converted rather than newly built (or a mixture of the two, as at [[Portsmouth Grammar School|Cambridge Barracks, Portsmouth]] where a new frontage, housing officers, was built in front of a range of warehouses converted to house the men). In response to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] riots three barracks were established in north-west England in the 1840s, [[Ladysmith Barracks]] at Ashton-under-Lyne, [[Wellington Barracks, Bury|Wellington Barracks]] at Bury and [[Fulwood Barracks]] at Preston.\n\n[[File:Kempston Barracks - geograph.org.uk - 527339.jpg|thumbnail|[[Kempston Barracks]], built to serve as depot for the [[Bedfordshire Regiment]] in 1875 (one of a number of similar barracks established following the Cardwell reforms)]]\nA review conducted following the demise of the Board of Ordnance in 1855 noted that only seven barracks outside London had accommodation for more than 1,000.<ref name=May2002 /> This changed with the establishment of large-scale Army Camps such as [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]] (1854), and the expansion of Garrison towns such as [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester]]; over time in these locations temporary huts were replaced with more permanent barracks buildings. Large-scale camps were not the only way forward, however; from the 1870s, the localisation agenda of the [[Cardwell Reforms]] saw new and old barracks established as [[Regimental depot|depots]] for regional or County brigades and regiments. The latter part of the 19th century also saw the establishment of a number of Naval barracks (an innovation long resisted by the Royal Navy, which had tended to accommodate its sailors afloat either on their ships or else in [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]] moored in its harbours). The first of these, Keyham Barracks in Devonport (later [[HMNB Devonport|HMS Drake]]), was begun in 1879, and only completed in 1907.\n\n[[File:Chelsea Barracks - geograph.org.uk - 812156.jpg|thumbnail|left|Chelsea Barracks, as rebuilt in the 1960s]]\nDuring the 20th century, activity ranged from the need for speedy expansion during the First World War (when large camps such as [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]] were established), to the closure of many barracks in the [[interwar period]]. Many of those that remained were rebuilt in the 1960s, either substantially (as happened at Woolwich, behind the facade) or entirely (as at [[Hyde Park Barracks, London|Hyde Park]] and at [[Chelsea Barracks|Chelsea]] - built 1863, demolished and rebuilt 1963, closed 2008). There has been an ongoing focus on improving the quality of barracks accommodation; since the 1970s several [[List of former Royal Air Force stations|former RAF bases]] have been converted to serve as Army barracks, in place of some of the more cramped urban sites. Today, generally, only single and unmarried personnel or those who choose not to move their families nearby live in barracks. Most British military barracks are named after battles, military figures or the locality.\n\n===Poland===\nIn Poland barracks are represented usually as a complex of buildings, each consisting of a separate entity or an administrative or business premises. As an example, the [[Barracks Complex in Wrze\u015bnia]].\n\n===United States of America===\n[[File:Fort Larned Barracks.jpg|thumb|Many barracks contain large numbers of beds or bunk beds with minimal common areas]]\nIn basic training, and sometimes follow-on training, service members live in barracks. The [[U.S. Marine Corps]] have gender-separate basic training units. The [[U.S. Army]] has gender-separate basic training, but like the [[United States Coast Guard]], [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[U.S. Navy]], has training where male and female recruits share barracks, but are separated during personal time and lights out. However, all the services integrate male and female members following [[Recruit training|boot camp]] and first assignment, except the various [[combat arms]] elements.\n\nAfter training, unmarried junior enlisted members will typically reside in barracks. In the 21st century, these service members are generally housed in individual rooms conforming to the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD's]] \"1+1 standard\", though exceptions still exist. During unaccompanied, dependent-restricted assignments, non-commissioned and commissioned officer ranks may also be required to live in barracks. Amenities in these barracks increase with the rank of the occupant.\n\nUnlike the other services, the U.S. Air Force officially uses the term \"[[dormitory#United States military|dormitory]]\" to refer to its unaccompanied housing.\n\nDuring World War II, many U.S. barracks were made of inexpensive, sturdy and easy to assemble [[Quonset hut]]s that resembled [[Native American long house]]s (having a rounded roof but made out of metal).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cantonment]], a temporary or semi-permanent military quarters.\n*[[B hut]]\n*[[Barkas, Hyderabad]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Black, Jeremy, ''A Military Revolution?: Military Change and European Society, 1550-1800'' (London, 1991)\n* Dallemagne, Fran\u00e7ois, ''Les casernes fran\u00e7aises'', (1990)\n* Douet, James, ''British Barracks, their social and architectural importance, 1660-1914'' (London, 1997)\n* Roberts, Michael ''The Military Revolution, 1560-1660'' (Belfast, 1956); reprinted with some amendments in Rogers, Clifford, ed., ''The Military Revolution Debate'' Rogers, Clifford, ed., ''The Military Revolution Debate: Readings on the Military Transformation of Early Modern Europe'' (Boulder, 1995)\n* 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Barracks}}\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Barracks |volume=3 |short=x}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013163723/http://remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_engineer.htm#mil_con Royal Engineers Museum] Military Works (Barrack construction)\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations by type]]\n[[Category:Barracks| ]]\n[[Category:Human habitats]]\n[[Category:Total institutions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Accommodation for soldiers}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Barrack|Barack (disambiguation){{!}}Barack|Hay barrack}}\n{{other uses|Barrack (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:The New Barracks (18thC), Edinburgh Castle.JPG|thumb|300px|Late 18th century barracks from the reign of [[George III]], [[Edinburgh Castle]], [[Scotland]]]]\n'''Barracks''' are usually a group of long buildings built to house military personnel or [[laborers]].

Hut camps were developed using variations of the eponymous [[Nissen hut]], made from timber or corrugated iron.\n\n==Military==\n[[Image:Barracks-sweden.jpg|thumb|160px|Barracks housing [[conscription|conscripts]] of [[Norrbotten Regiment]] in [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]], Sweden.]]\n[[Image:Homburgerland-bundespolizei002.jpg|thumb|German barracks for troops of [[German Federal Police|Bundespolizei]] (federal police) in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.]]\nIn many military forces, [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s and enlisted personnel will frequently be housed in barracks for service or training. Junior enlisted and sometimes junior NCOs will often receive less space and may be housed in bays, while senior NCOs and officers may share or have their own room.\nThe term \"[[Garrison]] town\" is a common expression for any town that has military barracks, i.e., a permanent military presence nearby.\n\n==Worldwide==\n{{Globalize|article|United Kingdom|2name=the United Kingdom|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Canada===\nBarracks blockhouses were used to house troops in forts in Upper Canada. The [[HMCS Stone Frigate|Stone Frigate]], completed in 1820, served as barracks briefly in 1837\u201338, and was refitted as a [[dormitory]] and classrooms to house the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] by 1876. The Stone frigate is a large stone building originally designed to hold gear and rigging from British warships dismantled to comply with the [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]].\n\n===Portugal===\nThe [[Portuguese Army]] bases is referred as a ''quartel'' (barracks). In a barracks, each of the dormitory buildings is referred as a ''caserna'' ([[casern]]). Most of them are regimental barracks, constituting the fixed component of the Army system of forces and being responsible for the training, sustenance and general support to the Army. In addition to the regimental administrative, logistic and training bodies, each barracks can lodge one or more operational units (operational battalions, independent companies or equivalent units). Although there are housing blocks within the perimeter of some regimental barracks, the Portuguese current practice is for the members of the Armed Forces to live out of the military bases with their families, inserted in the local civilian communities.\n\nMany of the Portuguese regimental barracks are of the CANIFA model (The CANIFA barracks were designed to lodge 1,000 or more soldiers). These type of barracks were built in the 1950s and 1960s, following a standardized architectural model, usually with an area of between 100,000 and 200,000 square metres, including a headquarters building, a guard house, a general mess building, an infirmary building, a workshop and garage building, an officer house building, a sergeant house building, three to ten rank and file caserns, fire ranges and sports facilities.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:Barracks of Hampton Court Palace.jpg|thumbnail|Barracks at [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1689), Greater London; these are Britain's oldest surviving purpose-built barracks.]]\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries there were concerns around the idea of a standing army housed in barracks; instead, the law provided for troops routinely to be [[billet]]ed in small groups in inns and other locations.<ref name=May2002>{{cite book|last1=May|first1=Trevor|title=Military Barracks|date=2002|publisher=Shire Books}}</ref> (The concerns were various: political, ideological and constitutional, provoked by memories of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s [[New Model Army]] and of the use of troops in reign of [[James II]] to intimidate areas of civil society. Furthermore, grand urban barracks were associated with absolutist monarchies, where they could be seen as emblematic of power sustained through military might; and there was an ongoing suspicion that gathering soldiers together in barracks might encourage sedition.)<ref name=Douet1997 />\n\nNevertheless, some \"soldiers' lodgings\" were built in Britain at this time, usually attached to coastal fortifications or royal palaces. The first recorded use of the word 'barracks' in this context was for the Irish Barracks, built in the precinct of the [[Tower of London]] in 1669. At the [[Ordnance Office]] (responsible for construction and upkeep of barracks) [[Bernard de Gomme]] played a key role in developing a 'domestic' style of barrack design in the latter half of the 17th century: he provided barrack blocks for such locations as [[Royal Citadel, Plymouth|Plymouth Citadel]] and [[Tilbury Fort]], each with rows of square rooms arranged in pairs on two stories, accommodating a [[Company (military unit)|Company]] of some sixty men, four to a room, two to a bed. Standard furnishings were provided, and each room had a grate used for heating and cooking.<ref name=Douet1997 />\n\n[[File:Parade Ground , Fort George - geograph.org.uk - 979337.jpg|thumbnail|left|Fort George barracks, 1753]]\nIn England, this domestic style continued to be used through the first half of the eighteenth century; most new barracks of this period were more or less hidden within the precincts of medieval castles and [[Device Forts|Henrician forts]]. In Scotland, however, a more demonstrative style was employed following the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]] (as at [[Ruthven Barracks]]) and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|that of 1745]] (as seen in the monumental [[Fort George, Scotland|Fort George]]). This bolder approach gradually began to be adopted south of the border during the eighteenth century (beginning with nearby [[Berwick Barracks|Berwick]], 1717). There was much building in and around the [[Royal Navy Dockyard|Royal Dockyard]]s at this time: during the [[Seven Years' War]], fears of a land attack led to defensive '[[Fortification|lines]]' being built around the dockyard towns, and infantry barracks were established within them (e.g. at Chatham, Upper and Lower Barracks, 1756, and Plymouth, six defensible square barracks, 1758\u201363). The newly constituted [[Royal Marines]] were also provided with accommodation in the vicinity of the Dockyards (e.g. [[Stonehouse Barracks]], 1779) becoming the first Corps in Britain to be fully provided with its own accommodation. Large urban barracks were still a rarity, though. In London there was a fair amount of barrack accommodation, but most of it was within the precincts of various royal palaces (as at [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]], 1753). The prominent [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] in Woolwich (1776) was one exception (but significantly the Artillery were under the command of the [[Board of Ordnance]] rather than of the Army).<ref name=Douet1997>{{cite book|last1=Douet|first1=James|title=British Barracks, 1660-1914|date=1997|publisher=English Heritage}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stable Block Christchurch Barracks Dorset.JPG|thumbnail|Cavalry barracks, [[Christchurch, Dorset]], 1795: officers' accommodation in the end blocks, ground-floor stables with men's accommodation over.]]\nIn the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], though, things changed. The size of the army grew from 40,000 to 225,000 between 1790 and 1814 (with the [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] adding a further 100,000).<ref name=May2002 /> Barrack accommodation at the time was provided for a mere 20,000. To deal with the situation, responsibility for building barracks was transferred in 1792 from the [[Board of Ordnance]] to a specialist Barracks Department overseen by the War Office. With a view to dealing with sedition, and perhaps quelling thoughts of revolution, several large cavalry barracks were built in the 1790s: first at [[Knightsbridge Barracks|Knightsbridge]] (close to the royal palaces), then in several provincial towns and cities: Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester, Norwich, Nottingham and Sheffield (as well as [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow|Hounslow Barracks]] just west of London). Several smaller cavalry and artillery barracks were established around this time, but very little was built for the infantry; instead, a number of large camps (with wooden huts) were set up, including at Chelmsford, [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester]] and [[Sunderland Barracks|Sunderland]], as well as at various locations along the south coast.<ref name=\"Douet1997\" />\n\n[[File:Portsmouth Grammar School seen from the High Street.jpg|thumbnail|left|Officers' accommodation at Cambridge Infantry Barracks in Portsmouth (1820s)]]\nIt was not until some years after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (and post-war [[recession]]) that barrack-building began again. [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] built four as part of his London improvements: [[Regent's Park Barracks|Regent's Park]] and [[St John's Wood Barracks|St John's Wood]] for the Cavalry, [[Wellington Barracks]] for the Guards, and [[St George's Barracks, London|St George's Barracks]] (since demolished) behind the [[National Gallery]]. In several instances elsewhere, buildings were converted rather than newly built (or a mixture of the two, as at [[Portsmouth Grammar School|Cambridge Barracks, Portsmouth]] where a new frontage, housing officers, was built in front of a range of warehouses converted to house the men). In response to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] riots three barracks were established in north-west England in the 1840s, [[Ladysmith Barracks]] at Ashton-under-Lyne, [[Wellington Barracks, Bury|Wellington Barracks]] at Bury and [[Fulwood Barracks]] at Preston.\n\n[[File:Kempston Barracks - geograph.org.uk - 527339.jpg|thumbnail|[[Kempston Barracks]], built to serve as depot for the [[Bedfordshire Regiment]] in 1875 (one of a number of similar barracks established following the Cardwell reforms)]]\nA review conducted following the demise of the Board of Ordnance in 1855 noted that only seven barracks outside London had accommodation for more than 1,000.<ref name=May2002 /> This changed with the establishment of large-scale Army Camps such as [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]] (1854), and the expansion of Garrison towns such as [[Colchester Garrison|Colchester]]; over time in these locations temporary huts were replaced with more permanent barracks buildings. Large-scale camps were not the only way forward, however; from the 1870s, the localisation agenda of the [[Cardwell Reforms]] saw new and old barracks established as [[Regimental depot|depots]] for regional or County brigades and regiments. The latter part of the 19th century also saw the establishment of a number of Naval barracks (an innovation long resisted by the Royal Navy, which had tended to accommodate its sailors afloat either on their ships or else in [[Hulk (ship type)|hulks]] moored in its harbours). The first of these, Keyham Barracks in Devonport (later [[HMNB Devonport|HMS Drake]]), was begun in 1879, and only completed in 1907.\n\n[[File:Chelsea Barracks - geograph.org.uk - 812156.jpg|thumbnail|left|Chelsea Barracks, as rebuilt in the 1960s]]\nDuring the 20th century, activity ranged from the need for speedy expansion during the First World War (when large camps such as [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]] were established), to the closure of many barracks in the [[interwar period]]. Many of those that remained were rebuilt in the 1960s, either substantially (as happened at Woolwich, behind the facade) or entirely (as at [[Hyde Park Barracks, London|Hyde Park]] and at [[Chelsea Barracks|Chelsea]] - built 1863, demolished and rebuilt 1963, closed 2008). There has been an ongoing focus on improving the quality of barracks accommodation; since the 1970s several [[List of former Royal Air Force stations|former RAF bases]] have been converted to serve as Army barracks, in place of some of the more cramped urban sites. Today, generally, only single and unmarried personnel or those who choose not to move their families nearby live in barracks. Most British military barracks are named after battles, military figures or the locality.\n\n===Poland===\nIn Poland barracks are represented usually as a complex of buildings, each consisting of a separate entity or an administrative or business premises. As an example, the [[Barracks Complex in Wrze\u015bnia]].\n\n===United States of America===\n[[File:Fort Larned Barracks.jpg|thumb|Many barracks contain large numbers of beds or bunk beds with minimal common areas]]\nIn basic training, and sometimes follow-on training, service members live in barracks. The [[U.S. Marine Corps]] have gender-separate basic training units. The [[U.S. Army]] has gender-separate basic training, but like the [[United States Coast Guard]], [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[U.S. Navy]], has training where male and female recruits share barracks, but are separated during personal time and lights out. However, all the services integrate male and female members following [[Recruit training|boot camp]] and first assignment, except the various [[combat arms]] elements.\n\nAfter training, unmarried junior enlisted members will typically reside in barracks. In the 21st century, these service members are generally housed in individual rooms conforming to the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD's]] \"1+1 standard\", though exceptions still exist. During unaccompanied, dependent-restricted assignments, non-commissioned and commissioned officer ranks may also be required to live in barracks. Amenities in these barracks increase with the rank of the occupant.\n\nUnlike the other services, the U.S. Air Force officially uses the term \"[[dormitory#United States military|dormitory]]\" to refer to its unaccompanied housing.\n\nDuring World War II, many U.S. barracks were made of inexpensive, sturdy and easy to assemble [[Quonset hut]]s that resembled [[Native American long house]]s (having a rounded roof but made out of metal).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cantonment]], a temporary or semi-permanent military quarters.\n*[[Selimiye Barracks]]\n*[[B hut]]\n*[[Barkas, Hyderabad]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Black, Jeremy, ''A Military Revolution?: Military Change and European Society, 1550-1800'' (London, 1991)\n* Dallemagne, Fran\u00e7ois, ''Les casernes fran\u00e7aises'', (1990)\n* Douet, James, ''British Barracks, their social and architectural importance, 1660-1914'' (London, 1997)\n* Roberts, Michael ''The Military Revolution, 1560-1660'' (Belfast, 1956); reprinted with some amendments in Rogers, Clifford, ed., ''The Military Revolution Debate'' Rogers, Clifford, ed., ''The Military Revolution Debate: Readings on the Military Transformation of Early Modern Europe'' (Boulder, 1995)\n* 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Barracks}}\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Barracks |volume=3 |short=x}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013163723/http://remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_engineer.htm#mil_con Royal Engineers Museum] Military Works (Barrack construction)\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations by type]]\n[[Category:Barracks| ]]\n[[Category:Human habitats]]\n[[Category:Total institutions]]\n", "name_user": "ArchArslan", "label": "safe", "comment": "No real reason for a link or \"read more\" to a specific Turkish barracks built around the 19th century.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks"}

From November 1940 until his capture in July 1943, he was credited with sinking 17 ships for a total of {{GRT|66848|disp=long}} and damaging another for {{GRT|6003}}. He was responsible for sinking the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} in November 1941. For these achievements he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]], among other commendations. After the war he became the Deputy Chief of Staff in the [[NATO]] command [[Allied Forces Northern Europe|AFNORTH]].\n\n==Early life==\nGuggenberger was born in [[Munich]] on 6 March 1915. He had entered the navy by 1934, transferring to the [[U-boat]] arm in October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War. After the usual training pattern he was assigned to {{GS|U-28|1936|2}}, where he served under the command of Knight's Cross holder [[G\u00fcnther Kuhnke]]. Guggenberger then briefly took over from Kuhnke and commanded ''U-28'' for a few months whilst she was part of a school flotilla. He was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 2nd Class]] on 23 March 1940.\n\n==''U-81''==\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal sinking.jpg|thumb|left|200px|{{HMS|Legion|G74|6}} moves alongside the damaged and listing {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} in order to take off survivors]]\nGuggenberger then received command of {{GS|U-81|1941|2}}, commissioning her on 26 April 1941. He carried out three patrols in the Atlantic, encountering moderate success and sinking two ships. He was awarded the [[U-boat War Badge|U-boat War Badge 1939]] on 8 July and promoted to [[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]] on 1 September.\n\nHe was then ordered to take ''U-81'' into the Mediterranean to join [[29th U-boat Flotilla]]. His first attempt failed when, attempting to force the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], ''U-81'' was spotted by RAF planes and attacked, causing heavy damage. ''U-81'' retreated to [[Brest, France|Brest]] where she was repaired.{{sfn|Paterson|2001|pp=108\u2013109}} Guggenberger was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class on 9 September.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} He put to sea that afternoon and sank the ''Empire Springbuck'' at 5,591 tons. The following day he sank ''Sally M\u00e6rsk'' for a further 3,252 gross registered tons.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=65}}\n\n''U-81'' sailed again to attempt to enter the Mediterranean in November 1941. Whilst transiting the Straits on 13 November, he met the ships of [[Force H]], returning to [[Gibraltar]]. He was able to attack the aircraft carrier HMS ''Ark Royal'', hitting her amidships with a single torpedo.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=227}} The carrier was hunting [[German submarine U-205|''U-205'']], which had carried out an unsuccessful attack on her. ''Ark Royal'' and been turning into wind to launch aircraft when Guggenberger struck.{{sfn|Paterson|2001|p=111}}\n\nHe then escaped the depth charge attacks of the escorting destroyers. Despite attempts to salvage ''Ark Royal'' had to be abandoned, and she sank the next day.{{sfn|Rohwer|1996|p=65}}{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=21}} Guggenberger was awarded the Knight's Cross. The award was fortuitous. Guggenberger was sure he had hit a battleship\u2014[[HMS Malaya|''Malaya'']]\u2014 and was shocked when the [[BdU]] announced the sinking of the carrier for he had missed his intended target.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=154}} Only one man was killed aboard the carrier by the initial impact. The remainder were evacuated.{{sfn|Paterson|2001|p=111}}\n\nGuggenberger achieved modest success in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]]. The ''FFL Vikings P 41'', a French ship of 1,150 get was sunk on 16 April 1942, as was the British ''Caspia'' to increase the haul by 6,018 grt. A number of Egyptian [[sailing ship]]s followed. The same day ''Bab el Farag'', 105 grt \nand ''Fatouh el Kher'', 97 grt, were sunk by gunfire southwest of [[Haifa]]. The 90-ton ''Hefz el Rahman'' followed on 19 April. On 22 April ''El Saadiah'', 122 grt, and ''Aziza'' were sunk.\n\n==''U-513'' and capture==\n\nGuggenberger went on to have a number of successful patrols in the Mediterranean, and left ''U-81'' on 24 December 1942, being replaced by [[Johann-Otto Krieg]]. Guggenberger was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross on 8 January and oversaw the commissioning of {{GS|U-847||2}}, but did not take her on any war patrols. The presentation was made on 31 January 1943 at the [[Wolf's Lair]], Hitler's headquarters in [[Rastenburg]], present-day K\u0119trzyn in Poland, for the Oak Leaves presentation. Following the presentation, Hitler met with D\u00f6nitz and ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Theodor Krancke]] in private. In this meeting, Hitler appointed D\u00f6nitz as ''[[Oberkommando der Marine|Oberbefehlshaber der Marine]]'' (Commander-in-Chief) of the ''Kriegsmarine'' following [[Erich Raeder resignation and later|Raeder's resignation]] on 30 January 1943. On the return flight to Berlin, D\u00f6nitz informed Guggenberger and the other officers present of this change in command.\n\nHe then joined Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]'s staff for three months. He returned to sea in May 1943 in command of {{GS|U-513||2}}. He only undertook one patrol aboard her though. After sinking four ships and damaging a fifth she was sunk on 19 July 1943 by depth charges from an American [[PBM Mariner]] whilst off the coast of [[Brazil]]. Guggenberger was one of only seven survivors. Badly wounded he and the others spent a day aboard a [[life raft]] before being picked up by an American ship, {{USS|Barnegat|AVP-10|6}}. Guggenberger was operated on and then hospitalised for a period, before being transferred to [[Fort Hunt]] on 25 September 1943, followed by the [[Prisoner of war camp]] at [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]] later that month. By late January 1944 Guggenberger had been moved to the [[Camp Papago Park|Papago Park camp]] near [[Phoenix, Arizona]].\n\n==Escapes==\nGuggenberger met with four other U-boat commanders and on 12 February 1944 they escaped from the camp. Guggenberger travelled with [[August Maus]], but they were recaptured in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Guggenberger was part of the [[Great Papago Escape]], a larger breakout of 25 POWs on the night of 23\u201324 December 1944. This time he travelled with [[J\u00fcrgen Quaet-Faslem]] and managed to make it to within 10 miles of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border before they were recaptured on 6 January 1945. After these escapades, Guggenberger was transferred to [[Camp Shanks]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in February, 1946, and was then repatriated to Germany. He was held in a compound in the British zone, near [[M\u00fcnster]], before being released in August 1946.\n\n==Postwar and personal life==\nOn 16 November 1940 Guggenberger married Lieselotte Fischer. The marriage produced four children.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Kriegsmarine Crew 34|title=Friedrich \"Fritz\" Guggenberger |url=http://www.marineoffiziere-crew-34.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=510&Itemid=27 |language=German|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref> Guggenberger became an [[architect]], before rejoining the navy, by now the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' in 1956.

II|Second World War]]. From November 1940 until his capture in July 1943, he was credited with sinking 17 ships for a total of {{GRT|66848|disp=long}} and damaging another for {{GRT|6003}}. He was responsible for sinking the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} in November 1941. For these achievements he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]], among other commendations. After the war he became the Deputy Chief of Staff in the [[NATO]] command [[Allied Forces Northern Europe|AFNORTH]].\n\n==Early life==\nGuggenberger was born in [[Munich]] on 6 March 1915. He had entered the navy by 1934, transferring to the [[U-boat]] arm in October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War. After the usual training pattern he was assigned to {{GS|U-28|1936|2}}, where he served under the command of Knight's Cross holder [[G\u00fcnther Kuhnke]]. Guggenberger then briefly took over from Kuhnke and commanded ''U-28'' for a few months whilst she was part of a school flotilla. He was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 2nd Class]] on 23 March 1940.\n\n==''U-81''==\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal sinking.jpg|thumb|left|200px|{{HMS|Legion|G74|6}} moves alongside the damaged and listing {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} in order to take off survivors]]\nGuggenberger then received command of {{GS|U-81|1941|2}}, commissioning her on 26 April 1941. He carried out three patrols in the Atlantic, encountering moderate success and sinking two ships. He was awarded the [[U-boat War Badge|U-boat War Badge 1939]] on 8 July and promoted to [[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]] on 1 September.\n\nHe was then ordered to take ''U-81'' into the Mediterranean to join [[29th U-boat Flotilla]]. His first attempt failed when, attempting to force the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], ''U-81'' was spotted by RAF planes and attacked, causing heavy damage. ''U-81'' retreated to [[Brest, France|Brest]] where she was repaired.{{sfn|Paterson|2001|pp=108\u2013109}} Guggenberger was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class on 9 September.{{cn|date=December 2019}} He put to sea that afternoon and sank the ''Empire Springbuck'' at 5,591 tons. The following day he sank ''Sally M\u00e6rsk'' for a further 3,252 gross registered tons.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=65}}\n\n''U-81'' sailed again to attempt to enter the Mediterranean in November 1941. Whilst transiting the Straits on 13 November, he met the ships of [[Force H]], returning to [[Gibraltar]]. He was able to attack the aircraft carrier HMS ''Ark Royal'', hitting her amidships with a single torpedo.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=227}} The carrier was hunting [[German submarine U-205|''U-205'']], which had carried out an unsuccessful attack on her. ''Ark Royal'' and been turning into wind to launch aircraft when Guggenberger struck.{{sfn|Paterson|2001|p=111}}\n\nHe then escaped the depth charge attacks of the escorting destroyers. Despite attempts to salvage ''Ark Royal'' had to be abandoned, and she sank the next day.{{sfn|Rohwer|1996|p=65}}{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=21}} Guggenberger was awarded the Knight's Cross. The award was fortuitous. Guggenberger was sure he had hit a battleship\u2014[[HMS Malaya|''Malaya'']]\u2014 and was shocked when the [[BdU]] announced the sinking of the carrier for he had missed his intended target.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=154}} Only one man was killed aboard the carrier by the initial impact. The remainder were evacuated.{{sfn|Paterson|2001|p=111}}\n\nGuggenberger achieved modest success in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]]. The ''FFL Vikings P 41'', a French ship of 1,150 get was sunk on 16 April 1942, as was the British ''Caspia'' to increase the haul by 6,018 grt. A number of Egyptian [[sailing ship]]s followed. The same day ''Bab el Farag'', 105 grt \nand ''Fatouh el Kher'', 97 grt, were sunk by gunfire southwest of [[Haifa]]. The 90-ton ''Hefz el Rahman'' followed on 19 April. On 22 April ''El Saadiah'', 122 grt, and ''Aziza'' were sunk.\n\n==''U-513'' and capture==\n\nGuggenberger went on to have a number of successful patrols in the Mediterranean, and left ''U-81'' on 24 December 1942, being replaced by [[Johann-Otto Krieg]]. Guggenberger was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross on 8 January and oversaw the commissioning of {{GS|U-847||2}}, but did not take her on any war patrols. The presentation was made on 31 January 1943 at the [[Wolf's Lair]], Hitler's headquarters in [[Rastenburg]], present-day K\u0119trzyn in Poland, for the Oak Leaves presentation. Following the presentation, Hitler met with D\u00f6nitz and ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Theodor Krancke]] in private. In this meeting, Hitler appointed D\u00f6nitz as ''[[Oberkommando der Marine|Oberbefehlshaber der Marine]]'' (Commander-in-Chief) of the ''Kriegsmarine'' following [[Erich Raeder resignation and later|Raeder's resignation]] on 30 January 1943. On the return flight to Berlin, D\u00f6nitz informed Guggenberger and the other officers present of this change in command.\n\nHe then joined Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]'s staff for three months. He returned to sea in May 1943 in command of {{GS|U-513||2}}. He only undertook one patrol aboard her though. After sinking four ships and damaging a fifth she was sunk on 19 July 1943 by depth charges from an American [[PBM Mariner]] whilst off the coast of [[Brazil]]. Guggenberger was one of only seven survivors. Badly wounded he and the others spent a day aboard a [[life raft]] before being picked up by an American ship, {{USS|Barnegat|AVP-10|6}}. Guggenberger was operated on and then hospitalised for a period, before being transferred to [[Fort Hunt]] on 25 September 1943, followed by the [[Prisoner of war camp]] at [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]] later that month. By late January 1944 Guggenberger had been moved to the [[Camp Papago Park|Papago Park camp]] near [[Phoenix, Arizona]].\n\n==Escapes==\nGuggenberger met with four other U-boat commanders and on 12 February 1944 they escaped from the camp. Guggenberger travelled with [[August Maus]], but they were recaptured in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Guggenberger was part of the [[Great Papago Escape]], a larger breakout of 25 POWs on the night of 23\u201324 December 1944. This time he travelled with [[J\u00fcrgen Quaet-Faslem]] and managed to make it to within 10 miles of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border before they were recaptured on 6 January 1945. After these escapades, Guggenberger was transferred to [[Camp Shanks]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in February, 1946, and was then repatriated to Germany.

The game can be played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. Players commonly use sticks made out of wood, [[carbon fibre]], [[fibre glass]] or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic [[hockey ball]]. The length of the [[field hockey stick|hockey stick]] is based on the player's individual height: the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, and taller players typically have taller sticks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.longstreth.com/How-to-Choose-a-Stick/products/1951/ |title=How to Choose a Stick |website=Longstreth.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714053805/http://www.longstreth.com/How-to-Choose-a-Stick/products/1951/ |archive-date=14 July 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The sticks have a round side and a flat side only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used; if the other side is used it results in a foul. Goalies often have a different kind of stick; however, they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, this is to give them more surface area to save the ball. The uniform consists of [[shin guard]]s, shoes, shorts or a skirt, a [[mouthguard]] and a jersey.\n\nToday, the game is played globally, mainly in parts of [[Western Europe]], [[South Asia]], [[Southern Africa]], Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States (primarily [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eisen|first1=Matt|title=In America, field hockey still toils in obscurity|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/10/12/in-america-field-hockey-still-toils-in-obscurity/|accessdate=4 February 2017|work=[[Yale Daily News]]|date=12 October 2006|quote=The American game is regionally centered.

In [[Sweden]], the term ''landhockey'' is used and to some degree also in [[Norway]] where it is governed by [[Norway's Bandy Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandyforbundet.no/?p=95|title=Landhockey|website=bandyforbundet.no}}</ref>\n\nDuring play, goal keepers are the only players who are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body (the player's hand is considered part of the stick if on the stick), while field players play the ball with the flat side of their stick. If the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick, it will result in a penalty. Goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick.\n\nWhoever scores the most [[goal (sport)|goal]]s by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the competition's format. There are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league and tournament play. In college play, a seven-aside overtime period consists of a 10-minute [[golden goal]] period with seven players for each team. If a tie still remains, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses 5 players to dribble from the 25-yard line down to the circle against the opposing goalie. The player has 8 seconds to score on the goalie keeping it in bounds. The play ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one on one) or time expires. If the tie still persists more rounds are played until one team has scored.\n\nThe governing body of field hockey is the [[International Hockey Federation|International Hockey Federation (FIH), which is called the ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey'' in French]], with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIH Hockey World League|World League]], [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] and [[Junior Hockey World Cup|Junior World Cup]], with many countries running extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organizing the [[Hockey Rules Board]] and developing the [[Sport rule|rules]] for the game.\n\nA popular variant of field hockey is [[indoor field hockey]], which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Indoor hockey is a 5-a-side variant, with a field which is reduced to approximately {{convert|40|x|20|m|abbr=on}}. With many of the rules remaining the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: Players may not raise the ball unless shooting on goal, players may not hit the ball (instead using pushes to transfer the ball), and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers which the ball will rebound off.<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\">{{cite web|title=Field Hockey Rules|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202012-interactif.pdf|publisher=International Hockey Federation}}</ref> In addition, the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than an outdoor stick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/media/12236439/rules-of-indoor-hockey-2017.pdf|title=Rules of Indoor hockey 2017|last=The International Hockey Federation}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of field hockey}}\n[[File:Relief pentelic marble \"Ball Players\" 510-500 BC, NAMA 3476 102587.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Relief of 510 BC depicting [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] players of ''ker\u0113t\u00edzein'', an ancestral form of hockey or [[ground billiards]]; in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]\nThere is a depiction of a field hockey-like game in [[Ancient Greece]], dating to c.&nbsp;510&nbsp;BC, when the game may have been called {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} (''ker\u0113t\u00edzein'') because it was played with a horn ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2}}, ''k\u00e9ras'', in [[Ancient Greek]]) and a ball.<ref>Oikonomos, G. \"\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\" Archaiologikon Deltion 6 (1920\u20131921): 56 -59; there are clear depictions of the game, but the identification with the name \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd is [http://sarantakos.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/keretizein/ disputed] ([http://hellenisteukontos.blogspot.com/2010/03/ancient-greek-field-hockey.html English summary]).</ref> <!--Begin block of material sourced to Stein & Rubino.-->Researchers disagree over how to interpret this image.

By the 12th century, a team ball game called ''{{lang|frm|[[la soule]]}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|choule}}'', akin to a chaotic and sometimes long-distance version of hockey or [[rugby football]] (depending on whether sticks were used in a particular local variant), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes. <!--Being block of text cited to Stein & Rubino.-->Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Early Modern era]], such games often involved the local clergy or secular [[aristocracy]], and in some periods were limited to them by various anti-gaming edicts, or even banned altogether.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" /> Stein and Rubino, among others, ultimately trace aspects of these games both to rituals in antiquity involving [[Globus cruciger|orbs]] and [[sceptre]]s (on the aristocratic and clerical side), and to ancient [[military training exercise]]s (on the popular side); [[polo]] (essentially hockey on horseback) was devised by the [[Ancient Persia]]ns for [[cavalry]] training, based on the local proto-hockey foot game of the region.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />\n\nThe word ''hockey'' itself has no clear origin. One belief is that it was recorded in 1363 when [[Edward III]] of England issued the proclamation: \"Moreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games.\"<ref name=exp>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm |title=Rugby Football History |publisher=Rugby Football History |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> The belief is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games \"Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam\". It may be recalled at this point that ''baculum'' is the Latin for 'stick', so the reference would appear to be to a game played with sticks. The English historian and biographer [[John Strype]] did not use the word \"hockey\" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, and the word 'hockey' remains of unknown origin.\n\nThe modern game grew from English [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] in the early 19th century. The first club was in 1849 at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in south-east [[London]], but the modern rules grew out of a version played by [[Middlesex]] [[cricket]] clubs for winter game.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} [[Teddington]] Hockey Club formed the modern game by introducing the striking circle and changing the ball to a sphere from a rubber cube.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3BNMr7U8e9wC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22Hockey%22+circle+Teddington&source=bl&ots=L1sdZllpDV&sig=ztRqdfmNq6rFPyN-WLC2AzqjSGs&hl=en&ei=HEDATJfoEcK4jAegoPXRCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Hockey%22%20circle%20Teddington&f=false |first=Tracie |last=Egan |first2=Helen |last2=Connolly |title=Field Hockey: Rules, Tips, Strategy, and Safety |date=2005 |isbn=978-1-4042-0182-8 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> The Hockey Association was founded in 1886.

Synthetic pitches changed most aspects of field hockey, gaining speed. New tactics and techniques such as the [[Indian dribble]] developed, followed by new rules to take account. The switch to synthetic surfaces ended Indian and Pakistani domination because artificial turf was too expensive in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. Since the 1970s, Australia, the Netherlands, and Germany have dominated at the Olympics and World Cup stages.\n\nWomen's field hockey was first played at British universities and schools. The first club, the Molesey Ladies, was founded in 1887.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The first national association was the [[Irish Ladies Hockey Union]] in 1894,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} and though rebuffed by the Hockey Association, women's field hockey grew rapidly around the world. This led to the International Federation of Women's Hockey Association (IFWHA) in 1927, though this did not include many continental European countries where women played as sections of men's associations and were affiliated to the FIH. The IFWHA held conferences every three years, and tournaments associated with these were the primary IFWHA competitions. These tournaments were non-competitive until 1975.\n\nBy the early 1970s, there were 22 associations with women's sections in the FIH and 36 associations in the IFWHA. Discussions started about a common rule book. The FIH introduced competitive tournaments in 1974, forcing the acceptance of the principle of competitive field hockey by the IFWHA in 1973. It took until 1982 for the two bodies to merge, but this allowed the introduction of women's field hockey to the Olympic games from 1980 where, as in the men's game, The Netherlands, Germany, and Australia have been consistently strong. Argentina has emerged as a team to be reckoned with since 2000, winning the world championship in 2002 and 2010 and medals at the last three Olympics.\n\nIn the United States field hockey is played predominantly by females. However, outside North America, participation is now fairly evenly balanced between men and women. For example, in England, [[England Hockey]] reports that as of the 2008\u201309 season there were 2488 registered men's teams, 1969 women's teams, 1042 boys' teams, 966 girls' teams and 274 mixed teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=70&sectionTitle=Clubs |title=Clubs |work=EnglandHockey.co.uk |publisher=England Hockey Board |accessdate=10 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817214039/http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=70&sectionTitle=Clubs |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2006 the [[Irish Hockey Association]] reported that the gender split among its players was approximately 65% female and 35% male.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,1181-180298-197516-38886-258897-custom-item,00.html |title=Ireland |work=FIHockey.org |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> In its 2008 census, [[Hockey Australia]] reported 40,534 male club players and 41,542 female.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockey.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Census/2008NationalHockeyCensusExecSummary_Board.pdf |title=National Census Executive Summary 2008 |work=Hockey.org.ca |publisher=Hockey Australia |page=2 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022091719/http://www.hockey.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Census/2008NationalHockeyCensusExecSummary_Board.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, in the United States of America, there are few field hockey clubs, most play taking place between high school or college sides, consisting almost entirely of women. The strength of college field hockey reflects the impact of [[Title IX]] which mandated that colleges should fund men's and women's games programmes comparably.\n\nThe game's roots in the English public girls' school mean that the game is associated in the UK with active or overachieving [[middle class]] and [[upper class]] women. For example, in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s novel set in a totalitarian London, main character [[Winston Smith]] initially dislikes Julia, the woman he comes to love, because of \"the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=George |last=Orwell |author-link=George Orwell |title=Nineteen Eighty-Four |at=Part I, Ch. 1 |origyear=1949 |date=9 November 2011 |url= http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four/Part_I/Chapter_1 |via=WikiLivres.ca |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game of field hockey is also very present in the United States. Many high schools and colleges in the U.S. offer the sport and in some areas it is even offered for youth athletes. It has been predominantly played on the East Coast, specifically the Northeast in states such as New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. It recent years however it has become increasingly present on the West Coast and in the Midwest. Field hockey is still not played much in the Southern states of the U.S. but it is offered at a few colleges in Tennessee and Kentucky.\n\n==Field of play==\n{{Main|Field hockey pitch}}\n[[File:Hockey field metric.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Diagram of a hockey field]]\nMost hockey field dimensions were originally fixed using whole numbers of [[imperial measure]]s. Nevertheless, metric measurements are now the official dimensions as laid down by the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH) in the \"Rules of Hockey\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/media/13164482/fih-rules-of-hockey-2019-final-website.pdf|title=Rules of Hockey|date=25 February 2020|website=FIH - Federation of International Hockey}}</ref> The pitch is a {{convert|91.4|x|55|m|yd|abbr=on}} rectangular field. At each end is a goal {{convert|2.14|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|3.66|m|0|abbr=on}} wide, as well as lines across the field {{convert|22.90|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} from each end-line (generally referred to as the 23-metre lines or the 25-yard lines) and in the center of the field. A spot {{convert|0.15|m|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, called the penalty spot or stroke mark, is placed with its centre {{convert|6.40|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} from the centre of each goal. The shooting circle is {{convert|16|yd|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the base line.\n\nField hockey goals are made of two upright posts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar, with a net positioned to catch the ball when it passes through the goalposts. The goalposts and crossbar must be white and rectangular in shape, and should be {{cvt|2|inch}} wide and {{cvt|2 - 3|in}} deep.\nField hockey goals also include sideboards and a backboard, which stand {{cvt|50|cm}} from the ground. The backboard runs the full {{cvt|3.66|m}} width of the goal, while the sideboards are {{cvt|1.2|m}} deep.<ref name=\"pitch and post dimensions\">{{cite web | title=\" Hockey Goal, Field & Line Dimensions: Regulations for Professional Field Hockey\" |url= https://www.harrodsport.com/advice-and-guides/hockey-goal-field-dimensions |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Playing surface===\nHistorically the game developed on natural grass turf. In the early 1970s, \"[[artificial turf|synthetic grass]]\" fields began to be used for hockey, with the first Olympic Games on this surface being held at [[Montreal]] in [[Field hockey at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]]. Synthetic pitches are now mandatory for all international tournaments and for most national competitions. While hockey is still played on traditional grass fields at some local levels and lesser national divisions, it has been replaced by synthetic surfaces almost everywhere in the western world. There are three main types of artificial hockey surface:<ref name=\"GB Pitches\">{{cite web|url=http://greatbritainhockey.co.uk/library-media/documents/Hockey%20Pitch%20Basic%20Info.pdf|title=Hockey Pitches \u2013 Basic Information|publisher=[[Great Britain Hockey]]|format=PDF|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.8 \u00a72}}{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.19 \u00a75.5.1}}\n\n*Unfilled or water based - artificial fibres that are densely packed for stabilisation, requires irrigation or watering to avoid pitch wear\n*Dressed or sand dressed - artificial fibres can be less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for part of the [[Pile (textile)|pile depth]]\n*Filled or sand filled - artificial fibres can be longer and less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for 100% of the pile depth\n\nSince the 1970s, sand-based pitches have been favoured as they dramatically speed up the game. However, in recent years there has been a massive increase in the number of \"water-based\" artificial turfs. Water-based synthetic turfs enable the ball to be transferred more quickly than on sand-based surfaces. It is this characteristic that has made them the surface of choice for international and national league competitions. Water-based surfaces are also less abrasive than sand-based surfaces and reduce the level of injury to players when they come into contact with the surface. The FIH are now{{when|date=January 2015}} proposing that new surfaces being laid should be of a hybrid variety which require less watering. This is due to the negative ecological effects of the high water requirements of water-based synthetic fields. It has also been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent countries who could afford these new pitches.<ref name=\"TOI\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/headon/entry/the-untold-story-of-how-india-lost-hockey-supremacy|title=The untold story of how India lost hockey supremacy|first=Minhaz|last=Merchant|date=15 January 2013|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rules and play==\nThe game is played between two teams of whom eleven, 10 field players and one goal keeper, are permitted to be on the pitch at any one time. The remaining players may be substituted in any combination. There is an unlimited number of times a team can sub in and out. Substitutions are permitted at any point in the game, apart from between the award and end of a penalty corner; two exceptions to this rule is for injury or suspension of the defending goalkeeper, which is not allowed when playing with a field keep, or a player can exit the field, but you must wait until after the inserter touches the ball to put somebody back in.\n\nPlayers are permitted to play the ball with the flat of the 'face side' and with the edges of the head and handle of the field hockey stick with the exception that, for reasons of safety, the ball may not be struck 'hard' with a forehand edge stroke, because of the difficulty of controlling the height and direction of the ball from that stroke.\n\nThe flat side is always on the \"natural\" side for a right-handed person swinging the stick at the ball from right to left. Left-handed sticks are rare, but available; however they are pointless as the rules forbid their use in a game. To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of the stick to the ball by 'reversing' the stick head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180\u00b0 (while a reverse edge hit would turn the stick head through approximately 90\u00b0 from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of the stick head).\n\nEdge hitting of the ball underwent a two-year \"experimental period\", twice the usual length of an \"experimental trial\" and is still a matter of some controversy within the game. Ric Charlesworth, the former Australian coach, has been a strong critic of the unrestricted use of the reverse edge hit. The 'hard' forehand edge hit was banned after similar concerns were expressed about the ability of players to direct the ball accurately, but the reverse edge hit does appear to be more predictable and controllable than its counterpart. This type of hit is now more commonly referred to as the \"forehand sweep\" where the ball is hit with the flat side or \"natural\" side of the stick and not the rounded edge.\n\nOther rules include; no foot-to-ball contact, no use of hands, no obstructing other players, no high back swing, no hacking, and no third party. If a player is dribbling the ball and either loses control and kicks the ball or another player interferes that player is not permitted to gain control and continue dribbling. The rules do not allow the person who kicked the ball to gain advantage from the kick, so the ball will automatically be passed on to the opposing team. Conversely, if no advantage is gained from kicking the ball, play should continue. Players may not obstruct another's chance of hitting the ball in any way. No shoving/using your body/stick to prevent advancement in the other team. Penalty for this is the opposing team receives the ball and if the problem continues, the player can be carded. While a player is taking a free hit or starting a corner the back swing of their hit cannot be too high for this is considered dangerous. Finally there may not be three players touching the ball at one time. Two players from opposing teams can battle for the ball, however if another player interferes it is considered third party and the ball automatically goes to the team who only had one player involved in the third party.\n\n=== The game ===\nA match ordinarily consists of two periods of 35 minutes and a halftime interval of 5 minutes. Other periods and interval may be agreed by\nboth teams except as specified in Regulations for particular competitions.<ref>http://www.fih.ch/media/12236728/fih-rules-of-hockey-2017.pdf</ref> Since 2014, some International games have four 15 minute quarters with 2 minutes break between each quarter and 15 minutes break between quarter two and three. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games Held on the Gold Coast in Brisbane, Australia the hockey games for both men and women had four 15 minute quarters.\n\nIn December 2018 the FIH announced rule changes that would make 15-minute quarters universal from January 2019. England Hockey confirmed that while no changes would be made to the domestic game mid-season, the new rules would be implemented at the start of the 2019-20 season. However, in July 2019 England Hockey announced that 17.5-minute quarters would only be implemented in elite domestic club games.<ref name=\"Application of the rules of hockey\">{{cite web | title=Application of the rules of hockey in England for the 2019-20 Season|url= https://www.englandhockey.co.uk/news.asp?itemid=46512&itemTitle=Application+of+the+rules+of+hockey+in+England+for+the+2019-20+Season.&section=22 |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game begins with a pass back from the centre-forward usually to the centre-half back from the halfway line, the opposing team can not try to tackle this play until the ball has been pushed back. The team consists of eleven players, the players are usually set up as follows: Goalkeeper, Left Fullback, Right Fullback, 3 half-backs and 4 forwards consisting of Left Wing, Left Inner, Right Inner and Right Wing.{{Contradict-inline|reason=These sum up to 10, not 11 |date=August 2019}} These positions can change and adapt throughout the course of the game depending on the attacking and defensive style of the opposition.<ref>http://kingslangleyhockey.org.au/doc/JnrPosPlayDraft5.pdf</ref>\n\n===Positions===\n[[File:UVA field hockey.jpg|thumb|A [[Virginia Cavaliers]] field player passing the ball]]\nWhen hockey positions are discussed, notions of fluidity are very common. Each team can be fielded with a maximum of 11 players and will typically arrange themselves into forwards, midfielders, and defensive players (fullbacks) with players frequently moving between these lines with the flow of play. Each team may also play with:\n\n''* a goalkeeper who wears a different color shirt and full protective equipment comprising at least headgear, leg guards and kickers; this player is referred to in the rules as a goalkeeper; or''\n\n''* Only field players; no player has goalkeeping privileges or wears a different color shirt; no player may wear protective headgear except a face mask when defending a penalty corner or stroke.''<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\"/>\n\n====Formations====\nAs hockey has a very dynamic style of play, it is difficult to simplify positions to the static [[Formation (association football)|formation]]s which are common in [[association football|football]]. Although positions will typically be categorized as either fullback, halfback, midfield/inner or striker, it is important for players to have an understanding of every position on the field. For example, it is not uncommon to see a halfback overlap and end up in either attacking position, with the midfield and strikers being responsible for re-adjusting to fill the space they left. Movement between lines like this is particularly common across all positions.\n\nThis fluid Australian culture{{Explain |date=August 2019}} of hockey has been responsible for developing an international trend towards players occupying spaces on the field, not having assigned positions. Although they may have particular spaces on the field which they are more comfortable and effective as players, they are responsible for occupying the space nearest them. This fluid approach to hockey and player movement has made it easy for teams to transition between formations such as; ''\"3 at the back\"'', ''\"2 centre halves\"'', ''\"5 at the front\",'' and more.\n\n====Goalkeepers====\n[[File:M060519 vit vipers-dragons 0071.JPG|thumb|Goalkeeper during game]]\nWhen the ball is inside the circle they are defending and they have their stick in their hand, goalkeepers wearing full protective equipment are permitted to use their stick, feet, kickers or leg guards to propel the ball and to use their stick, feet, kickers, leg guards or any other part of their body to stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. Similarly, field players are permitted to use their stick. They are not allowed to use their feet and legs to propel the ball, stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. However, neither goalkeepers, or players with goalkeeping privileges are permitted to conduct themselves in a manner which is dangerous to other players by taking advantage of the protective equipment they wear.<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\"/>\n\nNeither goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges may lie on the ball, however, they are permitted to use arms, hands and any other part of their body to push the ball away. Lying on the ball deliberately will result in a penalty stroke, whereas if an umpire deems a goalkeeper has lain on the ball accidentally (e.g. it gets stuck in their protective equipment), a penalty corner is awarded.\n\n''* The action above is permitted only as part of a goal saving action or to move the ball away from the possibility of a goal scoring action by opponents. It does not permit a goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges to propel the ball forcefully with arms, hands or body so that it travels a long distance''\n\nWhen the ball is outside the circle they are defending, goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges are only permitted to play the ball with their stick. Further, a goalkeeper, or player with goalkeeping privileges who is wearing a helmet, must not take part in the match outside the 23m area they are defending, except when taking a penalty stroke. A goalkeeper must wear protective headgear at all times, except when taking a penalty stroke.\n\n===General play===\nFor the purposes of the rules, all players on the team in possession of the ball are attackers, and those on the team without the ball are defenders, yet throughout the game being played you are always \"defending\" your goal and \"attacking\" the opposite goal.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/field-hockey-elizabeth-anders/1101100144 |title=No Results Page &#124; Barnes & Noble |website=Barnesandnoble.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brenda256.jpg|thumb|right|Sideline hit in a match Standard Athletic Club vs. British School of Paris (1996)]]\nThe match is officiated by two field [[umpire (field hockey)|umpires]]. Traditionally each umpire generally controls half of the field, divided roughly diagonally. These umpires are often assisted by a technical bench including a timekeeper and record keeper.\n\nPrior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or whether to start with the ball. Since 2017 the game consists of four periods of 15 minutes with a 2-minute break after every period, and a 15-minute intermission at half time before changing ends. At the start of each period, as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field. All players must start in their defensive half (apart from the player making the pass), but the ball may be played in any direction along the floor. Each team starts with the ball in one half, and the team that conceded the goal has possession for the restart. Teams trade sides at halftime.\n\nField players may only play the ball with the face of the stick. If the back side of the stick is used, it is a penalty and the other team will get the ball back. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or the other person's stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalized if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body to push a defender out of the way.\n\nField players may not play the ball with their feet, but if the ball accidentally hits the feet, and the player gains no benefit from the contact, then the contact is not penalized. Although there has been a change in the wording of this rule from 1 January 2007, the current FIH umpires' briefing instructs umpires not to change the way they interpret this rule.<ref name=\"Umpires' briefing\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |title=Title of presentation |publisher=Fihockey.org |accessdate=2014-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202000007/http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nObstruction typically occurs in three circumstances&nbsp;\u2013 when a defender comes between the player with possession and the ball in order to prevent them tackling; when a defender's stick comes between the attacker's stick and the ball or makes contact with the attacker's stick or body; and also when blocking the opposition's attempt to tackle a teammate with the ball (called ''third party obstruction'').\n\nWhen the ball passes completely over the sidelines (on the sideline is still in), it is returned to play with a sideline hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. The ball must be placed on the sideline, with the hit taken from as near the place the ball went out of play as possible. If it crosses the back line after last touched by an attacker, a {{convert|15|m|yd|abbr=on}} hit is awarded. A 15&nbsp;m hit is also awarded for offences committed by the attacking side within 15&nbsp;m of the end of the pitch they are attacking.\n\n===Set plays===\nSet plays are often utilized for specific situations such as a penalty corner or free hit. For instance, many teams have penalty corner variations that they can use to beat the defensive team. The coach may have plays that sends the ball between two defenders and lets the player attack the opposing team's goal. There are no set plays unless your team has them.\n\n====Free hits====\nFree hits are awarded when offences are committed outside the scoring circles (the term 'free hit' is standard usage but the ball need not be hit). The ball may be hit, pushed or lifted in any direction by the team offended against. The ball can be lifted from a free hit but not by hitting, you must flick or scoop to lift from a free hit. (In previous versions of the rules, hits in the area outside the circle in open play have been permitted but lifting one direction from a free hit was prohibited). Opponents must move {{convert|5|m|yd|abbr=on}}<!-- 5 m is the distance used in most of the world, only US high school rules mandate 7 yards. Please don't change--> from the ball when a free hit is awarded. A free hit must be taken from within playing distance of the place of the offence for which it was awarded and the ball must be stationary when the free hit is taken.\n\nAs mentioned above, a 15&nbsp;m hit is awarded if an attacking player commits a foul forward of that line, or if the ball passes over the back line off an attacker. These free hits are taken in-line with where the foul was committed (taking a line parallel with the sideline between where the offence was committed, or the ball went out of play). When an attacking free hit is awarded within 5&nbsp;m of the circle everyone including the person taking the penalty must be five metres from the circle and everyone apart from the person taking the free hit must be five metres away from the ball. When taking an attacking free hit, the ball may not be hit straight into the circle if you are within your attacking 23 meter area (25 yard area). It must travel 5 meters before going in.\n\n====2009 experimental changes====\nIn February 2009 the FIH introduced, as a \"Mandatory Experiment\" for international competition, an updated version of the free-hit rule. The changes allows a player taking a free hit to pass the ball to themselves. Importantly, this is not a \"play on\" situation, but to the untrained eye it may appear to be. The player must play the ball any distance in two separate motions, before continuing as if it were a play-on situation. They may raise an aerial or overhead immediately as the second action, or any other stroke permitted by the rules of field hockey. At high-school level, this is called a self pass and was adopted in Pennsylvania in 2010 as a legal technique for putting the ball in play.\n\nAlso, all players (from both teams) must be at least 5&nbsp;m from any free hit awarded to the attack within the 23&nbsp;m area. The ball may not travel directly into the circle from a free hit to the attack within the 23 m area without first being touched by another player or being dribbled at least 5 m by a player making a \"self-pass\". These experimental rules apply to all free-hit situations, including sideline and corner hits. National associations may also choose to introduce these rules for their domestic competitions.\n\n====Attacking-free hit from quarter line====\nA free hit from the quarter line is awarded to the attacking team if the ball goes over the back-line after last being touched by a defender, provided they do not play it over the back-line deliberately, in which case a penalty corner is awarded. This free hit is played by the attacking team from a spot on the quarter line closest to where the ball went out of play. All the parameters of an attacking free hit within the attacking quarter of the playing surface apply.\n\n====Penalty corner====\nThe [[Penalty corner|short or penalty corner]] is awarded: [[File:Fieldhockey shortcorner defense.jpg|thumb|right|A group of five defenders, including the goalkeeper, prepare on the back line for a short corner.]]\n# for an offence by a defender in the circle which does not prevent the probable scoring of a goal;\n# for an intentional offence in the circle by a defender against an opponent who does not have possession of the ball or an opportunity to play the ball;\n# for an intentional offence by a defender outside the circle but within the 23-metre area they are defending;\n# for intentionally playing the ball over the back line by a defender;\n# when the ball becomes lodged in a player's clothing or equipment while in the circle they are defending.\n\nShort corners begin with five defenders (usually including the keeper) positioned behind the back line and the ball placed at least 10 yards from the nearest goal post.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Field Hockey Rules|url=http://lower.usm.k12.wi.us/special/phy_ed/basic_fh_rules.htm|archivedate = 2014-07-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729122657/http://lower.usm.k12.wi.us/special/phy_ed/basic_fh_rules.htm}}</ref> All other players in the defending team must be beyond the centre line, that is not in their 'own' half of the pitch, until the ball is in play. Attacking players begin the play standing outside the scoring circle, except for one attacker who starts the corner by playing the ball from a mark 10&nbsp;m either side of the goal (the circle has a 14.63&nbsp;m radius). This player puts the ball into play by pushing or hitting the ball to the other attackers outside the circle; the ball must pass outside the circle and then put back into the circle before the attackers may make a shot at the goal from which a goal can be scored. FIH rules do not forbid a shot at goal before the ball leaves the circle after being 'inserted', nor is a shot at the goal from outside the circle prohibited, but a goal cannot be scored at all if the ball has not gone out of the circle and cannot be scored from a shot from outside the circle if it is not again played by an attacking player before it enters the goal.\n\nFor safety reasons, the first shot of a penalty corner must not exceed 460&nbsp;mm high (the height of the \"backboard\" of the goal) at the point it crosses the goal line if it is hit. However, if the ball is deemed to be below backboard height, the ball can be subsequently deflected above this height by another player (defender or attacker), providing that this deflection does not lead to danger. Note that the \"Slap\" stroke (a sweeping motion towards the ball, where the stick is kept on or close to the ground when striking the ball) is classed as a hit, and so the first shot at goal must be below backboard height for this type of shot also.\n\nIf the first shot at goal in a short corner situation is a push, flick or scoop, in particular the ''[[drag flick (field hockey)|drag flick]]'' (which has become popular at international and national league standards), the shot is permitted to rise above the height of the backboard, as long as the shot is not deemed dangerous to any opponent. This form of shooting was developed because it is not height restricted in the same way as the first hit shot at the goal and players with good technique are able to drag-flick with as much power as many others can hit a ball.\n\n====Penalty stroke====\n{{Main|Penalty stroke}}\nA [[penalty stroke]] is awarded when a defender commits a foul in the circle (accidental or otherwise) that prevents a probable goal or commits a deliberate foul in the circle or if defenders repeatedly run from the back line too early at a penalty corner. The penalty stroke is taken by a single attacker in the circle, against the goalkeeper, from a spot 6.4&nbsp;m from goal. The ball is played only once at goal by the attacker using a push, flick or scoop stroke. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with a 15 m hit to the defenders. When a goal is scored, play is restarted in the normal way.\n\n===Dangerous play and raised balls===\nAccording to the current Rules of Hockey 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202015-interactif.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rules of Hockey |website=Fih.ch |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> issued by the FIH there are only two criteria for a dangerously played ball. The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent (what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment). The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally, if somewhat inconsistently, applied throughout the game and in all parts of the pitch: it is that a ball lifted above knee height and at an opponent who is within 5m of the ball is certainly dangerous.\n\nThe velocity of the ball is not mentioned in the rules concerning a dangerously played ball. A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalized, this is at the umpire's discretion. A jab tackle, for example, might accidentally lift the ball above knee height into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be, in the opinion of the umpire, dangerous play. In the same way a high-velocity hit at very close range into an opponent, but below knee height, could be considered to be dangerous or reckless play in the view of the umpire, especially when safer alternatives are open to the striker of the ball.\n\nA ball that has been lifted high so that it will fall among close opponents may be deemed to be potentially dangerous and play may be stopped for that reason. A lifted ball that is falling to a player in clear space may be made potentially dangerous by the actions of an opponent closing to within 5m of the receiver before the ball has been controlled to ground&nbsp;\u2013 a rule which is often only loosely applied; the distance allowed is often only what might be described as playing distance, 2\u20133&nbsp;m, and opponents tend to be permitted to close on the ball as soon as the receiver plays it: these unofficial variations are often based on the umpire's perception of the skill of the players i.e. on the level of the game, in order to maintain game flow, which umpires are in general in both Rules and Briefing instructed to do, by not penalising when it is unnecessary to do so; this is also a matter at the umpire's discretion.\n\nThe term \"falling ball\" is important in what may be termed encroaching offences. It is generally only considered an offence to encroach on an opponent receiving a lifted ball that has been lifted to above head height (although the height is not specified in rule) and is falling. So, for example, a lifted shot at the goal which is still rising as it crosses the goal line (or would have been rising as it crossed the goal line) can be legitimately followed up by any of the attacking team looking for a rebound.\n\nIn general even potentially dangerous play is not penalised if an opponent is not disadvantaged by it or, obviously, not injured by it so that he cannot continue. A personal penalty, that is a caution or a suspension, rather than a team penalty, such as a free ball or a penalty corner, may be (many would say should be or even must be, but again this is at the umpire's discretion) issued to the guilty party after an advantage allowed by the umpire has been played out in any situation where an offence has occurred, including dangerous play (but once advantage has been allowed the umpire cannot then call play back and award a team penalty).\n\nIt is not an offence to lift the ball over an opponent's stick (or body on the ground), provided that it is done with consideration for the safety of the opponent and not dangerously. For example, a skillful attacker may lift the ball over a defenders stick or prone body and run past them, however if the attacker lifts the ball into or at the defender's body, this would almost certainly be regarded as dangerous.\n\nIt is not against the rules to bounce the ball on the stick and even to run with it while doing so, as long as that does not lead to a potentially dangerous conflict with an opponent who is attempting to make a tackle. For example, two players trying to play at the ball in the air at the same time, would probably be considered a dangerous situation and it is likely that the player who first put the ball up or who was so 'carrying' it would be penalised.\n\nDangerous play rules also apply to the usage of the stick when approaching the ball, making a stroke at it (replacing what was at one time referred to as the \"sticks\" rule, which once forbade the raising of any part of the stick above the shoulder during any play. This last restriction has been removed but the stick should still not be used in a way that endangers an opponent) or attempting to tackle, (fouls relating to tripping, impeding and obstruction). The use of the stick to strike an opponent will usually be much more severely dealt with by the umpires than offences such as barging, impeding and obstruction with the body, although these are also dealt with firmly, especially when these fouls are intentional: field hockey is a non-contact game.\n\nPlayers may not play or attempt to play at the ball above their shoulders unless trying to save a shot that could go into the goal, in which case they are permitted to stop the ball or deflect it safely away. A swing, as in a hit, at a high shot at the goal (or even wide of the goal) will probably be considered dangerous play if at opponents within 5&nbsp;m and such a stroke would be contrary to rule in these circumstances anyway.\n\nWithin the English National League it is now a legal action to take a ball above shoulder height if completed using a controlled action.\n\n===Warnings and suspensions===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"110\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"The penalty cards\">\nGr\u00fcne Karte Hockey.JPG|green card (warning with 2 min suspension)\nGelbe Karte Hockey.JPG|yellow card (suspension of 5 / 10 mins depending on intensity of foul)\nRote Karte Hockey.JPG|red card (permanent suspension)\n</gallery>\nHockey uses a three-tier [[penalty card]] system of warnings and suspensions:\n[[File:Indiana (80) (5028145116).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Penn State Nittany Lions field hockey|Penn State]] player receives a green card.]]\n*When shown a '''green card''', the player may have to leave the field for two minutes, depending on national regulations, though at international standards the player has to leave the field for two minutes, but any further infractions will result in a yellow or red card.\n*A '''yellow card''' is an official suspension similar to the [[penalty box]] in ice hockey. The duration is decided by the umpire issuing the card and the player must go to a pre-defined area of the pitch as chosen by the umpires, or by the local/state/national association of that country; in this case generally it will be in the rule book where that player must go to, at the beginning of the match. Most umpires will opt for a minimum of five minutes' duration without substitution; the maximum time is at the discretion of the umpire, depending on the seriousness of the offence; for example the second yellow to the same player or the first for danger might be given ten minutes. (In some modes, including indoor, shorter periods of suspension are applied, dependent on local rules.) However it is possible to send a player off for the remainder of the match if the penalty time is longer than the time remaining in the match. Three yellows risks a red card, and a substitute will serve out whatever time imposed by the officials. Depending on national rules, if a coach is sent off a player may have to leave the field too for the time the coach is sent off.\n*A '''red card''', just like in association football, is a permanent exclusion from the rest of the game, without substitution, and usually results in the player being banned for a certain period of time or number of matches (this is governed by local playing conditions, rather than the rules of field hockey). The player must also leave the pitch and surrounding area.\nIf a coach is sent off, depending on local rules, a player may have to leave the field for the remaining length of the match.\n\nIn addition to their colours, field hockey penalty cards are often shaped differently, so they can be recognized easily. Green cards are normally triangular, yellow cards rectangular and red cards circular.\n\nUnlike football, a player may receive more than one green or yellow card. However, they cannot receive the same card for the same offence (for example two yellows for dangerous play), and the second must always be a more serious card. In the case of a second yellow card for a different breach of the rules (for example a yellow for deliberate foot, and a second later in the game for dangerous play) the temporary suspension would be expected to be of considerably longer duration than the first. However, local playing conditions may mandate that cards are awarded only progressively, and not allow any second awards.\n\nUmpires, if the free hit would have been in the attacking 23&nbsp;m area, may upgrade the free hit to a penalty corner for dissent or other misconduct after the free hit has been awarded.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe teams' object is to play the ball into their attacking circle and, from there, hit, push or flick the ball into the goal, scoring a goal. The team with more goals after 60 minutes wins the game. The playing time may be shortened, particularly when younger players are involved, or for some tournament play. If the game is played in a countdown clock, like ice hockey, a goal can only count if the ball completely crosses the goaline and into the goal ''before'' time expires, not when the ball leaves the stick in the act of shooting.\n\n{{Main|Penalty shoot-out (field hockey)}}\nIn many competitions (such as regular club competition, or in pool games in FIH international tournaments such as the Olympics or the World Cup), a tied result stands and the overall competition standings are adjusted accordingly. Since March 2013, when tie breaking is required, the official FIH Tournament Regulations mandate to no longer have extra time and go directly into a [[Penalty shoot-out (field hockey)|penalty shoot-out]] when a classification match ends in a tie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/en/news-4281-executive-board-makes-key-decisions-at-latest|title=Executive Board makes key decisions at latest meeting|accessdate=2013-08-04|date=2013-03-21}}</ref> However, many associations follow the previous procedure consisting of two periods of 7.5 minutes of \"golden goal\" extra time during which the game ends as soon as one team scores.\n\n===Rule change procedure===\nThe FIH implemented a two-year rules cycle with the 2007\u201308 edition of the rules, with the intention that the rules be reviewed on a biennial basis. The 2009 rulebook was officially released in early March 2009 (effective 1 May 2009), however the FIH published the major changes in February. The current rule book is effective from 1 January 2019.\n\nThe FIH has adopted a policy of including major changes to the rules as \"Mandatory Experiments\", showing that they must be played at international level, but are treated as experimental and will be reviewed before the next rulebook is published and either changed, approved as permanent rules, or deleted.\n\n==Local rules==\nThere are sometimes minor variations in rules from competition to competition; for instance, the duration of matches is often varied for junior competitions or for carnivals. Different national associations also have slightly differing rules on player equipment.\n\nThe new [[Euro Hockey League]] and the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]] has made major alterations to the rules to aid television viewers, such as splitting the game into four quarters, and to try to improve player behavior, such as a two-minute suspension for green cards\u2014the latter was also used in the 2010 World Cup and [[2016 Summer Olympic Games|2016 Olympics]]. In the [[United States]], the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] has its own rules for inter-collegiate competitions; high school associations similarly play to different rules, usually using the rules published by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS). This article assumes FIH rules unless otherwise stated. [[USA Field Hockey]] produces an annual summary of the differences.<ref name=\"US rule differences\">{{cite web |url=http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/48247/Rules_Comparisons_2011_v1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160208111233/http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/48247/Rules_Comparisons_2011_v1.0.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the games at the junior high level consist of four 12-minute periods, while the high-school level consists of two 30-minute periods. Many private American schools play 12-minute quarters, and some have adopted FIH rules rather than NFHS rules.\n\nPlayers are required to wear [[mouth guard]]s and shin guards in order to play the game. Also, there is a newer rule requiring certain types of sticks be used. In recent years, the NFHS rules have moved closer to FIH, but in 2011 a new rule requiring protective eyewear was introduced for the 2011 Fall season. Further clarification of NFHS's rule requiring protective eyewear states, \"effective 1 January 2019, all eye protection shall be permanently labeled with the current ASTM 2713 standard for field hockey.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfhs.org/articles/ten-rules-changes-approved-in-high-school-field-hockey/|title=NFHS Field Hockey Rule Changes 2015|date=23 February 2015|website=NFHS}}</ref> Metal 'cage style' goggles favored by US high school lacrosse and permitted in high school field hockey is prohibited under FIH rules.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Field-Hockey/Features/2011/April/22/Approved-FIH-and-USA-Field-Hockey-protective-eyewear.aspx |title= Approved FIH and USA Field Hockey protective eyewear |publisher= USA Field Hockey |date= 22 April 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n===Field hockey stick===\n{{main|Field hockey stick}}\n[[File:Splice Handle Head.jpg|thumb|Naming parts of stick]]\nEach player carries a \"stick\" that normally measures between 80\u201395&nbsp;cm (31\u201338\"); shorter or longer sticks are available. Sticks were traditionally made of wood, but are now often made also with [[fibreglass]], [[kevlar]] or [[carbon fibre]] [[composite material|composites]]. Metal is forbidden from use in field hockey sticks, due to the risk of injury from sharp edges if the stick were to break. The stick has a rounded handle, has a J-shaped hook at the bottom, and is flattened on the left side (when looking down the handle with the hook facing upwards). All sticks must be right-handed; left-handed ones are prohibited.\n\nThere was traditionally a slight curve (called the bow, or rake) from the top to bottom of the face side of the stick and another on the 'heel' edge to the top of the handle (usually made according to the angle at which the handle part was inserted into the splice of the head part of the stick), which assisted in the positioning of the stick head in relation to the ball and made striking the ball easier and more accurate.\n\nThe hook at the bottom of the stick was only recently the tight curve (Indian style) that we have nowadays. The older 'English' sticks had a longer bend, making it very hard to use the stick on the reverse. For this reason players now use the tight curved sticks.\n\nThe handle makes up about the top third of the stick. It is wrapped in a grip similar to that used on tennis racket. The grip may be made of a variety of materials, including [[chamois grip|chamois leather]], which improves grip in the wet and gives the stick a softer touch and different weighting it wrapped over a preexisting grip .\n\nIt was recently discovered that increasing the depth of the face bow made it easier to get high speeds from the dragflick and made the stroke easier to execute. At first, after this feature was introduced, the Hockey Rules Board placed a limit of 50&nbsp;mm on the maximum depth of bow over the length of the stick but experience quickly demonstrated this to be excessive. New rules now limit this curve to under 25&nbsp;mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked.\n\n===Field hockey ball===\n[[File:Balle de hockey sur gazon avec pi\u00e8ce de 5 francs.jpg|right|thumb|A field hockey ball with a 5 franc coin]]\nStandard field hockey balls are hard spherical balls, made of solid plastic (sometimes over a cork core), and are usually white, although they can be any colour as long as they contrast with the playing surface. The balls have a [[diameter]] of {{convert|71.3|-|74.8|mm|abbr=on}} and a [[mass]] of {{convert|156|-|163|g|abbr=on}}. The ball is often covered with [[Alcove (architecture)|indentations]] to reduce [[aquaplaning]] that can cause an inconsistent ball speed on wet surfaces.\n[[File:HockyBallsPuck.JPG|thumb|An assembly of field hockey balls and a roller hockey puck]]\n\n===Goalkeeping equipment===\n[[File:M060519 vit vipers-dragons 0071.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A goalkeeper makes a glove save. Equipment worn here is typical gear for a field hockey goalkeeper.]]\nThe 2007 rulebook saw major changes regarding goalkeepers. A fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guards and kickers, and like all players, they must carry a stick. Goalkeepers may use either a field player's stick or a specialised goalkeeping stick provided always the stick is of legal dimensions. Usually field hockey goalkeepers also wear extensive additional protective equipment including chest guards, padded shorts, heavily padded hand protectors, groin protectors, neck protectors and arm guards. A goalie may not cross the 23&nbsp;m line, the sole exception to this being if the goalkeeper is to take a penalty stroke at the other end of the field, when the clock is stopped. The goalkeeper can also remove their helmet for this action. While goalkeepers are allowed to use their feet and hands to clear the ball, like field players they may only use the one side of their stick. Slide tackling is permitted as long as it is with the intention of clearing the ball, not aimed at a player.\n\nIt is now also even possible for teams to have a full eleven outfield players and no goalkeeper at all. No player may wear a helmet or other goalkeeping equipment, neither will any player be able to play the ball with any other part of the body than with their stick. This may be used to offer a tactical advantage, for example, if a team is trailing with only a short time to play, or to allow for play to commence if no goalkeeper or kit is available.\n\n==Tactics==\nThe basic tactic in field hockey, as in association football and many other team games, is to outnumber the opponent in a particular area of the field at a moment in time. When in possession of the ball this temporary numerical superiority can be used to pass the ball around opponents so that they cannot effect a tackle because they cannot get within playing reach of the ball and to further use this numerical advantage to gain time and create clear space for making scoring shots on the opponent's goal. When not in possession of the ball numerical superiority is used to isolate and channel an opponent in possession and 'mark out' any passing options so that an interception or a tackle may be made to gain possession. Highly skillful players can sometimes get the better of more than one opponent and retain the ball and successfully pass or shoot but this tends to use more energy than quick early passing.\n\nEvery player has a role depending on their relationship to the ball if the team communicates throughout the play of the game. There will be players on the ball (offensively - ball carriers; defensively - pressure, support players, and movement players.\n\nThe main methods by which the ball is moved around the field by players are a) passing b) pushing the ball and running with it controlled to the front or right of the body and c) \"dribbling\"; where the player controls the ball with the stick and moves in various directions with it to elude opponents. To make a pass the ball may be propelled with a pushing stroke, where the player uses their wrists to push the stick head through the ball while the stick head is in contact with it; the \"flick\" or \"scoop\", similar to the push but with an additional arm and leg and rotational actions to lift the ball off the ground; and the \"hit\", where a swing at ball is taken and contact with it is often made very forcefully, causing the ball to be propelled at velocities in excess of {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. In order to produce a powerful hit, usually for travel over long distances or shooting at the goal, the stick is raised higher and swung with maximum power at the ball, a stroke sometimes known as a \"drive\".\n\nTackles are made by placing the stick into the path of the ball or playing the stick head or shaft directly at the ball. To increase the effectiveness of the tackle, players will often place the entire stick close to the ground horizontally, thus representing a wider barrier. To avoid the tackle, the ball carrier will either pass the ball to a teammate using any of the push, flick, or hit strokes, or attempt to maneuver or \"drag\" the ball around the tackle, trying to deceive the tackler.\n\nIn recent years, the [[penalty corner (field hockey)|penalty corner]] has gained importance as a goal scoring opportunity. Particularly with the technical development of the [[drag flick (field hockey)|drag flick]]. Tactics at penalty corners to set up time for a shot with a drag flick or a hit shot at the goal involve various complex plays, including multiple passes before deflections towards the goal is made but the most common method of shooting is the direct flick or hit at the goal.\n\nAt the highest level, field hockey is a fast moving, highly skilled game, with players using fast moves with the stick, quick accurate passing, and hard hits, in attempts to keep possession and move the ball towards the goal. Tackling with physical contact and otherwise physically obstructing players is not permitted. Some of the tactics used resemble football (soccer), but with greater ball speed.\n\nWith the 2009 changes to the rules regarding free hits in the attacking 23m area, the common tactic of hitting the ball hard into the circle was forbidden. Although at higher levels this was considered tactically risky and low-percentage at creating scoring opportunities, it was used with some effect to 'win' penalty corners by forcing the ball onto a defender's foot or to deflect high (and dangerously) off a defender's stick. The FIH felt it was a dangerous practice that could easily lead to raised deflections and injuries in the circle, which is often crowded at a free-hit situation, and outlawed it.\n\n==International competition==\n{{Main|International field hockey tournaments}}\n[[File:GB v Argentina 2016 CT (27151811463).jpg|thumb|300px|Great Britain's women's hockey players with their goal-keeper during a [[2016 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy|2016 Champions Trophy]] match.]]\n\nThe biggest two field hockey tournaments are the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] tournament, and the [[Hockey World Cup]], which is also held every 4 years. Apart from this, there is the [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] held each year for the six top-ranked teams. Field hockey has also been played at the [[Hockey at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] since 1998. Amongst the men, India lead in Olympic competition, having won 8 golds (6 successive in row). Amongst the women, Australia and Netherlands have 3 Olympic golds while Netherlands has clinched the World Cup 6 times. The [[Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament]] and [[Sultan of Johor Cup|Sultan Ibrahim Ismail Hockey Tournament]] for the junior team, both tournaments held annually in Malaysia, are becoming prominent field hockey tournaments where teams from around the world participate to win the cup.\n\n[[India men's national field hockey team|India]] and [[Pakistan men's national field hockey team|Pakistan]] dominated men's hockey until the early 1980s, winning eight Olympic golds and three of the first five world cups, respectively, but have become less prominent with the ascendancy of [[Belgium men's national field hockey team|Belgium]], [[Netherlands men's national field hockey team|the Netherlands]], [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]], [[New Zealand men's national field hockey team|New Zealand]], [[Australia men's national field hockey team|Australia]], and [[Spain men's national field hockey team|Spain]] since the late 1980s, as grass playing surfaces were replaced with artificial turf (which conferred increased importance on athleticism). Other notable men's nations include [[Argentina men's national field hockey team|Argentina]], [[England men's national field hockey team|England]] (who combine with other British \"Home Nations\" to form the [[Great Britain men's national field hockey team|Great Britain]] side at [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic events]]) and [[South Korea men's national field hockey team|South Korea]]. Despite their recent drop in international rankings, Pakistan still holds the record of four World Cup wins.\n\n[[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]], [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]] and [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|Argentina]] are the most successful national teams among women. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] was the predominant women's team before field hockey was added to Olympic events. In the early 1990s, [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]] emerged as the strongest women's country although retirement of a number of players weakened the team. [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|Argentina]] improved its play on the 2000s, heading IFH rankings in 2003, 2010 and 2013. Other prominent women's teams are [[China women's national field hockey team|China]], [[South Korea women's national field hockey team|South Korea]], [[Germany women's national field hockey team|Germany]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]].\n\n{{As of|November 2017}} Argentina's men's team and the Netherlands' women's teams lead the FIH world rankings.\n\nFor a couple of years, Belgium has emerged as a leading nation, with a World Champions title (2018), a European Champions title (2019), a silver medal at the Olympics (2016) and a lead on the FIH men's team world ranking. \n\n\nThis is a list of the major '''International field hockey tournaments''', in chronological order. Tournaments included are:\n*[[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] - held every four years.\n*[[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] - held every four years, in between the Olympics.\n*[[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] - scrapped since 2018.\n*[[Hockey Champions Challenge|Champions Challenge]] - eventually replaced by now defunct World Hockey League.\n*[[Hockey Champions Challenge II|Champions Challenge II]] - eventually replaced by now defunct World Hockey League.\n\nAlthough invitational or not open to all countries, the following are also considered international tournaments:\n*[[Hockey at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] \u2013 held every four years between members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]\n*[[Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament]] - held annually in Malaysia, an invitational tournament.\n*[[Sultan of Johor Cup|Sultan Ibrahim Ismail Hockey Tournament]] - held annually for athletes aged under-21 in Malaysia, an invitational tournament.\n\n==Variants==\n{{See also|Indoor field hockey|Bandy|Hockey 9s}}\n\n===Hockey5s===\n\nAs the name suggests, Hockey5s is a hockey variant which features five players on each team (which must include a goalkeeper). The field of play is 55&nbsp;m long and 41.70&nbsp;m wide&mdash; this is approximately half the size of a [[field hockey pitch|regular pitch]]. Few additional markings are needed as there is no penalty circle nor penalty corners; shots can be taken from anywhere on the pitch. Penalty strokes are replaced by a \"challenge\" which is like the one-on-one method used in a [[penalty shoot-out (field hockey)|penalty shoot-out]]. The duration of the match is three 12-minute periods with an interval of two minutes between periods; [[golden goal]] periods are multiple 5-minute periods. The rules are simpler and it is intended that the game is faster, creating more shots on goal with less play in midfield, and more attractive to spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,1181-123651-124958-16294-53006-custom-item,00.html|title=A History of the Rules of Hockey|date=8 February 2017|publisher=[[International Hockey Federation]]|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAn Asian qualification tournament for two places at the [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics|2014 Youth Olympic Games]] was the first time an FIH event used the Hockey5s format.

The game can be played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. Players commonly use sticks made out of wood, [[carbon fibre]], [[fibre glass]] or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic [[hockey ball]]. The length of the [[field hockey stick|hockey stick]] is based on the player's individual height, the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, taller players typically have taller sticks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.longstreth.com/How-to-Choose-a-Stick/products/1951/ |title=How to Choose a Stick |website=Longstreth.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714053805/http://www.longstreth.com/How-to-Choose-a-Stick/products/1951/ |archive-date=14 July 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The sticks have a round side and a flat side only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used, if the other side is used it results in a foul. Goalies often have a different kind of stick, however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, this is to give them more surface area to save the ball. The uniform consists of [[shin guard]]s, shoes, shorts or a skirt, a [[mouthguard]] and a jersey.\n\nToday, the game is played globally, mainly in parts of [[Western Europe]], [[South Asia]], [[Southern Africa]], Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States (primarily [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eisen|first1=Matt|title=In America, field hockey still toils in obscurity|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/10/12/in-america-field-hockey-still-toils-in-obscurity/|accessdate=4 February 2017|work=[[Yale Daily News]]|date=12 October 2006|quote=The American game is regionally centered.

If the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick, it will result in a penalty. Goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick.\n\nWhoever scores the most [[goal (sport)|goal]]s by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the competition's format. There are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league and tournament play. In college play, a seven-aside overtime period consists of a 10-minute [[golden goal]] period with seven players for each team. If a tie still remains, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses 5 players to dribble from the 25-yard line down to the circle against the opposing goalie. The player has 8 seconds to score on the goalie keeping it in bounds. The play ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one on one) or time expires. If the tie still persists more rounds are played until one team has scored.\n\nThe governing body of field hockey is the [[International Hockey Federation|International Hockey Federation (FIH), which is called the ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey'' in French]], with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIH Hockey World League|World League]], [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] and [[Junior Hockey World Cup|Junior World Cup]], with many countries running extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organizing the [[Hockey Rules Board]] and developing the [[Sport rule|rules]] for the game.\n\nA popular variant of field hockey is [[indoor field hockey]], which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Indoor hockey is a 5-a-side variant, with a field which is reduced to approximately {{convert|40|x|20|m|abbr=on}}. With many of the rules remaining the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: Players may not raise the ball unless shooting on goal, players may not hit the ball (instead using pushes to transfer the ball), and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers which the ball will rebound off.<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\">{{cite web|title=Field Hockey Rules|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202012-interactif.pdf|publisher=International Hockey Federation}}</ref> In addition, the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than an outdoor stick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/media/12236439/rules-of-indoor-hockey-2017.pdf|title=Rules of Indoor hockey 2017|last=The International Hockey Federation}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of field hockey}}\n[[File:Relief pentelic marble \"Ball Players\" 510-500 BC, NAMA 3476 102587.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Relief of 510 BC depicting [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] players of ''ker\u0113t\u00edzein'', an ancestral form of hockey or [[ground billiards]]; in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]\nThere is a depiction of a field hockey-like game in [[Ancient Greece]], dating to c.&nbsp;510&nbsp;BC, when the game may have been called {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} (''ker\u0113t\u00edzein'') because it was played with a horn ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2}}, ''k\u00e9ras'', in [[Ancient Greek]]) and a ball.<ref>Oikonomos, G. \"\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\" Archaiologikon Deltion 6 (1920\u20131921): 56 -59; there are clear depictions of the game, but the identification with the name \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd is [http://sarantakos.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/keretizein/ disputed] ([http://hellenisteukontos.blogspot.com/2010/03/ancient-greek-field-hockey.html English summary]).</ref> <!--Begin block of material sourced to Stein & Rubino.-->Researchers disagree over how to interpret this image.

By the 12th century, a team ball game called ''{{lang|frm|[[la soule]]}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|choule}}'', akin to a chaotic and sometimes long-distance version of hockey or [[rugby football]] (depending on whether sticks were used in a particular local variant), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes. <!--Being block of text cited to Stein & Rubino.-->Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Early Modern era]], such games often involved the local clergy or secular [[aristocracy]], and in some periods were limited to them by various anti-gaming edicts, or even banned altogether.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" /> Stein and Rubino, among others, ultimately trace aspects of these games both to rituals in antiquity involving [[Globus cruciger|orbs]] and [[sceptre]]s (on the aristocratic and clerical side), and to ancient [[military training exercise]]s (on the popular side); [[polo]] (essentially hockey on horseback) was devised by the [[Ancient Persia]]ns for [[cavalry]] training, based on the local proto-hockey foot game of the region.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />\n\nThe word ''hockey'' itself has no clear origin. One belief is that it was recorded in 1363 when [[Edward III]] of England issued the proclamation: \"Moreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games.\"<ref name=exp>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm |title=Rugby Football History |publisher=Rugby Football History |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> The belief is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games \"Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam\". It may be recalled at this point that ''baculum'' is the Latin for 'stick', so the reference would appear to be to a game played with sticks. The English historian and biographer [[John Strype]] did not use the word \"hockey\" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, and the word 'hockey' remains of unknown origin.\n\nThe modern game grew from English [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] in the early 19th century. The first club was in 1849 at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in south-east [[London]], but the modern rules grew out of a version played by [[Middlesex]] [[cricket]] clubs for winter game.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} [[Teddington]] Hockey Club formed the modern game by introducing the striking circle and changing the ball to a sphere from a rubber cube.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3BNMr7U8e9wC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22Hockey%22+circle+Teddington&source=bl&ots=L1sdZllpDV&sig=ztRqdfmNq6rFPyN-WLC2AzqjSGs&hl=en&ei=HEDATJfoEcK4jAegoPXRCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Hockey%22%20circle%20Teddington&f=false |first=Tracie |last=Egan |first2=Helen |last2=Connolly |title=Field Hockey: Rules, Tips, Strategy, and Safety |date=2005 |isbn=978-1-4042-0182-8 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> The Hockey Association was founded in 1886.

Synthetic pitches changed most aspects of field hockey, gaining speed. New tactics and techniques such as the [[Indian dribble]] developed, followed by new rules to take account. The switch to synthetic surfaces ended Indian and Pakistani domination because artificial turf was too expensive in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. Since the 1970s, Australia, the Netherlands, and Germany have dominated at the Olympics and World Cup stages.\n\nWomen's field hockey was first played at British universities and schools. The first club, the Molesey Ladies, was founded in 1887.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The first national association was the [[Irish Ladies Hockey Union]] in 1894,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} and though rebuffed by the Hockey Association, women's field hockey grew rapidly around the world. This led to the International Federation of Women's Hockey Association (IFWHA) in 1927, though this did not include many continental European countries where women played as sections of men's associations and were affiliated to the FIH. The IFWHA held conferences every three years, and tournaments associated with these were the primary IFWHA competitions. These tournaments were non-competitive until 1975.\n\nBy the early 1970s, there were 22 associations with women's sections in the FIH and 36 associations in the IFWHA. Discussions started about a common rule book. The FIH introduced competitive tournaments in 1974, forcing the acceptance of the principle of competitive field hockey by the IFWHA in 1973. It took until 1982 for the two bodies to merge, but this allowed the introduction of women's field hockey to the Olympic games from 1980 where, as in the men's game, The Netherlands, Germany, and Australia have been consistently strong. Argentina has emerged as a team to be reckoned with since 2000, winning the world championship in 2002 and 2010 and medals at the last three Olympics.\n\nIn the United States field hockey is played predominantly by females. However, outside North America, participation is now fairly evenly balanced between men and women. For example, in England, [[England Hockey]] reports that as of the 2008\u201309 season there were 2488 registered men's teams, 1969 women's teams, 1042 boys' teams, 966 girls' teams and 274 mixed teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=70&sectionTitle=Clubs |title=Clubs |work=EnglandHockey.co.uk |publisher=England Hockey Board |accessdate=10 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817214039/http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/page.asp?section=70&sectionTitle=Clubs |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2006 the [[Irish Hockey Association]] reported that the gender split among its players was approximately 65% female and 35% male.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,1181-180298-197516-38886-258897-custom-item,00.html |title=Ireland |work=FIHockey.org |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> In its 2008 census, [[Hockey Australia]] reported 40,534 male club players and 41,542 female.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockey.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Census/2008NationalHockeyCensusExecSummary_Board.pdf |title=National Census Executive Summary 2008 |work=Hockey.org.ca |publisher=Hockey Australia |page=2 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022091719/http://www.hockey.org.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Census/2008NationalHockeyCensusExecSummary_Board.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, in the United States of America, there are few field hockey clubs, most play taking place between high school or college sides, consisting almost entirely of women. The strength of college field hockey reflects the impact of [[Title IX]] which mandated that colleges should fund men's and women's games programmes comparably.\n\nThe game's roots in the English public girls' school mean that the game is associated in the UK with active or overachieving [[middle class]] and [[upper class]] women. For example, in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s novel set in a totalitarian London, main character [[Winston Smith]] initially dislikes Julia, the woman he comes to love, because of \"the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=George |last=Orwell |author-link=George Orwell |title=Nineteen Eighty-Four |at=Part I, Ch. 1 |origyear=1949 |date=9 November 2011 |url= http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four/Part_I/Chapter_1 |via=WikiLivres.ca |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game of field hockey is also very present in the United States. Many high schools and colleges in the U.S. offer the sport and in some areas it is even offered for youth athletes. It has been predominantly played on the East Coast, specifically the Northeast in states such as New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. It recent years however it has become increasingly present on the West Coast and in the Midwest.

In the early 1970s, \"[[artificial turf|synthetic grass]]\" fields began to be used for hockey, with the first Olympic Games on this surface being held at [[Montreal]] in [[Field hockey at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]]. Synthetic pitches are now mandatory for all international tournaments and for most national competitions. While hockey is still played on traditional grass fields at some local levels and lesser national divisions, it has been replaced by synthetic surfaces almost everywhere in the western world. There are three main types of artificial hockey surface:<ref name=\"GB Pitches\">{{cite web|url=http://greatbritainhockey.co.uk/library-media/documents/Hockey%20Pitch%20Basic%20Info.pdf|title=Hockey Pitches \u2013 Basic Information|publisher=[[Great Britain Hockey]]|format=PDF|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.8 \u00a72}}{{sfn|FIH Pitches|2014|loc=p.19 \u00a75.5.1}}\n\n*Unfilled or water based - artificial fibres that are densely packed for stabilisation, requires irrigation or watering to avoid pitch wear\n*Dressed or sand dressed - artificial fibres can be less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for part of the [[Pile (textile)|pile depth]]\n*Filled or sand filled - artificial fibres can be longer and less densely packed and sand supports the fibres for 100% of the pile depth\n\nSince the 1970s, sand-based pitches have been favoured as they dramatically speed up the game. However, in recent years there has been a massive increase in the number of \"water-based\" artificial turfs. Water-based synthetic turfs enable the ball to be transferred more quickly than on sand-based surfaces. It is this characteristic that has made them the surface of choice for international and national league competitions. Water-based surfaces are also less abrasive than sand-based surfaces and reduce the level of injury to players when they come into contact with the surface. The FIH are now{{when|date=January 2015}} proposing that new surfaces being laid should be of a hybrid variety which require less watering. This is due to the negative ecological effects of the high water requirements of water-based synthetic fields. It has also been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent countries who could afford these new pitches.<ref name=\"TOI\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/headon/entry/the-untold-story-of-how-india-lost-hockey-supremacy|title=The untold story of how India lost hockey supremacy|first=Minhaz|last=Merchant|date=15 January 2013|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rules and play==\nThe game is played between two teams of whom eleven, 10 field players and one goal keeper, are permitted to be on the pitch at any one time. The remaining players may be substituted in any combination. There is an unlimited number of times a team can sub in and out. Substitutions are permitted at any point in the game, apart from between the award and end of a penalty corner; two exceptions to this rule is for injury or suspension of the defending goalkeeper, which is not allowed when playing with a field keep, or a player can exit the field, but you must wait until after the inserter touches the ball to put somebody back in.\n\nPlayers are permitted to play the ball with the flat of the 'face side' and with the edges of the head and handle of the field hockey stick with the exception that, for reasons of safety, the ball may not be struck 'hard' with a forehand edge stroke, because of the difficulty of controlling the height and direction of the ball from that stroke.\n\nThe flat side is always on the \"natural\" side for a right-handed person swinging the stick at the ball from right to left. Left-handed sticks are rare, but available; however they are pointless as the rules forbid their use in a game. To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of the stick to the ball by 'reversing' the stick head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180\u00b0 (while a reverse edge hit would turn the stick head through approximately 90\u00b0 from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of the stick head).\n\nEdge hitting of the ball underwent a two-year \"experimental period\", twice the usual length of an \"experimental trial\" and is still a matter of some controversy within the game. Ric Charlesworth, the former Australian coach, has been a strong critic of the unrestricted use of the reverse edge hit. The 'hard' forehand edge hit was banned after similar concerns were expressed about the ability of players to direct the ball accurately, but the reverse edge hit does appear to be more predictable and controllable than its counterpart. This type of hit is now more commonly referred to as the \"forehand sweep\" where the ball is hit with the flat side or \"natural\" side of the stick and not the rounded edge.\n\nOther rules include; no foot-to-ball contact, no use of hands, no obstructing other players, no high back swing, no hacking, and no third party. If a player is dribbling the ball and either loses control and kicks the ball or another player interferes that player is not permitted to gain control and continue dribbling. The rules do not allow the person who kicked the ball to gain advantage from the kick, so the ball will automatically be passed on to the opposing team. Conversely, if no advantage is gained from kicking the ball, play should continue. Players may not obstruct another's chance of hitting the ball in any way. No shoving/using your body/stick to prevent advancement in the other team. Penalty for this is the opposing team receives the ball and if the problem continues, the player can be carded. While a player is taking a free hit or starting a corner the back swing of their hit cannot be too high for this is considered dangerous. Finally there may not be three players touching the ball at one time. Two players from opposing teams can battle for the ball, however if another player interferes it is considered third party and the ball automatically goes to the team who only had one player involved in the third party.\n\n=== The game ===\nA match ordinarily consists of two periods of 35 minutes and a halftime interval of 5 minutes. Other periods and interval may be agreed by\nboth teams except as specified in Regulations for particular competitions.<ref>http://www.fih.ch/media/12236728/fih-rules-of-hockey-2017.pdf</ref> Since 2014, some International games have four 15 minute quarters with 2 minutes break between each quarter and 15 minutes break between quarter two and three. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games Held on the Gold Coast in Brisbane, Australia the hockey games for both men and women had four 15 minute quarters.\n\nIn December 2018 the FIH announced rule changes that would make 15-minute quarters universal from January 2019. England Hockey confirmed that while no changes would be made to the domestic game mid-season, the new rules would be implemented at the start of the 2019-20 season. However, in July 2019 England Hockey announced that 17.5-minute quarters would only be implemented in elite domestic club games.<ref name=\"Application of the rules of hockey\">{{cite web | title=Application of the rules of hockey in England for the 2019-20 Season|url= https://www.englandhockey.co.uk/news.asp?itemid=46512&itemTitle=Application+of+the+rules+of+hockey+in+England+for+the+2019-20+Season.&section=22 |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game begins with a pass back from the centre-forward usually to the centre-half back from the halfway line, the opposing team can not try to tackle this play until the ball has been pushed back. The team consists of eleven players, the players are usually set up as follows: Goalkeeper, Left Fullback, Right Fullback, 3 half-backs and 4 forwards consisting of Left Wing, Left Inner, Right Inner and Right Wing.{{Contradict-inline|reason=These sum up to 10, not 11 |date=August 2019}} These positions can change and adapt throughout the course of the game depending on the attacking and defensive style of the opposition.<ref>http://kingslangleyhockey.org.au/doc/JnrPosPlayDraft5.pdf</ref>\n\n===Positions===\n[[File:UVA field hockey.jpg|thumb|A [[Virginia Cavaliers]] field player passing the ball]]\nWhen hockey positions are discussed, notions of fluidity are very common. Each team can be fielded with a maximum of 11 players and will typically arrange themselves into forwards, midfielders, and defensive players (fullbacks) with players frequently moving between these lines with the flow of play. Each team may also play with:\n\n''* a goalkeeper who wears a different color shirt and full protective equipment comprising at least headgear, leg guards and kickers; this player is referred to in the rules as a goalkeeper; or''\n\n''* Only field players; no player has goalkeeping privileges or wears a different color shirt; no player may wear protective headgear except a face mask when defending a penalty corner or stroke.''<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\"/>\n\n====Formations====\nAs hockey has a very dynamic style of play, it is difficult to simplify positions to the static [[Formation (association football)|formation]]s which are common in [[association football|football]]. Although positions will typically be categorized as either fullback, halfback, midfield/inner or striker, it is important for players to have an understanding of every position on the field. For example, it is not uncommon to see a halfback overlap and end up in either attacking position, with the midfield and strikers being responsible for re-adjusting to fill the space they left. Movement between lines like this is particularly common across all positions.\n\nThis fluid Australian culture{{Explain |date=August 2019}} of hockey has been responsible for developing an international trend towards players occupying spaces on the field, not having assigned positions. Although they may have particular spaces on the field which they are more comfortable and effective as players, they are responsible for occupying the space nearest them. This fluid approach to hockey and player movement has made it easy for teams to transition between formations such as; ''\"3 at the back\"'', ''\"2 centre halves\"'', ''\"5 at the front\",'' and more.\n\n====Goalkeepers====\n[[File:M060519 vit vipers-dragons 0071.JPG|thumb|Goalkeeper during game]]\nWhen the ball is inside the circle they are defending and they have their stick in their hand, goalkeepers wearing full protective equipment are permitted to use their stick, feet, kickers or leg guards to propel the ball and to use their stick, feet, kickers, leg guards or any other part of their body to stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. Similarly, field players are permitted to use their stick. They are not allowed to use their feet and legs to propel the ball, stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. However, neither goalkeepers, or players with goalkeeping privileges are permitted to conduct themselves in a manner which is dangerous to other players by taking advantage of the protective equipment they wear.<ref name=\"International Hockey Federation\"/>\n\nNeither goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges may lie on the ball, however, they are permitted to use arms, hands and any other part of their body to push the ball away. Lying on the ball deliberately will result in a penalty stroke, whereas if an umpire deems a goalkeeper has lain on the ball accidentally (e.g. it gets stuck in their protective equipment), a penalty corner is awarded.\n\n''* The action above is permitted only as part of a goal saving action or to move the ball away from the possibility of a goal scoring action by opponents. It does not permit a goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges to propel the ball forcefully with arms, hands or body so that it travels a long distance''\n\nWhen the ball is outside the circle they are defending, goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges are only permitted to play the ball with their stick. Further, a goalkeeper, or player with goalkeeping privileges who is wearing a helmet, must not take part in the match outside the 23m area they are defending, except when taking a penalty stroke. A goalkeeper must wear protective headgear at all times, except when taking a penalty stroke.\n\n===General play===\nFor the purposes of the rules, all players on the team in possession of the ball are attackers, and those on the team without the ball are defenders, yet throughout the game being played you are always \"defending\" your goal and \"attacking\" the opposite goal.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/field-hockey-elizabeth-anders/1101100144 |title=No Results Page &#124; Barnes & Noble |website=Barnesandnoble.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brenda256.jpg|thumb|right|Sideline hit in a match Standard Athletic Club vs. British School of Paris (1996)]]\nThe match is officiated by two field [[umpire (field hockey)|umpires]]. Traditionally each umpire generally controls half of the field, divided roughly diagonally. These umpires are often assisted by a technical bench including a timekeeper and record keeper.\n\nPrior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or whether to start with the ball. Since 2017 the game consists of four periods of 15 minutes with a 2-minute break after every period, and a 15-minute intermission at half time before changing ends. At the start of each period, as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field. All players must start in their defensive half (apart from the player making the pass), but the ball may be played in any direction along the floor. Each team starts with the ball in one half, and the team that conceded the goal has possession for the restart. Teams trade sides at halftime.\n\nField players may only play the ball with the face of the stick. If the back side of the stick is used, it is a penalty and the other team will get the ball back. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or the other person's stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalized if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body to push a defender out of the way.\n\nField players may not play the ball with their feet, but if the ball accidentally hits the feet, and the player gains no benefit from the contact, then the contact is not penalized. Although there has been a change in the wording of this rule from 1 January 2007, the current FIH umpires' briefing instructs umpires not to change the way they interpret this rule.<ref name=\"Umpires' briefing\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |title=Title of presentation |publisher=Fihockey.org |accessdate=2014-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202000007/http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1181-180262-197480-115788-0-file,00.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nObstruction typically occurs in three circumstances&nbsp;\u2013 when a defender comes between the player with possession and the ball in order to prevent them tackling; when a defender's stick comes between the attacker's stick and the ball or makes contact with the attacker's stick or body; and also when blocking the opposition's attempt to tackle a teammate with the ball (called ''third party obstruction'').\n\nWhen the ball passes completely over the sidelines (on the sideline is still in), it is returned to play with a sideline hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. The ball must be placed on the sideline, with the hit taken from as near the place the ball went out of play as possible. If it crosses the back line after last touched by an attacker, a {{convert|15|m|yd|abbr=on}} hit is awarded. A 15&nbsp;m hit is also awarded for offences committed by the attacking side within 15&nbsp;m of the end of the pitch they are attacking.\n\n===Set plays===\nSet plays are often utilized for specific situations such as a penalty corner or free hit. For instance, many teams have penalty corner variations that they can use to beat the defensive team. The coach may have plays that sends the ball between two defenders and lets the player attack the opposing team's goal. There are no set plays unless your team has them.\n\n====Free hits====\nFree hits are awarded when offences are committed outside the scoring circles (the term 'free hit' is standard usage but the ball need not be hit). The ball may be hit, pushed or lifted in any direction by the team offended against. The ball can be lifted from a free hit but not by hitting, you must flick or scoop to lift from a free hit. (In previous versions of the rules, hits in the area outside the circle in open play have been permitted but lifting one direction from a free hit was prohibited). Opponents must move {{convert|5|m|yd|abbr=on}}<!-- 5 m is the distance used in most of the world, only US high school rules mandate 7 yards. Please don't change--> from the ball when a free hit is awarded. A free hit must be taken from within playing distance of the place of the offence for which it was awarded and the ball must be stationary when the free hit is taken.\n\nAs mentioned above, a 15&nbsp;m hit is awarded if an attacking player commits a foul forward of that line, or if the ball passes over the back line off an attacker. These free hits are taken in-line with where the foul was committed (taking a line parallel with the sideline between where the offence was committed, or the ball went out of play). When an attacking free hit is awarded within 5&nbsp;m of the circle everyone including the person taking the penalty must be five metres from the circle and everyone apart from the person taking the free hit must be five metres away from the ball. When taking an attacking free hit, the ball may not be hit straight into the circle if you are within your attacking 23 meter area (25 yard area). It must travel 5 meters before going in.\n\n====2009 experimental changes====\nIn February 2009 the FIH introduced, as a \"Mandatory Experiment\" for international competition, an updated version of the free-hit rule. The changes allows a player taking a free hit to pass the ball to themselves. Importantly, this is not a \"play on\" situation, but to the untrained eye it may appear to be. The player must play the ball any distance in two separate motions, before continuing as if it were a play-on situation. They may raise an aerial or overhead immediately as the second action, or any other stroke permitted by the rules of field hockey. At high-school level, this is called a self pass and was adopted in Pennsylvania in 2010 as a legal technique for putting the ball in play.\n\nAlso, all players (from both teams) must be at least 5&nbsp;m from any free hit awarded to the attack within the 23&nbsp;m area. The ball may not travel directly into the circle from a free hit to the attack within the 23 m area without first being touched by another player or being dribbled at least 5 m by a player making a \"self-pass\". These experimental rules apply to all free-hit situations, including sideline and corner hits. National associations may also choose to introduce these rules for their domestic competitions.\n\n====Attacking-free hit from quarter line====\nA free hit from the quarter line is awarded to the attacking team if the ball goes over the back-line after last being touched by a defender, provided they do not play it over the back-line deliberately, in which case a penalty corner is awarded. This free hit is played by the attacking team from a spot on the quarter line closest to where the ball went out of play. All the parameters of an attacking free hit within the attacking quarter of the playing surface apply.\n\n====Penalty corner====\nThe [[Penalty corner|short or penalty corner]] is awarded: [[File:Fieldhockey shortcorner defense.jpg|thumb|right|A group of five defenders, including the goalkeeper, prepare on the back line for a short corner.]]\n# for an offence by a defender in the circle which does not prevent the probable scoring of a goal;\n# for an intentional offence in the circle by a defender against an opponent who does not have possession of the ball or an opportunity to play the ball;\n# for an intentional offence by a defender outside the circle but within the 23-metre area they are defending;\n# for intentionally playing the ball over the back line by a defender;\n# when the ball becomes lodged in a player's clothing or equipment while in the circle they are defending.\n\nShort corners begin with five defenders (usually including the keeper) positioned behind the back line and the ball placed at least 10 yards from the nearest goal post.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Field Hockey Rules|url=http://lower.usm.k12.wi.us/special/phy_ed/basic_fh_rules.htm|archivedate = 2014-07-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729122657/http://lower.usm.k12.wi.us/special/phy_ed/basic_fh_rules.htm}}</ref> All other players in the defending team must be beyond the centre line, that is not in their 'own' half of the pitch, until the ball is in play. Attacking players begin the play standing outside the scoring circle, except for one attacker who starts the corner by playing the ball from a mark 10&nbsp;m either side of the goal (the circle has a 14.63&nbsp;m radius). This player puts the ball into play by pushing or hitting the ball to the other attackers outside the circle; the ball must pass outside the circle and then put back into the circle before the attackers may make a shot at the goal from which a goal can be scored. FIH rules do not forbid a shot at goal before the ball leaves the circle after being 'inserted', nor is a shot at the goal from outside the circle prohibited, but a goal cannot be scored at all if the ball has not gone out of the circle and cannot be scored from a shot from outside the circle if it is not again played by an attacking player before it enters the goal.\n\nFor safety reasons, the first shot of a penalty corner must not exceed 460&nbsp;mm high (the height of the \"backboard\" of the goal) at the point it crosses the goal line if it is hit. However, if the ball is deemed to be below backboard height, the ball can be subsequently deflected above this height by another player (defender or attacker), providing that this deflection does not lead to danger. Note that the \"Slap\" stroke (a sweeping motion towards the ball, where the stick is kept on or close to the ground when striking the ball) is classed as a hit, and so the first shot at goal must be below backboard height for this type of shot also.\n\nIf the first shot at goal in a short corner situation is a push, flick or scoop, in particular the ''[[drag flick (field hockey)|drag flick]]'' (which has become popular at international and national league standards), the shot is permitted to rise above the height of the backboard, as long as the shot is not deemed dangerous to any opponent. This form of shooting was developed because it is not height restricted in the same way as the first hit shot at the goal and players with good technique are able to drag-flick with as much power as many others can hit a ball.\n\n====Penalty stroke====\n{{Main|Penalty stroke}}\nA [[penalty stroke]] is awarded when a defender commits a foul in the circle (accidental or otherwise) that prevents a probable goal or commits a deliberate foul in the circle or if defenders repeatedly run from the back line too early at a penalty corner. The penalty stroke is taken by a single attacker in the circle, against the goalkeeper, from a spot 6.4&nbsp;m from goal. The ball is played only once at goal by the attacker using a push, flick or scoop stroke. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with a 15 m hit to the defenders. When a goal is scored, play is restarted in the normal way.\n\n===Dangerous play and raised balls===\nAccording to the current Rules of Hockey 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202015-interactif.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rules of Hockey |website=Fih.ch |accessdate=2016-07-15}}</ref> issued by the FIH there are only two criteria for a dangerously played ball. The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent (what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment). The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally, if somewhat inconsistently, applied throughout the game and in all parts of the pitch: it is that a ball lifted above knee height and at an opponent who is within 5m of the ball is certainly dangerous.\n\nThe velocity of the ball is not mentioned in the rules concerning a dangerously played ball. A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalized, this is at the umpire's discretion. A jab tackle, for example, might accidentally lift the ball above knee height into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be, in the opinion of the umpire, dangerous play. In the same way a high-velocity hit at very close range into an opponent, but below knee height, could be considered to be dangerous or reckless play in the view of the umpire, especially when safer alternatives are open to the striker of the ball.\n\nA ball that has been lifted high so that it will fall among close opponents may be deemed to be potentially dangerous and play may be stopped for that reason. A lifted ball that is falling to a player in clear space may be made potentially dangerous by the actions of an opponent closing to within 5m of the receiver before the ball has been controlled to ground&nbsp;\u2013 a rule which is often only loosely applied; the distance allowed is often only what might be described as playing distance, 2\u20133&nbsp;m, and opponents tend to be permitted to close on the ball as soon as the receiver plays it: these unofficial variations are often based on the umpire's perception of the skill of the players i.e. on the level of the game, in order to maintain game flow, which umpires are in general in both Rules and Briefing instructed to do, by not penalising when it is unnecessary to do so; this is also a matter at the umpire's discretion.\n\nThe term \"falling ball\" is important in what may be termed encroaching offences. It is generally only considered an offence to encroach on an opponent receiving a lifted ball that has been lifted to above head height (although the height is not specified in rule) and is falling. So, for example, a lifted shot at the goal which is still rising as it crosses the goal line (or would have been rising as it crossed the goal line) can be legitimately followed up by any of the attacking team looking for a rebound.\n\nIn general even potentially dangerous play is not penalised if an opponent is not disadvantaged by it or, obviously, not injured by it so that he cannot continue. A personal penalty, that is a caution or a suspension, rather than a team penalty, such as a free ball or a penalty corner, may be (many would say should be or even must be, but again this is at the umpire's discretion) issued to the guilty party after an advantage allowed by the umpire has been played out in any situation where an offence has occurred, including dangerous play (but once advantage has been allowed the umpire cannot then call play back and award a team penalty).\n\nIt is not an offence to lift the ball over an opponent's stick (or body on the ground), provided that it is done with consideration for the safety of the opponent and not dangerously. For example, a skillful attacker may lift the ball over a defenders stick or prone body and run past them, however if the attacker lifts the ball into or at the defender's body, this would almost certainly be regarded as dangerous.\n\nIt is not against the rules to bounce the ball on the stick and even to run with it while doing so, as long as that does not lead to a potentially dangerous conflict with an opponent who is attempting to make a tackle. For example, two players trying to play at the ball in the air at the same time, would probably be considered a dangerous situation and it is likely that the player who first put the ball up or who was so 'carrying' it would be penalised.\n\nDangerous play rules also apply to the usage of the stick when approaching the ball, making a stroke at it (replacing what was at one time referred to as the \"sticks\" rule, which once forbade the raising of any part of the stick above the shoulder during any play. This last restriction has been removed but the stick should still not be used in a way that endangers an opponent) or attempting to tackle, (fouls relating to tripping, impeding and obstruction). The use of the stick to strike an opponent will usually be much more severely dealt with by the umpires than offences such as barging, impeding and obstruction with the body, although these are also dealt with firmly, especially when these fouls are intentional: field hockey is a non-contact game.\n\nPlayers may not play or attempt to play at the ball above their shoulders unless trying to save a shot that could go into the goal, in which case they are permitted to stop the ball or deflect it safely away. A swing, as in a hit, at a high shot at the goal (or even wide of the goal) will probably be considered dangerous play if at opponents within 5&nbsp;m and such a stroke would be contrary to rule in these circumstances anyway.\n\nWithin the English National League it is now a legal action to take a ball above shoulder height if completed using a controlled action.\n\n===Warnings and suspensions===\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"110\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"The penalty cards\">\nGr\u00fcne Karte Hockey.JPG|green card (warning with 2 min suspension)\nGelbe Karte Hockey.JPG|yellow card (suspension of 5 / 10 mins depending on intensity of foul)\nRote Karte Hockey.JPG|red card (permanent suspension)\n</gallery>\nHockey uses a three-tier [[penalty card]] system of warnings and suspensions:\n[[File:Indiana (80) (5028145116).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Penn State Nittany Lions field hockey|Penn State]] player receives a green card.]]\n*When shown a '''green card''', the player may have to leave the field for two minutes, depending on national regulations, though at international standards the player has to leave the field for two minutes, but any further infractions will result in a yellow or red card.\n*A '''yellow card''' is an official suspension similar to the [[penalty box]] in ice hockey. The duration is decided by the umpire issuing the card and the player must go to a pre-defined area of the pitch as chosen by the umpires, or by the local/state/national association of that country; in this case generally it will be in the rule book where that player must go to, at the beginning of the match. Most umpires will opt for a minimum of five minutes' duration without substitution; the maximum time is at the discretion of the umpire, depending on the seriousness of the offence; for example the second yellow to the same player or the first for danger might be given ten minutes. (In some modes, including indoor, shorter periods of suspension are applied, dependent on local rules.) However it is possible to send a player off for the remainder of the match if the penalty time is longer than the time remaining in the match. Three yellows risks a red card, and a substitute will serve out whatever time imposed by the officials. Depending on national rules, if a coach is sent off a player may have to leave the field too for the time the coach is sent off.\n*A '''red card''', just like in association football, is a permanent exclusion from the rest of the game, without substitution, and usually results in the player being banned for a certain period of time or number of matches (this is governed by local playing conditions, rather than the rules of field hockey). The player must also leave the pitch and surrounding area.\nIf a coach is sent off, depending on local rules, a player may have to leave the field for the remaining length of the match.\n\nIn addition to their colours, field hockey penalty cards are often shaped differently, so they can be recognized easily. Green cards are normally triangular, yellow cards rectangular and red cards circular.\n\nUnlike football, a player may receive more than one green or yellow card. However, they cannot receive the same card for the same offence (for example two yellows for dangerous play), and the second must always be a more serious card. In the case of a second yellow card for a different breach of the rules (for example a yellow for deliberate foot, and a second later in the game for dangerous play) the temporary suspension would be expected to be of considerably longer duration than the first. However, local playing conditions may mandate that cards are awarded only progressively, and not allow any second awards.\n\nUmpires, if the free hit would have been in the attacking 23&nbsp;m area, may upgrade the free hit to a penalty corner for dissent or other misconduct after the free hit has been awarded.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe teams' object is to play the ball into their attacking circle and, from there, hit, push or flick the ball into the goal, scoring a goal. The team with more goals after 60 minutes wins the game. The playing time may be shortened, particularly when younger players are involved, or for some tournament play. If the game is played in a countdown clock, like ice hockey, a goal can only count if the ball completely crosses the goaline and into the goal ''before'' time expires, not when the ball leaves the stick in the act of shooting.\n\n{{Main|Penalty shoot-out (field hockey)}}\nIn many competitions (such as regular club competition, or in pool games in FIH international tournaments such as the Olympics or the World Cup), a tied result stands and the overall competition standings are adjusted accordingly. Since March 2013, when tie breaking is required, the official FIH Tournament Regulations mandate to no longer have extra time and go directly into a [[Penalty shoot-out (field hockey)|penalty shoot-out]] when a classification match ends in a tie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/en/news-4281-executive-board-makes-key-decisions-at-latest|title=Executive Board makes key decisions at latest meeting|accessdate=2013-08-04|date=2013-03-21}}</ref> However, many associations follow the previous procedure consisting of two periods of 7.5 minutes of \"golden goal\" extra time during which the game ends as soon as one team scores.\n\n===Rule change procedure===\nThe FIH implemented a two-year rules cycle with the 2007\u201308 edition of the rules, with the intention that the rules be reviewed on a biennial basis. The 2009 rulebook was officially released in early March 2009 (effective 1 May 2009), however the FIH published the major changes in February. The current rule book is effective from 1 January 2019.\n\nThe FIH has adopted a policy of including major changes to the rules as \"Mandatory Experiments\", showing that they must be played at international level, but are treated as experimental and will be reviewed before the next rulebook is published and either changed, approved as permanent rules, or deleted.\n\n==Local rules==\nThere are sometimes minor variations in rules from competition to competition; for instance, the duration of matches is often varied for junior competitions or for carnivals. Different national associations also have slightly differing rules on player equipment.\n\nThe new [[Euro Hockey League]] and the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]] has made major alterations to the rules to aid television viewers, such as splitting the game into four quarters, and to try to improve player behavior, such as a two-minute suspension for green cards\u2014the latter was also used in the 2010 World Cup and [[2016 Summer Olympic Games|2016 Olympics]]. In the [[United States]], the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] has its own rules for inter-collegiate competitions; high school associations similarly play to different rules, usually using the rules published by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS). This article assumes FIH rules unless otherwise stated. [[USA Field Hockey]] produces an annual summary of the differences.<ref name=\"US rule differences\">{{cite web |url=http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/48247/Rules_Comparisons_2011_v1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160208111233/http://assets.teamusa.org/assets/documents/attached_file/filename/48247/Rules_Comparisons_2011_v1.0.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the games at the junior high level consist of four 12-minute periods, while the high-school level consists of two 30-minute periods. Many private American schools play 12-minute quarters, and some have adopted FIH rules rather than NFHS rules.\n\nPlayers are required to wear [[mouth guard]]s and shin guards in order to play the game. Also, there is a newer rule requiring certain types of sticks be used. In recent years, the NFHS rules have moved closer to FIH, but in 2011 a new rule requiring protective eyewear was introduced for the 2011 Fall season.

Sticks were traditionally made of wood, but are now often made also with [[fibreglass]], [[kevlar]] or [[carbon fibre]] [[composite material|composites]]. Metal is forbidden from use in field hockey sticks, due to the risk of injury from sharp edges if the stick were to break. The stick has a rounded handle, has a J-shaped hook at the bottom, and is flattened on the left side (when looking down the handle with the hook facing upwards). All sticks must be right-handed; left-handed ones are prohibited.\n\nThere was traditionally a slight curve (called the bow, or rake) from the top to bottom of the face side of the stick and another on the 'heel' edge to the top of the handle (usually made according to the angle at which the handle part was inserted into the splice of the head part of the stick), which assisted in the positioning of the stick head in relation to the ball and made striking the ball easier and more accurate.\n\nThe hook at the bottom of the stick was only recently the tight curve (Indian style) that we have nowadays. The older 'English' sticks had a longer bend, making it very hard to use the stick on the reverse. For this reason players now use the tight curved sticks.\n\nThe handle makes up about the top third of the stick. It is wrapped in a grip similar to that used on tennis racket. The grip may be made of a variety of materials, including [[chamois grip|chamois leather]], which improves grip in the wet and gives the stick a softer touch and different weighting it wrapped over a preexisting grip .\n\nIt was recently discovered that increasing the depth of the face bow made it easier to get high speeds from the dragflick and made the stroke easier to execute. At first, after this feature was introduced, the Hockey Rules Board placed a limit of 50&nbsp;mm on the maximum depth of bow over the length of the stick but experience quickly demonstrated this to be excessive. New rules now limit this curve to under 25&nbsp;mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked.\n\n===Field hockey ball===\n[[File:Balle de hockey sur gazon avec pi\u00e8ce de 5 francs.jpg|right|thumb|A field hockey ball with a 5 franc coin]]\nStandard field hockey balls are hard spherical balls, made of solid plastic (sometimes over a cork core), and are usually white, although they can be any colour as long as they contrast with the playing surface. The balls have a [[diameter]] of {{convert|71.3|-|74.8|mm|abbr=on}} and a [[mass]] of {{convert|156|-|163|g|abbr=on}}. The ball is often covered with [[Alcove (architecture)|indentations]] to reduce [[aquaplaning]] that can cause an inconsistent ball speed on wet surfaces.\n[[File:HockyBallsPuck.JPG|thumb|An assembly of field hockey balls and a roller hockey puck]]\n\n===Goalkeeping equipment===\n[[File:M060519 vit vipers-dragons 0071.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A goalkeeper makes a glove save. Equipment worn here is typical gear for a field hockey goalkeeper.]]\nThe 2007 rulebook saw major changes regarding goalkeepers. A fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guards and kickers, and like all players, they must carry a stick. Goalkeepers may use either a field player's stick or a specialised goalkeeping stick provided always the stick is of legal dimensions. Usually field hockey goalkeepers also wear extensive additional protective equipment including chest guards, padded shorts, heavily padded hand protectors, groin protectors, neck protectors and arm guards. A goalie may not cross the 23&nbsp;m line, the sole exception to this being if the goalkeeper is to take a penalty stroke at the other end of the field, when the clock is stopped. The goalkeeper can also remove their helmet for this action. While goalkeepers are allowed to use their feet and hands to clear the ball, like field players they may only use the one side of their stick. Slide tackling is permitted as long as it is with the intention of clearing the ball, not aimed at a player.\n\nIt is now also even possible for teams to have a full eleven outfield players and no goalkeeper at all. No player may wear a helmet or other goalkeeping equipment, neither will any player be able to play the ball with any other part of the body than with their stick. This may be used to offer a tactical advantage, for example, if a team is trailing with only a short time to play, or to allow for play to commence if no goalkeeper or kit is available.\n\n==Tactics==\nThe basic tactic in field hockey, as in association football and many other team games, is to outnumber the opponent in a particular area of the field at a moment in time. When in possession of the ball this temporary numerical superiority can be used to pass the ball around opponents so that they cannot effect a tackle because they cannot get within playing reach of the ball and to further use this numerical advantage to gain time and create clear space for making scoring shots on the opponent's goal. When not in possession of the ball numerical superiority is used to isolate and channel an opponent in possession and 'mark out' any passing options so that an interception or a tackle may be made to gain possession. Highly skillful players can sometimes get the better of more than one opponent and retain the ball and successfully pass or shoot but this tends to use more energy than quick early passing.\n\nEvery player has a role depending on their relationship to the ball if the team communicates throughout the play of the game. There will be players on the ball (offensively - ball carriers; defensively - pressure, support players, and movement players.\n\nThe main methods by which the ball is moved around the field by players are a) passing b) pushing the ball and running with it controlled to the front or right of the body and c) \"dribbling\"; where the player controls the ball with the stick and moves in various directions with it to elude opponents. To make a pass the ball may be propelled with a pushing stroke, where the player uses their wrists to push the stick head through the ball while the stick head is in contact with it; the \"flick\" or \"scoop\", similar to the push but with an additional arm and leg and rotational actions to lift the ball off the ground; and the \"hit\", where a swing at ball is taken and contact with it is often made very forcefully, causing the ball to be propelled at velocities in excess of {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. In order to produce a powerful hit, usually for travel over long distances or shooting at the goal, the stick is raised higher and swung with maximum power at the ball, a stroke sometimes known as a \"drive\".\n\nTackles are made by placing the stick into the path of the ball or playing the stick head or shaft directly at the ball. To increase the effectiveness of the tackle, players will often place the entire stick close to the ground horizontally, thus representing a wider barrier. To avoid the tackle, the ball carrier will either pass the ball to a teammate using any of the push, flick, or hit strokes, or attempt to maneuver or \"drag\" the ball around the tackle, trying to deceive the tackler.\n\nIn recent years, the [[penalty corner (field hockey)|penalty corner]] has gained importance as a goal scoring opportunity. Particularly with the technical development of the [[drag flick (field hockey)|drag flick]]. Tactics at penalty corners to set up time for a shot with a drag flick or a hit shot at the goal involve various complex plays, including multiple passes before deflections towards the goal is made but the most common method of shooting is the direct flick or hit at the goal.\n\nAt the highest level, field hockey is a fast moving, highly skilled game, with players using fast moves with the stick, quick accurate passing, and hard hits, in attempts to keep possession and move the ball towards the goal. Tackling with physical contact and otherwise physically obstructing players is not permitted. Some of the tactics used resemble football (soccer), but with greater ball speed.\n\nWith the 2009 changes to the rules regarding free hits in the attacking 23m area, the common tactic of hitting the ball hard into the circle was forbidden. Although at higher levels this was considered tactically risky and low-percentage at creating scoring opportunities, it was used with some effect to 'win' penalty corners by forcing the ball onto a defender's foot or to deflect high (and dangerously) off a defender's stick. The FIH felt it was a dangerous practice that could easily lead to raised deflections and injuries in the circle, which is often crowded at a free-hit situation, and outlawed it.\n\n==International competition==\n{{Main|International field hockey tournaments}}\n[[File:GB v Argentina 2016 CT (27151811463).jpg|thumb|300px|Great Britain's women's hockey players with their goal-keeper during a [[2016 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy|2016 Champions Trophy]] match.]]\n\nThe biggest two field hockey tournaments are the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] tournament, and the [[Hockey World Cup]], which is also held every 4 years. Apart from this, there is the [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] held each year for the six top-ranked teams. Field hockey has also been played at the [[Hockey at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] since 1998. Amongst the men, India lead in Olympic competition, having won 8 golds (6 successive in row). Amongst the women, Australia and Netherlands have 3 Olympic golds while Netherlands has clinched the World Cup 6 times. The [[Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament]] and [[Sultan of Johor Cup|Sultan Ibrahim Ismail Hockey Tournament]] for the junior team, both tournaments held annually in Malaysia, are becoming prominent field hockey tournaments where teams from around the world participate to win the cup.\n\n[[India men's national field hockey team|India]] and [[Pakistan men's national field hockey team|Pakistan]] dominated men's hockey until the early 1980s, winning eight Olympic golds and three of the first five world cups, respectively, but have become less prominent with the ascendancy of [[Belgium men's national field hockey team|Belgium]], [[Netherlands men's national field hockey team|the Netherlands]], [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]], [[New Zealand men's national field hockey team|New Zealand]], [[Australia men's national field hockey team|Australia]], and [[Spain men's national field hockey team|Spain]] since the late 1980s, as grass playing surfaces were replaced with artificial turf (which conferred increased importance on athleticism). Other notable men's nations include [[Argentina men's national field hockey team|Argentina]], [[England men's national field hockey team|England]] (who combine with other British \"Home Nations\" to form the [[Great Britain men's national field hockey team|Great Britain]] side at [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic events]]) and [[South Korea men's national field hockey team|South Korea]]. Despite their recent drop in international rankings, Pakistan still holds the record of four World Cup wins.\n\n[[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]], [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]] and [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|Argentina]] are the most successful national teams among women. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] was the predominant women's team before field hockey was added to Olympic events. In the early 1990s, [[Australia women's national field hockey team|Australia]] emerged as the strongest women's country although retirement of a number of players weakened the team. [[Argentina women's national field hockey team|Argentina]] improved its play on the 2000s, heading IFH rankings in 2003, 2010 and 2013. Other prominent women's teams are [[China women's national field hockey team|China]], [[South Korea women's national field hockey team|South Korea]], [[Germany women's national field hockey team|Germany]] and [[India women's national field hockey team|India]].\n\n{{As of|November 2017}} Argentina's men's team and the Netherlands' women's teams lead the FIH world rankings.\n\nFor a couple of years, Belgium has emerged as a leading nation, with a World Champions title (2018), a European Champions title (2019), a silver medal at the Olympics (2016) and a lead on the FIH men's team world ranking. \n\n\nThis is a list of the major '''International field hockey tournaments''', in chronological order. Tournaments included are:\n*[[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] - held every four years.\n*[[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] - held every four years, in between the Olympics.\n*[[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] - scrapped since 2018.\n*[[Hockey Champions Challenge|Champions Challenge]] - eventually replaced by now defunct World Hockey League.\n*[[Hockey Champions Challenge II|Champions Challenge II]] - eventually replaced by now defunct World Hockey League.\n\nAlthough invitational or not open to all countries, the following are also considered international tournaments:\n*[[Hockey at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] \u2013 held every four years between members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]\n*[[Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament]] - held annually in Malaysia, an invitational tournament.\n*[[Sultan of Johor Cup|Sultan Ibrahim Ismail Hockey Tournament]] - held annually for athletes aged under-21 in Malaysia, an invitational tournament.\n\n==Variants==\n{{See also|Indoor field hockey|Bandy|Hockey 9s}}\n\n===Hockey5s===\n\nAs the name suggests, Hockey5s is a hockey variant which features five players on each team (which must include a goalkeeper). The field of play is 55&nbsp;m long and 41.70&nbsp;m wide&mdash; this is approximately half the size of a [[field hockey pitch|regular pitch]]. Few additional markings are needed as there is no penalty circle nor penalty corners; shots can be taken from anywhere on the pitch. Penalty strokes are replaced by a \"challenge\" which is like the one-on-one method used in a [[penalty shoot-out (field hockey)|penalty shoot-out]]. The duration of the match is three 12-minute periods with an interval of two minutes between periods; [[golden goal]] periods are multiple 5-minute periods. The rules are simpler and it is intended that the game is faster, creating more shots on goal with less play in midfield, and more attractive to spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fihockey.org/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,1181-123651-124958-16294-53006-custom-item,00.html|title=A History of the Rules of Hockey|date=8 February 2017|publisher=[[International Hockey Federation]]|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAn Asian qualification tournament for two places at the [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics|2014 Youth Olympic Games]] was the first time an FIH event used the Hockey5s format.
