They are part of a larger group of ethno-linguistically related [[Luo peoples]] who inhabit an area ranging from [[South Sudan]], South-Western [[Ethiopia]], Northern and Eastern [[Uganda]], South-Western [[Kenya]] and North-Eastern [[Tanzania]].\n\nThe Luo are the fourth largest ethnic group (10.65%) in Kenya, after the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] (17.13%), the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] (14.35%) and the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] (13.37%).<ref name =Census2019/> The Luo and the Kikuyu inherited the bulk of political power in the first years following Kenya's independence in 1963. The Luo population in Kenya was estimated to be 2,185,000 in 1994 and 3.4 million in 2010 according to Government census. However the figure was disputed by many Luos as not scientific since a significant portion of people previously considered as Luo were now counted as Suba people (of [[Suba people (Kenya)|Kenya]] and [[Suba people (Tanzania)|Tanzania]]). The [[Suba people (Kenya)|Subas]] eventually numbered 300,000 but most are completely assimilated Luos by culture, name, language and political orientation and have more or less the same outlook of life. This is a result of heavy intermarriage and interaction. The Luos also feel that their overall population has always been downscaled by successive Kenyan regime census in an attempt to mute the strong Luo political voice. Sample census conducted by experts estimate the total Kenyan Luo population to be currently at around 5 million. The '''Tanzanian''' Luo population was estimated at 1.1 million in 2001 and 1.9 million in 2010.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{Cite book|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=luo|title = Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth Edition|last = Gordon, Jr.|first = Raymond G.

Outside [[Luoland]], the Luo comprise a significant fraction of East Africa's intellectual and skilled labour force in various professions. Others members work in eastern Africa as tenant fishermen, small-scale farmers, and urban workers.\n\nThey speak the [[Luo language|Dholuo language]], which belongs to the [[Western Nilotic]] branch of the [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]] language family spoken by other Luo-speaking peoples, such as the [[Langi people|Lango]], [[Acholi people|Acholi]], [[Adhola people|Adhola]] and [[Alur people|Alur]] (all of Uganda and parts of South Sudan and Eastern Congo). The four waves of Luo migration were chiefly from the four Luo-speaking groups (Lwoo), especially Acholi and Padhola. [[Dholuo]], spoken in Kenya, is considered to be proper and standard Luo because it contains elements from all other Lwoo languages. It is estimated that Dholuo has 90% lexical similarity with Lep Alur ([[Alur language]]); 83% with Lep Achol ([[Acholi language]]); 81% with [[Lango language]], 93% with Dhopadhola (Padhola language), 74%  with [[Anuak language|Anuak]], and 69% with Jurchol ([[Luwo]]) and Dhi-Pari (Pari).\n\nThe Luo are the originators of a number of music styles, such as [[Benga music|Benga]], [[Ohangla music|Ohangla]], [[Dodo music|Dodo]], [[Nyatiti]], [[Orutu]] and [[Otenga]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Luo peoples}}\n\nThe Luo of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]], even though related to other Luo groups linguistically, are classified as the only 'river lake Nilotes' having migrated and lived along the [[Nile river]]. They are indigenous to the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] and have been for thousands of years. Their cradle of civilization was the city-state of [[Napata]] or present-day [[Karima, Sudan]] in the 'Koch' kingdom ([[Kingdom of Kush|Kush kingdom]]).\nArguably the first inhabitants of Sudan, they entered Kenya and Tanzania via [[Uganda]] from the Bahr al Gazzal or [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el-Ghazal]] region. The [[Luo peoples|Luo]] were the founders of the [[Shilluk Kingdom|Shilluk kingdom]]. the Luo clans of Kenya and Tanzania were called 'Ororo', while among the Nuer they were called 'Liel'. In the Dinka tribe the Luo are called the 'Jur-Chol'.  \n\n===Pre-colonial times===\nThe present-day Kenya Luo traditionally consist of 27 tribes, each in turn composed of various clans and sub-clans<ref>{{Cite book|author = Ogot, Bethwell A.| title = History of the Southern Luo: Volume I, Migration and Settlement, (Series: Peoples of East Africa)|publisher = [[East African Publishing House]], Nairobi|year = 1967|page = assim}}</ref> (\"Jo-\" indicates \"people of\").\n\n===Colonial times===\nEarly [[British Empire|British]] contact with the Luo was indirect and sporadic. Relations intensified only when the completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] had confirmed British intentions and largely removed the need for local alliances. In 1896 a [[punitive expedition]] was mounted in support of the Wanga ruler [[Rulers of Wanga|Mumia]] in Ugenya against the  Kager clan led by [[Gero (Luo leader)|Ochieng Ger III]] Otherwise known as Gero. Over 200 were quickly killed by a [[Maxim gun]]. 300 people in Uyoma resistance were killed by an expedition led by Sir Charles Horbley (Bwana Obila Muruayi) when they were confiscating Luo cattle to help feed the Coolies who were building the Uganda railway.\n\nBy 1900, the Luo chief Odera was providing 1,500 porters for a British expedition against the [[Nandi people|Nandi]].\n\nIn 1915, the [[British East Africa|Colonial Government]] sent ''Odera Akang'o'', the ''[[Luo dialect#Sample phrases|ruoth]]'' of Gem, to [[Kampala]], Uganda. He was impressed by the British settlement there and upon his return home he initiated a forced process of adopting western styles of \"schooling, dress and hygiene\". This resulted in the rapid education of the '''Luo''' in the English language and English ways.\n\nThe Luo generally were not dispossessed of their land by the British, avoiding the fate that befell the pastoral ethnic groups inhabiting the Kenyan \"[[White Highlands]]\". Many Luo played significant roles in the struggle for Kenyan independence, but the people were relatively uninvolved in the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] (1952-60). Instead, some Luo used their education to advance the cause of independence peacefully. The lawyer [[C.M.G. Argwings-Kodhek]], for example, used his expertise to defend Mau Mau suspects in court, although they had attacked not only whites, but also the men of other ethnic groups.\n\n===Independent Kenya===\nAfter Kenya became independent on 12 December 1963, the prominent Luo leader [[Oginga Odinga]] declined the presidency of Kenya and agreed to assume the vice presidency with [[Jomo Kenyatta]] as the head of government. Their administration represented the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party. However, differences with Kenyatta caused Odinga to defect from the party and abandon the vice presidency in 1966. His departure caused the Luo to become politically marginalized under the Kenyatta and subsequently the [[Daniel arap Moi|Moi]] administrations.\n\nIn Tanzania, [[Mwalimu J.K. Nyerere]] had personally sought to work with Hellon Ang'iela Owino of [[Shirati]], Tanzania, as a trusted and vibrant political aide who was never ashamed of eloquently speaking his mind whenever needed. Mr. Owino was well known among the [[front bench]] politicians who exchanged fists with the then [[Oscar Kambona]] and Bhoke Munanka, whom he claimed were betraying Nyerere behind his agreed official prayers.{{Clarify|reason=|date=August 2019}} Owino (1930s \u2013 1988) was frequently sent many times by Nyerere (through Oginga Odinga) to mend relations with Kenya and was in particular the one who passed information (from Odinga, who was his African strategic security hub so as to calm down their badly torn relations caused by the Mau Mau war.\n\nMany years of marginalization and disastrous economic management in Kenya, particularly under the KANU party's administration of the nascent state, had tragic consequences for the people of Kenya. Despite the economic potential of nearby [[Lake Victoria]], Kenya continues to struggle with [[Poverty in Africa|poverty]] and AIDS today.<ref>[http://www.worldbank.org/research/povertymaps/kenya/volume_index.htm Energy Old \u2013 Renewable Energy for Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713113111/http://www.worldbank.org/research/povertymaps/kenya/volume_index.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in [[2007\u20132008 Kenyan crisis|Kenya's election violence]] amongst the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]],  Luo, and several other ethnic groups following the controversial [[Kenyan presidential election of 2007|December 2007 presidential election]].<ref>[http://news.theage.com.au/un-chief-calls-on-kenya-rivals-to-stop-violence/20080131-1pcr.html UN chief calls on Kenya rivals to stop violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042825/http://news.theage.com.au/un-chief-calls-on-kenya-rivals-to-stop-violence/20080131-1pcr.html |date=2008-02-02 }}, [[The Age]], 31 January 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512118&in_page_id=1811 As Kenya descends into anarchy, there's no sign of an end of the tribal bloodshed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220011848/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512118&in_page_id=1811 |date=2008-02-20 }}, [[Daily Mail]], 4 February 2008</ref>\n\nThe most prominent Luo politician today is [[Raila Odinga]], the son of [[Oginga Odinga]] and former Prime Minister of the republic of Kenya.

Other prominent politicians include [[James Orengo]], Professor [[Anyang' Nyong'o]] (father of the actress and film director [[Lupita Nyong'o]]), [[Peter Oloo-Aringo]], [[Dalmas Otieno]] and [[Peter Ombija]]. Dr. [[PLO Lumumba]] who is the former [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission]] director is also a Luo. Prominent Luo doctors and scientists include the late Prof. David Peter Simon Wasawo, the first science professor in East and Central Africa and first black East African to study and lecture science courses at Makerere university; [[Prof. Henry Odera Oruka]], philosopher; Dr. [[Joseph Aluoch]], a chest physician; Professor [[Walter Jaoko]], a Tropical Diseases Specialist and leading HIV researcher; Professor [[George Magoha]], a consultant urologist and former Vice-Chancellor of University of Nairobi; Dr. [[Job Bodo]], an orthopaedic surgeon; [[Brian Jaoko Odongo]], a prominent environmental scientist; [[Nixon Ojijo]] a prominent sales and marketing practitioner in the East African Region, and Prof Richard Samson Odingo, vice-chairman of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) which received the 2007 Nobel peace prize.\n\nAnother prominent member was the economist [[Barack Obama Sr.]], whose son, [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama II]], was the 44th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==Culture and customs==\n\n===Rites of passage===\nTraditionally, the names given to children often reflected the conditions of the mother's pregnancy or delivery (including, for example, the time or season).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures and Contemporary Issues|last=Danver, Steven L.|date=2013|publisher=M.E.

Many of the vegetables eaten by the Luo were shared after years of association with their Bantu neighbours, the [[Abaluhya]] and the [[Abagusii]]. Traditional Luo diet consisted of kuon made of sorghum or millet accompanied by fish, meat, or vegetable stews.\n\n===Religious customs===\n{{See also|African divination#Luo people}}\nLike many ethnic communities in Uganda, including the Langi, Acholi, and Alur, the Luo do not practice the [[ritual]] [[circumcision]] of males as [[initiation]].\n\nLocal churches include ''Legio Maria'', ''Roho'', ''Nomiya'' and ''Fweny'' among others.\n\n===Marriage customs===\nHistorically, couples were introduced to each other by matchmakers, but this is not common now. Like many other communities in Kenya, marriage practices among the Luo have been changing and some people are moving away from the traditional way of doing things. \n\nThe Luo successfully expanded their culture through intermarriage with other groups in the region, and many Luo today continue to marry outside the Luo community.<ref name=\":0\" /> The traditional marriage ceremony takes place in two parts, both involving the payment of a [[bride price]] by the groom. The first ceremony, the [[Ayie]], involves a payment of money to the mother of the bride; the second stage involves giving cattle to her father. Often these two steps are carried out at the same time, and, as many modern Luos are Christians, a church ceremony often follows.\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|Music of Kenya#Luo|l1=Luo Section of Folk Music of Kenya}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luo dansers in krijgskostuum tijdens de Eldoret Agricultural Show TMnr 20014319.jpg|left|thumb|Luo dancers in Eldoret, Kenya]]\n\nTraditionally, music was the most widely practiced art in the Luo community. At any time of day or night, music would be made. Music was not played for its own sake. Music was functional, being used for ceremonial, religious, political, or incidental purposes. Music was performed during funerals (''[[Tero buru]]''), to praise the departed, to console the bereaved, to keep people awake at night, and to express pain and agony. It was also used during cleansing and chasing away of spirits. Music was also played during ceremonies like beer parties (''[[Dudu (party)|Dudu]], [[ohangla dance]]''), welcoming back the warriors from a war, during a wrestling match (''[[Olengo]]''), during courtship, etc. Work songs also existed. These were performed both during communal work like building, weeding, etc. and individual work like pounding of cereals, or winnowing. Music was also used for ritual purposes like chasing away evil spirits ''(nyawawa)'', who visit the village at night, in rain making, and during divination and healing.\n\nThe Luo music was shaped by the total way of life, lifestyles, and life patterns of individuals of this community. Because of that, the music had characteristics which distinguished it from that of other communities. This can be seen, heard, and felt in their melodies, rhythms, mode of presentation and dancing styles, movements, and formations.\n\nThe melodies in Luo music were lyrical, with a lot of vocal ornamentations. These ornaments came out clearly, especially when the music carried an important message. Their rhythms were characterized by a lot of syncopation and acrusic beginning. These songs were usually presented in solo-response style, although some were solo performances. The most common forms of solo performances were chants. These chants were recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases, which carried serious messages. Most of the Luo dances were introduced by these chants. One example is the dudu dance.\n\nAnother unique characteristic in the Luo music is the introduction of yet another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance is self-praise. This is referred to as '''''Pakruok'''''. There was also a unique kind of ululation, '''''Sigalagala''''', that marked the climax of the musical performance. Sigalagala was mainly done by women.\n\nThe dance styles in the Luo folk music were elegant and graceful. They involved either the movement of one leg in the opposite direction with the waist in step with the syncopated beats of the music or the shaking of the shoulders vigorously, usually to the tune of the [[nyatiti]], an eight-stringed instrument.\n\nAdamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances, the Luo wore costumes and decorated themselves not only to appear beautiful, but also to enhance their movements. These costumes included sisal skirts ('''''owalo'''''), beads ('''''Ombulu / [[tigo]]''''') worn around the neck and waist, and red or white clay worn by the ladies. The men's costumes included '''''[[kuodi]]''''' or '''''chieno''''', a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist respectively to cover their nakedness, '''''Ligisa''''', the headgear, shield and spear, reed hats, and clubs, among others. All these costumes and ornaments were made from locally available materials.\n\nThe Luo were also rich in musical instruments which ranged from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, '''''ongeng'o or gara''''', shakers), strings (e.g., '''''nyatiti''''', a type of [[lyre]]; '''''[[orutu]]''''', a type of [[fiddle]]), wind ('''''tung (instrument)|tung'''''' a horn,'''''[[Asili]]''''', a [[flute]], '''''A bu-!''''', to a specific type of trumpet).\n\nCurrently the Luo are associated with the ''[[Benga music|benga]]'' style of music. It is a lively style in which songs in [[Dholuo]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], or English are sung to a lively guitar riff. It originated in the 1950s with Luo musicians trying to adapt their traditional dance rhythms to western instruments. The [[guitar]] (acoustic, later electric) replaced the [[nyatiti]] as the string instrument. ''Benga'' has become so popular that it is played by musicians of all ethnicities and is no longer considered a purely Luo style. It has become Kenya's characteristic pop sound.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nLuo singer and nyatiti player [[Ayub Ogada]] received widespread exposure in 2005 when two of his songs were featured in [[Alberto Iglesias]]' Academy Award-nominated score for [[Fernando Mereilles]]' film adaptation of ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''.\n\nOther Luo musical greats in various genres are [[Akothee]],\n[[Suzanna Owiyo]], [[Daniel Owino Misiani]], [[Achieng' Abura]], [[George Ramogi]], [[Musa Juma]], [[Tony Nyadundo]], and [[Onyi Papa Jey]].\n\n===Kinship, Family, and Inheritance===\nOcholla Ayayo writes in \"Traditional Ideology and Ethics among the southern Luo\":\n\n\"When the time of the inheritance comes the ideology of seniority is respected: the elder son receives the largest share, followed in the order of seniority. If it is the land to be divided, for instance, the land of the old grandfather's homestead, the senior son gets the middle piece, the second the land to the right hand side of the homestead, and the third son takes the land on the left hand side. After the father's death the senior son takes over the responsibilities of leadership. These groups when considered in terms of genealogy, are people of the same grandfather, and are known in Dholuo as Jokakwaro. They share sacrifices under the leadership of the senior brother. If the brother is dead the next brother in seniority takes the leadership of senior brother. The responsibility and prestige position of leadership is that it puts one into the primary position in harvesting, cultivation, as well as in eating specified parts of the animal killed, usually the best parts. It is the senior brother, who is leading in the group, who can first own the fishing boat. Since it is he who will be communicating with the ancestors of their father or grandfather, it is he who will conduct or lead the sacrifices of religiousity of the boat, as we have noted earlier. [...] The system of the allocation of land by the father while he is still alive is important since it will coincide with the system of inheritance of land. The principle of the division of the land in monogamous families is rather simple and straightforward. [...] The senior son takes the centre portion of all the land of the homestead up to and beyond the gate or to the buffer zone; the second son then has the remainder of the land to divide with the other brothers. If the land is divided among the elder sons after they are married, and take to live in their lands, it often happens that a youngest son remains in the village of the father to care for him in his old age. His inheritance is the last property, called Mondo and the remaining gardens of his mother. [...] In the case of a polygamous village, the land is divided along the same lines, except that within the village, the sons claim the area contiguous to the houses of their mother. Each wife and her children are regarded as if the group constituted was the son of a single woman.By that I mean the children of the senior wife, Mikayi, are given that portion of the total area which could have been given to the senior son in a monogamous family. The sons of Nyachira, the second wife, and the sons of Reru, the third wife, lay claim to those portions which would have fallen to the second and third sons of Mikayi in a monogamous village\".<ref>Traditional ideology and ethics among the southern Luo \u2013 DiVA {{cite web |url=http://nai.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:280191/FULLTEXT01 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014150155/http://nai.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:280191/FULLTEXT01 |archivedate=2013-10-14 }}</ref>\n\nPaul Hebinck and Nelson Mango explain in detail the family and inheritance system of the Luo in their article \"Land and embedded rights: An analysis of land conflicts in Luoland, Western Kenya.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/13060/ASC-075287668-1014-01.pdf?sequence=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019201253/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/13060/ASC-075287668-1014-01.pdf?sequence=2 |archivedate=2013-10-19 }}</ref> Parker MacDonald Shipton also writes extensively about kinship, family and inheritance among the Luo in his book \"Mortgaging the Ancestors: Ideologies of Attachment in Africa\":\n\n\"Outside the homestead enclosure, or (where there is no more enclosure) beyond and before its houses, Luo people have favored a layout of fields that in some ways reflects placements of houses within. The following pattern, as described in Gordon Wilson\u2019s work from the 1950s, is still discernable in our times\u2014not just in informants\u2019 sketches of their ideals, but also in the allocations of real lands where space has allowed following suit. If there is more than one son in a monogamous homestead, the eldest takes land in front of or to the right of the entrance, and the second son takes land on the left. The third receives land to the right and center again, but farther from the father's homestead. The fourth son, if there is one, goes to the left but farther from the paternal homestead than the second. Further sons alternate right and left. While elder sons might thus receive larger shares than the younger ones, the youngest takes over the personal garden (mondo) kept by the father for his own use\u2014as if as a consolation prize\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Legio Maria]], a large religious group originating in Luoland\n* [[Arthur Carscallen]], as superintendent of the Seventh Day Adventist Mission in British East Africa from 1906\u20131921, he compiled and published the first Dholuo grammar and dictionary.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Suggested reading==\n* Herbich, Ingrid.  \"The Luo.\"  In ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures Supplement'',  C.

They are part of a larger group of ethno-linguistically related [[Luo peoples]] who inhabit an area ranging from [[South Sudan]], South-Western [[Ethiopia]], Northern and Eastern [[Uganda]], South-Western [[Kenya]] and North-Eastern [[Tanzania]].\n\nThe Luo are the fourth largest ethnic group (10.65%) in Kenya, after the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] (17.13%), the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] (14.35%) and the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] (13.37%).<ref name =Census2019/> The Luo and the Kikuyu inherited the bulk of political power in the first years following Kenya's independence in 1963. The Luo population in Kenya was estimated to be 2,185,000 in 1994 and 3.4 million in 2010 according to Government census. However the figure was disputed by many Luos as not scientific since a significant portion of people previously considered as Luo were now counted as Suba people (of [[Suba people (Kenya)|Kenya]] and [[Suba people (Tanzania)|Tanzania]]). The [[Suba people (Kenya)|Subas]] eventually numbered 300,000 but most are completely assimilated Luos by culture, name, language and political orientation and have more or less the same outlook of life. This is a result of heavy intermarriage and interaction. The Luos also feel that their overall population has always been downscaled by successive Kenyan regime census in an attempt to mute the strong Luo political voice. Sample census conducted by experts estimate the total Kenyan Luo population to be currently at around 5 million. The '''Tanzanian''' Luo population was estimated at 1.1 million in 2001 and 1.9 million in 2010.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{Cite book|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=luo|title = Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth Edition|last = Gordon, Jr.|first = Raymond G.

Outside [[Luoland]], the Luo comprise a significant fraction of East Africa's intellectual and skilled labour force in various professions. Others members work in eastern Africa as tenant fishermen, small-scale farmers, and urban workers.\n\nThey speak the [[Luo language|Dholuo language]], which belongs to the [[Western Nilotic]] branch of the [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]] language family spoken by other Luo-speaking peoples, such as the [[Langi people|Lango]], [[Acholi people|Acholi]], [[Adhola people|Adhola]] and [[Alur people|Alur]] (all of Uganda and parts of South Sudan and Eastern Congo). The four waves of Luo migration were chiefly from the four Luo-speaking groups (Lwoo), especially Acholi and Padhola. [[Dholuo]], spoken in Kenya, is considered to be proper and standard Luo because it contains elements from all other Lwoo languages. It is estimated that Dholuo has 90% lexical similarity with Lep Alur ([[Alur language]]); 83% with Lep Achol ([[Acholi language]]); 81% with [[Lango language]], 93% with Dhopadhola (Padhola language), 74%  with [[Anuak language|Anuak]], and 69% with Jurchol ([[Luwo]]) and Dhi-Pari (Pari).\n\nThe Luo are the originators of a number of music styles, such as [[Benga music|Benga]], [[Ohangla music|Ohangla]], [[Dodo music|Dodo]], [[Nyatiti]], [[Orutu]] and [[Otenga]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Luo peoples}}\n\nThe Luo of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]], even though related to other Luo groups linguistically, are classified as the only 'river lake Nilotes' having migrated and lived along the [[Nile river]]. They are indigenous to the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] and have been for thousands of years. Their cradle of civilization was the city-state of [[Napata]] or present-day [[Karima, Sudan]] in the 'Koch' kingdom ([[Kingdom of Kush|Kush kingdom]]).\nArguably the first inhabitants of Sudan, they entered Kenya and Tanzania via [[Uganda]] from the Bahr al Gazzal or [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el-Ghazal]] region. The [[Luo peoples|Luo]] were the founders of the [[Shilluk Kingdom|Shilluk kingdom]]. the Luo clans of Kenya and Tanzania were called 'Ororo', while among the Nuer they were called 'Liel'. In the Dinka tribe the Luo are called the 'Jur-Chol'.  \n\n===Pre-colonial times===\nThe present-day Kenya Luo traditionally consist of 27 tribes, each in turn composed of various clans and sub-clans<ref>{{Cite book|author = Ogot, Bethwell A.| title = History of the Southern Luo: Volume I, Migration and Settlement, (Series: Peoples of East Africa)|publisher = [[East African Publishing House]], Nairobi|year = 1967|page = assim}}</ref> (\"Jo-\" indicates \"people of\").\n\n===Colonial times===\nEarly [[British Empire|British]] contact with the Luo was indirect and sporadic. Relations intensified only when the completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] had confirmed British intentions and largely removed the need for local alliances. In 1896 a [[punitive expedition]] was mounted in support of the Wanga ruler [[Rulers of Wanga|Mumia]] in Ugenya against the  Kager clan led by [[Gero (Luo leader)|Ochieng Ger III]] Otherwise known as Gero. Over 200 were quickly killed by a [[Maxim gun]]. 300 people in Uyoma resistance were killed by an expedition led by Sir Charles Horbley (Bwana Obila Muruayi) when they were confiscating Luo cattle to help feed the Coolies who were building the Uganda railway.\n\nBy 1900, the Luo chief Odera was providing 1,500 porters for a British expedition against the [[Nandi people|Nandi]].\n\nIn 1915, the [[British East Africa|Colonial Government]] sent ''Odera Akang'o'', the ''[[Luo dialect#Sample phrases|ruoth]]'' of Gem, to [[Kampala]], Uganda. He was impressed by the British settlement there and upon his return home he initiated a forced process of adopting western styles of \"schooling, dress and hygiene\". This resulted in the rapid education of the '''Luo''' in the English language and English ways.\n\nThe Luo generally were not dispossessed of their land by the British, avoiding the fate that befell the pastoral ethnic groups inhabiting the Kenyan \"[[White Highlands]]\". Many Luo played significant roles in the struggle for Kenyan independence, but the people were relatively uninvolved in the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] (1952-60). Instead, some Luo used their education to advance the cause of independence peacefully. The lawyer [[C.M.G. Argwings-Kodhek]], for example, used his expertise to defend Mau Mau suspects in court, although they had attacked not only whites, but also the men of other ethnic groups.\n\n===Independent Kenya===\nAfter Kenya became independent on 12 December 1963, the prominent Luo leader [[Oginga Odinga]] declined the presidency of Kenya and agreed to assume the vice presidency with [[Jomo Kenyatta]] as the head of government. Their administration represented the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party. However, differences with Kenyatta caused Odinga to defect from the party and abandon the vice presidency in 1966. His departure caused the Luo to become politically marginalized under the Kenyatta and subsequently the [[Daniel arap Moi|Moi]] administrations.\n\nIn Tanzania, [[Mwalimu J.K. Nyerere]] had personally sought to work with Hellon Ang'iela Owino of [[Shirati]], Tanzania, as a trusted and vibrant political aide who was never ashamed of eloquently speaking his mind whenever needed. Mr. Owino was well known among the [[front bench]] politicians who exchanged fists with the then [[Oscar Kambona]] and Bhoke Munanka, whom he claimed were betraying Nyerere behind his agreed official prayers.{{Clarify|reason=|date=August 2019}} Owino (1930s \u2013 1988) was frequently sent many times by Nyerere (through Oginga Odinga) to mend relations with Kenya and was in particular the one who passed information (from Odinga, who was his African strategic security hub so as to calm down their badly torn relations caused by the Mau Mau war.\n\nMany years of marginalization and disastrous economic management in Kenya, particularly under the KANU party's administration of the nascent state, had tragic consequences for the people of Kenya. Despite the economic potential of nearby [[Lake Victoria]], Kenya continues to struggle with [[Poverty in Africa|poverty]] and AIDS today.<ref>[http://www.worldbank.org/research/povertymaps/kenya/volume_index.htm Energy Old \u2013 Renewable Energy for Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713113111/http://www.worldbank.org/research/povertymaps/kenya/volume_index.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in [[2007\u20132008 Kenyan crisis|Kenya's election violence]] amongst the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]],  Luo, and several other ethnic groups following the controversial [[Kenyan presidential election of 2007|December 2007 presidential election]].<ref>[http://news.theage.com.au/un-chief-calls-on-kenya-rivals-to-stop-violence/20080131-1pcr.html UN chief calls on Kenya rivals to stop violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042825/http://news.theage.com.au/un-chief-calls-on-kenya-rivals-to-stop-violence/20080131-1pcr.html |date=2008-02-02 }}, [[The Age]], 31 January 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512118&in_page_id=1811 As Kenya descends into anarchy, there's no sign of an end of the tribal bloodshed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220011848/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512118&in_page_id=1811 |date=2008-02-20 }}, [[Daily Mail]], 4 February 2008</ref>\n\nThe most prominent Luo politician today is [[Raila Odinga]], the son of [[Oginga Odinga]] and former Prime Minister of the republic of Kenya.

Other prominent politicians include [[James Orengo]], Professor [[Anyang' Nyong'o]] (father of the actress and film director [[Lupita Nyong'o]]), [[Peter Oloo-Aringo]], [[Dalmas Otieno]] and [[Peter Ombija]]. Dr. [[PLO Lumumba]] who is the former [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission]] director is also a Luo. Prominent Luo doctors and scientists include the late Prof. David Peter Simon Wasawo, the first science professor in East and Central Africa and first black East African to study and lecture science courses at Makerere university; [[Prof. Henry Odera Oruka]], philosopher; Dr. [[Joseph Aluoch]], a chest physician; Professor [[Walter Jaoko]], a Tropical Diseases Specialist and leading HIV researcher; Professor [[George Magoha]], a consultant urologist and former Vice-Chancellor of University of Nairobi; Dr. [[Job Bodo]], an orthopaedic surgeon; [[Brian Jaoko Odongo]], a prominent environmental scientist; [[Nixon Ojijo]] a prominent sales and marketing practitioner in the East African Region, and Prof Richard Samson Odingo, vice-chairman of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) which received the 2007 Nobel peace prize.\n\nAnother prominent member was the economist [[Barack Obama Sr.]], whose son, [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama II]], was the 44th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==Culture and customs==\n\n===Rites of passage===\nTraditionally, the names given to children often reflected the conditions of the mother's pregnancy or delivery (including, for example, the time or season).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures and Contemporary Issues|last=Danver, Steven L.|date=2013|publisher=M.E.

Many of the vegetables eaten by the Luo were shared after years of association with their Bantu neighbours, the [[Abaluhya]] and the [[Abagusii]]. Traditional Luo diet consisted of kuon made of sorghum or millet accompanied by fish, meat, or vegetable stews.\n\n===Religious customs===\n{{See also|African divination#Luo people}}\nLike many ethnic communities in Uganda, including the Langi, Acholi, and Alur, the Luo do not practice the [[ritual]] [[circumcision]] of males as [[initiation]].\n\nLocal churches include ''Legio Maria'', ''Roho'', ''Nomiya'' and ''Fweny'' among others.\n\n===Marriage customs===\nHistorically, couples were introduced to each other by matchmakers, but this is not common now. Like many other communities in Kenya, marriage practices among the Luo have been changing and some people are moving away from the traditional way of doing things. \n\nThe Luo successfully expanded their culture through intermarriage with other groups in the region, and many Luo today continue to marry outside the Luo community.<ref name=\":0\" /> The traditional marriage ceremony takes place in two parts, both involving the payment of a [[bride price]] by the groom. The first ceremony, the [[Ayie]], involves a payment of money to the mother of the bride; the second stage involves giving cattle to her father. Often these two steps are carried out at the same time, and, as many modern Luos are Christians, a church ceremony often follows.\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|Music of Kenya#Luo|l1=Luo Section of Folk Music of Kenya}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luo dansers in krijgskostuum tijdens de Eldoret Agricultural Show TMnr 20014319.jpg|left|thumb|Luo dancers in Eldoret, Kenya]]\n\nTraditionally, music was the most widely practiced art in the Luo community. At any time of day or night, music would be made. Music was not played for its own sake. Music was functional, being used for ceremonial, religious, political, or incidental purposes. Music was performed during funerals (''[[Tero buru]]''), to praise the departed, to console the bereaved, to keep people awake at night, and to express pain and agony. It was also used during cleansing and chasing away of spirits. Music was also played during ceremonies like beer parties (''[[Dudu (party)|Dudu]], [[ohangla dance]]''), welcoming back the warriors from a war, during a wrestling match (''[[Olengo]]''), during courtship, etc. Work songs also existed. These were performed both during communal work like building, weeding, etc. and individual work like pounding of cereals, or winnowing. Music was also used for ritual purposes like chasing away evil spirits ''(nyawawa)'', who visit the village at night, in rain making, and during divination and healing.\n\nThe Luo music was shaped by the total way of life, lifestyles, and life patterns of individuals of this community. Because of that, the music had characteristics which distinguished it from that of other communities. This can be seen, heard, and felt in their melodies, rhythms, mode of presentation and dancing styles, movements, and formations.\n\nThe melodies in Luo music were lyrical, with a lot of vocal ornamentations. These ornaments came out clearly, especially when the music carried an important message. Their rhythms were characterized by a lot of syncopation and acrusic beginning. These songs were usually presented in solo-response style, although some were solo performances. The most common forms of solo performances were chants. These chants were recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases, which carried serious messages. Most of the Luo dances were introduced by these chants. One example is the dudu dance.\n\nAnother unique characteristic in the Luo music is the introduction of yet another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance is self-praise. This is referred to as '''''Pakruok'''''. There was also a unique kind of ululation, '''''Sigalagala''''', that marked the climax of the musical performance. Sigalagala was mainly done by women.\n\nThe dance styles in the Luo folk music were elegant and graceful. They involved either the movement of one leg in the opposite direction with the waist in step with the syncopated beats of the music or the shaking of the shoulders vigorously, usually to the tune of the [[nyatiti]], an eight-stringed instrument.\n\nAdamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances, the Luo wore costumes and decorated themselves not only to appear beautiful, but also to enhance their movements. These costumes included sisal skirts ('''''owalo'''''), beads ('''''Ombulu / [[tigo]]''''') worn around the neck and waist, and red or white clay worn by the ladies. The men's costumes included '''''[[kuodi]]''''' or '''''chieno''''', a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist respectively to cover their nakedness, '''''Ligisa''''', the headgear, shield and spear, reed hats, and clubs, among others. All these costumes and ornaments were made from locally available materials.\n\nThe Luo were also rich in musical instruments which ranged from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, '''''ongeng'o or gara''''', shakers), strings (e.g., '''''nyatiti''''', a type of [[lyre]]; '''''[[orutu]]''''', a type of [[fiddle]]), wind ('''''tung (instrument)|tung'''''' a horn,'''''[[Asili]]''''', a [[flute]], '''''A bu-!''''', to a specific type of trumpet).\n\nCurrently the Luo are associated with the ''[[Benga music|benga]]'' style of music. It is a lively style in which songs in [[Dholuo]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], or English are sung to a lively guitar riff. It originated in the 1950s with Luo musicians trying to adapt their traditional dance rhythms to western instruments. The [[guitar]] (acoustic, later electric) replaced the [[nyatiti]] as the string instrument. ''Benga'' has become so popular that it is played by musicians of all ethnicities and is no longer considered a purely Luo style. It has become Kenya's characteristic pop sound.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nLuo singer and nyatiti player [[Ayub Ogada]] received widespread exposure in 2005 when two of his songs were featured in [[Alberto Iglesias]]' Academy Award-nominated score for [[Fernando Mereilles]]' film adaptation of ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''.\n\nOther Luo musical greats in various genres are [[Akothee]],\n[[Suzanna Owiyo]], [[Daniel Owino Misiani]], [[Achieng' Abura]], [[George Ramogi]], [[Musa Juma]], [[Tony Nyadundo]], and [[Onyi Papa Jey]].\n\n===Kinship, Family, and Inheritance===\nOcholla Ayayo writes in \"Traditional Ideology and Ethics among the southern Luo\":\n\n\"When the time of the inheritance comes the ideology of seniority is respected: the elder son receives the largest share, followed in the order of seniority. If it is the land to be divided, for instance, the land of the old grandfather's homestead, the senior son gets the middle piece, the second the land to the right hand side of the homestead, and the third son takes the land on the left hand side. After the father's death the senior son takes over the responsibilities of leadership. These groups when considered in terms of genealogy, are people of the same grandfather, and are known in Dholuo as Jokakwaro. They share sacrifices under the leadership of the senior brother. If the brother is dead the next brother in seniority takes the leadership of senior brother. The responsibility and prestige position of leadership is that it puts one into the primary position in harvesting, cultivation, as well as in eating specified parts of the animal killed, usually the best parts. It is the senior brother, who is leading in the group, who can first own the fishing boat. Since it is he who will be communicating with the ancestors of their father or grandfather, it is he who will conduct or lead the sacrifices of religiousity of the boat, as we have noted earlier. [...] The system of the allocation of land by the father while he is still alive is important since it will coincide with the system of inheritance of land. The principle of the division of the land in monogamous families is rather simple and straightforward. [...] The senior son takes the centre portion of all the land of the homestead up to and beyond the gate or to the buffer zone; the second son then has the remainder of the land to divide with the other brothers. If the land is divided among the elder sons after they are married, and take to live in their lands, it often happens that a youngest son remains in the village of the father to care for him in his old age. His inheritance is the last property, called Mondo and the remaining gardens of his mother. [...] In the case of a polygamous village, the land is divided along the same lines, except that within the village, the sons claim the area contiguous to the houses of their mother. Each wife and her children are regarded as if the group constituted was the son of a single woman.By that I mean the children of the senior wife, Mikayi, are given that portion of the total area which could have been given to the senior son in a monogamous family. The sons of Nyachira, the second wife, and the sons of Reru, the third wife, lay claim to those portions which would have fallen to the second and third sons of Mikayi in a monogamous village\".<ref>Traditional ideology and ethics among the southern Luo \u2013 DiVA {{cite web |url=http://nai.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:280191/FULLTEXT01 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014150155/http://nai.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:280191/FULLTEXT01 |archivedate=2013-10-14 }}</ref>\n\nPaul Hebinck and Nelson Mango explain in detail the family and inheritance system of the Luo in their article \"Land and embedded rights: An analysis of land conflicts in Luoland, Western Kenya.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/13060/ASC-075287668-1014-01.pdf?sequence=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019201253/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/13060/ASC-075287668-1014-01.pdf?sequence=2 |archivedate=2013-10-19 }}</ref> Parker MacDonald Shipton also writes extensively about kinship, family and inheritance among the Luo in his book \"Mortgaging the Ancestors: Ideologies of Attachment in Africa\":\n\n\"Outside the homestead enclosure, or (where there is no more enclosure) beyond and before its houses, Luo people have favored a layout of fields that in some ways reflects placements of houses within. The following pattern, as described in Gordon Wilson\u2019s work from the 1950s, is still discernable in our times\u2014not just in informants\u2019 sketches of their ideals, but also in the allocations of real lands where space has allowed following suit. If there is more than one son in a monogamous homestead, the eldest takes land in front of or to the right of the entrance, and the second son takes land on the left. The third receives land to the right and center again, but farther from the father's homestead. The fourth son, if there is one, goes to the left but farther from the paternal homestead than the second. Further sons alternate right and left. While elder sons might thus receive larger shares than the younger ones, the youngest takes over the personal garden (mondo) kept by the father for his own use\u2014as if as a consolation prize\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Legio Maria]], a large religious group originating in Luoland\n* [[Arthur Carscallen]], as superintendent of the Seventh Day Adventist Mission in British East Africa from 1906\u20131921, he compiled and published the first Dholuo grammar and dictionary.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Suggested reading==\n* Herbich, Ingrid.  \"The Luo.\"  In ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures Supplement'',  C.

It was established by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)]] in 1931 when the original [[St Patrick's College, Wellington]] (established 1885) was intended to be moved to a larger site more suited to a boarding school. In fact, both colleges survived. Today, they share not only a common history, motto and spirit but also a good natured rivalry and competition in many endeavours. Silverstreamers refer to the mother school simply as 'Town'.\n\nThe Silverstream College, quite often referred to simply by the suburb title or 'Stream', is on seven hectares of grounds between the [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt River]] and [[Silverstream railway station|Silverstream Railway Station]] close to the suburbs of Silverstream and [[Heretaunga, Wellington|Heretaunga]]. As a [[state-integrated school]], St Patrick's College is funded by the Society of Mary, [[Catholic Schools Board Limited]] and the [[New Zealand Government]].<ref>St. Patrick's College (Silverstream) Parents' Handbook 2014</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, St Patrick's record was marred by a member of staff being involved in incidents of sexual abuse involving students. Reports of this sexual abuse were allegedly suppressed by the school [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist]] priests.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3574937|title=Police may go after the clergymen who hid abuse|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=26 June 2004|first=Alan|last=Gardner}}</ref>\n\nAt its foundation much of the original College was transferred from the Wellington site including many of the Marist teachers, much of the memorabilia and the College colours. The brother Colleges today share an Old Boys' Association in recognition of their common heritage. School sports teams have enjoyed success in Rugby union, cricket and athletics. Football, hockey and basketball are popular winter sports at the college. Both Of St Patrick's Colleges also compete against each other in an annual event called \u201cMc Evedy\u201d similar to the athletics of Old Boys but it is shared with two other schools, Wellington College and Rongotai College. Over the years of the College it has evolved from being primarily a boarding school into a largely day school with a small boarding facility. This demographic shift has resulted from several pressures including the huge increase in number of residents in the local area. In more recent years it has been necessary to cap the roll and introduce an enrolment scheme to ensure an equitable educational outcome for all local pupils. The College celebrated its 75th Jubilee in 2006.\n\nSt Patrick's College as a Catholic School bases its educational philosophy on Christian teachings and on the Marist tradition under which the school was founded. In 2012 the St Patrick's College, Silverstream Foundation was established with an inaugural dinner. The Foundation will build a stronger college community where there are many opportunities for Old Boys, staff, parents and friends to become involved in college life.\n\n==Demographics==\nAt the October 2011 [[Education Review Office]] (ERO) review, St Patrick's Silverstream had 712 students enrolled. Sixty-six percent of students identified as [[New Zealand European]] (P\u0101keh\u0101), 14 percent identified as [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], ten percent as [[Pacific Islander]]s, five percent as [[Asian people|Asian]], and five percent as another ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.ero.govt.nz/Early-Childhood-School-Reports/School-Reports/St-Patrick-s-College-Silverstream-05-12-2011 |title= St Patrick's College (Silverstream) Education Review |publisher= Education Review Office |date= 5 December 2011 |accessdate= 20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSt Patrick's Silverstream has a [[socio-economic decile]] of 8 (step P), meaning it draws its school community from areas of moderately-high [[socioeconomic status]] when compared to other New Zealand schools. The school was recategorised from decile 9 (step Q) in January 2015, as part of the nationwide review of deciles following the 2013 census.<ref name=\"decile2015\" />\n\n== Sexual abuse of children ==\nAt least four former priests who taught at St Pats have been identified as paedophiles:\n\n* [[Francis Durning]], the former rector of the college during the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/367124/priest-s-sexual-abuse-at-upper-hutt-school-admitted-it-s-criminal|title=Priest's sexual abuse at Upper Hutt school admitted: It's 'criminal'|date=2018-09-24|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> \n*AM Donnelly, who taught at St Pat\u2019s from 1968 to 1974<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=113278|title=Wellington.scoop.co.nz \u00bb Sexual abuse: police investigating former priest who taught at St Pat\u2019s Silverstream|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n* Alan Woodcock abused children at [[St John's College, Hastings|St John's College]] in [[Hastings]], [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream|St Patrick's College]] in [[Upper Hutt]], Highden in the [[Manawatu]] and Futuna in [[Wellington]].

The College celebrated its 75th Jubilee in 2006.\n\nSt Patrick's College as a Catholic School bases its educational philosophy on Christian teachings and on the Marist tradition under which the school was founded. In 2012 the St Patrick's College, Silverstream Foundation was established with an inaugural dinner. The Foundation will build a stronger college community where there are many opportunities for Old Boys, staff, parents and friends to become involved in college life.\n\n==Demographics==\nAt the October 2011 [[Education Review Office]] (ERO) review, St Patrick's Silverstream had 712 students enrolled.
