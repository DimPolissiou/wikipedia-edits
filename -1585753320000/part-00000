Corresponding to this, knowledge-based decision making tries to focus on functioning within an environment and surroundings with a variety of components, including respecting one another's decisions and listening to each other. These factors link to culture as they can contribute to how an individual feels within the environment, whether this is positive or negative  reducing the amount of fear and pressure put on individuals if they make a mistake. If individuals feel as though they need advice, the culture can assist individuals, as it would be normal to help each other, be reassuring as well as encouraging.

The structure supports and is suited to assist long- term planning and strategic decision-making.<ref name=\":5\" /> At the beginning of the process key background information is assembled to increase the amount of knowledge and understanding each individual decision maker has about the topic, vital aspects of information will also be included. The research and information founded is put into a mutual location to provide equal grounds in terms of knowledge before a discussion occurs, this give time for questions to be established. From the KBDM process a decision can be made based on facts, understanding and suitable reasoning from discussions to conclude the most appropriate decision.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Questions==\nDuring the third stage of the process background information is measured against a set of questions.

If individuals feel as though they need advice, the culture can assist individuals, as it would be normal to help each other, be reassuring as well as encouraging.

A development of the previous year's [[Lotus 97T|97T]], the car was raced by Brazilian [[Ayrton Senna]], in his second year with the team, and Scottish newcomer [[Johnny Dumfries]].\n\nThe chassis featured a lower monocoque than the 97T as a result of a regulation change stipulating a reduction in fuel capacity to 195 litres. The powertrain consisted of the new [[Renault F1|Renault]] [[Renault EF-Type engine|EF15B]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] V6 engine, driving through a six-speed, [[sequential manual transmission|manual sequential]] Hewland gearbox.<ref name=\"power\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelotusforums.com/latest-news/our-news/the-power-and-the-glory-lotus-98t/|title=The power and the glory. Lotus 98T.|date=3 December 2015|website=The Lotus Forums|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe EF15B was to appear in two forms, the standard engine and the \"D.P.\" engine which featured pneumatic valve springs for the first time. At the end of the season [[Renault F1|Renault]] introduced the revised EF15C which in addition to the D.P. valve gear also boasted common rail fuel injection and much revised water cooling through the cylinder head reducing the likelihood of pre-ignition (detonation). Power figures for this period of F1 history are largely speculative as most engine manufactures freely admitted that their test beds would not have a sufficient power rating to measure the 1.5 litre turbos output at above 4 bar boost. It is claimed that the Renault EF15B in its pinnacle increment was claimed to produce in excess of 1000 HP at unrestricted boost pressure, thus making it one of the most powerful engines ever used in Formula 1 history. <ref name=\"power\"/> \n\nThis was, however, during qualifying, where teams used unrestricted boost pressures for maximum power output, and for very quick lap times. These unrestricted engines were very unreliable, and would only last about a couple clean laps. Therefore, the 98T produced around 900 HP in race trim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turnology.com/news/video-onboard-the-terrifying-lotus-98t-turbo-f1/|title=Video: Onboard the Terrifying Lotus 98T Turbo F1!|date=25 March 2016|website=turnology.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref> The 98T was also the final Lotus powered by a Renault engine, as Lotus switched to Honda for the following year/season.\n\nThe gearbox came in two variants, a conventional five speed and a new six speed. The six speed was very much a development gearbox and was largely unreliable. While Senna opted to run only with the five speed, Dumfries was tasked with testing the six speed. Both gearboxes featured Hewland internals within a Lotus designed casing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/684/Lotus-98T-Renault.html|title=1986 Lotus 98T Renault - Images, Specifications and Information|website=Ultimatecarpage.com|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther notable innovations of the 98T included a two-stage ride height adjustment, water injection through the intercoolers, an early form of barge board (also present on the 97T) and an advanced (for the time) fuel consumption micro computer.\n\n==Driver controversy==\nAt the end of 1985 [[Elio de Angelis]], who had driven for Lotus since 1980, left the team to join [[Brabham]]. Lotus intended to replace the Italian with [[Derek Warwick]], out of a drive as a result of Renault closing their factory team. However, Ayrton Senna did not believe that the team could sustain two number 1 drivers, and did not want the focus of the team to be on anything but himself. He thus put pressure on Lotus not to sign Warwick, and to instead sign his fellow countryman, [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]], as a number 2 driver. The team bowed to Senna's first demand, but signed Johnny Dumfries rather than Gugelmin, as long-time sponsor [[John Player & Sons|John Player]] reportedly wanted a British driver. Subsequently, Warwick replaced de Angelis at Brabham after the Italian's fatal testing accident at [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] (and eventually joined Lotus in {{F1|1990}}), while Gugelmin would not appear in F1 until he joined the [[March Engineering|March]] team in {{F1|1988}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-2010/76/lunch-derek-warwick|title=Lunch With... Derek Warwick|date=7 July 2014|website=Motor Sport Magazine|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 98T was the last Lotus car to carry John Player's famous black and gold colours. With Renault withdrawing from F1 at the end of 1986, Lotus did a deal with [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] to use the Japanese company's engines in {{F1|1987}} and 1988. As part of the deal, the team signed Honda's official test driver, [[Satoru Nakajima]], as Senna's teammate for 1987. John Player, still wanting a British driver in the team, subsequently pulled its sponsorship, to be replaced by another cigarette brand, [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-2008/90/lunch-peter-warr|title=Lunch with...

A development of the previous year's [[Lotus 97T|97T]], the car was raced by Brazilian [[Ayrton Senna]], in his second year with the team, and Scottish newcomer [[Johnny Dumfries]].\n\nThe chassis featured a lower monocoque than the 97T as a result of a regulation change stipulating a reduction in fuel capacity to 195 litres. The powertrain consisted of the new [[Renault F1|Renault]] [[Renault EF-Type engine|EF15B]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] V6 engine, driving through a six-speed, [[sequential manual transmission|manual sequential]] Hewland gearbox.<ref name=\"power\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelotusforums.com/latest-news/our-news/the-power-and-the-glory-lotus-98t/|title=The power and the glory. Lotus 98T.|date=3 December 2015|website=The Lotus Forums|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe EF15B was to appear in two forms, the standard engine and the \"D.P.\" engine which featured pneumatic valve springs for the first time. At the end of the season [[Renault F1|Renault]] introduced the revised EF15C which in addition to the D.P. valve gear also boasted common rail fuel injection and much revised water cooling through the cylinder head reducing the likelihood of pre-ignition (detonation). Power figures for this period of F1 history are largely speculative as most engine manufactures freely admitted that their test beds would not have a sufficient power rating to measure the 1.5 litre turbos output at above 4 bar boost. It is claimed that the Renault EF15B in its pinnacle increment was claimed to produce in excess of 1000 HP at unrestricted boost pressure, thus making it one of the most powerful engines ever used in Formula 1 history. <ref name=\"power\"/> \n\nThis was however during qualifying, where teams used unrestricted boost pressures for maximum power output, and for very quick lap times. These unrestricted engines were very unreliable, and would only last about a couple clean laps. Therefore, the 98T produced around 900 HP in race trim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turnology.com/news/video-onboard-the-terrifying-lotus-98t-turbo-f1/|title=Video: Onboard the Terrifying Lotus 98T Turbo F1!|date=25 March 2016|website=turnology.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref> The 98T was also the final Lotus powered by a Renault engine, as Lotus switched to Honda for the following year/season.\n\nThe gearbox came in two variants, a conventional five speed and a new six speed. The six speed was very much a development gearbox and was largely unreliable. While Senna opted to run only with the five speed, Dumfries was tasked with testing the six speed. Both gearboxes featured Hewland internals within a Lotus designed casing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/684/Lotus-98T-Renault.html|title=1986 Lotus 98T Renault - Images, Specifications and Information|website=Ultimatecarpage.com|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther notable innovations of the 98T included a two-stage ride height adjustment, water injection through the intercoolers, an early form of barge board (also present on the 97T) and an advanced (for the time) fuel consumption micro computer.\n\n==Driver controversy==\nAt the end of 1985 [[Elio de Angelis]], who had driven for Lotus since 1980, left the team to join [[Brabham]]. Lotus intended to replace the Italian with [[Derek Warwick]], out of a drive as a result of Renault closing their factory team. However, Ayrton Senna did not believe that the team could sustain two number 1 drivers, and did not want the focus of the team to be on anything but himself. He thus put pressure on Lotus not to sign Warwick, and to instead sign his fellow countryman, [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]], as a number 2 driver. The team bowed to Senna's first demand, but signed Johnny Dumfries rather than Gugelmin, as long-time sponsor [[John Player & Sons|John Player]] reportedly wanted a British driver. Subsequently, Warwick replaced de Angelis at Brabham after the Italian's fatal testing accident at [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] (and eventually joined Lotus in {{F1|1990}}), while Gugelmin would not appear in F1 until he joined the [[March Engineering|March]] team in {{F1|1988}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-2010/76/lunch-derek-warwick|title=Lunch With... Derek Warwick|date=7 July 2014|website=Motor Sport Magazine|access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 98T was the last Lotus car to carry John Player's famous black and gold colours. With Renault withdrawing from F1 at the end of 1986, Lotus did a deal with [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] to use the Japanese company's engines in {{F1|1987}} and 1988. As part of the deal, the team signed Honda's official test driver, [[Satoru Nakajima]], as Senna's teammate for 1987. John Player, still wanting a British driver in the team, subsequently pulled its sponsorship, to be replaced by another cigarette brand, [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-2008/90/lunch-peter-warr|title=Lunch with...

The episode first aired in [[broadcast syndication]] on January&nbsp;11, 1988. This was the second writing credit of the series for [[Tracy Torm\u00e9]] following the episode \"[[Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Haven]]\". [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]] planned to direct the episode, but he was switched to \"[[Datalore]]\" due to delays in its production. With Bowman working on another episode, [[Joseph L. Scanlan]] became the director.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]]. In this episode, the crew is sent to open diplomatic ties with the Jarada. While taking a break from preparations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]), Lt. Cmdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]), and Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) are trapped, due to a computer malfunction, in a 1940s-style gangster [[holodeck]] program with Captain Picard playing the role of [[detective]] Dixon Hill.\n\n\"The Big Goodbye\" is the first episode to significantly feature the holodeck. Torm\u00e9 credited [[Gene Roddenberry]] with the idea for the detective novel, with Torm\u00e9 employing the [[film noir]] style using references to ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941). [[Lawrence Tierney]], who appeared in film noir movies in the 1940s, guest stars as Cyrus Redblock. The Dixon Hill setting reappeared in two later episodes in the series and in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996).\n\n11.5&nbsp;million viewers watched \"The Big Goodbye\"; critical reception was mixed. One reviewer found it too similar to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]\". Other reviewers complained about the holodeck but praised Tierney's performance. The episode won an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series|Outstanding Costumes for a Series]] and is the only ''Star Trek'' episode to ever win the [[Peabody Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise'']] heads to Torona IV to open negotiations with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock ([[Lawrence Tierney]]) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen ([[David Selburg]]) to join him in the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary ([[Gary Armagnac]]) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the ''Enterprise'' is scanned from a distance by the Jarada, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.\n\nThe Jarada demand their greeting earlier than the agreed time and are insulted at having to talk to anyone other than the Captain. The crew try to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but find it impossible; the Jarada signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) and [[Wesley Crusher]] ([[Wil Wheaton]]) attempt to repair the holodeck systems, while inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech ([[Harvey Jason]]) appears having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover the holodeck is malfunctioning and they are unable to exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.\n\nOutside, Wesley finds the glitch, however he cannot simply turn off the system for fear of losing everyone inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and the others in the middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is \"the big goodbye\", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to the Jarada. The Jarada accept the greeting, heralding the start of successful negotiations.\n\n==Production==\n[[image:MainTitleMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|References were deliberately included in \"The Big Goodbye\" to the 1941 film ''The Maltese Falcon''.]]\nThe initial idea for Picard's detective based holodeck program came from series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and other writing staff.

The episode's name is itself a reference to two works by [[detective fiction]] writer [[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]''.

The episode first aired in [[broadcast syndication]] on January&nbsp;11, 1988. This was the second writing credit of the series for [[Tracy Torm\u00e9]] following the episode \"[[Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Haven]]\". [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]] planned to direct the episode, but he was switched to \"[[Datalore]]\" due to delays in its production. With Bowman working on another episode, [[Joseph L. Scanlan]] became the director.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]]. In this episode, the crew are sent to open diplomatic ties with the Jarada. While taking a break from preparations, a computer malfunction traps Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]), Lt. Cmdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]), and Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) in a 1940s-style gangster [[holodeck]] program with Captain Picard playing the role of [[detective]] Dixon Hill.\n\n\"The Big Goodbye\" is the first episode to significantly feature the holodeck. Torm\u00e9 credited [[Gene Roddenberry]] with the idea for the detective novel, with Torm\u00e9 employing the [[film noir]] style using references to ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941). [[Lawrence Tierney]], who appeared in film noir movies in the 1940s, guest stars as Cyrus Redblock. The Dixon Hill setting reappeared in two later episodes in the series and in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996).\n\n11.5&nbsp;million viewers watched \"The Big Goodbye\"; critical reception was mixed. One reviewer found it too similar to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]\". Other reviewers complained about the holodeck but praised Tierney's performance. The episode won an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series|Outstanding Costumes for a Series]] and is the only ''Star Trek'' episode to ever win the [[Peabody Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise'']] heads to Torona IV to open negotiations with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock ([[Lawrence Tierney]]) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen ([[David Selburg]]) to join him in the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary ([[Gary Armagnac]]) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the ''Enterprise'' is scanned from a distance by the Jarada, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.\n\nThe Jarada demand their greeting earlier than the agreed time and are insulted at having to talk to anyone other than the Captain. The crew try to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but find it impossible; the Jarada signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. [[Geordi La Forge]] ([[LeVar Burton]]) and [[Wesley Crusher]] ([[Wil Wheaton]]) attempt to repair the holodeck systems, while inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech ([[Harvey Jason]]) appears having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover the holodeck is malfunctioning and they are unable to exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.\n\nOutside, Wesley finds the glitch, however he cannot simply turn off the system for fear of losing everyone inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and the others in the middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is \"the big goodbye\", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to the Jarada. The Jarada accept the greeting, heralding the start of successful negotiations.\n\n==Production==\n[[image:MainTitleMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|References were deliberately included in \"The Big Goodbye\" to the 1941 film ''The Maltese Falcon''.]]\nThe initial idea for Picard's detective based holodeck program came from series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and other writing staff.

The episode's name is itself a reference to two works by [[detective fiction]] writer [[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' and ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]''.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

Kashgar is close to China's border with the independent states of former [[Soviet Central Asia]] and the SEZ seeks to capitalize on international trade links between China and those states.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/25/china-s-hottest-cities-and-kashgar.html|title=A New Shenzhen|author=Fish, Isaac Stone|date=2010-09-25|accessdate=2011-07-29|magazine=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref>\n\n== List of SEZs ==\nAs part of its economic reforms and policy of opening to the world, between 1980 and 1984 China established [[special economic zone|special economic zones]] (SEZs) in [[Shantou]], [[Shenzhen]], and [[Zhuhai]] in [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] and [[Xiamen]] in [[Fujian|Fujian Province]] and designated the entire island province of [[Hainan]] a special economic zone.\n\nIn 1984, China opened 14 other coastal cities to overseas investment (listed north to south): [[Dalian]], [[Qinhuangdao]], [[Tianjin]], [[Yantai]], [[Qingdao]], [[Lianyungang]], [[Nantong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Ningbo]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhanjiang]], and [[Beihai]].\n\nThen, beginning in 1985, the central government expanded the coastal area by establishing the following open economic zones (listed north to south): the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Hebei|Hebei Province]] (which surrounds [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]; see [[Jing-Jin-Ji]]), the [[Shandong Peninsula]], [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Xiamen]]-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in southern [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], the [[Pearl River Delta]], and [[Guangxi|Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]].\n\nIn 1990, the Chinese government decided to open the [[Pudong|Pudong New Area]] in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, as well as more cities in the Yang Zi River Valley.\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of border cities and all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions.\n\nIn addition, 15 free-trade zones, 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and high-tech industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As a result, a multilevel diversified pattern of opening and integrating coastal areas with river, border, and inland areas has been formed in China.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type\n!

The policy change to a more liberalized economy is identified using SEZ variables as instrumental variables. The results indicate that export and [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] growth have positive and [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] effects on economic growth in these countries. The presence of SEZs increases regional growth but increasing the number of SEZs has negligible effect on growth. The key to faster economic growth appears to be a greater pace of liberalization.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Economy of China]]\n* [[Megalopolises in China]]\n* [[New areas]]\n* [[Special administrative regions of China]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Chee Kian Leong, 2007, A Tale of Two Countries: Openness and Growth in China and India [http://www.degit.ifw-kiel.de/papers/degit_12/C012_042.pdf], Dynamics, Economic Growth, and International Trade (DEGIT) Conference Paper.\n* Chee Kian Leong, (forthcoming), Special economic zones and growth in China and India: an empirical investigation,[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10368-012-0223-6] International Economics and Economic Policy.\n\n== External links ==\n*Chung-Tong Wu.
