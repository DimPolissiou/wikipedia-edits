A [[England v Scotland representative football matches (1870\u20131872)|representative match between England and Scotland]] was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the [[The Football Association|Football Association]]. A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872. This match, played at [[Hamilton Crescent]] in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association.<ref>{{cite web |title=England Match No. 1&nbsp;\u2013 Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 30 November 1872&nbsp;\u2013 Match Summary and Report |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |publisher=englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=22 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203105311/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |archive-date=3 December 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three [[Home Nations]]\u2014Scotland, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]\u2014in the [[British Home Championship]].\n\nAt first, England had no permanent home stadium. They joined [[FIFA]] in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908. [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. The relationship between England and FIFA became strained, and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. As a result, they did not compete in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] until [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], in which they were beaten in a [[United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1\u20130 defeat]] by the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/7823072/England-v-USA-1950-World-Cup-win-over-the-Three-Lions-lives-long-in-the-memory.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Tim |last=Hart |title=England v USA: 1950 World Cup win over the Three Lions lives long in the memory |date=12 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nTheir first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a [[1949 England v Ireland football match|2\u20130 loss]] to [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], on 21 September 1949 at [[Goodison Park]].

The [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted in England and Ramsey guided England to victory with a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4\u20132 win]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] after [[extra time]] in the final, during which [[Geoff Hurst]] scored a [[hat-trick]]. In [[UEFA Euro 1968]], the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nEngland qualified for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2\u20130 up, but were eventually beaten 3\u20132 after [[extra time]]. They failed in qualification for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], leading to Ramsey's dismissal.\n\n===Don Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson===\nRamsey was succeeded by [[Don Revie]] between 1974 and 1977, but the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1976]] and the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. Under [[Ron Greenwood]], they managed to qualify for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain (the first time competitively since 1962); despite not losing a game, they were eliminated in the second group stage.\n\n[[Bobby Robson]] managed England from 1982 to 1990. Although the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1984]], they reached the quarter-finals of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], losing 2\u20131 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a game made famous by two goals by [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] for very contrasting reasons - the first being knocked in by hand, prompting the \"Hand of God\" label, the second being an outstanding individual goal, involving dribbling past several opponents. England striker [[Gary Lineker]] finished as the tournament's top scorer with six goals.\n\nEngland went on to lose every match at [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. They next achieved their second best result in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing fourth&nbsp;\u2013 losing again to West Germany in a semi-final finishing 1\u20131 after [[extra time]], then 4\u20133 in England's first [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. Despite losing to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, the members of the England team were given bronze medals identical to the Italians'. Due to the emotional nature of the defeat to West Germany<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt0xx3So6zw&feature=emb_logo</ref>, the team were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets for an open-top bus parade.\n\n===Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan===\nThe 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] was Robson's immediate successor. England failed to win any matches at [[UEFA Euro 1992]], drawing with tournament winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and later with [[France national football team|France]], before being eliminated by host nation [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. The team then failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] after losing a controversial game against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, [[Terry Venables]] managed the team. At [[UEFA Euro 1996]], held in England, they equalled their best performance at a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via a penalty shoot-out loss to Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live |title =England v West Germany at Italia '90 \u2013 as it happened|date=27 March 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> England striker [[Alan Shearer]] was the tournament's top scorer with five goals.

He guided England to the quarter-finals of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. England lost only five competitive matches during his tenure, and England rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. Eriksson's contract was extended by the FA by two years, to include [[UEFA Euro 2008]], but was terminated by them after the 2006 World Cup.\n\n[[Steve McClaren]] was then appointed as head coach, but after failing to qualify for Euro 2008 was sacked on 22 November 2007. The following month, he was replaced by a second foreign manager, Italian [[Fabio Capello]], whose experience included spells at [[Juventus]] and [[Real Madrid]]. England won all but one of their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|qualifying games]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], but at the tournament itself, England drew their opening two games; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rifts appear as players grow tired of Capello regime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jun/21/england-john-terry-fabio-capello |date=21 June 2010 |last=Gibson |first=Owen |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 July 2010 |location=London}}</ref> They progressed to the next round, however, where they were beaten 4\u20131 by [[Germany national football team|Germany]], their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match.

shirts, navy blue shorts and white or black socks. The team has periodically worn an all-white kit.\n\nAlthough England's first [[away kit]]s were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]] in the semi-final of [[Euro 1996]] but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. The away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.\n\nEngland have occasionally had a third kit. At the 1970 World Cup England wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They had a kit similar to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973. For the World Cup in 1986 England had a third kit of pale blue, imitating that worn in Mexico 16 years before and England retained pale blue third kits until 1992, but they were rarely used.\n\n[[Umbro]] first agreed to manufacture the kit in 1954 and since then has supplied most of the kits, the exceptions being from 1959\u20131965 with [[Bukta]] and 1974\u20131984 with [[Admiral Sportswear|Admiral]]. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] purchased Umbro in 2008 and took over as kit supplier in 2013 following their sale of the Umbro brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=England's Uniforms and Playing Kits|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamunif/Unif.html|website=EnglandFootballOnline.com|accessdate=30 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115085155/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/Unif.html|archive-date=15 January 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\nkits\n\n{{Football kit box\n|width=180\n|filetype=png\n|alt=\n|pattern_la=_eng18h\n|pattern_b=_eng18h\n|pattern_ra=_eng18h\n|leftarm=FFFFF\n|body=FFFFF\n|rightarm=FFFFF\n|shorts=FFFFF\n|pattern_sh=_eng18h\n|pattern_so=_eng18hlong\n|socks=FFFFF\n|title=This is the kit worn by england Away to Kosovo on 17th November 2019\n|align=\n}}\n\n===Crest===\nThe motif of the England national football team has three lions ''passant guardant'', the emblem of King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], who reigned from 1189 to 1199.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cartwright|first1=Justin|title=Richard the Lionheart: battle addict who spent much of his life in France|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/14/richard-lionheart-battle-addict-france|accessdate=16 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407080237/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/14/richard-lionheart-battle-addict-france|archive-date=7 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1872, English players wore white jerseys emblazoned with the three lions crest of the Football Association.<ref name=kits/> The lions, often blue, have had minor changes to colour and appearance.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Henry|title=England identity crisis ahead as FA rejig Three Lions|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/4928389/England-identity-crisis-ahead-as-FA-rejig-Three-Lions.html|accessdate=16 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205110708/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/4928389/England-identity-crisis-ahead-as-FA-rejig-Three-Lions.html|archive-date=5 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Initially topped by a crown, this was removed in 1949 when the FA was given an official coat of arms by the [[College of Arms]];

They initially used [[cricket]] grounds before later moving on to football club stadiums. The original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]] was built in [[Wembley]], London, for the [[British Empire Exhibition]].\n\nEngland played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against Scotland and for the next 27 years Wembley was used as a venue for matches against Scotland only. The stadium later became known simply as Wembley Stadium and it became England's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. In October 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a [[2000 England v Germany football match|defeat]].\n\nThis stadium was demolished during the period of 2002\u20132003, and work began to completely rebuild it. During this time, England played at venues across the country, though by the time of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|2006 World Cup qualification]], this had largely settled down to having [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] stadium as the primary venue, with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[St. James' Park, Newcastle|St. James' Park]] used on occasions when Old Trafford was unavailable.\n\nThey returned to the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in March 2007. The stadium is now owned by the Football Association, via its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Limited.\n\n===Media coverage===\nAll England matches are broadcast with full commentary on [[talkSPORT]] and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. From the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]] season until the 2017\u201318 season, England's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (often with the exception of [[STV (TV network)|STV]], the ITV franchisee in central and northern [[Scotland]]). England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on [[Setanta Sports]] until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between \u00a34.99 and \u00a311.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000.<ref>{{cite news

[[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and have subsequently qualified for a total of 15 FIFA World Cup finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. They are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside Spain. The national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one [[FIFA World Cup]] title. The England team won their first and only World Cup title in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. The tournament was played on home soil, and England defeated [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 4\u20132 in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. In [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished in fourth place, losing 2\u20131 to host nation [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-final. They also finished in fourth place in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], after losing 2\u20130 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the third place play-off and 2\u20131 to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the semi-final after extra time. The team also reached the quarter-final stage in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].\n\nEngland failed to qualify for the World Cup in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. The team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and, most recently, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. This was after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Group D. In 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. In [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], England suffered its most resounding World Cup defeat, 4\u20131 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]], in the Round of 16 stage. This came after drawing with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], and defeating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1\u20130 in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|group stage]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:white; color:#0B0B3F; {{box-shadow

the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[UEFA European Championship]] and the [[UEFA Nations League]]. England, as a [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country of the United Kingdom]], is not a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and therefore the national team does not compete at the [[Olympic Games]].\n\nEngland is one of the two oldest national teams in football, alongside [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], whom they played in the world's [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first international football match]] in 1872. England's home ground is [[Wembley Stadium]], London, and their headquarters is at [[St George's Park National Football Centre|St George's Park]], [[Burton upon Trent]]. The team's manager is [[Gareth Southgate]]. \n\nSince first entering the tournament in 1950, England has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] 15 times. They won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], when they hosted [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the finals]], and finished fourth in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]].

A [[England v Scotland representative football matches (1870\u20131872)|representative match between England and Scotland]] was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the [[The Football Association|Football Association]]. A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872. This match, played at [[Hamilton Crescent]] in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association.<ref>{{cite web |title=England Match No. 1&nbsp;\u2013 Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 30 November 1872&nbsp;\u2013 Match Summary and Report |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |publisher=englandfootballonline.com |accessdate=22 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203105311/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |archive-date=3 December 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three [[Home Nations]]\u2014Scotland, [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]\u2014in the [[British Home Championship]].\n\nAt first, England had no permanent home stadium. They joined [[FIFA]] in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908. [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. The relationship between England and FIFA became strained, and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. As a result, they did not compete in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] until [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], in which they were beaten in a [[United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1\u20130 defeat]] by the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/7823072/England-v-USA-1950-World-Cup-win-over-the-Three-Lions-lives-long-in-the-memory.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Tim |last=Hart |title=England v USA: 1950 World Cup win over the Three Lions lives long in the memory |date=12 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nTheir first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a [[1949 England v Ireland football match|2\u20130 loss]] to [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], on 21 September 1949 at [[Goodison Park]].

(7936243534).jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth II]] presenting England captain [[Bobby Moore]] with the Jules Rimet trophy following England's 4\u20132 victory over West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final]]\nAlthough [[Walter Winterbottom]] was appointed as England's first ever full-time manager in 1946, the team was still picked by a committee until [[Alf Ramsey]] took over in 1963. The [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted in England and Ramsey guided England to victory with a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4\u20132 win]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] after [[extra time]] in the final, during which [[Geoff Hurst]] scored a [[hat-trick]]. In [[UEFA Euro 1968]], the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nEngland qualified for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2\u20130 up, but were eventually beaten 3\u20132 after [[extra time]]. They failed in qualification for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], leading to Ramsey's dismissal.\n\n===Don Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson===\nRamsey was succeeded by [[Don Revie]] between 1974 and 1977, but the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1976]] and the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. Under [[Ron Greenwood]], they managed to qualify for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain (the first time competitively since 1962); despite not losing a game, they were eliminated in the second group stage.\n\n[[Bobby Robson]] managed England from 1982 to 1990. Although the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1984]], they reached the quarter-finals of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], losing 2\u20131 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a game made famous by two goals by [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] for very contrasting reasons - the first being knocked in by hand, prompting the \"Hand of God\" label, the second being an outstanding individual goal, involving dribbling past several opponents. England striker [[Gary Lineker]] finished as the tournament's top scorer with six goals.\n\nEngland went on to lose every match at [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. They next achieved their second best result in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing fourth&nbsp;\u2013 losing again to West Germany in a semi-final finishing 1\u20131 after [[extra time]], then 4\u20133 in England's first [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. Despite losing to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, the members of the England team were given bronze medals identical to the Italians'. Due to the emotional nature of the defeat to West Germany<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt0xx3So6zw&feature=emb_logo</ref>, the team were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets for an open-top bus parade.\n\n===Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan===\nThe 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] was Robson's immediate successor. England failed to win any matches at [[UEFA Euro 1992]], drawing with tournament winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and later with [[France national football team|France]], before being eliminated by host nation [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. The team then failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] after losing a controversial game against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, [[Terry Venables]] managed the team. At [[UEFA Euro 1996]], held in England, they equalled their best performance at a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via a penalty shoot-out loss to Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live |title =England v West Germany at Italia '90 \u2013 as it happened|date=27 March 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> England striker [[Alan Shearer]] was the tournament's top scorer with five goals.

Following Hoddle's departure, [[Kevin Keegan]] took England to [[UEFA Euro 2000]], but the team left in the group stage and he resigned shortly afterwards.\n\n===Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello===\n\n[[File:England team.jpg|thumb|left|The England team at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]]]\n[[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] took charge between 2001 and 2006, and was the team's first non-English manager. He guided England to the quarter-finals of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. England lost only five competitive matches during his tenure, and England rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. Eriksson's contract was extended by the FA by two years, to include [[UEFA Euro 2008]], but was terminated by them after the 2006 World Cup.\n\n[[Steve McClaren]] was then appointed as head coach, but after failing to qualify for Euro 2008 was sacked on 22 November 2007. The following month, he was replaced by a second foreign manager, Italian [[Fabio Capello]], whose experience included spells at [[Juventus]] and [[Real Madrid]]. England won all but one of their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|qualifying games]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], but at the tournament itself, England drew their opening two games; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rifts appear as players grow tired of Capello regime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jun/21/england-john-terry-fabio-capello |date=21 June 2010 |last=Gibson |first=Owen |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 July 2010 |location=London}}</ref> They progressed to the next round, however, where they were beaten 4\u20131 by [[Germany national football team|Germany]], their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match.

shirts, navy blue shorts and white or black socks. The team has periodically worn an all-white kit.\n\nAlthough England's first [[away kit]]s were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]] in the semi-final of [[Euro 1996]] but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. The away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.\n\nEngland have occasionally had a third kit. At the 1970 World Cup England wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They had a kit similar to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973. For the World Cup in 1986 England had a third kit of pale blue, imitating that worn in Mexico 16 years before and England retained pale blue third kits until 1992, but they were rarely used.\n\n[[Umbro]] first agreed to manufacture the kit in 1954 and since then has supplied most of the kits, the exceptions being from 1959\u20131965 with [[Bukta]] and 1974\u20131984 with [[Admiral Sportswear|Admiral]].

They initially used [[cricket]] grounds before later moving on to football club stadiums. The original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Empire Stadium]] was built in [[Wembley]], London, for the [[British Empire Exhibition]].\n\nEngland played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against Scotland and for the next 27 years Wembley was used as a venue for matches against Scotland only. The stadium later became known simply as Wembley Stadium and it became England's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. In October 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a [[2000 England v Germany football match|defeat]].\n\nThis stadium was demolished during the period of 2002\u20132003, and work began to completely rebuild it. During this time, England played at venues across the country, though by the time of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 UEFA Group 6|2006 World Cup qualification]], this had largely settled down to having [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] stadium as the primary venue, with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[St. James' Park, Newcastle|St. James' Park]] used on occasions when Old Trafford was unavailable.\n\nThey returned to the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in March 2007. The stadium is now owned by the Football Association, via its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Limited.\n\n===Media coverage===\nAll England matches are broadcast with full commentary on [[talkSPORT]] and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. From the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]] season until the 2017\u201318 season, England's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (often with the exception of [[STV (TV network)|STV]], the ITV franchisee in central and northern [[Scotland]]). England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on [[Setanta Sports]] until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between \u00a34.99 and \u00a311.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000.<ref>{{cite news

[[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and have subsequently qualified for a total of 15 FIFA World Cup finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. They are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside Spain. The national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one [[FIFA World Cup]] title. The England team won their first and only World Cup title in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. The tournament was played on home soil, and England defeated [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 4\u20132 in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. In [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished in fourth place, losing 2\u20131 to host nation [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-final. They also finished in fourth place in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], after losing 2\u20130 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the third place play-off and 2\u20131 to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the semi-final after extra time. The team also reached the quarter-final stage in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].\n\nEngland failed to qualify for the World Cup in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. The team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and, most recently, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. This was after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Group D. In 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. In [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], England suffered its most resounding World Cup defeat, 4\u20131 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]], in the Round of 16 stage.

This is due to the fact that its jurisdiction includes all of Yellowstone National Park, which extends slightly beyond Wyoming's boundaries into [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]].

This is due to the fact that its jurisdiction includes all of Yellowstone National Park, which extends slightly beyond Wyoming's boundaries into [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]. In addition, the federal government has [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over the park, so crimes committed in the park cannot be prosecuted under any of the states' laws.\n\nTrials in the district court are normally held at the federal courthouse in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. However, the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] decrees that juries in federal criminal cases must be made up of citizens who are from both the district ''and'' state where the crime was committed.

However, the lawmakers ignored Kalt's suggestion. In 2007, author [[C. J. Box|C.J. Box]] wrote a novel called ''Free Fire'' that featured the Zone, which Box hoped would increase governmental awareness. The novel did succeed in alerting Wyoming Senator [[Mike Enzi]] to the issue. However, Enzi was unable to convince Congress to discuss it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNo known felonies have been committed in the Zone of Death since Kalt's discovery. However, a poacher named Michael Belderrain illegally shot an [[elk]] in the Montana section of Yellowstone. While that section of the park does have enough residents to form a jury, it might be difficult to put together a standing and fair one due to travel or unwillingness of members of the small population there to serve. A federal judge ruled that Belderrain could be tried in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming, despite the 6th Amendment problem. Belderrain cited Kalt's paper \"The Perfect Crime\" to explain why he believed it was illegal to have his trial with a jury from a state other than where the crime was committed. The judge disagreed, Belderrain took a plea deal, and the issue was left unresolved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fb-firm.com/blog/2014/11/a-zone-of-death-in-yellowstone-national-park.shtml|title=A \"Zone of Death\" in Yellowstone National Park?|last=Mandell|first=Mark|publisher=Fausone Bohn, LLP|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12|date=November 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coords|44.29|-111.07|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Yellowstone National Park]]\n[[Category:United States Constitution Article Six case law]]\n", "name_user": "2600:6c56:6700:ee1c:b9b6:bff5:d574:ea20", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory:changed some things)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_Death_(legal)"}

The school enjoyed academic success and ensured that the Catholic Girls in and around Rickmansworth continued to received the best of education. In 1978, as with the majority of grammar schools across the country, St Joan of Arc moved to become a [[comprehensive school]] and switched to a co-educational facility. During 1978, the school also set the [[Guinness World Record]] for balloon bursting; the school managed to burst 2,000 balloons in 14 minutes 14.5 seconds <ref>{{cite web |last1=Pells |first1=Kelly |title=Nostalgia: School sets new world record in March 1978 |url=https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/18317612.nostalgia-school-sets-new-world-record-march-1978/ |website=Watford Observer |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>. \n\n===21st Century===\nIn 2002, pupils at the school worked together to relaunch the school website, becoming the first pupil-run website in the area and having been considered for the 2002 [[BECTA]] (British Educational Community and Technology Agency) awards <ref>{{cite web |title=St Joan of Arc: Watch out Bill Gates |url=https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/6406823.st-joan-of-arc-watch-out-bill-gates/ |website=Newshopper |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>.

Englefield was the large Edwardian house that currently houses the St Joan of Arc Sixth Form. This was to be the site for St Joan of Arc School until 1922. As the school went from strength to strength so the need for a larger premises became apparent. This need for greater space lead to the Mother Superior (Mother Septima) and Fr Julien acquiring \u2018The Elms\u2019.\n\nThe Elms was a grand Georgian estate built in 1728 consisting of the house and eleven and a half acres with a stream running through the grounds.

The school enjoyed academic success and ensured that the Catholic Girls in and around Rickmansworth continued to received the best of education. In 1978, as with the majority of grammar schools across the country, St Joan of Arc moved to become a [[comprehensive school]] and switched to a co-educational facility. During 1978, the school also set the [[Guinness World Record]] for balloon bursting; the school managed to burst 2,000 balloons in 14 minutes 14.5 seconds <ref>{{cite web |last1=Pells |first1=Kelly |title=Nostalgia: School sets new world record in March 1978 |url=https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/18317612.nostalgia-school-sets-new-world-record-march-1978/ |website=Watford Observer |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>. \n\n===21st Century===\nIn 2002, pupils at the school worked together to relaunch the school website, becoming the first pupil-run website in the area and having been considered for the 2002 [[BECTA]] (British Educational Community and Technology Agency) awards <ref>{{cite web |title=St Joan of Arc: Watch out Bill Gates |url=https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/6406823.st-joan-of-arc-watch-out-bill-gates/ |website=Newshopper |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>. The school was awarded Specialist Status for Mathematics & Computing in 2003 and in 2012, St Joan of Arc converted to become an [[Academy (English school)|academy]] as the founding school of the 'All Saints Catholic Academy Trust' (ASCAT). Since changing to Academy status, the schools OFSTED rating was lowered from 'Outstanding' to 'Good'; headteacher Mr Sweeny cited changes in the methods used by OFSTED as one of the reasons for the difference.<ref>https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/11005899.secondary-school-goes-from-outstanding-to-good-after-inspection/</ref>.\n\nDuring the 2019 [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Coronavirus]] outbreak, as per national guidelines<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weale |first1=Sally |title=Coronavirus: why are UK schools closing and what does it mean for parents? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-why-are-uk-schools-closing-and-what-does-it-mean-for-parents |website=The Guardian |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>, St Joan of Arc closed completely and with other schools in the district donated vital protective equiprment to local hospitals to help the fight against the virus <ref>{{cite web |title=Further actions  Schools donate vital protective equipment to local hospitals to help fight coronavirus |url=https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/about-the-council/news/press-releases/schools-donate-vital-protective-equipment-to-local-hospitals-to-help-fight-coronavirus.aspx |website=Hertfordshire.gov |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\n== School site ==\n\nThe school is located about {{convert|0.6|km|mi|sigfig=1}} from [[Rickmansworth station]] in Rickmansworth Town Centre.\n\nThe Parish priest at St Mary's in Rickmansworth, Fr Julien, bought the initial property, 11 High Street, known as \u2018Englefield\u2019 and this was to become the original site for St Joan of Arc School. Englefield was the large Edwardian house that currently houses the St Joan of Arc Sixth Form. This was to be the site for St Joan of Arc School until 1922. As the school went from strength to strength so the need for a larger premises became apparent. This need for greater space lead to the Mother Superior (Mother Septima) and Fr Julien acquiring \u2018The Elms\u2019.\n\nThe Elms was a grand Georgian estate built in 1728 consisting of the house and eleven and a half acres with a stream running through the grounds. This created an ideal learning environment for the Catholic girls of Rickmansworth and its surrounding area. The house was famous for being the residence of [[George Eliot]] at the time that she was writing Daniel Deronda.<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1100848 National Heritage List for England] St Joan of Arc's Convent High School], ''Images of England'', [[English Heritage]] National Monuments Record.</ref>\n\nThe school grounds back on to the [[River Chess]] and Chess Valley and a 17th-century barn that once belonged to the Abbot of [[St Albans Cathedral]] is located at the boundary of the grounds.<ref>https://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/3176075.Ancient_barn_revealed_/</ref>\n\n==Houses==\nIn total there are eight forms in each year, with about 30 pupils in each.

The facility serves as the primary base of operations for the bulk of the senior offices within the [[Organization of the National Archives and Records Administration|organization of the National Archives]].  The facility operates in tandem with the [[National Archives Building]] in Washington, D.C. which serves as the ceremonial headquarters of the National Archives in that this is where the [[Archivist of the United States]] maintains his primary office.\n\n==History==\nThe National Archives building at College Park was constructed in 1994, mostly to alleviate space constraints at the aged National Archives Building in Washington which, by that time, had become incapable of holding further numbers of records transferred in from various branches of the government.  Due to its more modern facilities, the Archives at College Park quickly assumed a role as the de facto headquarters of the National Archives, hosting several of the more important operational and administrative offices.  Officially, the seat of the National Archives remains at the National Archives building in Washington, D.C.\n[[File:ArchivesCollegeParkAir.jpg|thumb|295px|Aerial view of the facility in 1998]]\n\n==Holdings==\nThe National Archives at College Park primarily holds government records of the 20th century and receives current holdings from the 21st century as they become available from government agencies.  The center also possesses a small number of 19th century (and earlier) records; however, the bulk of these historic holdings are maintained at the National Archives Building in Washington.  A security vault is maintained at College Park which contains high profile historical artifacts.  Among these include burned wreckage from the [[Branch Davidians|Branch Davidian]] compound in [[Waco, Texas]] as well as the [[last will and testament of Adolf Hitler]].<ref>National Archives and Records Administration, \"Annual Holdings Reports\" (Volume 75), June 13, 2011</ref>\n[[File:NARA Backstage Pass (2011-08) - 07.jpg|thumb|right]NARA Backstage Pass (2011\u201308) \u2013 07|Storage area]]\n\nApproximately 80% of the records on file at College Park are open to the public.  The remainder are considered classified records and may only be reviewed by authorized government agencies.  For records which contain [[personally identifiable information]], but which are not classified, the National Archives at College Park maintains a Special Access Office (typically known as the \"[[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] branch\") which reviews and redacts records prior to release to a public researcher.\n\nIn 1995, the [[Berlin Document Center]] provided to the National Archives at College Park a large number of microfiche records relating to [[Nazi Germany]].  These included [[service record]]s of the [[SS]], [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]], as well as German governmental ministry records from [[World War II]].  The center did not transfer personnel records of the regular German armed forces, which are maintained still at various facilities in Germany.<ref>National Archives and Records Administration, \"Records of Foreign Records Seized\", [https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/242.html RG242]</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:US National Archives II.jpg|thumb|right|275px|National Archives at College Park]]\nThe National Archives at College Park is overseen by the [[Organization_of_the_National_Archives_and_Records_Administration#Access_Coordinators|Access Coordinator]] for the Washington, D.C. archives region.  The building does not have a single director, but is instead divided into several divisions which maintain day-to-day operations.  The building also contains the office of the chief operating officer as well as several other senior National Archives executives.  The [[Archivist of the United States]] maintains an auxiliary office on the premises, but mostly conducts business from the archives building in Washington.\n\n===Research Room operations===\nThe National Archives at College Park maintains the most number of research rooms of any National Archives facility, in total there are five separate research rooms including a researcher orientation and registration center.<ref>Washington Post, \"New archives building largest in country\", April 17, 1995</ref> The research rooms are organized as follows.\n\n* 1st Floor: Researcher Registration and Orientation\n* 2nd Floor: Textual Research Room\n* 3rd Floor: Cartographic Research Room\n* 4th Floor: Microfilm Research Room\n* 5th Floor: Photographic Research Room\n* 6th Floor: Classified Research Room\n\nThe director of research room operations also oversees \"pull and refile section\" which physically retrieve records from the archival record area and deliver them to on-site researchers in the research room.  Written correspondence concerning reference requests is handled through the Textual Records Division which is a separate office from the research room.\n\n===Textual Records===\nThe Textual Records Division of Archives II prepares records for release to the public and also responds to written inquires concerning records already on file.  Until 2020, the three main branches of the textual records division were:\n\n* '''Accessioning''': Physically receives records into the National Archives from government agencies.  The Accessioning Branch is divided into two divisions, the first for records which are automatically and annually transferred to the National Archives each year (known as \"Annual Move\" records) while the second division deals with records which are offered to the National Archives on a case by case basis from the government (known as \"Direct Offer\" records).  A small portion of the Accessioning office is also devoted to reviewing donated records to the National archives, which are known as \"gifted\" records.\n* '''Processing''': The Processing Branch organizes newly received records into understandable and coherent files which may be easily understood by researchers.  This normally involves creating file lists for records and reboxing the records into user friendly containers rather than the shipping type boxes in which records are provided by the government.  The Processing Branch further enters records information into the National Archives Catalog.\n*'''Reference''': The Reference Branch of Textual Records responds to all written correspondence concerning the holdings at College Park and provides referral information for other records in other National Archives facilities.  The reference archivists also work in tandem with research room operations and provide on-site consultation for researchers seeking specific types of records.  There are two divisions of the reference branch respectively, concerning military records and records of the civilian United States government.  Military records at College Park pertain primarily to organizational records, orders, and [[after action report]]s.  Military personnel records of individual service members are stored at the [[Military Personnel Records Center]] in [[St. Louis]].\n\nBeginning in 2020, the Textual Records Division of Archives II underwent a major reorganization<ref>\"Textual Reference Division - Baseline Position Staffing\", National Archives & Records Administration (2020)</ref> where the offices of Accessioning, Processing, and Reference were merged into two new offices as follows:\n\n* '''Accessioning, Basic Processing, & Holdings Security'''\n* '''Reference, Research Rooms, & Augmented Processing'''\n\nThe merger also placed operation of the research rooms, previously as their own office branch, under the Textual Records Division and further divided into:\n\n* '''Reference and Researcher Registration'''\n* '''Research Room Pulls and Monitoring'''\n\n===Special Media records===\nSpecial media records at College Park include [[cartography|cartographic]], photographic, and record series consisting of motion pictures which includes records on [[videotape]].  The special media records division also maintains two conservation labs for film preservation as well as the upkeep of records on [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]].  Records on [[microfilm]] are typically not considered special media, but rather as regular textual records.\n\n===Electronic records===\nBeginning in the early 2000s, the National Archives began a dedicated effort to provide specific records support for [[Digital data|electronic data]]. The Electronic Records Division is essentially a mirror of the textual (paper) division of the National Archives at College Park and contains its own accessioning, processing and reference branch for dealing with electronic records. The branch also maintains a \"Digital Preservation Service Office\" for the upkeep of records in electronic format.\n\n==Relationship to Archives I==\nTo avoid duplicate offices, the National Archives at College Park oversees several of the functions of the main National Archives building in downtown Washington.  The overseen offices are known as \"Archives I offices\" and consist of the Archives I Research Room, overseen by Research Room operations in College Park, as well as the Archives I Processing Branch which is considered an extension of the processing office of Archives II.  \n\nAll references correspondence from the Archives I building is under direction of the Archives II Textual Records Division.  The intake and accessioning of all records to Archives I (which in the modern day are few) is also overseen by College Park and Archives I does not maintain an independent accessioning office.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n\n{{College Park, Maryland}}\n\n{{coord|39.0011|-76.9595|format=dms|type:landmark_region:US-MD|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:College Park, Maryland]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Prince George's County, Maryland]]\n[[Category:National Archives and Records Administration]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Archives II, a newer research and storage facility of the National Archives, in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C LCCN2011633193.tif|thumb|right|\"Archives II,\" a newer research and storage facility of the National Archives, in the [[Maryland]] suburbs of Washington]]\nThe '''National Archives at College Park''' (also known as \"Archives II\") is a [[National Archives facilities|major facility]] of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] of the United States which is located in [[College Park, Maryland]].
