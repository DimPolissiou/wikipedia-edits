It has an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of 5.5,<ref name=aaa418_989/> which is [[Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|bright enough]] to be seen with the naked eye outside of urban areas.\n\n18 Scorpii has some physical properties in common with the [[Sun]], a [[G-type star]]. Cayrel de Strobel (1996) included it in her review of the stars most similar to the Sun,<ref name=aar7_3_243/> and Porto de Mello & da Silva (1997) identified it as a younger [[solar twin]].<ref>[http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1337a/ ESO, The life cycle of a Sun-like star (annotated), from [[European Southern Observatory]], 28 August 2013]</ref><ref name=apj482_2_L89/> Some scientists therefore believe the prospects for [[life]] in its vicinity are good. However, no planet has yet been discovered orbiting this star.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:18 scorpii-map.png|left|240px|thumb|18 scorpii is on the northern boundary of the constellation. Its high [[proper motion]] positions it in Ophiuchus before 1700.]]\n18 Scorpii is a [[main sequence]] star of [[stellar classification|spectral and luminosity type]] G2&nbsp;Va,<ref name=apj482_2_L89/> with the luminosity class of 'V' indicating it is generating energy through the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in its core region. Sousa ''et al.'' (2008) found its [[metallicity]] to be about 1.1 times that of the Sun, which means the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium is 10% greater.<ref name=aaa487_1_373/><ref name=metal/> The radius of this star, as measured using [[Astronomical interferometer|interferometry]] by Bazot ''et al.'' (2011), is 101% the [[Solar radius|radius of the Sun]]. When combined with the results of [[asteroseismology]] measurements, this allows the mass of the star to be estimated as 102% of the [[Solar mass|Sun's mass]].<ref name=aaa526_L4/> This star is radiating 106% of the Sun's luminosity from its [[stellar atmosphere|outer atmosphere]] at an [[effective temperature]] of 5,433&nbsp;K.<ref name=apj746_1_101/> It is this heat that gives the star the yellow-hued glow of a [[G-type star]].<ref name=csiro/>\n\nAccording to Lockwood (2002), it has a temporal [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] behavior very similar to the Sun.<ref name=baas34_651/> Its brightness variation over its entire activity cycle is 0.09%, about the same as the Sun's brightness variations during recent solar cycles.<ref name=aj133_5_2206/> Using the technique of [[Zeeman-Doppler imaging]], Petit et al. (2008) have detected its surface magnetic field, showing that its intensity and geometry are very similar to the large-scale solar magnetic field.<ref name=mnras388_1_80/> The estimated period for the activity cycle of 18 Scorpii is about seven years,<ref name=aj138_1_312/> which is significantly shorter than the Sun's, and its overall chromospheric activity level is noticeably higher.<ref name=aj133_5_2206/><ref name=apj545_2_L43/> Like the Sun, it has a hot [[stellar corona|corona]] with a temperature in the range of 1.5\u20132&nbsp;MK and an [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] luminosity of {{nowrap|8 \u00b1 1.5 ergs s<sup>\u22121</sup>}}.<ref name=baas42_333/>\n\nThough 18 Scorpii is only slightly more metal-rich overall than the Sun, its lithium abundance is about three times as high; for this reason, Mel\u00e9ndez & Ram\u00edrez (2007) have suggested that 18 Scorpii be called a \"quasi solar twin\", reserving the term [[solar twin]] for stars (such as [[Hipparcos catalogue|HIP]] [[HIP 56948|56948]]) that match the Sun, within the observational errors, for all parameters.<ref name=apj669_2_L89/>\n\n18 Scorpii is a young star at 2.9 Gyr (2.9 Billion years old). 18 Scorpii has not yet entered its stable burning stage. The Sun at 4.7 Gyr is at its most stable stage. Due to 18 Scorpii age, it is at the edge of range for a solar twin, and is more of a Solar analog.<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = astro-ph/0508004|last1 = King|first1 = Jeremy R|title = Keck/HIRES Spectroscopy of Four Candidate Solar Twins|journal = The Astronomical Journal|volume = 130|issue = 5|pages = 2318\u20132325|last2 = Boesgaard|first2 = Ann M|last3 = Schuler|first3 = Simon C|year = 2005|doi = 10.1086/452640|bibcode = 2005AJ....130.2318K}}</ref>\n\n18 Scorpii was identified in September 2003 by astrobiologist [[Margaret Turnbull]] from the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]] as one of the most promising nearby candidates for hosting life, based on her analysis of the [[HabCat]] list of stars.

It has an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of 5.5,<ref name=aaa418_989/> which is [[Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|bright enough]] to be seen with the naked eye outside of urban areas.\n\n18 Scorpii has some physical properties in common with the [[Sun]], a [[G-type star|G-type]] star. Cayrel de Strobel (1996) included it in her review of the stars most similar to the Sun,<ref name=aar7_3_243/> and Porto de Mello & da Silva (1997) identified it as a younger [[solar twin]].<ref>[http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1337a/ ESO, The life cycle of a Sun-like star (annotated), from [[European Southern Observatory]], 28 August 2013]</ref><ref name=apj482_2_L89/> Some scientists therefore believe the prospects for [[life]] in its vicinity are good. However, no planet has yet been discovered orbiting this star.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:18 scorpii-map.png|left|240px|thumb|18 scorpii is on the northern boundary of the constellation. Its high [[proper motion]] positions it in Ophiuchus before 1700.]]\n18 Scorpii is a [[main sequence]] star of [[stellar classification|spectral and luminosity type]] G2&nbsp;Va,<ref name=apj482_2_L89/> with the luminosity class of 'V' indicating it is generating energy through the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in its core region. Sousa ''et al.'' (2008) found its [[metallicity]] to be about 1.1 times that of the Sun, which means the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium is 10% greater.<ref name=aaa487_1_373/><ref name=metal/> The radius of this star, as measured using [[Astronomical interferometer|interferometry]] by Bazot ''et al.'' (2011), is 101% the [[Solar radius|radius of the Sun]]. When combined with the results of [[asteroseismology]] measurements, this allows the mass of the star to be estimated as 102% of the [[Solar mass|Sun's mass]].<ref name=aaa526_L4/> This star is radiating 106% of the Sun's luminosity from its [[stellar atmosphere|outer atmosphere]] at an [[effective temperature]] of 5,433&nbsp;K.<ref name=apj746_1_101/> It is this heat that gives the star the yellow-hued glow of a [[G-type star]].<ref name=csiro/>\n\nAccording to Lockwood (2002), it has a temporal [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] behavior very similar to the Sun.<ref name=baas34_651/> Its brightness variation over its entire activity cycle is 0.09%, about the same as the Sun's brightness variations during recent solar cycles.<ref name=aj133_5_2206/> Using the technique of [[Zeeman-Doppler imaging]], Petit et al. (2008) have detected its surface magnetic field, showing that its intensity and geometry are very similar to the large-scale solar magnetic field.<ref name=mnras388_1_80/> The estimated period for the activity cycle of 18 Scorpii is about seven years,<ref name=aj138_1_312/> which is significantly shorter than the Sun's, and its overall chromospheric activity level is noticeably higher.<ref name=aj133_5_2206/><ref name=apj545_2_L43/> Like the Sun, it has a hot [[corona]] with a temperature in the range of 1.5\u20132&nbsp;MK and an [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] luminosity of {{nowrap|8 \u00b1 1.5 ergs s<sup>\u22121</sup>}}.<ref name=baas42_333/>\n\nThough 18 Scorpii is only slightly more metal-rich overall than the Sun, its lithium abundance is about three times as high; for this reason, Mel\u00e9ndez & Ram\u00edrez (2007) have suggested that 18 Scorpii be called a \"quasi solar twin\", reserving the term [[solar twin]] for stars (such as [[Hipparcos catalogue|HIP]] [[HIP 56948|56948]]) that match the Sun, within the observational errors, for all parameters.<ref name=apj669_2_L89/>\n\n18 Scorpii is a young star at 2.9 Gyr (2.9 Billion years old). 18 Scorpii has not yet entered its stable burning stage. The Sun at 4.7 Gyr is at its most stable stage. Due to 18 Scorpii age, it is at the edge of range for a solar twin, and is more of a Solar analog.<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = astro-ph/0508004|last1 = King|first1 = Jeremy R|title = Keck/HIRES Spectroscopy of Four Candidate Solar Twins|journal = The Astronomical Journal|volume = 130|issue = 5|pages = 2318\u20132325|last2 = Boesgaard|first2 = Ann M|last3 = Schuler|first3 = Simon C|year = 2005|doi = 10.1086/452640|bibcode = 2005AJ....130.2318K}}</ref>\n\n18 Scorpii was identified in September 2003 by astrobiologist [[Margaret Turnbull]] from the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]] as one of the most promising nearby candidates for hosting life, based on her analysis of the [[HabCat]] list of stars.

It was built on the [[chassis]] of the proven [[Panzer III]] tank, replacing the turret with [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|an armored, fixed superstructure]] mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile [[assault gun]] for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was continually modified, and much like the later ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'', was employed as a [[tank destroyer]].\n\n==Development==\nThe ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' originated from German experiences in [[World War I]], when it was discovered that, during the offensives on the Western Front, the infantry lacked the means to effectively engage fortifications. The artillery of the time was heavy and not mobile enough to keep up with the advancing infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes, and other minor fortifications with direct fire. Although the problem was well known in the German army, it was General [[Erich von Manstein]] who is considered the father of the ''Sturmartillerie'' (assault artillery). The initial proposal was from von Manstein and submitted to General [[Ludwig Beck]] in 1935, suggesting that ''Sturmartillerie'' units should be used in a direct-fire support role for infantry divisions. On 15&nbsp;June 1936, [[Daimler-Benz]] AG received an order to develop an armoured infantry support vehicle capable of mounting a {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on|2}} calibre artillery piece. The gun mount's fixed, fully integrated [[casemate]] superstructure was to allow a limited traverse of a minimum of 25\u00b0 and provide overhead protection for the crew.<ref>Military Intelligence Service, ''Artillery in the Desert'' (Department of War, 25&nbsp;November 1942), p.19, says depression 5\u00b0, elevation 20\u00b0, traverse only 20\u00b0 on a captured sample.</ref> The height of the vehicle was not to exceed that of the average soldier.\n\nDaimler-Benz AG used the chassis and running gear of its recent Panzer III medium tank as a basis for the new vehicle. Prototype manufacture was passed over to [[Alkett]], which produced five prototypes in 1937 on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis. These prototypes featured a [[mild steel]] superstructure and a [[Krupp]] short-barrelled, [[howitzer]]-like in appearance, [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] cannon. Production vehicles with this gun were known as '''''Gepanzerte Selbstfahrlafette f\u00fcr Sturmgesch\u00fctz 7.5&nbsp;cm Kanone Ausf\u00fchrung A bis D (Sd.Kfz.142)'''''.\n\nWhile the StuG was considered self-propelled artillery, it was not clear which land combat arm of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] would handle the new weapon. The ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'' (armoured corps), the natural user of tracked fighting vehicles, had no resources to spare for the formation of StuG units and neither did the infantry. It was agreed that it would best be employed as part of the artillery arm. The StuGs were organized into battalions (later renamed \"brigades\" for disinformation purposes) and followed their own doctrine. Infantry support using direct-fire was its intended role. Later, there was also a strong emphasis on its use as an anti-tank gun.\n\nAs the StuG was designed to fill an infantry close support combat role, early models were fitted with a [[howitzer]]-pattern, low-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun, much as [[Panzer IV#Ausf. A to Ausf. F1|the earliest versions]] of the fully turreted [[Panzer IV]] were. Low-velocity shells are lightly built of thin steel and carry a large charge of explosive, to destroy soft-skin targets and blast fortifications. Such shells do not penetrate armour well. After the Germans encountered the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] and [[T-34]] tanks, the StuG was first equipped with a high-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] main gun (spring 1942) and in the autumn of 1942 with the slightly longer [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun. These high-velocity guns were the same as those mounted on the [[Panzer IV]] for anti-tank use but the heavy steel wall high-velocity shells carried much less explosive and had a lower blast effect for use against infantry or field fortifications. These versions were known as the '''''7.5&nbsp;cm Sturmgesch\u00fctz 40 Ausf.F'', ''Ausf. F/8'' and '' Ausf. G (Sd.Kfz.142/1)'''''.\n\nBeginning with the StuG III Ausf. G from December 1942, a [[7.92\u00d757&nbsp;mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[MG34]] machine gun could be mounted on a shield on top of the superstructure for added anti-infantry protection. Some of the F/8 models were retrofitted with a shield. An additional coaxial 7.92&nbsp;mm MG34 was introduced in Mid 1944 for some production and all production by autumn 1944.\n\nThe vehicles of the ''Sturmgesch\u00fctz'' series were cheaper and faster to build than contemporary German [[tank]]s; at 82,500 [[German Reichsmark|RM]], a StuG III Ausf G was cheaper than a [[Panzer III]] Ausf. M, which cost 103,163 RM. This was due to the omission of the turret, which greatly simplified manufacture and allowed the chassis to carry a larger gun. By the end of the war, ~11,300 StuG IIIs and StuH 42s had been built.<ref name=wwiivehicles>[http://www.wwiivehicles.com/germany/self-propelled/sturmgeschutz.asp Sturmgesch\u00fctz] wwiivehicles.com</ref>\n\n==Performance against enemy vehicles==\nEstimated effective range against targets, assuming a 30-degree sideward angle.

Because of their low silhouette, StuG IIIs were easy to camouflage and be hidden and were difficult targets to destroy. As of 10&nbsp;April 1945, there were 1,053 StuG IIIs and 277 StuH 42s in German service. The StuG assault guns were cost-effective compared to the heavier German tanks such as the Tiger I and the Panther, although as anti-tank guns they were best used defensively as the lack of a traversable turret and its generally-thin armour was a severe disadvantage in the attack role. As the situation for the German military deteriorated further later in the war, more StuGs were built than tanks, particularly due to its ease of production.\n\nIn 1943 and 1944, the [[Finnish Army]] received 59 StuG III Ausf. Gs from Germany and used them against the Soviet Union. Thirty of the vehicles were received in 1943 and a further twenty-nine obtained in 1944. The first batch from 1943 destroyed at least eighty-seven enemy tanks for a loss of only eight StuGs (some of which were destroyed by their crews to prevent enemy capture).<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The later batch from 1944 saw no real action. After the war, the StuGs were the main combat vehicles of the Finnish Army up until the early 1960s when they were phased out. These StuGs gained the nickname \"Sturmi\" in the Finnish military, which can be found in some plastic scale-model kits.\n\n100 StuG III Ausf. Gs were delivered to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] in the autumn of 1943. They were officially known as TAs (or TAs T3 to avoid confusion with TAs T4 (Jagdpanzer IVs)) in their army's inventory. By February 1945, 13 units were still in use with the 2nd Armoured Regiment. None of this initial batch survived the end of the war in May that year.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.77</ref> Thirty-one TAs were on the Romanian military's inventory in November 1947. Most of them were probably StuG III Ausf. Gs and a small number of Panzer IV/70 (V) (same as TAs T4). These TAs were supplied by the Red Army or were damaged units repaired by the Romanian Army.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.47</ref> All German equipment was removed from service in 1950 and finally scrapped four years later due to the army's decision to use only Soviet armour.\n\nStuG IIIs were also exported to other nations friendly to Germany, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. Hungary fielded its StuG IIIs against Soviet troops during their sweep into the country in end-1944 up until early 1945. As with Hungary, Bulgaria received several StuGs from Germany too but almost none saw service against the Soviets, the country having ended the alliance with Germany by switching sides to the Allies before the Soviets invaded. Post-WWII, these were used for a short time before being turned into fixed gun emplacements on the Krali Marko Line on the border with neighbouring Turkey. StuG IIIs were also given to the pro-German Ustashe Militia in Yugoslavia, most of which were captured in Yugoslavia by [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav partisans]] during and after the war, as did German-operated vehicles. These were used by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] until the 1950s when they were replaced by more modern combat vehicles. Spain received a small number (around 10) of StuG IIIs from Germany during WWII, later sold to Syria between 1950 and 1960. Italy received the smallest number of StuG IIIs Germany distributed in the war, with only 3.\n\nAfter the Second World War, abandoned German StuG IIIs remained behind in many European nations Germany occupied during the war years, such as in Czechoslovakia,  France, Norway and Yugoslavia. The [[Soviet Union]] also captured hundreds of ex-German StuGs, most ending up being donated to [[Syria]], which continued to use them along with other war surplus armoured fighting vehicles received from the USSR or Czechoslovakia (varying from long-barrelled Panzer IVs (late models) and [[T-34-85|T-34/85]]s) during the 1950s and up until [[War over Water (Jordan river)|the War over Water]] against Israel in the mid-1960s. By the time of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, all of them had been either destroyed, stripped for spare parts, scrapped or emplaced on the [[Golan Heights]] as pillboxes. None remain in service today. A few Syrian StuG IIIs ended up in Israeli hands and have become war memorials or simply left rusting away on former battlefields.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from [[Assault gun]] -->\nProduction numbers were:<ref name=\"Panzer_Tracts_23\"/>\n[[File:Stug III Dresden 1.jpg|thumb|A StuG III in the Military History Museum of Dresden.]]\n* '''StuG III''' prototypes (1937, 5 produced on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis): by December 1937, two vehicles were in service with Panzer Regiment 1 in Erfurt. Vehicles had eight road wheels per side with {{convert|360|mm|in|adj=on}} wide tracks, 14.5&nbsp;mm thick soft steel superstructure and the [[7.5 cm KwK 37|7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun. Although not suitable for combat, they were used for training purposes as late as 1941.\n\n[[File:StuG III Ausf A.jpg|thumb|StuG III, Ausf. A.]]\n* '''StuG III Ausf. A''' (Sd.Kfz. 142; January\u2013May 1940, 30+6 produced by [[Daimler-Benz]]): first used in the [[Battle of France]], the StuG III Ausf. A used a modified 5./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. F) with front armour strengthened to 50&nbsp;mm. The last six vehicles were built on chassis diverted from Panzer III Ausf. G production.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. B''': (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940\u2013May 1941, 300 produced by Alkett) Modified 7./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. H), widened tracks (380&nbsp;mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;79&nbsp;mm to 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;95&nbsp;mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission was changed to a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward drive sprocket, and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original drive sprocket with eight round holes was changed to a new cast drive sprocket with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380&nbsp;mm tracks or 360&nbsp;mm wide tracks. 380&nbsp;mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels, as spacer rings could be added to the older sprockets. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380&nbsp;mm tracks.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. C''': (Sd.Kfz 142; April 1941, 50 produced) Gunner's forward view port above driver's visor was a [[shot trap]] and thus eliminated; instead, superstructure top was given an opening for gunner's periscope. Idler wheel was redesigned.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. D''': (Sd.Kfz 142; May\u2013September 1941, 150 produced) Simply a contract extension on Ausf. C. On-board intercom installed, transmission hatch locks added, otherwise identical to Ausf. C.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. E''': (Sd.Kfz 142; September 1941{{snd}}February 1942, 284 produced) Superstructure sides added extended rectangular armoured boxes for radio equipment. Increased space allowed room for six additional rounds of ammunition for the main gun (giving a maximum of 50) plus a machine gun. One [[MG 34]] and seven drum-type magazines were carried in the right rear side of the fighting compartment to protect the vehicle from enemy infantry. Vehicle commanders were officially provided with SF14Z stereoscopic scissor periscopes. Stereoscopic scissor type periscopes for artillery spotters may have been used by vehicle commanders from the start.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; March\u2013September 1942, 366 produced) The first real up-gunning of the StuG, this version uses the longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] gun. Firing armour-piercing Panzergranat-Patrone 39, the StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/43 could penetrate 91&nbsp;mm of armour inclined 30 degrees from vertical at 500&nbsp;m, 82&nbsp;mm at 1,000&nbsp;m, 72&nbsp;mm at 1,500&nbsp;m, 63&nbsp;mm at 2,000&nbsp;m, allowing the Ausf. F to engage most Soviet armoured vehicles at normal combat ranges. This change marked the StuG as being more of a tank destroyer than an infantry support vehicle. An exhaust fan was added to the rooftop to evacuate fumes from spent shells, to enable the firing of continuous shots. Additional 30&nbsp;mm armour plates were welded to the 50&nbsp;mm frontal armour from June 1942, making the frontal armour 80&nbsp;mm thick. From June 1942, Ausf. F were mounted with approximately 13&nbsp;inch (334&nbsp;mm to be exact) longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7,5&nbsp;cm StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/48]] gun. Firing above mentioned ammunition, longer L/48 could penetrate 96&nbsp;mm, 85&nbsp;mm, 74&nbsp;mm, 64&nbsp;mm respectively (30 degrees from vertical).\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F/8''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; September\u2013December 1942, 250 produced) Introduction of an improved hull design similar to that used for the Panzer III Ausf. J / L with increased rear armour. This was 8th version of the Panzer III hull, thus the designation \"F/8\". This hull has towing hook holes extending from side walls. From October 1942, 30&nbsp;mm thick plates of additional armour were bolted (previously welded) on to speed up the production line. From F/8, the [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun was standard until the very last of the Ausf. G. Due to the lack of double baffle [[muzzle brake]]s, a few L/48 guns mounted on F/8s were fitted with the single baffle ball type muzzle brake used on the Panzer IV Ausf. F2/G.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. G''' (Sd.Kfz. 142/1; December 1942{{snd}}April 1945, ~8,423 produced, 142 built on Panzer III Ausf. M chassis, 173 converted from Panzer III): The final and by far the most common of the StuG series. Upper superstructure was widened: welded boxes on either sides were abandoned. This new superstructure design increased its height to 2160&nbsp;mm. The back wall of the fighting compartment got straightened, and the ventilation fan on top of the superstructure was relocated to the back of the fighting compartment. From March 1943, the driver's periscope was abandoned. In February 1943, Alkett was joined by MIAG as a second manufacturer. From May 1943, side hull spaced armour plates ''(Sch\u00fcrzen)'' were fitted to G models; these were primarily intended for protection against Russian anti-tank rifles, but were also useful against hollow-charge ammunition. Side plates were retro-fitted to some Ausf. F/8 models, as they were to be fitted to all front line StuGs and other tanks by June 1943 in preparation for the [[battle of Kursk]]. Mountings for the ''Sch\u00fcrzen'' proved to be inadequate, as many were lost in the field. From March 1944, an improved mounting was introduced; as a result, side skirts are seen more often with late model Ausf G. From May 1943, 80&nbsp;mm thick plates were used for frontal armour instead of two plates of 50&nbsp;mm + 30&nbsp;mm. However, a backlog of StuGs with completed 50&nbsp;mm armour existed. For those, a 30&nbsp;mm additional armour plate still had to be welded or bolted on until October 1943.\n\nA rotating cupola with periscopes was added for the Ausf G.'s commander. However, from September 1943, the lack of ball bearings (resulting from [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission|USAAF bombing of Schweinfurt]]) forced cupolas to be welded on. Ball bearings were once again installed from August 1944. Shot deflectors for the cupolas were first installed from October 1943 from one factory, to be installed on all StuGs from February 1944. Some vehicles without shot deflectors carried several track pieces wired around the cupola for added protection.\n\nFrom December 1942, a square machine gun shield for the loader was installed, allowing an MG34 to be factory installed on a StuG for the first time. When stowed this shield folded back, partially overlapping the front half of the loader's hatch cover.  A curved protrusion welded to the backside of the shield pushed the shield forward as the front half of the loader's hatch cover was opened and guided the hatch cover to naturally engage a latch point on the shield thus, supporting the shield in its deployed position without exposing the loader to hostile forward fire. F/8 models had machine gun shields retro-fitted from early 1943. The loader's machine gun shield was later replaced by rotating machine gun mount that could be operated by the loader inside the vehicle sighting through a periscope. In April 1944, 27 of them were being field tested on the Eastern front. Favourable reports led to installation of these \"remote\" machine gun mounts from the summer of 1944.\n\nFrom October 1943, G versions were fitted with the ''Topfblende'' pot mantlet (often called ''Saukopf'' \"Pig's head\") gun mantlet without a coaxial mount. This cast mantlet, which had a sloped and rounded shape, was more effective at deflecting shots than the original boxy ''Kastenblende'' mantlet that had armour varying in thickness from 45&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm. The lack of large castings meant that the trapezoid-shape boxy mantlet was also produced until the very end. A coaxial machine gun was first added to boxy mantlets, from June 1944, and then to cast Topfblende, from October 1944, in the middle of \"Topfblende\" mantlet production. With the addition of this coaxial machine gun, all StuGs carried two MG 34 machine guns from fall of 1944. Some previously completed StuGs with a boxy mantlet had a coaxial machine gun hole drilled to retrofit a coaxial machine gun; however, Topfblende produced from November&nbsp;1943 to October&nbsp;1944 without a machine gun opening could not be tampered with.\n\nAlso from November 1943 onwards, all-metal return rollers of a few different types were used due to lack of rubber supply. [[Zimmerit]] anti-magnetic coating to protect vehicles from magnetic mines was applied starting in September ([[MIAG]] facility) or November ([[Alkett]] facility) 1943 and ending in September 1944.\n\n===Further variants===\nIn 1942, a variant of the StuG Ausf. F was designed with a {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on|1}} true [[howitzer]] instead of the 7.5&nbsp;cm StuK 40 L/43 cannon. These new vehicles, designated '''StuH 42''' (''Sturmhaubitze 42'', Sd.Kfz 142/2), were designed to provide infantry support with the increased number of StuG III Ausf. F/8 and Ausf. Gs being used in the anti-tank role. The StuH 42 mounted a variant of the [[10.5 cm leFH 18]] howitzer, modified to be electrically fired and fitted with a [[muzzle brake]]. Production models were built on StuG III Ausf. G chassis. The muzzle brake was often omitted due to the scarcity of resources later in the war. Alkett produced 1,299 StuH 42 from March 1943 to 1945, the initial 12 vehicles were built on repaired StuG III Ausf. F and F/8 from the autumn of 1942 to January 1943.\n\nIn 1943, 10 StuG IIIs were converted to the '''StuG III (Flamm)''' configuration by replacing the main gun with a Schwade [[flamethrower]]. These chassis were all refurbished at the depot level and were a variety of pre-Ausf. F models. There are no reports to indicate that any of these were used in combat and all were returned to Ausf. G standard at depot level by 1944.\n\nIn late 1941, the StuG chassis was selected to carry the [[15 cm sIG 33]] heavy infantry gun. These vehicles were known as [[Sturm-Infanteriegesch\u00fctz 33B]]. Twenty-four were rebuilt on older StuG III chassis of which twelve vehicles saw combat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where they were destroyed or captured. The remaining 12 vehicles were assigned to [[23rd Panzer Division]].\n\nDue to the dwindling supply of rubber, rubber-saving road wheels were tested during 8\u201314 November 1942, but did not see production.\n\nBombing raids on the Alkett factory resulted in significant drops in StuG III production in November 1943. To make up for this loss of production, [[Krupp]] displayed a substitution StuG on a Panzer IV chassis to Hitler on 16\u201317 December 1943. From January 1944 onwards, the [[StuG IV]], based on the [[Panzer IV]] chassis and with a slightly modified StuG III superstructure, entered production.\n\nField modifications were made to increase the vehicle's survivability, resulting in diversity to already numerous variants; cement plastered on front superstructure, older Ausf.C/D retrofitted with a KwK 40 L/48 gun, Ausf.G mounting Panzer IV cupola, a coaxial MG34 through a hole drilled on a boxy mantlet, et cetera.\n\nThe Soviet [[SU-76i]] self-propelled gun was based on captured StuG III and [[Panzer III]] vehicles.<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In total, Factory #37 in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] manufactured 181 SU-76i plus 20 commander SU-76i for [[Red Army]] service by adding an enclosed superstructure and the 76.2&nbsp;mm S-1 tank gun.\n\nApproximately 10,000 StuG IIIs of various types were produced from 1940 to 1945 by Alkett (~7,500) and from 1943 to 1945 by MIAG (2,586). From April to July 1944, some 173 Panzer III were converted into StuG III Ausf. G. The 1,299 StuH 42 and the 12 conversions from StuG III were solely built by Alkett.<ref name=Panzer_Tracts_23/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016202-23A, Russland, Sturmgesch\u00fctz III vor Ortschaft.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in the Soviet Union, 1941.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-009-0882-04, Russland-Nord, Vormarsch durch Lettland.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in Latvia during the [[Baltic Operation]].\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|[[Battle of Stalingrad]]: Infantry and a supporting StuG assault gun advance towards the city center.\nFile:StuG III destroyed Normandy.jpg|A StuG III Ausf.G destroyed in [[Normandy]] by a [[Cooking off|catastrophic internal explosion]], 1944.\nFile:StuG III Ausf G, Dezember 1942.jpg|Initial Production StuG III Ausf.

It was built on the [[chassis]] of the proven [[Panzer III]] tank, replacing the turret with [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|an armored, fixed superstructure]] mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile [[assault gun]] for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was continually modified, and much like the later ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'', was employed as a [[tank destroyer]].\n\n==Development==\nThe ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' originated from German experiences in [[World War I]], when it was discovered that, during the offensives on the Western Front, the infantry lacked the means to effectively engage fortifications. The artillery of the time was heavy and not mobile enough to keep up with the advancing infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes, and other minor fortifications with direct fire. Although the problem was well known in the German army, it was General [[Erich von Manstein]] who is considered the father of the ''Sturmartillerie'' (assault artillery). The initial proposal was from von Manstein and submitted to General [[Ludwig Beck]] in 1935, suggesting that ''Sturmartillerie'' units should be used in a direct-fire support role for infantry divisions. On 15&nbsp;June 1936, [[Daimler-Benz]] AG received an order to develop an armoured infantry support vehicle capable of mounting a {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on|2}} calibre artillery piece. The gun mount's fixed, fully integrated [[casemate]] superstructure was to allow a limited traverse of a minimum of 25\u00b0 and provide overhead protection for the crew.<ref>Military Intelligence Service, ''Artillery in the Desert'' (Department of War, 25&nbsp;November 1942), p.19, says depression 5\u00b0, elevation 20\u00b0, traverse only 20\u00b0 on a captured sample.</ref> The height of the vehicle was not to exceed that of the average soldier.\n\nDaimler-Benz AG used the chassis and running gear of its recent Panzer III medium tank as a basis for the new vehicle. Prototype manufacture was passed over to [[Alkett]], which produced five prototypes in 1937 on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis. These prototypes featured a [[mild steel]] superstructure and a [[Krupp]] short-barrelled, [[howitzer]]-like in appearance, [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] cannon. Production vehicles with this gun were known as '''''Gepanzerte Selbstfahrlafette f\u00fcr Sturmgesch\u00fctz 7.5&nbsp;cm Kanone Ausf\u00fchrung A bis D (Sd.Kfz.142)'''''.\n\nWhile the StuG was considered self-propelled artillery, it was not clear which land combat arm of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] would handle the new weapon. The ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'' (armoured corps), the natural user of tracked fighting vehicles, had no resources to spare for the formation of StuG units and neither did the infantry. It was agreed that it would best be employed as part of the artillery arm. The StuGs were organized into battalions (later renamed \"brigades\" for disinformation purposes) and followed their own doctrine. Infantry support using direct-fire was its intended role. Later, there was also a strong emphasis on its use as an anti-tank gun.\n\nAs the StuG was designed to fill an infantry close support combat role, early models were fitted with a [[howitzer]]-pattern, low-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun, much as [[Panzer IV#Ausf. A to Ausf. F1|the earliest versions]] of the fully turreted [[Panzer IV]] were. Low-velocity shells are lightly built of thin steel and carry a large charge of explosive, to destroy soft-skin targets and blast fortifications. Such shells do not penetrate armour well. After the Germans encountered the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] and [[T-34]] tanks, the StuG was first equipped with a high-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] main gun (spring 1942) and in the autumn of 1942 with the slightly longer [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun. These high-velocity guns were the same as those mounted on the [[Panzer IV]] for anti-tank use but the heavy steel wall high-velocity shells carried much less explosive and had a lower blast effect for use against infantry or field fortifications. These versions were known as the '''''7.5&nbsp;cm Sturmgesch\u00fctz 40 Ausf.F'', ''Ausf. F/8'' and '' Ausf. G (Sd.Kfz.142/1)'''''.\n\nBeginning with the StuG III Ausf. G from December 1942, a [[7.92\u00d757&nbsp;mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[MG34]] machine gun could be mounted on a shield on top of the superstructure for added anti-infantry protection. Some of the F/8 models were retrofitted with a shield. An additional coaxial 7.92&nbsp;mm MG34 was introduced in Mid 1944 for some production and all production by autumn 1944.\n\nThe vehicles of the ''Sturmgesch\u00fctz'' series were cheaper and faster to build than contemporary German [[tank]]s; at 82,500 [[German Reichsmark|RM]], a StuG III Ausf G was cheaper than a [[Panzer III]] Ausf. M, which cost 103,163 RM. This was due to the omission of the turret, which greatly simplified manufacture and allowed the chassis to carry a larger gun. By the end of the war, ~11,300 StuG IIIs and StuH 42s had been built.<ref name=wwiivehicles>[http://www.wwiivehicles.com/germany/self-propelled/sturmgeschutz.asp Sturmgesch\u00fctz] wwiivehicles.com</ref>\n\n==Performance against enemy vehicles==\nEstimated effective range against targets, assuming a 30-degree sideward angle.

Because of their low silhouette, StuG IIIs were easy to camouflage and be hidden and were difficult targets to destroy. As of 10&nbsp;April 1945, there were 1,053 StuG IIIs and 277 StuH 42s in German service. The StuG assault guns were cost-effective compared to the heavier German tanks such as the Tiger I and the Panther, although as anti-tank guns they were best used defensively as the lack of a traversable turret and its generally-thin armour was a severe disadvantage in the attack role. As the situation for the German military deteriorated further later in the war, more StuGs were built than tanks, particularly due to its ease of production.\n\nIn 1943 and 1944, the [[Finnish Army]] received 59 StuG III Ausf. Gs from Germany and used them against the Soviet Union. Thirty of the vehicles were received in 1943 and a further twenty-nine obtained in 1944. The first batch from 1943 destroyed at least eighty-seven enemy tanks for a loss of only eight StuGs (some of which were destroyed by their crews to prevent enemy capture).<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The later batch from 1944 saw no real action. After the war, the StuGs were the main combat vehicles of the Finnish Army up until the early 1960s when they were phased out. These StuGs gained the nickname \"Sturmi\" in the Finnish military, which can be found in some plastic scale-model kits.\n\n100 StuG III Ausf. Gs were delivered to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] in the autumn of 1943. They were officially known as TAs (or TAs T3 to avoid confusion with TAs T4 (Jagdpanzer IVs)) in their army's inventory. By February 1945, 13 units were still in use with the 2nd Armoured Regiment. None of this initial batch survived the end of the war in May that year.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.77</ref> Thirty-one TAs were on the Romanian military's inventory in November 1947. Most of them were probably StuG III Ausf. Gs and a small number of Panzer IV/70 (V) (same as TAs T4). These TAs were supplied by the Red Army or were damaged units repaired by the Romanian Army.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.47</ref> All German equipment was removed from service in 1950 and finally scrapped four years later due to the army's decision to use only Soviet armour.\n\nStuG IIIs were also exported to other nations friendly to Germany, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. Hungary fielded its StuG IIIs against Soviet troops during their sweep into the country in end-1944 up until early 1945. As with Hungary, Bulgaria received several StuGs from Germany too but almost none saw service against the Soviets, the country having ended the alliance with Germany by switching sides to the Allies before the Soviets invaded. Post-WWII, these were used for a short time before being turned into fixed gun emplacements on the Krali Marko Line on the border with neighbouring Turkey. StuG IIIs were also given to the pro-German Ustashe Militia in Yugoslavia, most of which were captured in Yugoslavia by [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav partisans]] during and after the war, as did German-operated vehicles. These were used by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] until the 1950s when they were replaced by more modern combat vehicles. Spain received a small number (around 10) of StuG IIIs from Germany during WWII, later sold to Syria between 1950 and 1960. Italy received the smallest number of StuG IIIs Germany distributed in the war, with only 3.\n\nAfter the Second World War, abandoned German StuG IIIs remained behind in many European nations Germany occupied during the war years, such as in Czechoslovakia,  France, Norway and Yugoslavia. The [[Soviet Union]] also captured hundreds of ex-German StuGs, most ending up being donated to [[Syria]], which continued to use them along with other war surplus armoured fighting vehicles received from the USSR or Czechoslovakia (varying from long-barrelled Panzer IVs (late models) and [[T-34-85|T-34/85]]s) during the 1950s and up until [[War over Water (Jordan river)|the War over Water]] against Israel in the mid-1960s. By the time of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, all of them had been either destroyed, stripped for spare parts, scrapped or emplaced on the [[Golan Heights]] as pillboxes. None remain in service today. A few Syrian StuG IIIs ended up in Israeli hands and have become war memorials or simply left rusting away on former battlefields.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from [[Assault gun]] -->\nProduction numbers were:<ref name=\"Panzer_Tracts_23\"/>\n[[File:Stug III Dresden 1.jpg|thumb|A StuG III in the Military History Museum of Dresden.]]\n* '''StuG III''' prototypes (1937, 5 produced on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis): by December 1937, two vehicles were in service with Panzer Regiment 1 in Erfurt. Vehicles had eight road wheels per side with {{convert|360|mm|in|adj=on}} wide tracks, 14.5&nbsp;mm thick soft steel superstructure and the [[7.5 cm KwK 37|7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun. Although not suitable for combat, they were used for training purposes as late as 1941.\n\n[[File:StuG III Ausf A.jpg|thumb|StuG III, Ausf. A.]]\n* '''StuG III Ausf. A''' (Sd.Kfz. 142; January\u2013May 1940, 30+6 produced by [[Daimler-Benz]]): first used in the [[Battle of France]], the StuG III Ausf. A used a modified 5./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. F) with front armour strengthened to 50&nbsp;mm. The last six vehicles were built on chassis diverted from Panzer III Ausf. G production.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. B''': (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940\u2013May 1941, 300 produced by Alkett) Modified 7./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. H), widened tracks (380&nbsp;mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;79&nbsp;mm to 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;95&nbsp;mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission was changed to a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward drive sprocket, and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original drive sprocket with eight round holes was changed to a new cast drive sprocket with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380&nbsp;mm tracks or 360&nbsp;mm wide tracks. 380&nbsp;mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels, as spacer rings could be added to the older sprockets. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380&nbsp;mm tracks.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. C''': (Sd.Kfz 142; April 1941, 50 produced) Gunner's forward view port above driver's visor was a [[shot trap]] and thus eliminated; instead, superstructure top was given an opening for gunner's periscope. Idler wheel was redesigned.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. D''': (Sd.Kfz 142; May\u2013September 1941, 150 produced) Simply a contract extension on Ausf. C. On-board intercom installed, transmission hatch locks added, otherwise identical to Ausf. C.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. E''': (Sd.Kfz 142; September 1941{{snd}}February 1942, 284 produced) Superstructure sides added extended rectangular armoured boxes for radio equipment. Increased space allowed room for six additional rounds of ammunition for the main gun (giving a maximum of 50) plus a machine gun. One [[MG 34]] and seven drum-type magazines were carried in the right rear side of the fighting compartment to protect the vehicle from enemy infantry. Vehicle commanders were officially provided with SF14Z stereoscopic scissor periscopes. Stereoscopic scissor type periscopes for artillery spotters may have been used by vehicle commanders from the start.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; March\u2013September 1942, 366 produced) The first real up-gunning of the StuG, this version uses the longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] gun. Firing armour-piercing Panzergranat-Patrone 39, the StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/43 could penetrate 91&nbsp;mm of armour inclined 30 degrees from vertical at 500&nbsp;m, 82&nbsp;mm at 1,000&nbsp;m, 72&nbsp;mm at 1,500&nbsp;m, 63&nbsp;mm at 2,000&nbsp;m, allowing the Ausf. F to engage most Soviet armoured vehicles at normal combat ranges. This change marked the StuG as being more of a tank destroyer than an infantry support vehicle. An exhaust fan was added to the rooftop to evacuate fumes from spent shells, to enable the firing of continuous shots. Additional 30&nbsp;mm armour plates were welded to the 50&nbsp;mm frontal armour from June 1942, making the frontal armour 80&nbsp;mm thick. From June 1942, Ausf. F were mounted with approximately 13&nbsp;inch (334&nbsp;mm to be exact) longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7,5&nbsp;cm StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/48]] gun. Firing above mentioned ammunition, longer L/48 could penetrate 96&nbsp;mm, 85&nbsp;mm, 74&nbsp;mm, 64&nbsp;mm respectively (30 degrees from vertical).\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F/8''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; September\u2013December 1942, 250 produced) Introduction of an improved hull design similar to that used for the Panzer III Ausf. J / L with increased rear armour. This was 8th version of the Panzer III hull, thus the designation \"F/8\". This hull has towing hook holes extending from side walls. From October 1942, 30&nbsp;mm thick plates of additional armour were bolted (previously welded) on to speed up the production line. From F/8, the [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun was standard until the very last of the Ausf. G. Due to the lack of double baffle [[muzzle brake]]s, a few L/48 guns mounted on F/8s were fitted with the single baffle ball type muzzle brake used on the Panzer IV Ausf. F2/G.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. G''' (Sd.Kfz. 142/1; December 1942{{snd}}April 1945, ~8,423 produced, 142 built on Panzer III Ausf. M chassis, 173 converted from Panzer III): The final and by far the most common of the StuG series. Upper superstructure was widened: welded boxes on either sides were abandoned. This new superstructure design increased its height to 2160&nbsp;mm. The back wall of the fighting compartment got straightened, and the ventilation fan on top of the superstructure was relocated to the back of the fighting compartment. From March 1943, the driver's periscope was abandoned. In February 1943, Alkett was joined by MIAG as a second manufacturer. From May 1943, side hull spaced armour plates ''(Sch\u00fcrzen)'' were fitted to G models; these were primarily intended for protection against Russian anti-tank rifles, but were also useful against hollow-charge ammunition. Side plates were retro-fitted to some Ausf. F/8 models, as they were to be fitted to all front line StuGs and other tanks by June 1943 in preparation for the [[battle of Kursk]]. Mountings for the ''Sch\u00fcrzen'' proved to be inadequate, as many were lost in the field. From March 1944, an improved mounting was introduced; as a result, side skirts are seen more often with late model Ausf G. From May 1943, 80&nbsp;mm thick plates were used for frontal armour instead of two plates of 50&nbsp;mm + 30&nbsp;mm. However, a backlog of StuGs with completed 50&nbsp;mm armour existed. For those, a 30&nbsp;mm additional armour plate still had to be welded or bolted on until October 1943.\n\nA rotating cupola with periscopes was added for the Ausf G.'s commander. However, from September 1943, the lack of ball bearings (resulting from [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission|USAAF bombing of Schweinfurt]]) forced cupolas to be welded on. Ball bearings were once again installed from August 1944. Shot deflectors for the cupolas were first installed from October 1943 from one factory, to be installed on all StuGs from February 1944. Some vehicles without shot deflectors carried several track pieces wired around the cupola for added protection.\n\nFrom December 1942, a square machine gun shield for the loader was installed, allowing an MG34 to be factory installed on a StuG for the first time. When stowed this shield folded back, partially overlapping the front half of the loader's hatch cover.  A curved protrusion welded to the backside of the shield pushed the shield forward as the front half of the loader's hatch cover was opened and guided the hatch cover to naturally engage a latch point on the shield thus, supporting the shield in its deployed position without exposing the loader to hostile forward fire. F/8 models had machine gun shields retro-fitted from early 1943. The loader's machine gun shield was later replaced by rotating machine gun mount that could be operated by the loader inside the vehicle sighting through a periscope. In April 1944, 27 of them were being field tested on the Eastern front. Favourable reports led to installation of these \"remote\" machine gun mounts from the summer of 1944.\n\nFrom October 1943, G versions were fitted with the ''Topfblende'' pot mantlet (often called ''Saukopf'' \"Pig's head\") gun mantlet without a coaxial mount. This cast mantlet, which had a sloped and rounded shape, was more effective at deflecting shots than the original boxy ''Kastenblende'' mantlet that had armour varying in thickness from 45&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm. The lack of large castings meant that the trapezoid-shape boxy mantlet was also produced until the very end. A coaxial machine gun was first added to boxy mantlets, from June 1944, and then to cast Topfblende, from October 1944, in the middle of \"Topfblende\" mantlet production. With the addition of this coaxial machine gun, all StuGs carried two MG 34 machine guns from fall of 1944. Some previously completed StuGs with a boxy mantlet had a coaxial machine gun hole drilled to retrofit a coaxial machine gun; however, Topfblende produced from November&nbsp;1943 to October&nbsp;1944 without a machine gun opening could not be tampered with.\n\nAlso from November 1943 onwards, all-metal return rollers of a few different types were used due to lack of rubber supply. [[Zimmerit]] anti-magnetic coating to protect vehicles from magnetic mines was applied starting in September ([[MIAG]] facility) or November ([[Alkett]] facility) 1943 and ending in September 1944.\n\n===Further variants===\nIn 1942, a variant of the StuG Ausf. F was designed with a {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on|1}} true [[howitzer]] instead of the 7.5&nbsp;cm StuK 40 L/43 cannon. These new vehicles, designated '''StuH 42''' (''Sturmhaubitze 42'', Sd.Kfz 142/2), were designed to provide infantry support with the increased number of StuG III Ausf. F/8 and Ausf. Gs being used in the anti-tank role. The StuH 42 mounted a variant of the [[10.5 cm leFH 18]] howitzer, modified to be electrically fired and fitted with a [[muzzle brake]]. Production models were built on StuG III Ausf. G chassis. The muzzle brake was often omitted due to the scarcity of resources later in the war. Alkett produced 1,299 StuH 42 from March 1943 to 1945, the initial 12 vehicles were built on repaired StuG III Ausf. F and F/8 from the autumn of 1942 to January 1943.\n\nIn 1943, 10 StuG IIIs were converted to the '''StuG III (Flamm)''' configuration by replacing the main gun with a Schwade [[flamethrower]]. These chassis were all refurbished at the depot level and were a variety of pre-Ausf. F models. There are no reports to indicate that any of these were used in combat and all were returned to Ausf. G standard at depot level by 1944.\n\nIn late 1941, the StuG chassis was selected to carry the [[15 cm sIG 33]] heavy infantry gun. These vehicles were known as [[Sturm-Infanteriegesch\u00fctz 33B]]. Twenty-four were rebuilt on older StuG III chassis of which twelve vehicles saw combat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where they were destroyed or captured. The remaining 12 vehicles were assigned to [[23rd Panzer Division]].\n\nDue to the dwindling supply of rubber, rubber-saving road wheels were tested during 8\u201314 November 1942, but did not see production.\n\nBombing raids on the Alkett factory resulted in significant drops in StuG III production in November 1943. To make up for this loss of production, [[Krupp]] displayed a substitution StuG on a Panzer IV chassis to Hitler on 16\u201317 December 1943. From January 1944 onwards, the [[StuG IV]], based on the [[Panzer IV]] chassis and with a slightly modified StuG III superstructure, entered production.\n\nField modifications were made to increase the vehicle's survivability, resulting in diversity to already numerous variants; cement plastered on front superstructure, older Ausf.C/D retrofitted with a KwK 40 L/48 gun, Ausf.G mounting Panzer IV cupola, a coaxial MG34 through a hole drilled on a boxy mantlet, et cetera.\n\nThe Soviet [[SU-76i]] self-propelled gun was based on captured StuG III and [[Panzer III]] vehicles.<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In total, Factory #37 in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] manufactured 181 SU-76i plus 20 commander SU-76i for [[Red Army]] service by adding an enclosed superstructure and the 76.2&nbsp;mm S-1 tank gun.\n\nApproximately 10,000 StuG IIIs of various types were produced from 1940 to 1945 by Alkett (~7,500) and from 1943 to 1945 by MIAG (2,586). From April to July 1944, some 173 Panzer III were converted into StuG III Ausf. G. The 1,299 StuH 42 and the 12 conversions from StuG III were solely built by Alkett.<ref name=Panzer_Tracts_23/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016202-23A, Russland, Sturmgesch\u00fctz III vor Ortschaft.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in the Soviet Union, 1941.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-009-0882-04, Russland-Nord, Vormarsch durch Lettland.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in Latvia during the [[Baltic Operation]].\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|[[Battle of Stalingrad]]: Infantry and a supporting StuG assault gun advance towards the city center.\nFile:StuG III destroyed Normandy.jpg|A StuG III Ausf.G destroyed in [[Normandy]] by a [[Cooking off|catastrophic internal explosion]], 1944.\nFile:StuG III Ausf G, Dezember 1942.jpg|Initial Production StuG III Ausf.

SolO is intended to perform detailed measurements of the inner [[heliosphere]] and nascent [[solar wind]], and perform close observations of the polar regions of the Sun, which is difficult to do from [[Earth]], both serving to answer the question \"How does the Sun create and control the heliosphere?\"\n\nSolO will make observations of the Sun from an eccentric orbit moving as close as ~60 [[solar radius|solar radii (R<sub>S</sub>)]], or 0.284 [[astronomical unit]]s (au), placing it inside [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s perihelion of 0.3075 au.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kis.uni-freiburg.de/index.php?id=58&L=1|title=Kiepenheuer-Institut fuer Sonnenphysik: SolarOrbiter PHI-ISS|website=Kis.uni-freiburg.de|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> During the mission the orbital inclination will be raised to about 25\u00b0. The total mission cost is US$1.5 billion, counting both ESA and NASA contributions.<ref name=\"auto2\">https://spacenews.com/atlas-launches-solar-orbiter-mission/ - 11 February 2020</ref>\n\nSolO was launched on 10 February 2020. The mission is planned to last 7 years.\n\n[[File:Suncomparison.svg|thumb|right|A comparison of the size of the [[Sun]] as seen from [[Earth]] (left, 1 au) and from the ''Solar Orbiter'' spacecraft (0.284 au, right).]]\n[[File:Solar Orbiter Structural Thermal Model.jpg|thumb|The ''Solar Orbiter'' structural thermal model shortly before leaving the [[Airbus Defence and Space]] facility in Stevenage, UK.]]\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Solar Orbiter spacecraft is a Sun-pointed, three-axis stabilised platform with a dedicated heat shield to provide protection from the high levels of solar flux near perihelion. The spacecraft provides a stable platform to accommodate the combination of remote-sensing and in situ instrumentation in an electromagnetically clean environment. The 21 sensors were configured on the spacecraft to allow each to conduct its in situ or remote sensing experiments with both access to and protection from the solar environment. Solar Orbiter has inherited technology from previous missions, such as the solar arrays from the [[BepiColombo]] Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO). The [[solar arrays]] can be rotated about their longitudinal axis to avoid overheating when close to the Sun. A battery pack provides supplementary power at other points in the mission such as eclipse periods encountered during planetary flybys.\n\nThe Telemetry, Tracking and Command Subsystem provides the communication link capability with the Earth in X-band. The subsystem supports telemetry, telecommand and ranging. Low-Gain Antennas are used for Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and will also be available as a back-up during the mission phase when steerable Medium- and High-Gain Antennas will be in use. The High-Temperature High-Gain Antenna needs to point to a wide range of positions to achieve a link with the ground station and to be able to downlink sufficient volumes of data. Its design was adapted from the BepiColombo mission. The antenna can be folded in to gain protection from Solar Orbiter's heat shield if necessary. Most data will therefore initially be stored in on-board memory and sent back to Earth at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nThe ground station at [[Malarg\u00fce]] (Argentina), with a 35-m antenna, for 4 to 8 hours/day (effective). ESA's Malarg\u00fce ground station will be used for all operations throughout the mission with the ground stations in [[New Norcia]], Australia, and [[Cebreros]], Spain, acting as backup when necessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/44168-spacecraft|title=ESA Science & Technology - Spacecraft|website=sci.esa.int}}</ref>\n\n==Mission Operations==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 240\n| header = Animation of Solar Orbiter{{'s}} trajectory\n| image1 = Animation of Solar Orbiter's trajectory - polar view.gif\n| caption1 = Polar view.

Additional eight-hour downlink passes will be scheduled as needed to reach the required total science data return of the mission. The Solar Orbiter ground segment will make maximum reuse of ESA's infrastructure for Deep Space missions:\n\n* The ground stations, which belong to ESA's space tracking station network ([[ESTRACK]])\n* The Mission Operations Centre (MOC), located at [[ESOC]], [[Darmstadt]], Germany\n* The Science Operations Centre (SOC), located at [[European Space Astronomy Centre|ESAC]], [[Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada]], Spain\n* The communications network, linking the various remotely located centres and stations to support the operational data traffic\n\nThe Science Operations Centre will be responsible for mission planning and the generation of payload operations requests to the MOC, as well as science data archiving. The SOC will be operational for the active science phase of the mission, i.e. from the beginning of the Cruise Phase onwards. The handover of payload operations from the MOC to the SOC is performed at the end of the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase (NECP). ESA's Malarg\u00fce ground station in Argentina will be used for all operations throughout the mission with the ground stations in New Norcia, Australia, and Cebreros, Spain, acting as backup when necessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/44181-mission-operations|title=ESA Science & Technology - Mission Operations|website=sci.esa.int}}</ref>\n\nDuring the initial cruise phase, which lasts until November 2021, Solar Orbiter will perform two gravity-assist manoeuvres around Venus and one around Earth to alter the spacecraft's trajectory, guiding it towards the innermost regions of the Solar System. At the same time, Solar Orbiter will acquire in situ data and characterise and calibrate its remote-sensing instruments. The first close solar pass will take place in 2022 at around a third of Earth's distance from the Sun.<ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web |title=GMS: Solar Orbiter's Orbit |url=https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13532 |website=svs.gsfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=14 February 2020 |date=27 January 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft's orbit has been chosen to be 'in resonance' with Venus, which means that it will return to the planet's vicinity every few orbits and can again use the planet's gravity to alter or tilt its orbit. Initially, Solar Orbiter will be confined to the same plane as the planets, but each encounter of Venus will increase its orbital inclination. For example, after the 2025 Venus encounter, it will make its first solar pass at 17\u00b0 inclination, increasing to 33\u00b0 during a proposed mission extension phase, bringing even more of the polar regions into direct view.<ref name=\"NASA\"/>\n\n==Scientific objectives==\nThe spacecraft will make a close approach to the [[Sun]] every six months.<ref>https://www.esa.int/ScienceExploration/SpaceScience/SolarOrbiter/SolarOrbiterfactsheet - 10 February 2020</ref> The closest approach will be positioned to allow a repeated study of the same region of the solar atmosphere. ''Solar Orbiter'' will be able to observe the magnetic activity building up in the atmosphere that can lead to powerful [[solar flare]]s or eruptions.\n\nResearchers will also have the chance to coordinate observations with NASA's ''[[Parker Solar Probe]]'' mission (2018-2025) which is performing measurements of the Sun's extended [[solar corona|corona]].\n\nThe objective of the mission is to perform close-up, high-resolution studies of the Sun and its inner [[heliosphere]]. The new understanding will help answer these questions:\n\n* How and where do the [[solar wind]] plasma and [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic field]] originate in the [[solar corona|corona]]?\n* How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability?\n* How do solar eruptions produce [[Solar energetic particles|energetic particle]] radiation that fills the heliosphere?\n* How does the [[solar dynamo]] work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere?\n\n==Science payload==\nThe science payload is composed of 10 instruments:<ref name=esa-solar-orbiter>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter|title=Solar Orbiter|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Heliospheric in-situ instruments (4): \n* SWA - Solar Wind Plasma Analyser (United Kingdom): Consists of a suite of sensors that will measure the ion and electron bulk properties (including density, velocity, and temperature) of the solar wind, thereby characterizing the solar wind between 0.28 and 1.4 au from the Sun.

SolO is intended to perform detailed measurements of the inner [[heliosphere]] and nascent [[solar wind]], and perform close observations of the polar regions of the Sun, which is difficult to do from [[Earth]], both serving to answer the question \"How does the Sun create and control the heliosphere?\"\n\nSolO will make observations of the Sun from an eccentric orbit moving as close as ~60 [[solar radius|solar radii (R<sub>S</sub>)]], or 0.284 [[astronomical unit]]s (au), placing it inside [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s perihelion of 0.3075 au.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kis.uni-freiburg.de/index.php?id=58&L=1|title=Kiepenheuer-Institut fuer Sonnenphysik: SolarOrbiter PHI-ISS|website=Kis.uni-freiburg.de|accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref> During the mission the orbital inclination will be raised to about 25\u00b0. The total mission cost is US$1.5 billion, counting both ESA and NASA contributions.<ref name=\"auto2\">https://spacenews.com/atlas-launches-solar-orbiter-mission/ - 11 February 2020</ref>\n\nSolO was launched on 10 February 2020. The mission is planned to last 7 years.\n\n[[File:Suncomparison.svg|thumb|right|A comparison of the size of the [[Sun]] as seen from [[Earth]] (left, 1 au) and from the ''Solar Orbiter'' spacecraft (0.284 au, right).]]\n[[File:Solar Orbiter Structural Thermal Model.jpg|thumb|The ''Solar Orbiter'' structural thermal model shortly before leaving the [[Airbus Defence and Space]] facility in Stevenage, UK.]]\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Solar Orbiter spacecraft is a Sun-pointed, three-axis stabilised platform with a dedicated heat shield to provide protection from the high levels of solar flux near perihelion. The spacecraft provides a stable platform to accommodate the combination of remote-sensing and in situ instrumentation in an electromagnetically clean environment. The 21 sensors were configured on the spacecraft to allow each to conduct its in situ or remote sensing experiments with both access to and protection from the solar environment. Solar Orbiter has inherited technology from previous missions, such as the solar arrays from the [[BepiColombo]] Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO). The [[solar arrays]] can be rotated about their longitudinal axis to avoid overheating when close to the Sun. A battery pack provides supplementary power at other points in the mission such as eclipse periods encountered during planetary flybys.\n\nThe Telemetry, Tracking and Command Subsystem provides the communication link capability with the Earth in X-band. The subsystem supports telemetry, telecommand and ranging. Low-Gain Antennas are used for Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and will also be available as a back-up during the mission phase when steerable Medium- and High-Gain Antennas will be in use. The High-Temperature High-Gain Antenna needs to point to a wide range of positions to achieve a link with the ground station and to be able to downlink sufficient volumes of data. Its design was adapted from the BepiColombo mission. The antenna can be folded in to gain protection from Solar Orbiter's heat shield if necessary. Most data will therefore initially be stored in on-board memory and sent back to Earth at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nThe ground station at [[Malarg\u00fce]] (Argentina), with a 35-m antenna, for 4 to 8 hours/day (effective). ESA's Malarg\u00fce ground station will be used for all operations throughout the mission with the ground stations in [[New Norcia]], Australia, and [[Cebreros]], Spain, acting as backup when necessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/44168-spacecraft|title=ESA Science & Technology - Spacecraft|website=sci.esa.int}}</ref>\n\n==Mission Operations==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 240\n| header = Animation of Solar Orbiter{{'s}} trajectory\n| image1 = Animation of Solar Orbiter's trajectory - polar view.gif\n| caption1 = Polar view.

Additional eight-hour downlink passes will be scheduled as needed to reach the required total science data return of the mission. The Solar Orbiter ground segment will make maximum reuse of ESA's infrastructure for Deep Space missions:\n\n* The ground stations, which belong to ESA's space tracking station network ([[ESTRACK]])\n* The Mission Operations Centre (MOC), located at [[ESOC]], [[Darmstadt]], Germany\n* The Science Operations Centre (SOC), located at [[European Space Astronomy Centre|ESAC]], [[Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada]], Spain\n* The communications network, linking the various remotely located centres and stations to support the operational data traffic\n\nThe Science Operations Centre will be responsible for mission planning and the generation of payload operations requests to the MOC, as well as science data archiving. The SOC will be operational for the active science phase of the mission, i.e. from the beginning of the Cruise Phase onwards. The handover of payload operations from the MOC to the SOC is performed at the end of the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase (NECP). ESA's Malarg\u00fce ground station in Argentina will be used for all operations throughout the mission with the ground stations in New Norcia, Australia, and Cebreros, Spain, acting as backup when necessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/44181-mission-operations|title=ESA Science & Technology - Mission Operations|website=sci.esa.int}}</ref>\n\nDuring the initial cruise phase, which lasts until November 2021, Solar Orbiter will perform two gravity-assist manoeuvres around Venus and one around Earth to alter the spacecraft's trajectory, guiding it towards the innermost regions of the Solar System. At the same time, Solar Orbiter will acquire in situ data and characterise and calibrate its remote-sensing instruments. The first close solar pass will take place in 2022 at around a third of Earth's distance from the Sun.<ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web |title=GMS: Solar Orbiter's Orbit |url=https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13532 |website=svs.gsfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=14 February 2020 |date=27 January 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft's orbit has been chosen to be 'in resonance' with Venus, which means that it will return to the planet's vicinity every few orbits and can again use the planet's gravity to alter or tilt its orbit. Initially, Solar Orbiter will be confined to the same plane as the planets, but each encounter of Venus will increase its orbital inclination. For example, after the 2025 Venus encounter, it will make its first solar pass at 17\u00b0 inclination, increasing to 33\u00b0 during a proposed mission extension phase, bringing even more of the polar regions into direct view.<ref name=\"NASA\"/>\n\n==Scientific objectives==\nThe spacecraft will make a close approach to the [[Sun]] every six months.<ref>https://www.esa.int/ScienceExploration/SpaceScience/SolarOrbiter/SolarOrbiterfactsheet - 10 February 2020</ref> The closest approach will be positioned to allow a repeated study of the same region of the solar atmosphere. ''Solar Orbiter'' will be able to observe the magnetic activity building up in the atmosphere that can lead to powerful [[solar flare]]s or eruptions.\n\nResearchers will also have the chance to coordinate observations with NASA's ''[[Parker Solar Probe]]'' mission (2018-2025) which is performing measurements of the Sun's extended [[corona]].\n\nThe objective of the mission is to perform close-up, high-resolution studies of the Sun and its inner [[heliosphere]]. The new understanding will help answer these questions:\n\n* How and where do the [[solar wind]] plasma and [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic field]] originate in the [[corona]]?\n* How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability?\n* How do solar eruptions produce [[Solar energetic particles|energetic particle]] radiation that fills the heliosphere?\n* How does the [[solar dynamo]] work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere?\n\n==Science payload==\nThe science payload is composed of 10 instruments:<ref name=esa-solar-orbiter>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter|title=Solar Orbiter|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Heliospheric in-situ instruments (4): \n* SWA - Solar Wind Plasma Analyser (United Kingdom): Consists of a suite of sensors that will measure the ion and electron bulk properties (including density, velocity, and temperature) of the solar wind, thereby characterizing the solar wind between 0.28 and 1.4 au from the Sun.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

{"title_page": "Solar eclipse of March 29, 2006", "text_new": "{{Infobox solar eclipse|2006Mar29}}\nA total [[solar eclipse]] occurred on March 28\u201329, 2006. A solar eclipse occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's [[apparent diameter]] is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. It was visible from a narrow corridor which traversed half the [[Earth]]. The [[magnitude of eclipse|magnitude]], that is, the ratio between the apparent sizes of the Moon and that of the Sun, was 1.052, and it was part of Saros 139.\n\n== Visibility ==\n[[File:Solar eclipse animate (2006-Mar-29).gif|thumb|left|Animated path]]\nThe path of totality of the [[Moon]]'s shadow began at sunrise in [[Brazil]] and extended across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to [[Africa]], traveling across [[Ghana]], the southeastern tip of [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], [[Libya]], and a small corner of northwest [[Egypt]], from there across the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to [[Greece]] ([[Kastell\u00f3rizo]]) and [[Turkey]], then across the [[Black Sea]] via [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russia]], and [[Kazakhstan]] to Western [[Mongolia]], where it ended at sunset. A [[Solar eclipse|partial eclipse]] was seen from the much broader path of the [[Moon]]'s [[penumbra]], including the northern two-thirds of [[Africa]], the whole of [[Europe]], and [[Central Asia]].\n\n==Observations==\nPeople around the world gathered in areas where the eclipse was visible to view the event. The [[Manchester Astronomical Society]], the [[Malaysian Space Agency]], the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]], as well as dozens of tour groups met at the Apollo temple and the theater in [[Side, Turkey|Side]], [[Turkey]]. The San Francisco [[Exploratorium]] featured a live webcast from the site, where thousands of observers were seated in the ancient, Roman-style theater.<ref>[http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/2006/index.html Total Solar Eclipse: Live from Turkey in 2006<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n\nAlmost all actively visited areas in the path of totality had perfect weather.

A solar eclipse occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's [[apparent diameter]] is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. It was visible from a narrow corridor which traversed half the [[Earth]]. The [[magnitude of eclipse|magnitude]], that is, the ratio between the apparent sizes of the Moon and that of the Sun, was 1.052, and it was part of Saros 139.\n\n== Visibility ==\n[[File:Solar eclipse animate (2006-Mar-29).gif|thumb|left|Animated path]]\nThe path of totality of the [[Moon]]'s shadow began at sunrise in [[Brazil]] and extended across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to [[Africa]], traveling across [[Ghana]], the southeastern tip of [[Ivory Coast]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], [[Libya]], and a small corner of northwest [[Egypt]], from there across the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to [[Greece]] ([[Kastell\u00f3rizo]]) and [[Turkey]], then across the [[Black Sea]] via [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russia]], and [[Kazakhstan]] to Western [[Mongolia]], where it ended at sunset. A [[Solar eclipse|partial eclipse]] was seen from the much broader path of the [[Moon]]'s [[penumbra]], including the northern two-thirds of [[Africa]], the whole of [[Europe]], and [[Central Asia]].\n\n==Observations==\nPeople around the world gathered in areas where the eclipse was visible to view the event. The [[Manchester Astronomical Society]], the [[Malaysian Space Agency]], the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]], as well as dozens of tour groups met at the Apollo temple and the theater in [[Side, Turkey|Side]], [[Turkey]]. The San Francisco [[Exploratorium]] featured a live webcast from the site, where thousands of observers were seated in the ancient, Roman-style theater.<ref>[http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/2006/index.html Total Solar Eclipse: Live from Turkey in 2006<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n\nAlmost all actively visited areas in the path of totality had perfect weather. Many observers reported an unusually beautiful eclipse, with many or all effects visible, and a very nice [[corona]], despite the proximity to the [[solar minimum]]. The partial phase of the eclipse was also visible from the [[International Space Station]], where the astronauts on board took spectacular pictures of the moon's shadow on [[Earth]]'s surface. It initially appeared as though an orbit correction set for the middle of March would bring the ISS into the path of totality, but this correction was postponed.\n\n== Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Totality_libya_2006.jpg|[[Sahara]], Libya, 12:11 local time (10:11 UTC)\nImage:Eclipse Sol 290306 Valencia.jpg|[[Valencia, Spain]], 12:16 local time (10:16 UTC)\nImage:Diamondring-eclipse-March03-29-2006.jpg|[[Side, Turkey]], 13:55 local time (10:55 UTC)\nImage:Eclipse fromISS 2006-03-29.jpg|[[International Space Station]] over [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]], 13:57 local time (10:57 UTC)\nImage:Eclipse 29032006.jpg|[[Berkhamsted, England]], 12:01 local time (11:01 UTC)\nImage:Eclipsenovosib.jpg|[[Novosibirsk, Russia]], 18:42 local time (11:42 UTC)\nImage:eclipse_krasnoyarsk_29_03_2006.jpg|[[Krasnoyarsk, Russia]], 20:21 local time (12:11 UTC)\nImage:zatm_lagan.jpg|[[Kalmykia]], Russia, 16:22 local time (12:22 UTC)\nImage:20060329sequence.jpg|[[Degania A]], Israel: The Solar Eclipse\nFile:Animation eclipse.gif \n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Satellite failure==\n{{Main|Optus fleet of satellites#Failures}}\nThe satellite responsible for [[SKY Network Television]], a New Zealand pay TV company, failed the day after this eclipse at around 1900 local time.

In particular, it was designed to support separate compilation and data abstraction in a straightforward way. Much of the syntax is based on Wirth's earlier and better-known language, [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Modula-2 was designed to be broadly similar to Pascal, with some elements and syntactic ambiguities removed and the important addition of the ''module'' concept, and direct language support for [[multiprogramming]].\n\nThe language allows compilation in a single pass, and in a compiler of Gutknecht and Wirth was about four times faster than earlier multi-pass compilers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wirth |first1=N. |title=A Single-pass Modula-2 Compiler for Lilith |url=http://www.cfbsoftware.com/modula2/M2SinglePass.pdf |accessdate=28 January 2019 |date=1 May 1984}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example of the source code for the \"Hello world\" program:\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\nMODULE Hello;\nFROM STextIO IMPORT WriteString;\nBEGIN\n  WriteString(\"Hello World!\");\nEND Hello.\n</source>\n\nThe Modula-2 ''module'' may be used to encapsulate a set of related subprograms and data structures, and restrict their visibility from other portions of the program. The module design implemented the data abstraction feature of Modula-2 in a very clean way.  Modula-2 programs are composed of modules, each of which is made up of two parts: a '''definition module''', the interface portion, which contains only those parts of the subsystem that are ''exported'' (visible to other modules), and an '''implementation module''', which contains the working code that is internal to the module.\n\nThe language has strict scope control. In particular the scope of a module can be considered as an impenetrable wall: Except for standard identifiers no object from the outer world is visible inside a module unless explicitly imported; no internal module object is visible from the outside unless explicitly exported.\n\nSuppose module M1 exports objects a, b, c, and P by enumerating its identifiers in an explicit export list\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n  DEFINITION MODULE M1;\n    EXPORT QUALIFIED a, b, c, P;\n    ...\n</source>\n\nThen the objects a, b,c, and P from module M1 become now known outside module M1 as M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. They are exported in a ''qualified'' manner to the universe (assumed module M1 is global). The exporting module's name, i.e. M1, is used as a qualifier followed by the object's name.\n\nSuppose module M2 contains the following IMPORT declaration\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n  MODULE M2;\n    IMPORT M1;\n    ...\n</source>\n\nThen this means that the objects exported by module M1 to the universe of its enclosing program can now be used inside module M2. They are referenced in a ''qualified'' manner like this: M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. Example:\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n    ...\n    M1.a := 0;\n    M1.c := M1.P(M1.a + M1.b);\n    ...\n</source>\n\nQualified export avoids name clashes: For instance, if another module M3 would also export an object called P, then we can still distinguish the two objects, since M1.P differs from M3.P. Thanks to the qualified export it does not matter that both objects are called P inside their exporting modules M1 and M3.\n\nThere is an alternative technique available, which is in wide use by Modula-2 programmers. Suppose module M4 is formulated as this\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n  MODULE M4;\n    FROM M1 IMPORT a, b, c, P;\n</source>\n\nThen this means that objects exported by module M1 to the universe can again be used inside module M4, but now by mere references to the exported identifiers in an \"unqualified\" manner like this: a, b, c, and P. Example:\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n    ...\n    a := 0;\n    c := P(a + b);\n    ...\n</source>\n\nThis technique of unqualifying import allows use of variables and other objects outside their exporting module in exactly the same simple, i.e. ''unqualified'', manner as inside the exporting module. The walls surrounding all modules have now become irrelevant for all those objects for which this has been explicitly allowed. Of course unqualifying import is only usable if there are no name clashes.\n\nThese export and import rules may seem unnecessarily restrictive and verbose. But they do not only safeguard objects against unwanted access, but also have the pleasant side-effect of providing automatic cross-referencing of the definition of every identifier in a program: if the identifier is qualified by a module name, then the definition comes from that module. Otherwise if it occurs unqualified, simply search backwards, and you will either encounter a declaration of that identifier, or its occurrence in an IMPORT statement which names the module it comes from. This property becomes very useful when trying to understand large programs containing many modules.\n\nThe language provides for (limited) single-processor concurrency ([[monitor (synchronization)|monitors]], [[coroutine]]s and explicit transfer of control) and for hardware access (absolute addresses, bit manipulation, and [[interrupt]]s). It uses a [[nominal type system]].\n\n== Dialects ==\nThere are two major dialects of Modula-2.  The first is '''PIM''', named after the book\n\"Programming in Modula-2\" by Niklaus Wirth.  There were three major editions of PIM,\nthe second, third (corrected) and fourth editions, each describing slight variants of the\nlanguage.  The second major dialect is '''ISO''', from the standardization effort by the\n[[International Organization for Standardization]].  Here are a few of the differences amongst them.\n\n* '''PIM2''' (1983)\n** Required explicit '''EXPORT''' clause in definition modules.\n** Function '''SIZE''' needs to be imported from module '''SYSTEM'''\n* '''PIM3''' (1985)\n** Removed the '''EXPORT''' clause from definition modules following the observation that everything within a definition module defines the interface to that module, hence the '''EXPORT''' clause was redundant.\n** Function '''SIZE''' is pervasive (visible in any scope without import)\n* '''PIM4''' (1988)\n** Specified the behaviour of the '''MOD''' operator when the operands are negative.\n** Required all '''ARRAY OF CHAR''' strings to be terminated by ASCII NUL, even if the string fits exactly into its array.\n* '''ISO''' (1996 and 1998)\n** ISO Modula-2 resolved most of the ambiguities in PIM Modula-2. It added the data types '''COMPLEX''' and '''LONGCOMPLEX''', exceptions, module termination ('''FINALLY''' clause) and a complete standard I/O library. There are numerous minor differences and clarifications.<ref>ISO/IEC 10514-1:1996</ref>\n\n== Supersets ==\nThere are several supersets of Modula-2 with language extensions for specific application domains:\n* '''PIM supersets'''\n** [http://www.mhccorp.com/modula-2.html Canterbury Modula-2], extended with Oberon-like extensible records [This has been withdrawn and is no longer available anywhere]\n** [[Modula-2+]], extended with preemptive threads and exceptions\n** [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.48.7784 Modula-2*], parallel extension<ref>Tichy et al., Modula-2*: An Extension for Modula-2 for highly parallel portable programs, [[University of Karlsruhe]] [1990]</ref>\n** [http://robotics.ee.uwa.edu.au/modula-p/ Modula-P], another parallel extension<ref>Br\u00e4unl, Parallel Programming, Prentice-Hall [1993]</ref>\n** Modula-Prolog, adding a Prolog layer<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1109/MS.1986.229475 |title = Modula--Prolog: A Software Development|year = 1986|last1 = Muller|first1 = C.|journal = IEEE Software|volume = 3|issue = 6|pages = 39\u201345}}</ref>\n** Modula/R, with relational database extensions\n** Modula-GM, extensions for embedded systems\n* '''ISO supersets'''\n** ISO10514-2, adding an object-oriented programming layer<ref>modula2.org, 5.

The compiler runs on [[MS-DOS]] and it generates code for [[M68k]]-based embedded microcontrollers running the MINOS operating system.\n\n=== Mod51 ===\nMod51 by Mandeno Granville Electronics is based on ISO Modula-2 with language extensions for embedded development following IEC1131, an industry standard for [[programmable logic controllers]] (PLC) closely related to Modula-2. The Mod51 compiler generates standalone code for 80C51 based microcontrollers.\n\n=== Modula-GM ===\n[[Delco Electronics]], then a subsidiary of GM [[Hughes Electronics]], developed a version of Modula-2 for embedded control systems starting in 1985. Delco named it Modula-GM. It was the first high level language used to replace machine language code for embedded systems in Delco's engine control units (ECUs). This was significant because Delco was producing over 28,000 ECUs per day in 1988 for GM; this was then the world's largest producer of ECUs.<ref>Delco Electronics Electron Magazine, The Atwood Legacy, Spring '89, page 25</ref> The first experimental use of Modula-GM in an embedded controller was in the 1985 Antilock Braking System Controller which was based on the Motorola 68xxx microprocessor, and in 1993 Gen-4 ECU used by the [[Champ Car|CART]] (Championship Auto Racing Teams) and [[Indy Racing League|IRL]] (Indy Racing League) teams.<ref>[[Development of electronics for GM auto racing]]</ref> The first production use of Modula-GM was its use in GM trucks starting with the 1990 model year VCM (Vehicle Control Module) used to manage GM Powertrain's [[Vortec]] engines. Modula-GM was also used on all ECUs for GM's [[Buick V6 engine|90\u00b0 Buick V6 family]] 3800 Series II used in the 1997-2005 model year [[Buick Park Avenue]]. The Modula-GM compilers and associated software management tools were sourced by Delco from [[Intermetrics]].\n\nModula-2 was selected as the basis for Delco's high level language because of its many strengths over other alternative language choices in 1986. After Delco Electronics was spun off from GM (with other component divisions) to form [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]] in 1997, global sourcing required that a non-proprietary high-level software language be used.  ECU embedded software now developed at Delphi is compiled with commercial C compilers.\n\n=== Russian GPS satellites ===\nAccording to the Modula-2 article in the Russian Wikipedia, all satellites of the Russian GPS framework [[GLONASS]] are programmed in Modula-2.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Compilers ==\n{{External links|sections|date=February 2020}}\n* [https://github.com/davidgiven/ack ACK] Modula-2 for [[MINIX]] ([[freeware]])\n* [http://www.modula2.org/adwm2/ ADW Modula-2] ADW Modula-2 for Windows, ISO compliant, ISO/IEC 10514-1, ISO/IEC 10514-2 (OO extension), ISO/IEC 10514-3 (Generic extension) (freeware)\n* [http://aglet.web.runbox.net Aglet Modula-2] for Amiga OS 4.0/PPC (freeware)\n* [http://www.cms.uk.com Cambridge Modula-2] for various micro-controllers and embedded MINOS operating system (commercial + [[proprietary software]])\n* [ftp://ftp.psg.com/pub/modula-2/fst/fst-40s.lzh FST] Fitted Software Tools Modula-2 for DOS (freeware)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002046/http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/gpm/ Gardens Point Modula-2] for BSD, Linux, OS/2 and Solaris - ISO compliant (freeware), as of July 30, 2014, [http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/gpm/ original website] is down\n* [http://gpmclr.codeplex.com Gardens Point Modula-2 (GPM/CLR)] for [[.NET Framework|.NET]] (freeware)\n* [http://www.nongnu.org/gm2/ GNU Modula-2] for GCC platforms, version 1.0 released December 11, 2010; PIM2, PIM3, PIM4, and ISO compliant ([[free software]], [[GNU General Public License|GPLed]])\n*[http://m2amiga.claudio.ch M2Amiga] for Amiga ([[free software]])\n* [http://www.cfbsoftware.com/modula2 M2M] by N.

In particular, it was designed to support separate compilation and data abstraction in a straightforward way. Much of the syntax is based on Wirth's earlier and better-known language, [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Modula-2 was designed to be broadly similar to Pascal, with some elements and syntactic ambiguities removed and the important addition of the ''module'' concept, and direct language support for [[multiprogramming]].\n\nThe language allows compilation in a single pass, and in a compiler of Gutknecht and Wirth was about four times faster than earlier multi-pass compilers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wirth |first1=N. |title=A Single-pass Modula-2 Compiler for Lilith |url=http://www.cfbsoftware.com/modula2/M2SinglePass.pdf |accessdate=28 January 2019 |date=1 May 1984}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example of the source code for the \"Hello world\" program:\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\nMODULE Hello;\nFROM STextIO IMPORT WriteString;\nBEGIN\n  WriteString(\"Hello World!\");\nEND Hello.\n</source>\n\nThe Modula-2 ''module'' may be used to encapsulate a set of related subprograms and data structures, and restrict their visibility from other portions of the program. The module design implemented the data abstraction feature of Modula-2 in a very clean way.  Modula-2 programs are composed of modules, each of which is made up of two parts: a '''definition module''', the interface portion, which contains only those parts of the subsystem that are ''exported'' (visible to other modules), and an '''implementation module''', which contains the working code that is internal to the module.\n\nThe language has strict scope control. In particular the scope of a module can be considered as an impenetrable wall: Except for standard identifiers no object from the outer world is visible inside a module unless explicitly imported; no internal module object is visible from the outside unless explicitly exported.\n\nSuppose module M1 exports objects a, b, c, and P by enumerating its identifiers in an explicit export list\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n  DEFINITION MODULE M1;\n    EXPORT QUALIFIED a, b, c, P;\n    ...\n</source>\n\nThen the objects a, b,c, and P from module M1 become now known outside module M1 as M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. They are exported in a ''qualified'' manner to the universe (assumed module M1 is global). The exporting module's name, i.e. M1, is used as a qualifier followed by the object's name.\n\nSuppose module M2 contains the following IMPORT declaration\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n  MODULE M2;\n    IMPORT M1;\n    ...\n</source>\n\nThen this means that the objects exported by module M1 to the universe of its enclosing program can now be used inside module M2. They are referenced in a ''qualified'' manner like this: M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. Example:\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n    ...\n    M1.a := 0;\n    M1.c := M1.P(M1.a + M1.b);\n    ...\n</source>\n\nQualified export avoids name clashes: For instance, if another module M3 would also export an object called P, then we can still distinguish the two objects, since M1.P differs from M3.P. Thanks to the qualified export it does not matter that both objects are called P inside their exporting modules M1 and M3.\n\nThere is an alternative technique available, which is in wide use by Modula-2 programmers. Suppose module M4 is formulated as this\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n  MODULE M4;\n    FROM M1 IMPORT a, b, c, P;\n</source>\n\nThen this means that objects exported by module M1 to the universe can again be used inside module M4, but now by mere references to the exported identifiers in an \"unqualified\" manner like this: a, b, c, and P. Example:\n\n<source lang=\"modula2\">\n    ...\n    a := 0;\n    c := P(a + b);\n    ...\n</source>\n\nThis technique of unqualifying import allows use of variables and other objects outside their exporting module in exactly the same simple, i.e. ''unqualified'', manner as inside the exporting module. The walls surrounding all modules have now become irrelevant for all those objects for which this has been explicitly allowed. Of course unqualifying import is only usable if there are no name clashes.\n\nThese export and import rules may seem unnecessarily restrictive and verbose. But they do not only safeguard objects against unwanted access, but also have the pleasant side-effect of providing automatic cross-referencing of the definition of every identifier in a program: if the identifier is qualified by a module name, then the definition comes from that module. Otherwise if it occurs unqualified, simply search backwards, and you will either encounter a declaration of that identifier, or its occurrence in an IMPORT statement which names the module it comes from. This property becomes very useful when trying to understand large programs containing many modules.\n\nThe language provides for (limited) single-processor concurrency ([[monitor (synchronization)|monitors]], [[coroutine]]s and explicit transfer of control) and for hardware access (absolute addresses, bit manipulation, and [[interrupt]]s). It uses a [[nominal type system]].\n\n== Dialects ==\nThere are two major dialects of Modula-2.  The first is '''PIM''', named after the book\n\"Programming in Modula-2\" by Niklaus Wirth.  There were three major editions of PIM,\nthe second, third (corrected) and fourth editions, each describing slight variants of the\nlanguage.  The second major dialect is '''ISO''', from the standardization effort by the\n[[International Organization for Standardization]].  Here are a few of the differences amongst them.\n\n* '''PIM2''' (1983)\n** Required explicit '''EXPORT''' clause in definition modules.\n** Function '''SIZE''' needs to be imported from module '''SYSTEM'''\n* '''PIM3''' (1985)\n** Removed the '''EXPORT''' clause from definition modules following the observation that everything within a definition module defines the interface to that module, hence the '''EXPORT''' clause was redundant.\n** Function '''SIZE''' is pervasive (visible in any scope without import)\n* '''PIM4''' (1988)\n** Specified the behaviour of the '''MOD''' operator when the operands are negative.\n** Required all '''ARRAY OF CHAR''' strings to be terminated by ASCII NUL, even if the string fits exactly into its array.\n* '''ISO''' (1996 and 1998)\n** ISO Modula-2 resolved most of the ambiguities in PIM Modula-2. It added the data types '''COMPLEX''' and '''LONGCOMPLEX''', exceptions, module termination ('''FINALLY''' clause) and a complete standard I/O library. There are numerous minor differences and clarifications.<ref>ISO/IEC 10514-1:1996</ref>\n\n== Supersets ==\nThere are several supersets of Modula-2 with language extensions for specific application domains:\n* '''PIM supersets'''\n** [http://www.mhccorp.com/modula-2.html Canterbury Modula-2], extended with Oberon-like extensible records [This has been withdrawn and is no longer available anywhere]\n** [[Modula-2+]], extended with preemptive threads and exceptions\n** [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.48.7784 Modula-2*], parallel extension<ref>Tichy et al., Modula-2*: An Extension for Modula-2 for highly parallel portable programs, [[University of Karlsruhe]] [1990]</ref>\n** [http://robotics.ee.uwa.edu.au/modula-p/ Modula-P], another parallel extension<ref>Br\u00e4unl, Parallel Programming, Prentice-Hall [1993]</ref>\n** Modula-Prolog, adding a Prolog layer<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1109/MS.1986.229475 |title = Modula--Prolog: A Software Development|year = 1986|last1 = Muller|first1 = C.|journal = IEEE Software|volume = 3|issue = 6|pages = 39\u201345}}</ref>\n** Modula/R, with relational database extensions\n** Modula-GM, extensions for embedded systems\n* '''ISO supersets'''\n** ISO10514-2, adding an object-oriented programming layer<ref>modula2.org, 5.

The compiler runs on [[MS-DOS]] and it generates code for [[M68k]]-based embedded microcontrollers running the MINOS operating system.\n\n=== Mod51 ===\nMod51 by Mandeno Granville Electronics is based on ISO Modula-2 with language extensions for embedded development following IEC1131, an industry standard for [[programmable logic controllers]] (PLC) closely related to Modula-2. The Mod51 compiler generates standalone code for 80C51 based microcontrollers.\n\n=== Modula-GM ===\n[[Delco Electronics]], then a subsidiary of GM [[Hughes Electronics]], developed a version of Modula-2 for embedded control systems starting in 1985. Delco named it Modula-GM. It was the first high level language used to replace machine language code for embedded systems in Delco's engine control units (ECUs). This was significant because Delco was producing over 28,000 ECUs per day in 1988 for GM; this was then the world's largest producer of ECUs.<ref>Delco Electronics Electron Magazine, The Atwood Legacy, Spring '89, page 25</ref> The first experimental use of Modula-GM in an embedded controller was in the 1985 Antilock Braking System Controller which was based on the Motorola 68xxx microprocessor, and in 1993 Gen-4 ECU used by the [[Champ Car|CART]] (Championship Auto Racing Teams) and [[Indy Racing League|IRL]] (Indy Racing League) teams.<ref>[[Development of electronics for GM auto racing]]</ref> The first production use of Modula-GM was its use in GM trucks starting with the 1990 model year VCM (Vehicle Control Module) used to manage GM Powertrain's [[Vortec]] engines. Modula-GM was also used on all ECUs for GM's [[Buick V6 engine|90\u00b0 Buick V6 family]] 3800 Series II used in the 1997-2005 model year [[Buick Park Avenue]]. The Modula-GM compilers and associated software management tools were sourced by Delco from [[Intermetrics]].\n\nModula-2 was selected as the basis for Delco's high level language because of its many strengths over other alternative language choices in 1986. After Delco Electronics was spun off from GM (with other component divisions) to form [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]] in 1997, global sourcing required that a non-proprietary high-level software language be used.  ECU embedded software now developed at Delphi is compiled with commercial C compilers.\n\n=== Russian GPS satellites ===\nAccording to the Modula-2 article in the Russian Wikipedia, all satellites of the Russian GPS framework [[GLONASS]] are programmed in Modula-2.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Compilers ==\n{{External links|sections|date=February 2020}}\n* [https://github.com/davidgiven/ack ACK] Modula-2 for [[MINIX]] ([[freeware]])\n* [http://www.modula2.org/adwm2/ ADW Modula-2] ADW Modula-2 for Windows, ISO compliant, ISO/IEC 10514-1, ISO/IEC 10514-2 (OO extension), ISO/IEC 10514-3 (Generic extension) (freeware)\n* [http://aglet.web.runbox.net Aglet Modula-2] for Amiga OS 4.0/PPC (freeware)\n* [http://www.cms.uk.com Cambridge Modula-2] for various micro-controllers and embedded MINOS operating system (commercial + [[proprietary software]])\n* [ftp://ftp.psg.com/pub/modula-2/fst/fst-40s.lzh FST] Fitted Software Tools Modula-2 for DOS (freeware)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002046/http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/gpm/ Gardens Point Modula-2] for BSD, Linux, OS/2 and Solaris - ISO compliant (freeware), as of July 30, 2014, [http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/gpm/ original website] is down\n* [http://gpmclr.codeplex.com Gardens Point Modula-2 (GPM/CLR)] for [[.NET Framework|.NET]] (freeware)\n* [http://www.nongnu.org/gm2/ GNU Modula-2] for GCC platforms, version 1.0 released December 11, 2010; PIM2, PIM3, PIM4, and ISO compliant ([[free software]], [[GNU General Public License|GPLed]])\n*[http://m2amiga.claudio.ch M2Amiga] for Amiga ([[free software]])\n* [http://www.cfbsoftware.com/modula2 M2M] by N.
