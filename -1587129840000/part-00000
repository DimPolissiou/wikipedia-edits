To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

When Principal Morse crossed the street from the school and confronted Frederick about the banner, he asked \"What about the Bill of Rights and freedom of speech?\" She told him to take the banner down because she \"felt that it violated the policy against displaying offensive material, including material that advertises or promotes use of illegal drugs\", and she grabbed it from him and crumpled it up.<ref>''Frederick v.

Frederick then appealed to the Juneau School Board, which upheld the suspension on March 19, 2002.\n\n===District court===\n{{Youth rights sidebar|Activities}}\nOn April&nbsp;25, 2002, Frederick filed a [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|civil rights]] lawsuit (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) against Morse and the school board, claiming they violated his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech.<ref name=Mears/> He sought a [[declaratory relief]] (for a declaratory judgment that his First Amendment rights had been violated), [[Injunction|injunctive]] relief (for an injunction to remove the reference to the ten-day suspension from his school records), and monetary awards ([[Compensatory damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory damages]], [[punitive damages]], and [[attorney's fee]]s).<ref name=MvF4>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 399.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]] dismissed Frederick's case on [[summary judgment]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', No. J 02-008 CV(JWS), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27270 (D. Alaska May 27, 2003).</ref> The district court reasoned that ''[[Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under school-speech doctrines, even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No.'\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}. The Court, in holding (contra the District Court) that ''Tinker v.

Des Moines Independent Community School District'', {{Ussc|393|503|1969}} as \"that there is a right to political speech subject to disruption\u2014that the speech not be disruptive\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 4, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He defined the disruptiveness in general terms as behavior inimical to the educational mission of the school, and in specific terms as a violation of the school's announced policy to enforce and support laws with respect to the control of marijuana (and other laws in general). Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> That case was said to be concerned with school disciplinary actions \"casting a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> [[David Souter|Justice Souter]] remarked that 'Bong Hits 4 JESUS' \"sounds like just a kid's provocative statement to me\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 17, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> Starr responded by saying \"the key is to allow the school official to interpret the message as long as that interpretation is reasonable.\"<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 18, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>\n\nDeputy Solicitor-General [[Edwin Kneedler]] spoke on behalf of the U.S. government in support of the petitioner. He said: \"The First Amendment does not require public school officials to stand aside and permit students who are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote or encourage the illegal use of drugs.\"<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 19, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He cited the cases of ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' and ''Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier'' in his favor.\n\nDouglas K. Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''Board of Education v. Earls'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''. A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the class room: we are light years away from that.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 59, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"school speech\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits&nbsp;...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's school speech jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No.&nbsp;92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls]]''.<!-- this content isn\u2019t appropriate for this article; I am preserving it so I can move it to a new article on school speech.\n* \"while children assuredly do not 'shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate,' ... the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school.\"<ref>Here, Roberts cited to:<br />''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.

It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure.

Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would&nbsp;... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]].

For example, in Wisniewski, a student was suspended after school officials learned of an instant messenger icon he had created that depicted the shooting of his English teacher. 494 F.3d at 35. In one of the few decisions citing to Morse, the Second Circuit declined to consider whether the true threat doctrine was relevant, and instead applied ''Tinker''{{'}}s substantial disruption test. Id. at 38\u201339. The court held that the school did not violate the student's First Amendment rights by suspending him because it was reasonably foreseeable that the icon would come to school officials' attention and cause a disruption at school.

Frederick'' Be Applied?\" 12 ''Lewis & Clark Law Review'', 1</ref> noting that Chief Justice Roberts \"sought to keep the decision quite narrow\", limiting the case \"to the issue of public school administrators' ability to keep the educational process free from messages about illegal drugs\" and drawing from the Court's existing student speech jurisprudence that \"permitted school administrators broad discretion to keep out of the educational environment antisocial messages celebrating drug use\".<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n===Erwin Chemerinsky===\nLeading constitutional law scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] participated in the same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

His suit was dismissed by the [[federal district court]], but on appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the ruling, concluding that Frederick's speech rights were violated.\n\n[[Chief Justice Roberts]], writing for the majority, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment. To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

But Frederick and his group did not participate in these disorders, saving their [*1116] energy for what they hoped would be their nationally televised sign display. And, the disruption that took place occurred before the display of the banner, so it could not have been caused by it.</blockquote>\n\nIn subsequent days, there was some pro-drug graffiti in the high school that the principal thought was \"sparked\" by the banner, but the principal did not rip down the sign at the rally because she anticipated or was concerned about such possible consequences. When Principal Morse crossed the street from the school and confronted Frederick about the banner, he asked \"What about the Bill of Rights and freedom of speech?\" She told him to take the banner down because she \"felt that it violated the policy against displaying offensive material, including material that advertises or promotes use of illegal drugs\", and she grabbed it from him and crumpled it up.<ref>''Frederick v.

Frederick then appealed to the Juneau School Board, which upheld the suspension on March 19, 2002.\n\n===District court===\n{{Youth rights sidebar|Activities}}\nOn April&nbsp;25, 2002, Frederick filed a [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|civil rights]] lawsuit (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) against Morse and the school board, claiming they violated his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech.<ref name=Mears/> He sought a [[declaratory relief]] (for a declaratory judgment that his First Amendment rights had been violated), [[Injunction|injunctive]] relief (for an injunction to remove the reference to the ten-day suspension from his school records), and monetary awards ([[Compensatory damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory damages]], [[punitive damages]], and [[attorney's fee]]s).<ref name=MvF4>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 399.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]] dismissed Frederick's case on [[summary judgment]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', No. J 02-008 CV(JWS), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27270 (D. Alaska May 27, 2003).</ref> The district court reasoned that ''[[Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under school-speech doctrines, even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No.'\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}. The Court, in holding (contra the District Court) that ''Tinker v.

Des Moines Independent Community School District'', {{Ussc|393|503|1969}} as \"that there is a right to political speech subject to disruption\u2014that the speech not be disruptive\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 4, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He defined the disruptiveness in general terms as behavior inimical to the educational mission of the school, and in specific terms as a violation of the school's announced policy to enforce and support laws with respect to the control of marijuana (and other laws in general). Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> That case was said to be concerned with school disciplinary actions \"casting a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> [[David Souter|Justice Souter]] remarked that 'Bong Hits 4 JESUS' \"sounds like just a kid's provocative statement to me\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 17, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> Starr responded by saying \"the key is to allow the school official to interpret the message as long as that interpretation is reasonable.\"<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 18, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>\n\nDeputy Solicitor-General [[Edwin Kneedler]] spoke on behalf of the U.S. government in support of the petitioner. He said: \"The First Amendment does not require public school officials to stand aside and permit students who are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote or encourage the illegal use of drugs.\"<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 19, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He cited the cases of ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' and ''Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier'' in his favor.\n\nDouglas K. Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''Board of Education v. Earls'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''. A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the class room: we are light years away from that.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 59, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"school speech\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits&nbsp;...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.

Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would&nbsp;... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]]. Qualified immunity is an [[affirmative defense]] that requires courts to enter judgment in favor of a government employee accused of violating individual rights unless the employee's conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 429 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref> Because it was not clear whether the school principal's actions in taking down the banner violated the First Amendment, Breyer would have simply issued a narrow decision indicating that she was shielded by qualified immunity and gone no further.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 425-26 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Dissent===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens]], in a dissent joined by Justice [[David Souter|Souter]] and Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], argued that \"the Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding\u2014indeed, lauding\u2014a school's decision to punish Frederick for expressing a view with which it disagreed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 435 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens wrote:\n\n{{quote|... the school's interest in protecting its students from exposure to speech 'reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use' ... cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his attempt to make an ambiguous statement to a television audience simply because it contained an oblique reference to drugs.

He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule.

Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]], to form the DSA.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">\n* {{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html|accessdate=February 8, 2010|ref=harv}}\n''The New York Times'' reported on the Convention for three other days:\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721227-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists defeat motion favoring recognition of Cuba|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1972|page=15|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721228-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title='Firmness' urged on <!-- CAPITALIZED! -->Communists: Social Democrats reach end of U.S. Convention here|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1973|page=11|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/730101-sdusa-news.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members.

This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by the DSOC (the DSA forerunner) since its establishment in 1973. In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingunion.wordpress.com|title=Talking Union: A Project of the DSA Labor Network|publisher=Talkingunion.wordpress.com|date=|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1195/walking-the-tightrope/|title=Walking the tightrope - Weekly Worker|website=weeklyworker.co.uk|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA.

In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"obit\"/> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref>Bella Stumbo.

Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America\", states that \"no country has fully instituted democratic socialism\". Nonetheless, according to the DSA there are lessons to be learned from \"the [[Nordic model|comprehensive welfare state]] maintained by the Swedes, from Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|national healthcare system]], France's [[Child care#France|nationwide childcare program]], and Nicaragua's [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]]\".<ref name=\"whatis\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dsausa.org/pdf/widemsoc.pdf|title=What is Democratic Socialism?

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from what he saw as an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=June 29, 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=July 12, 2019 |date=August 5, 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=July 12, 2019 |date=July 30, 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=June 29, 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=June 29, 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States.

In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"obit\"/> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref>Bella Stumbo.

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from what he saw as an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=5 August 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=30 July 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law. In the same statement, the DSA called for protests of Trump's actions and for the lobbying of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to halt any further intervention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/democratic_socialists_of_america_condemns_the_u_s_bombing_of_syria|title=Democratic Socialists of America Condemns the U.S. Bombing of Syria|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2019 DSA Convention, the group announced its support for [[open borders]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/2019-convention-a-world-to-win/|title=2019 Convention: A World to Win|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Anti-fascism ===\nThe DSA maintains itself as an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/demsocialists/status/899489883428982784?lang=en|title=DSA \ud83c\udf39 on Twitter|website=Twitter}}</ref> Members have been present at various anti-fascist marches and protests, including counterprotests against the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], the [[Boston Free Speech Rally]] and many other right-wing rallies surrounding the [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]].

This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender.

Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\".

He is the captain of the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' (based on the [[Flying Dutchman|ghost ship of the same name]]).\n\nThe [[computer-generated imagery]] used to complete Jones was named by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' as the tenth favorite computer generated film character in film history, behind [[King Kong]]  in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our 10 Favorite CG Characters|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://ew.com/gallery/our-10-favorite-cg-characters/|accessdate=2018-06-14}}</ref> The work on Davy Jones by [[Industrial Light and Magic]] earned them the [[79th Academy Awards|2006]] [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for ''Dead Man's Chest''.\n\nThe character is based on the superstition of [[Davy Jones' Locker]].\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:FromRealToReal.jpg|thumb|upright|From reel to reality: Davy Jones is brought to life.]]\n{{See also|Industrial Light & Magic|Motion capture|Computer-generated imagery|photorealism}}\nBefore officially casting [[Bill Nighy]], producers also met with [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Iain Glen]] and [[Richard E.

Several reviewers have in fact mistakenly identified Nighy as wearing [[prosthetic makeup]] or a [[latex mask]] due to the [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] character's [[photorealism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/2006/piratesofthecaribbean2.html|title=Review by Russ Breimeier|work=ChristianityToday.com|accessdate=July 9, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/07/07/104046.php|title=A review by Iloz Zoc|work=BlogCritics.org|accessdate=July 9, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307120228/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/07/07/104046.php|archivedate=March 7, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Design and appearance===\nDavy Jones' physique was designed by the films' producers to be a mixture of various aquatic [[flora]] and [[fauna]] features. Jones' most striking feature is his [[cephalopod]]-like head, with octopus-like appendages giving the illusion of a thick beard. A prominent sac bulges from under his barnacle-encrusted [[tricorne]]. In addition to his \"bearded\" face, he breathes through a [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphon]] located on the left side of his face. Jones has a [[crustacean]]-style claw for his left arm, a long [[tentacle]] in place of the index finger on his right hand, and the right leg of a [[crab]] (resembling a [[pegleg]]).\n\nIt is revealed in the bonus features of the Special Edition DVD that the face's color was partly inspired by a coffee-stained styrofoam cup which was then scanned into ILM's computers to be used as the skin. He speaks with a clearly distinguishable, albeit thick, Scottish accent that's slightly altered to account for his lack of a nose, and presumably, a nasal cavity and/or sinuses. Originally, director [[Gore Verbinski]] wanted Jones to be Dutch, as he is the captain of the \"Dutch-man\". Nighy however responded, \"I don't do Dutch. So I decided on Scottish.\"<ref name=meet/> Nighy later revealed that Scottish sitcom ''[[Still Game]]'' influenced his choice of accent, stating: \"I had to find an accent no one else had. Although Alex Norton is Scottish, mine was slightly different. We wanted something that was distinctive and authoritative...I have seen ''Still Game'' and I am a fan. The sort of extremity of the accent was inspired in that area.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Davy / Nighy news update|publisher=BillNighy.info|url=http://www.billnighy.info/2006/07/07/davy-nighy-news-update/|date=July 7, 2006|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Before the films===\n{{See also|Tia Dalma|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}\n\nDavy Jones, a human and a great sailor, fell in love with Calypso, a sea goddess. She entrusted him with the task of ferrying the souls of those who died at sea to the next world.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.8.</ref> Calypso gave him the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' to accomplish this task. She swore that after ten years, she would meet him and they would spend one day together before he returned to his duties. However, when Jones returned to shore after ten years, Calypso failed to appear. Believing Calypso had betrayed him, a heartbroken and enraged Davy Jones turned the [[Brethren Court|Pirate Brethren]] against her, saying that if she were removed from the world, they would be able to claim the seas for themselves. They assembled in the [[Brethren Court|First Brethren Court]] and Jones taught them how to imprison her into her human form.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.15.</ref>\n\nDespite betraying her, Jones still loved Calypso, and in despair and guilt for what he had done, he carved out his own heart from his chest and placed it in the \"Dead Man's Chest\". The Chest was sealed and placed within a larger wooden chest, along with Jones' numerous love letters to Calypso and all other items having to do with her, except his matching musical locket. The chest was then buried on Isla Cruces. Jones kept the chest's key with him at all times. With Calypso gone, Jones abandoned his duties and returned to the Seven Seas. As a result of this, Jones gradually became monstrous, his physical appearance merging with various aquatic fauna. Sailors everywhere would fear him to the death, for Davy Jones had turned fierce and cruel, with an insatiable taste for all things brutal. Jones recruits dying sailors by promising them a reprieve from death in exchange for 100 years of service aboard the ''Dutchman''. He comes to command the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]], a feared mythological sea monster.\n\nIn the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow|book series]] about [[Jack Sparrow]]'s earlier adventures, Davy Jones shows interest in the Sword of Cortes, also sought by Jack. He is a minor character, but appears in the seventh book as Jack and his crew encounter the ''Flying Dutchman''.\n\nJones also appears in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom|prequel book]] about Jack's first years as a captain. He helps the Brethren Court to identify the traitor among them, who turns out to be Borya Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea.<ref>''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom]]'', Ch.8 The Devil in the Deep Blue Sea.</ref>\n\nBefore the events of the first film, Davy Jones approaches Sparrow with a deal: Jones will raise the ''Black Pearl'' back from [[Davy Jones' Locker]], allowing Sparrow to be captain for 13 years if Sparrow agrees to serve on the ''Dutchman'' for 100 years. This event, referenced in the films, also appears in the book series.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom'', Ch.19 The Freedom's Price.</ref>\n\n===''Dead Man's Chest''===\n{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}\n\nDavy Jones first appears in the second film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'', in which he attempts to collect on his bargain with Jack Sparrow: Davy Jones raised the ''Black Pearl'' from the sea for Sparrow. In exchange for being captain for 13 years, Sparrow promised Jones his soul. Sparrow argues that he was only captain for two years before [[Hector Barbossa]] committed mutiny. Jones rejects this explanation, explaining that despite the mutiny, Jack still gave himself the title \"Captain\". Sparrow then attempts to escape the deal by providing [[Will Turner]] as a substitute for himself. Jack strikes a new deal with Jones; Jack will be spared enslavement on the ''Dutchman'' if he brings Jones one hundred souls to replace his own within the next three days. Jones accepts, removes the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black spot]] from Jack's hand, and retains Will, keeping him as a \"good faith payment.\"\n\n[[File:Davyjonesandcrew.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Jones and some of the ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' crew after Will challenges him to Liar's Dice.]]\n\nWhile on the ''Dutchman'', Will challenges Jones at a game of [[Liar's Dice|liar's dice]]. They wager Will's soul for an eternity of service against the key to the ''Dead Man's Chest''. Bootstrap Bill joins the game and purposefully loses to save Will. During the game, Will learns where Jones keeps the key. The next morning, Jones realizes the key is gone and summons the Kraken to destroy the ship carrying Turner, who actually survives. The ''Dutchman'' then sails to Isla Cruces to stop Sparrow from getting the Chest.\n\nArriving, Jones sends his crew to retrieve the Chest; they return to him with it. The ''Dutchman'' then chases after the ''Black Pearl'', but is outrun. Jones summons the Kraken, which drags Jack Sparrow and the ''Pearl'' to Davy Jones's Locker. He afterwards opens the Chest only to find his heart missing; it having been taken by James Norrington, who gives it to Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.\n\n===''At World's End''===\n{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End}}\n{{See also|Cutler Beckett}}\n\nIn the third film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', Jones is under the control of [[Cutler Beckett]] and the [[East India Trading Company]]. Beckett possesses the heart, and threatens to have soldiers shoot it if Jones disobeys. Beckett orders Jones to sink pirate ships, but is infuriated when Jones leaves no survivors; Beckett wants prisoners to interrogate about the Brethren Court. Beckett also orders Jones to kill the Kraken.<ref name=awe5>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.5</ref> Later, he orders Jones attack the [[Brethren Court|Pirate Lord]] [[Sao Feng]]; Jones subsequently kills Sao and captures [[Elizabeth Swann]], who had been named captain by [[Sao Feng]] upon his death.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.12.</ref> When Admiral [[James Norrington]] dies on board the ''Dutchman'' while helping Elizabeth escape, Jones claims Norrington's sword (originally crafted by Will Turner). Jones then attempts mutiny against the EITC. However, [[List of characters in Pirates of the Caribbean#Mercer|Mercer]] successfully defends the Chest, forcing Jones to continue under Beckett's service.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.14.</ref>\n\nBeckett later summons Jones to his ship, the ''Endeavour''. Jones confronts [[Will Turner]] and divulges his past with Calypso, while learning of Jack Sparrow's escape from the Locker. The three men then arrive at [[Shipwreck Cove]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:'At World's End' - Davy Jones.jpg|thumb|Right|300px|Human Davy Jones.]]\n\nJones confronts Calypso, locked in the brig of the ''Black Pearl''. The two former lovers discuss Calypso's betrayal and Jones's curse. Calypso temporarily lifts his curse, allowing him to be seen briefly in his original human form. Jones tells her that his heart will always belong to her. Calypso, unaware that Jones betrayed her to the first Brethren Court, says that after her release, she will fully give her love to him.\n\nJones participates in a parley in which the EITC trades Turner for Sparrow.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.19</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.21 through 24</ref> After Calypso is freed, Will reveals that Jones betrayed her. She escapes, refusing to aid either the pirates or Jones. Her fury creates a monstrous [[maelstrom]]. The ''Dutchman'' and the ''Pearl'' enter it and battle.\n\nDuring the battle Jones kills Mercer and retrieves the key to the Chest. Sparrow and Jones fight for control of the chest in the rigging of the ''Dutchman''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Jack acquires both the Chest and the key while Jones battles Will and Elizabeth. Jones quickly overpowers Elizabeth, and is subsequently impaled through the back by Will. Jones, unharmed, holds Will at sword-point. Jack threatens to stab the heart, and Jones cruelly stabs Will. Remembering Will as his son, Bootstrap Bill briefly fights and overpowers Jones, but is quickly defeated. Jones attempts to kill Bootstrap, but Jack helps Will stab the heart. Jones then calls out for Calypso, before tumbling to his death in the maelstrom.\n\n===''Dead Men Tell No Tales''===\n{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales}}\n\nIn the [[post-credits scene]] of the fifth film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', Will (no longer bound to the ''Flying Dutchman'' after the destruction of the Trident of Poseidon) and Elizabeth are sleeping in their bed together, when their room is entered by the silhouette of an apparently resurrected Davy Jones. Just as Jones raises his clawed arm to strike at the couple, Will awakens and sees that the room is empty. Assuming Jones's appearance to be a nightmare, Will goes back to sleep, oblivious to the presence of barnacles on the floor amid a small puddle of seawater, revealing it was no dream and that Davy Jones is really alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thekingdominsider.com/pirates-6-post-credits-scene-added-pirates-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/|title=Pirates 6? Post-Credits Scene Added to 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' - The Kingdom Insider|date=May 22, 2017|author=Thom Pratt|accessdate=June 13, 2018|website=thekingdominsider.com}}</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Music===\nIn the films, Jones possesses a locket that plays a distinct melody, and he is known to play the same melody on his [[pipe organ]]. This melody is also his character's theme, and can be heard throughout the film's score. It comes in two variations: The soundtrack version and the film version. The melody of the soundtrack version is heard only in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''. The film version is played in both films multiple times, and is heard last during the climax of the film. Because Jones and Calypso own matching locket lockets, Tia Dalma's theme is similar to that of Davy Jones, albeit in a different arrangement. The theme is also heard briefly after Jones' appearance in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n{{See also|Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)}}\n\nDavy Jones possesses a large number of supernatural abilities. Jones is capable of [[teleportation]] on board ships at sea, and he can pass through solid objects.  His crew are bound to his every whim, and his enchanted ship, the ''Flying Dutchman'', is capable of traveling underwater.\n\nJones is immortal, capable of surviving injuries that would be fatal to mortals. However, he is not impervious to pain, as demonstrated when Jack was able to cut off some of his facial tentacles during their battle. Jones can also track any soul that is owed to him using the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black spot]], with which any member of his crew can mark a victim, but only Jones can remove it.\n\nJones has also the power to control and call forth the Kraken, a sea monster which can destroy ships upon command.\n\nJones' only real weaknesses are his heart, which can be possessed by others and used to kill him or leverage him under their control, and his inability to step on dry land except once every ten years.  However, he is shown standing in a bucket of water on a sandbar during the parley in ''At World's End'', revealing there are loopholes to this rule.  He can also send his crew ashore in his absence.\n\nIn a physical confrontation, Jones' physiology also gives him various advantages; his facial tentacles allow him to manipulate objects while leaving his hands free, such that he is able to restrain Mercer's arms with his hands while smothering him with his tentacles. His tentacle finger allows him to exert a much stronger grip and control his sword more quickly and precisely than a normal hand could, and his crab claw hand possesses enough strength to bend or sever sword blades. He also demonstrates more general superhuman strength when he throws Jack off the crossbeam using only one arm.\n\n==Merchandise==\nDavy Jones was part of Series One of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' [[action figure]] set produced by [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]]. Although the initial run of figures had a sticker on the box that proclaimed that the figure came with the Dead Man's Chest and Jones' heart, both props (as well as the key) were released with the Bootstrap Bill figure in Series Two.<ref>{{cite web|author=crawford|url=http://www.mwctoys.com/REVIEW_070306a.htm|title=Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest action figures \u2013 Another Toy Review by Michael Crawford, Captain Toy|publisher=Mwctoys.com|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref> Jones also made an appearance as a smaller figure with crew members Angler, Wheelback and Penrod. Jones was issued as a plush toy as part of [[Sega|Sega's]] \"Dead Man's Chest\" plush assortment. Jones was also part of a 3 figure pack as a 3.75&nbsp;inch figure with Hector Barbossa and a limited edition gold Jack Sparrow for ''At World's End''. Davy Jones and his ship, the ''Flying Dutchman'', were produced as a [[Mega Blocks]] set for the movies ''Dead Man's Chest'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. Although his minifigure counterpart in the ''Dead Man's Chest'' set has more bluish tentacles then his counterpart in the ''At World's End'' set, which has more greenish tentacles.\n\nHe was made as a Lego minifigure in November 2011, with 4184 Black Pearl.\n\nA children's and adult Halloween costumes were released for [[Halloween]] 2007.\n\nDavy Jones was released as a [[PEZ dispenser]], along with Jack Sparrow and Will Turner.\n\n[[Hot Toys]] also announced plans to make a 1:6 version of Davy Jones which became available Q2 2008, and is widely regarded as more detailed than those produced by [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]].\n\n==Other appearances==\n*Davy Jones makes his debut appearance in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', reprising his role from ''At World's End''.

Jones' most striking feature is his [[cephalopod]]-like head, with octopus-like appendages giving the illusion of a thick beard. A prominent sac bulges from under his barnacle-encrusted [[tricorne]]. In addition to his \"bearded\" face, he breathes through a [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphon]] located on the left side of his face. Jones has a [[crustacean]]-style claw for his left arm, a long [[tentacle]] in place of the index finger on his right hand, and the right leg of a [[crab]] (resembling a [[pegleg]]).\n\nIt is revealed in the bonus features of the Special Edition DVD that the face's color was partly inspired by a coffee-stained styrofoam cup which was then scanned into ILM's computers to be used as the skin. He speaks with a clearly distinguishable, albeit thick, Scottish accent that's slightly altered to account for his lack of a nose, and presumably, a nasal cavity and/or sinuses. Originally, director [[Gore Verbinski]] wanted Jones to be Dutch, as he is the captain of the \"Dutch-man\". Nighy however responded, \"I don't do Dutch. So I decided on Scottish.\"<ref name=meet/> Nighy later revealed that Scottish sitcom ''[[Still Game]]'' influenced his choice of accent, stating: \"I had to find an accent no one else had. Although Alex Norton is Scottish, mine was slightly different. We wanted something that was distinctive and authoritative...I have seen ''Still Game'' and I am a fan. The sort of extremity of the accent was inspired in that area.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Davy / Nighy news update|publisher=BillNighy.info|url=http://www.billnighy.info/2006/07/07/davy-nighy-news-update/|date=July 7, 2006|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Before the films===\n{{See also|Tia Dalma|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}\n\nDavy Jones, a human and a great sailor, fell in love with Calypso, a sea goddess. She entrusted him with the task of ferrying the souls of those who died at sea to the next world.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.8.</ref> Calypso gave him the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' to accomplish this task. She swore that after ten years, she would meet him and they would spend one day together before he returned to his duties. However, when Jones returned to shore after ten years, Calypso failed to appear. Believing Calypso had betrayed him, a heartbroken and enraged Davy Jones turned the [[Brethren Court|Pirate Brethren]] against her, saying that if she were removed from the world, they would be able to claim the seas for themselves. They assembled in the [[Brethren Court|First Brethren Court]] and Jones taught them how to imprison her into her human form.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.15.</ref>\n\nDespite betraying her, Jones still loved Calypso, and in despair and guilt for what he had done, he carved out his own heart from his chest and placed it in the \"Dead Man's Chest\". The Chest was sealed and placed within a larger wooden chest, along with Jones' numerous love letters to Calypso and all other items having to do with her, except his matching musical locket. The chest was then buried on Isla Cruces. Jones kept the chest's key with him at all times. With Calypso gone, Jones abandoned his duties and returned to the Seven Seas. As a result of this, Jones gradually became monstrous, his physical appearance merging with various aquatic fauna. Sailors everywhere would fear him to the death, for Davy Jones had turned fierce and cruel, with an insatiable taste for all things brutal. Jones recruits dying sailors by promising them a reprieve from death in exchange for 100 years of service aboard the ''Dutchman''. He comes to command the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]], a feared mythological sea monster.\n\nIn the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow|book series]] about [[Jack Sparrow]]'s earlier adventures, Davy Jones shows interest in the Sword of Cortes, also sought by Jack. He is a minor character, but appears in the seventh book as Jack and his crew encounter the ''Flying Dutchman''.\n\nJones also appears in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom|prequel book]] about Jack's first years as a captain. He helps the Brethren Court to identify the traitor among them, who turns out to be Borya Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea.<ref>''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom]]'', Ch.8 The Devil in the Deep Blue Sea.</ref>\n\nBefore the events of the first film, Davy Jones approaches Sparrow with a deal: Jones will raise the ''Black Pearl'' back from [[Davy Jones' Locker]], allowing Sparrow to be captain for 13 years if Sparrow agrees to serve on the ''Dutchman'' for 100 years. This event, referenced in the films, also appears in the book series.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom'', Ch.19 The Freedom's Price.</ref>\n\n===''Dead Man's Chest''===\n{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}\n\nDavy Jones first appears in the second film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'', in which he attempts to collect on his bargain with Jack Sparrow: Davy Jones raised the ''Black Pearl'' from the sea for Sparrow. In exchange for being captain for 13 years, Sparrow promised Jones his soul. Sparrow argues that he was only captain for two years before [[Hector Barbossa]] committed mutiny. Jones rejects this explanation, explaining that despite the mutiny, Jack still gave himself the title \"Captain\". Sparrow then attempts to escape the deal by providing [[Will Turner]] as a substitute for himself. Jack strikes a new deal with Jones; Jack will be spared enslavement on the ''Dutchman'' if he brings Jones one hundred souls to replace his own within the next three days. Jones accepts, removes the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black spot]] from Jack's hand, and retains Will, keeping him as a \"good faith payment.\"\n\n[[File:Davyjonesandcrew.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Jones and some of the ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' crew after Will challenges him to Liar's Dice.]]\n\nWhile on the ''Dutchman'', Will challenges Jones at a game of [[Liar's Dice|liar's dice]]. They wager Will's soul for an eternity of service against the key to the ''Dead Man's Chest''. Bootstrap Bill joins the game and purposefully loses to save Will. During the game, Will learns where Jones keeps the key. The next morning, Jones realizes the key is gone and summons the Kraken to destroy the ship carrying Turner, who actually survives. The ''Dutchman'' then sails to Isla Cruces to stop Sparrow from getting the Chest.\n\nArriving, Jones sends his crew to retrieve the Chest; they return to him with it. The ''Dutchman'' then chases after the ''Black Pearl'', but is outrun. Jones summons the Kraken, which drags Jack Sparrow and the ''Pearl'' to Davy Jones's Locker. He afterwards opens the Chest only to find his heart missing; it having been taken by James Norrington, who gives it to Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.\n\n===''At World's End''===\n{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End}}\n{{See also|Cutler Beckett}}\n\nIn the third film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', Jones is under the control of [[Cutler Beckett]] and the [[East India Trading Company]]. Beckett possesses the heart, and threatens to have soldiers shoot it if Jones disobeys. Beckett orders Jones to sink pirate ships, but is infuriated when Jones leaves no survivors; Beckett wants prisoners to interrogate about the Brethren Court. Beckett also orders Jones to kill the Kraken.<ref name=awe5>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.5</ref> Later, he orders Jones attack the [[Brethren Court|Pirate Lord]] [[Sao Feng]]; Jones subsequently kills Sao and captures [[Elizabeth Swann]], who had been named captain by [[Sao Feng]] upon his death.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.12.</ref> When Admiral [[James Norrington]] dies on board the ''Dutchman'' while helping Elizabeth escape, Jones claims Norrington's sword (originally crafted by Will Turner). Jones then attempts mutiny against the EITC. However, [[List of characters in Pirates of the Caribbean#Mercer|Mercer]] successfully defends the Chest, forcing Jones to continue under Beckett's service.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.14.</ref>\n\nBeckett later summons Jones to his ship, the ''Endeavour''. Jones confronts [[Will Turner]] and divulges his past with Calypso, while learning of Jack Sparrow's escape from the Locker. The three men then arrive at [[Shipwreck Cove]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:'At World's End' - Davy Jones.jpg|thumb|Right|300px|Human Davy Jones.]]\n\nJones confronts Calypso, locked in the brig of the ''Black Pearl''. The two former lovers discuss Calypso's betrayal and Jones's curse. Calypso temporarily lifts his curse, allowing him to be seen briefly in his original human form. Jones tells her that his heart will always belong to her. Calypso, unaware that Jones betrayed her to the first Brethren Court, says that after her release, she will fully give her love to him.\n\nJones participates in a parley in which the EITC trades Turner for Sparrow.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.19</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'', Ch.21 through 24</ref> After Calypso is freed, Will reveals that Jones betrayed her. She escapes, refusing to aid either the pirates or Jones. Her fury creates a monstrous [[maelstrom]]. The ''Dutchman'' and the ''Pearl'' enter it and battle.\n\nDuring the battle Jones kills Mercer and retrieves the key to the Chest. Sparrow and Jones fight for control of the chest in the rigging of the ''Dutchman''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Jack acquires both the Chest and the key while Jones battles Will and Elizabeth. Jones quickly overpowers Elizabeth, and is subsequently impaled through the back by Will. Jones, unharmed, holds Will at sword-point. Jack threatens to stab the heart, and Jones cruelly stabs Will. Remembering Will as his son, Bootstrap Bill briefly fights and overpowers Jones, but is quickly defeated. Jones attempts to kill Bootstrap, but Jack helps Will stab the heart. Jones then calls out for Calypso, before tumbling to his death in the maelstrom.\n\n===''Dead Men Tell No Tales''===\n{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales}}\n\nIn the [[post-credits scene]] of the fifth film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', Will (no longer bound to the ''Flying Dutchman'' after the destruction of the Trident of Poseidon) and Elizabeth are sleeping in their bed together, when their room is entered by the silhouette of an apparently resurrected Davy Jones. Just as Jones raises his clawed arm to strike at the couple, Will awakens and sees that the room is empty. Assuming Jones's appearance to be a nightmare, Will goes back to sleep, oblivious to the presence of barnacles on the floor amid a small puddle of seawater, revealing it was no dream and that Davy Jones is really alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thekingdominsider.com/pirates-6-post-credits-scene-added-pirates-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/|title=Pirates 6? Post-Credits Scene Added to 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' - The Kingdom Insider|date=May 22, 2017|author=Thom Pratt|accessdate=June 13, 2018|website=thekingdominsider.com}}</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Music===\nIn the films, Jones possesses a locket that plays a distinct melody, and he is known to play the same melody on his [[pipe organ]]. This melody is also his character's theme, and can be heard throughout the film's score. It comes in two variations: The soundtrack version and the film version. The melody of the soundtrack version is heard only in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''. The film version is played in both films multiple times, and is heard last during the climax of the film. Because Jones and Calypso own matching locket lockets, Tia Dalma's theme is similar to that of Davy Jones, albeit in a different arrangement. The theme is also heard briefly after Jones' appearance in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]''.\n\n===Powers and abilities===\n{{See also|Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)}}\n\nDavy Jones possesses a large number of supernatural abilities. Jones is capable of [[teleportation]] on board ships at sea, and he can pass through solid objects.  His crew are bound to his every whim, and his enchanted ship, the ''Flying Dutchman'', is capable of traveling underwater.\n\nJones is immortal, capable of surviving injuries that would be fatal to mortals. However, he is not impervious to pain, as demonstrated when Jack was able to cut off some of his facial tentacles during their battle. Jones can also track any soul that is owed to him using the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black spot]], with which any member of his crew can mark a victim, but only Jones can remove it.\n\nJones has also the power to control and call forth the Kraken, a sea monster which can destroy ships upon command.\n\nJones' only real weaknesses are his heart, which can be possessed by others and used to kill him or leverage him under their control, and his inability to step on dry land except once every ten years.  However, he is shown standing in a bucket of water on a sandbar during the parley in ''At World's End'', revealing there are loopholes to this rule.  He can also send his crew ashore in his absence.\n\nIn a physical confrontation, Jones' physiology also gives him various advantages; his facial tentacles allow him to manipulate objects while leaving his hands free, such that he is able to restrain Mercer's arms with his hands while smothering him with his tentacles. His tentacle finger allows him to exert a much stronger grip and control his sword more quickly and precisely than a normal hand could, and his crab claw hand possesses enough strength to bend or sever sword blades. He also demonstrates more general superhuman strength when he throws Jack off the crossbeam using only one arm.\n\n==Merchandise==\nDavy Jones was part of Series One of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' [[action figure]] set produced by [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]]. Although the initial run of figures had a sticker on the box that proclaimed that the figure came with the Dead Man's Chest and Jones' heart, both props (as well as the key) were released with the Bootstrap Bill figure in Series Two.<ref>{{cite web|author=crawford|url=http://www.mwctoys.com/REVIEW_070306a.htm|title=Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest action figures \u2013 Another Toy Review by Michael Crawford, Captain Toy|publisher=Mwctoys.com|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref> Jones also made an appearance as a smaller figure with crew members Angler, Wheelback and Penrod. Jones was issued as a plush toy as part of [[Sega|Sega's]] \"Dead Man's Chest\" plush assortment. Jones was also part of a 3 figure pack as a 3.75&nbsp;inch figure with Hector Barbossa and a limited edition gold Jack Sparrow for ''At World's End''. Davy Jones and his ship, the ''Flying Dutchman'', were produced as a [[Mega Blocks]] set for the movies ''Dead Man's Chest'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. Although his minifigure counterpart in the ''Dead Man's Chest'' set has more bluish tentacles then his counterpart in the ''At World's End'' set, which has more greenish tentacles.\n\nHe was made as a Lego minifigure in November 2011, with 4184 Black Pearl.\n\nA children's and adult Halloween costumes were released for [[Halloween]] 2007.\n\nDavy Jones was released as a [[PEZ dispenser]], along with Jack Sparrow and Will Turner.\n\n[[Hot Toys]] also announced plans to make a 1:6 version of Davy Jones which became available Q2 2008, and is widely regarded as more detailed than those produced by [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]].\n\n==Other appearances==\n*Davy Jones makes his debut appearance in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', reprising his role from ''At World's End''. He is voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]] in the English version and by [[H\u014dch\u016b \u014ctsuka]] in the Japanese version. Due to censorship rules, Jones' duels with Jack Sparrow and Will Turner are significantly toned down, and his heart is not physically seen in the game.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170203051734/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001221/ Davy Jones] on [[IMDb]]\n<!-- *[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001221/ Davy Jones] at the [[Internet Movie Database]] -->\n\n{{POTC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Davy}}\n[[Category:Pirates of the Caribbean characters]]\n[[Category:Disney CGI characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional personifications of death]]\n[[Category:Adventure film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional sea captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional pirates]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Fictional Scottish people]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "name_user": "Sapphirewhirlwind", "label": "safe", "comment": "he did not officially return since it was only his shadow that appeared, so it should be called a cameo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)"}

He meets his cousins Hsu Chien (Pronounced \"Shu Sheng\") ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs who steal dumplings from Hsu's brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby stopping the cat from getting out of the bag and restricting any of those to know.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed with their bodies hidden as to keep the boss's crime operations a secret.\n\nWhen the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot against the Thai management, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien with a horrified face in the ice blocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws it at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. Cheng does not get arrested for murder due to self-defense. The movie ends as the crowd walks back to the police car to leave the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Cheng Chao-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u912d\u6f6e\u5b89|cy=Zeng Ciu-On}}), a young man who, along with his uncle, travels from [[Guangdong]], [[China]] to [[Pak Chong District|Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]] to stay with his cousins.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting. Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=Bruce Lee the Legend |format=Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= | year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong,<ref name=mandarin /> a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were plentiful in the hotel, and the tap water was yellow.<ref name=Letters>Little, John (1998). ''Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon''.</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the \"uncertain\" original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua). Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as \"another so-so one with an almost unbearable air of superiority\".<ref name=Letters /> Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the ice factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby Rimtarninn Hotel (formerly New Wan Chai), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>''In Pursuit of the Dragon'' (2012 documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> \n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climactic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong. At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters /><ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in Bangkok was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=JKDClub /><ref name=mandarin /> before flying to the US the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, [[Fist of Fury]].<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside drinks vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release and box office==\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=Nation>New Nation, 29 November 1971, page 1</ref> It went on general release on 8 December, and by the end of its run on 21 January 1972, it had broken box office records with just over S$700,000 ({{US$|{{To USD|700000|SGP|year=2011|round=yes}}|link=no}}), about S$240,000 more than previous record-holder ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref name=Straits>The Straits Times, 24 January 1972, page 5</ref> The film also played to packed cinemas in [[Malaysia]], the third territory to show the film.\n\nDespite the enormous success of ''The Big Boss'' in the Far East, overseas distributors were initially reluctant as they didn't think it had potential outside Asia. It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in Beirut in 1972 that they began to take notice. Suddenly buyers from all over the world were arriving in Hong Kong to buy the film, which was soon opening in new markets for Chinese films such as South America, Africa and southern Europe.<ref name=Misad>Death by Misadventure (director Toby Russell)</ref> In the UK however, the release of the English-dubbed version was delayed as distributors Crest Films withdrew their application for a BBFC certificate, while they waited for the current storm surrounding film censorship in Britain to pass (the Mandarin version was shown in Chinese cinema clubs in Britain in June 1972).<ref name=Straits2>The Straits Times, 28 April 1972, page 17</ref> There was also a delay in the US, as distributors [[National General Pictures]] disliked the dubbing, and spent a lot of money on a new soundtrack featuring new music and rewritten, redubbed English dialogue.<ref name=Misad /> This new version was eventually released in the US in April 1973 with the title ''Fists of Fury'', about 18 months after the Hong Kong premiere and after ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (retitled ''The Chinese Connection'' in the U.S.), Lee's second major role, had been released in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film reviews: Fists of Fury|date=27 June 1973|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=34}}</ref> It was an instant hit, surprising given that the film was only originally intended for the Mandarin circuit.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the returning villains. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles. This can be seen in Television programs (Disney+, Netflix, etc.) with titles as \"Fist of Fury\" with the description of \"The Big Boss\". Film Purists ignore this mainly and focus more on the original titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the Original Cantonese language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''The'' ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Mandarin release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Mandarin version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss? (Or How I Learned to Stop Complaining and Love The Big Boss Part II)]</ref><ref>Logan, Bey ''Bruce Lee and I'' (Reel East Press, 2018)</ref>\n\n==Other actors as Bruce Lee playing Cheng Chao-an==\nVarious Bruce Lee biopics have been filmed over the years, with the two most famous being ''[[Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth]]'' and ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]]. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos's official site.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS releases===\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 17 March 1997\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 1 October 2001\n*'''Part of a boxset'''\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''20th Century Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Named ''Fists of Fury'''''\n*'''Classification''': R, X (known in some video releases)\n*'''Color''': NTSC\n*'''Run time''': 99 minutes\n\n===DVD releases===\n'''''Universe (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, trailers for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'', star files\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Mega Star (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:29:1)\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, synopsis, cast and Crew biographies\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Fortune Star \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate DVD Collection (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Released''': 29 April 2004\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (DTS 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Mandarin (DTS 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, celebrity interviews, unseen footage, ''Game of Death'' outtakes, ''Enter the Dragon'' alternate opening, 32-page booklet\n*Region 3, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:27:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': None\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 18 October 2005\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Manadarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, interview with Tung Wai, bonus trailers\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Special Collector's Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 6 November 2000\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': Commentary by Bey Logan, production photo gallery, animated biography showcase of Bruce Lee with voice over, original Mandarin trailer, Hong Kong promotional trailer, UK promotional trailer, bonus trailers\n*Region 2, PAL\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Platinum Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 23 October 2006\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': '''Disc 1''': Commentary by Andrew Staton and Will Johnston, bonus trailers;

He meets his cousins Hsu Chien (Pronounced \"Shu Sheng\") ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs which steal dumplings from Hsu's Brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby stopping the cat from getting out of the bag and restricting any of those to know.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed with their bodies hidden as to keep the boss's crime operations a secret.\n\nWhen the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot against the Thai management, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien with a horrified face in the iceblocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws it at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. Cheng does not get arrested for murder due to self-defense. The movie ends as the crowd walks back to the police car to leave the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Cheng Chao-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u912d\u6f6e\u5b89|cy=Zeng Ciu-On}}), a young man who, along with his uncle, travels from [[Guangdong]], [[China]] to [[Pak Chong District|Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]] to stay with his cousins.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting. Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=Bruce Lee the Legend |format=Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= | year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong,<ref name=mandarin /> a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were plentiful in the hotel, and the tap water was yellow.<ref name=Letters>Little, John (1998). ''Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon''.</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the overbearing and aggressive original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua). Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as a fame lover and not particularly focused on being much of a director. Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the ice factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby Rimtarninn Hotel (formerly New Wan Chai), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>In Pursuit of the Dragon (documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> In both cases the director stuck to his guns.\n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climatic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong. At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters /><ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in Bangkok was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=JKDClub /><ref name=mandarin /> before flying to the US the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, [[Fist of Fury]].<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside drinks vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release and box office==\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=Nation>New Nation, 29 November 1971, page 1</ref> It went on general release on 8 December, and by the end of its run on 21 January 1972, it had broken box office records with just over S$700,000 ({{US$|{{To USD|700000|SGP|year=2011|round=yes}}|link=no}}), about S$240,000 more than previous record-holder ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref name=Straits>The Straits Times, 24 January 1972, page 5</ref> The film also played to packed cinemas in [[Malaysia]], the third territory to show the film.\n\nDespite the enormous success of ''The Big Boss'' in the Far East, overseas distributors were initially reluctant as they didn't think it had potential outside Asia. It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in Beirut in 1972 that they began to take notice. Suddenly buyers from all over the world were arriving in Hong Kong to buy the film, which was soon opening in new markets for Chinese films such as South America, Africa and southern Europe.<ref name=Misad>Death by Misadventure (director Toby Russell)</ref> In the UK however, the release of the English-dubbed version was delayed as distributors Crest Films withdrew their application for a BBFC certificate, while they waited for the current storm surrounding film censorship in Britain to pass (the Mandarin version was shown in Chinese cinema clubs in Britain in June 1972).<ref name=Straits2>The Straits Times, 28 April 1972, page 17</ref> There was also a delay in the US, as distributors [[National General Pictures]] disliked the dubbing, and spent a lot of money on a new soundtrack featuring new music and rewritten, redubbed English dialogue.<ref name=Misad /> This new version was eventually released in the US in April 1973 with the title ''Fists of Fury'', about 18 months after the Hong Kong premiere and after ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (retitled ''The Chinese Connection'' in the U.S.), Lee's second major role, had been released in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film reviews: Fists of Fury|date=27 June 1973|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=34}}</ref> It was an instant hit, surprising given that the film was only originally intended for the Mandarin circuit.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the villains from the gambling den. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles. This can be seen in Television programs (Disney+, Netflix, etc.) with titles as \"Fist of Fury\" with the description of \"The Big Boss\". Film Purists ignore this mainly and focus more on the original titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the Original Cantonese language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''The'' ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Mandarin release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Mandarin version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss? (Or How I Learned to Stop Complaining and Love The Big Boss Part II)]</ref><ref>Logan, Bey ''Bruce Lee and I'' (Reel East Press, 2018)</ref>\n\n==Other actors as Bruce Lee playing Cheng Chao-an==\nVarious Bruce Lee biopics have been filmed over the years, with the two most famous being ''[[Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth]]'' and ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]]. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos's official site.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS releases===\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 17 March 1997\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 1 October 2001\n*'''Part of a boxset'''\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''20th Century Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Named ''Fists of Fury'''''\n*'''Classification''': R, X (known in some video releases)\n*'''Color''': NTSC\n*'''Run time''': 99 minutes\n\n===DVD releases===\n'''''Universe (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, trailers for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'', star files\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Mega Star (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:29:1)\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, synopsis, cast and Crew biographies\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Fortune Star \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate DVD Collection (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Released''': 29 April 2004\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (DTS 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Mandarin (DTS 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, celebrity interviews, unseen footage, ''Game of Death'' outtakes, ''Enter the Dragon'' alternate opening, 32-page booklet\n*Region 3, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:27:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': None\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 18 October 2005\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Manadarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, interview with Tung Wai, bonus trailers\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Special Collector's Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 6 November 2000\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': Commentary by Bey Logan, production photo gallery, animated biography showcase of Bruce Lee with voice over, original Mandarin trailer, Hong Kong promotional trailer, UK promotional trailer, bonus trailers\n*Region 2, PAL\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Platinum Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 23 October 2006\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': '''Disc 1''': Commentary by Andrew Staton and Will Johnston, bonus trailers;

It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a [[boat]] where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle.

The rivers are typically class V and involve waterfalls and dangerous rapids. Races may involve mass-starts or individual timed runs\n* [[Kayak fishing]] \u2013 fishing from a kayak\n* [[Outrigger canoe]]ing \u2013 sport in which an outrigger canoe (va\u02bba, wa\u02bba, and waka ama in Tahitian, Hawaiian, and M\u0101ori languages, respectively) is propelled by paddles\n* [[Playboating]] \u2013 discipline of whitewater canoeing and kayaking where the paddler performs various technical moves in one place (a playspot)\n* [[Snowkayaking]] \u2013 a winter sport practised by kayaker where the track for the athletes consists of ski tracks in the mountains\n* [[Surf kayaking]] \u2013 the sport of surfing ocean waves with kayaks\n* [[Squirt boating]] \u2013 a form of whitewater canoeing and kayaking where the boat is designed to be as low in volume as possible\n* [[Whitewater canoeing]] and [[Whitewater kayaking]] \u2013 sport of paddling respectively a canoe or kayak on a moving body of water, typically river [[rapid]]s. The term usually applies to a whole trip or run, which has at least some stretches of [[whitewater]] included\n* [[Wildwater canoeing]] \u2013 a competitive sport in which canoes and kayaks are used to negotiate a stretch of river speedily\n\n== Canoeing and kayaking equipment ==\n\n=== Canoes and kayaks ===\n[[Image:Helfordkayak.jpg|thumb|right|Kayaking on the [[Helford River]]]]\n\n* [[Canoe]] (North American English) or \"[[Canadian canoe]]\" (British English) \u2013 small boat, pointed at both ends, propelled by paddlers who kneel or sit on a raised seat and use paddles which usually have a blade at one end only. A [[Canoe#Touring_and_camping|touring canoe]] is normally used by two people.<ref name=\"Kayarchy\"/> A canoe is usually open on top, but can be decked over (i.e. covered, similar to a kayak). A canoe is typically human-powered, though it may also be powered by poling, sails or a small electric or gas motor. Paddles may be single-bladed or double-bladed.\n* [[Kayak]] \u2013 slim boat, normally pointed at both ends and usually propelled by one kayaker who sits in a low seat and uses paddles with a blade at each end. Kayaks usually have a covered deck, with a cockpit covered by a [[spray deck]] to keep the inside of the boat (and the paddler's lower body) dry.\nDifferences between a canoe and a kayak:\n* Sitting position: In a canoe the paddler either kneels on the bottom of the boat or sits on a raised seat. In a kayak the paddler sits on a low seat with their legs extended in front.\n* Number of blades on the paddle: A canoe paddle usually has a blade on one end, while a kayak paddle is bladed at both ends.\n* Scope of the name: In some parts of the world, such as the [[United Kingdom]], kayaks are considered a subtype of [[canoe]]s. Continental European and [[United Kingdom|British]] canoeing clubs and associations of the 19th Century used craft similar to kayaks, but referred to them as canoes and canoes were then called \"[[Canadian canoe]]s\". This explains the naming of the International and National Governing bodies of the sport of Canoeing.\n\n==== Modern designs ====\nMaterials used in modern designs \u2013 modern kayaks are usually made from Rotationally Molded Plastic ([[Rotomold]]), [[Fiberglass]] or [[Kevlar]], each of which has advantages and disadvantages.\n* [[Rotomold]] \u2013 very durable and ideal for kayaking over rocks; it is the most widely used material and the cheapest.\n* [[Fiberglass]] \u2013 lighter, but requires much more careful handling and is more costly to produce.\n* [[Kevlar]] \u2013 lighter and stronger than fiberglass (it is the same material used in bulletproof vests) but more expensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kayakforlife.com/kayak-materials.htm|title=Kayak Materials|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Royalex]] \u2013 many whitewater canoes are now made using this composite material which has an outer layer of vinyl and ABS with an inner layer of ABS foam, bonded by heat treatment.<ref name=\"Rosco\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roscocanoes.com.au/FAQ%60s/Materials%20%20Manufactoring/Royalex%20(RX)-253.aspx|title=Royalex (RX)|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref>\nModern canoe/kayak designs \u2013 in general, each of the activities mentioned above requires a type of boat specifically designed for that activity.\n* [[Concrete canoe]] \u2013 canoe made of concrete, typically created for an engineering competition similar in spirit to that of a cardboard boat race\u2013make the seemingly unfloatable float.\n* [[Kayak fishing|Fishing kayak]] \u2013 kayak equipped with after-market accessories such as anchor trolleys, rod holders, electronic fish-finders and live-bait containers for fishing\n* [[Flyak]] \u2013 [[hydrofoil]] adaptation to the conventional [[kayak]].
