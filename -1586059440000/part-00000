O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

That initial era of direct observation gave way to telescopes in the 1600s followed by satellites in the twentieth century.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Stratigraphy|Stratigraphic]] data suggest that solar cycles have occurred for hundreds of millions of years, if not longer; measuring [[varves]] in [[precambrian]] sedimentary rock has revealed repeating peaks in layer thickness corresponding to the cycle.

Study was hampered during the 17th century due to the low number of sunspots during what is now recognized as an extended period of low solar activity, known as the [[Maunder Minimum]]. By the 19th century, then-sufficient sunspot records allowed researchers to infer periodic cycles in sunspot activity. In 1845, [[Joseph Henry|Henry]] and [[Stephen Alexander (astronomer)|Alexander]] observed the Sun with a [[thermopile]] and determined that sunspots emitted less radiation than surrounding areas. The emission of higher than average amounts of radiation later were observed from the solar [[facula]]e.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arctowski |first=Henryk |year=1940 |title=On Solar Faculae and Solar Constant Variations |journal=Proc.

They showed that the Sun rotated, and their comings and goings showed that the Sun changed, contrary to Aristotle, who had taught that all celestial bodies were perfect, unchanging spheres.\n\nSunspots were rarely recorded between 1650 and 1699. Later analysis revealed the problem to a reduced number of sunspots, rather than observational lapses. Building upon [[Gustav Sp\u00f6rer]]'s work, [[Edward Maunder]] suggested that the Sun had changed from a period in which sunspots all but disappeared to a renewal of sunspot cycles starting in about 1700. Adding to this understanding of the absence of solar cycles were observations of [[polar aurora|aurorae]], which were absent at the same time. The lack of a [[solar corona]] during [[solar eclipse]]s was also noted prior to 1715. The period of low sunspot activity from 1645 to 1717 later became known as the \"[[Maunder Minimum]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=John A.

This pattern is best visualized in the form of the so-called butterfly diagram, first constructed by [[Edward Walter Maunder]] and [[Annie Scott Dill Maunder]] in the early twentieth century (see graph). Images of the Sun are divided into latitudinal strips, and the monthly-averaged fractional surface of sunspots calculated. This is plotted vertically as a color-coded bar, and the process is repeated month after month to produce a time-series diagram.\n\n[[Image:Sunspot butterfly graph.gif|thumb|600px|center|F2|The sunspot butterfly diagram. This modern version is constructed (and regularly updated) by the solar group at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.]]\n\nHalf a century later, the father-and-son team of [[Harold Babcock|Harold]] and [[Horace Babcock]] showed that the solar surface is magnetized even outside of sunspots; that this weaker magnetic field is to first order a [[dipole]]; and that this dipole undergoes polarity reversals with the same period as the sunspot cycle (see graph below). These observations established that the solar cycle is a spatiotemporal magnetic process unfolding over the Sun as a whole.\n\n[[Image:Synoptic-solmag.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Time vs. solar latitude diagram of the radial component of the solar magnetic field, averaged over successive solar rotation. The \"butterfly\" signature of sunspots is clearly visible at low latitudes. Diagram constructed (and regularly updated) by the solar group at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.]]\n\n=== Photography ===\nThe Sun was photographed for the first time, on 2 April 1845, by French physicists [[Louis Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]]. Sunspots, as well as the [[limb darkening]] effect, are visible in their [[daguerrotypes]]. Photography assisted in the study of solar prominences, [[Solar granulation|granulation]] and spectroscopy. Charles A. Young first captured a prominence in 1870. Solar eclipses were also photographed, with the most useful early images taken in 1851 by Berkowski and in 1860 by De la Rue's team in Spain.<ref name=\"HAO timeline 18006\"/>\n\n=== Rotation ===\nEarly estimates of the Sun's rotation period varied between 25 and 28 days. The cause was determined independently in 1858 by Richard C. Carrington and [[Gustav Sp\u00f6rer|Sp\u00f6rer]]. They discovered that the latitude with the most sunspots decreases from 40\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 during each cycle, and that at higher latitudes sunspots rotate more slowly. The Sun's rotation was thus shown to vary by latitude and that its outer layer must be fluid. In 1871 [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Hermann Vogel]], and shortly thereafter by [[Charles Augustus Young|Charles Young]] confirmed this spectroscopically. [[Nils D\u00faner]]'s spectroscopic observation in the 1880s showed a 30% difference between the Sun's faster equatorial regions and its slower polar regions.<ref name=\"HAO timeline 18006\"/>\n\n=== Space weather ===\nThe first modern, and clearly described, accounts of a solar flare and coronal mass ejection occurred in 1859 and 1860 respectively. On 1 September 1859, Richard C. Carrington, while observing sunspots, saw patches of increasingly bright light within a group of sunspots, which then dimmed and moved across that area within a few minutes. This event, also reported by R. Hodgson, is a description of a solar flare. The widely viewed total solar eclipse on 18 July 1860 resulted in many drawings, depicting an anomalous feature that corresponds with modern CME observations.<ref name=\"HAO timeline 18007\"/>\n\nFor many centuries, the earthly effects of solar variation were noticed but not understood. E.g., displays of [[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] light have long been observed at high latitudes, but were not linked to the Sun.\n\nIn 1724, [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] reported that the needle of a [[magnetic compass]] was regularly deflected from [[magnetic north]] over the course of each day. This effect was eventually attributed to overhead electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere by [[Balfour Stewart]] in 1882, and confirmed by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1889 from analysis of magnetic observatory data.\n\nIn 1852, astronomer and British major general [[Edward Sabine]] showed that the probability of the occurrence of magnetic storms on Earth was correlated with the number of [[sunspots]], thus demonstrating a novel solar-terrestrial interaction. In 1859, a great [[Solar storm of 1859|magnetic storm]] caused brilliant auroral displays and disrupted global [[telegraph]] operations. [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] correctly connected the storm with a [[solar flare]] that he had observed the day before in the vicinity of a large sunspot group\u2014thus demonstrating that specific solar events could affect the Earth.\n\n[[Kristian Birkeland]] explained the physics of aurora by creating artificial aurora in his laboratory and predicted the [[solar wind]].\n\n== 20th century ==\n\n=== Observatories ===\nEarly in the 20th century, interest in astrophysics grew in America, and multiple observatories were built.<ref name=\"history King\">{{cite book |last1 = King|first1 = Henry C.|title = The history of the telescope|date = 2003|publisher = Dover Publications|location = Mineola, N.Y.|isbn = 0486432653|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC}}</ref>{{rp|320}} Solar telescopes (and thus, solar observatories), were installed at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in California in 1904,<ref name=\"history King\" />{{rp|324}} and in the 1930s at [[McMath-Hulbert Observatory]].<ref>{{cite web|title = History|url = http://www.mcmath-hulbert.org/history.htm|publisher = Mcmath-Hulbert Solar Observatory|accessdate = 30 August 2014}}</ref> Interest also grew in other parts of the world, with the establishment of the [[Kodaikanal Solar Observatory]] in India at the turn of the century,<ref>{{cite web|title = Kodaikanal Observatory|url = http://www.iiap.res.in/centers/kodai|publisher = Indian Institute of Astrophysics|accessdate = 30 August 2014|date = 2 July 2014}}</ref> the [[Einstein Tower|Einsteinturm]] in Germany in 1924,<ref>{{cite news|last1 = Ouellette|first1 = Jennifer|title = Einstein's Not-So-Ivory Tower|url = http://news.discovery.com/space/einsteins-not-so-ivory-tower.htm|accessdate = 30 August 2014|work = Discovery News|date = 7 March 2011}}</ref> and the Solar Tower Telescope at the National Observatory of Japan in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|title = Solar Tower Telescope|url = http://solarwww.mtk.nao.ac.jp/en/tower.html|publisher = National Observatory of Japan|accessdate = 30 August 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060310014822/http://solarwww.mtk.nao.ac.jp/en/tower.html|archivedate = 10 March 2006|date = 14 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nAround 1900, researchers began to explore connections between solar variations and Earth's weather. [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) assigned [[Charles Greeley Abbot|Abbot]] and his team to detect changes in the radiation of the Sun. They began by inventing instruments to measure solar radiation. Later, when Abbot was SAO head, they established a solar station at [[Calama, Chile]] to complement its data from [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. He detected 27 harmonic periods within the 273-month [[Hale cycle]]s, including 7, 13, and 39-month patterns. He looked for connections to weather by means such as matching opposing solar trends during a month to opposing urban temperature and precipitation trends. With the advent of [[dendrochronology]], scientists such as Glock attempted to connect variation in tree growth to periodic solar variations and infer long-term secular variability in the [[solar constant]] from similar variations in millennial-scale chronologies.<ref name=\"frits\">{{cite book |author=Fritts, Harold C. |title=Tree rings and climate |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1976 |isbn=0-12-268450-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Coronagraph ===\nUntil the 1930s, little progress was made on understanding the Sun's corona, as it could only be viewed during infrequent total solar eclipses.

Solar radio emissions at 10.7&nbsp;cm wavelength provide another proxy that can be measured from the ground, since the atmosphere is transparent to such radiation.\n\nOther proxy data \u2013 such as the abundance of [[cosmogenic]] isotopes \u2013 have been used to infer solar magnetic activity, and thus likely brightness, over several millennia.\n\nTotal solar irradiance has been claimed to vary in ways that are not predicted by sunspot changes or radio emissions. These shifts may be the result of inaccurate satellite calibration.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2002GL016038|title=Secular total solar irradiance trend during solar cycles 21\u201323|author1=Richard C.

Study was hampered during the 17th century due to the low number of sunspots during what is now recognized as an extended period of low solar activity, known as the [[Maunder Minimum]]. By the 19th century, then-sufficient sunspot records allowed researchers to infer periodic cycles in sunspot activity. In 1845, [[Joseph Henry|Henry]] and [[Stephen Alexander (astronomer)|Alexander]] observed the Sun with a [[thermopile]] and determined that sunspots emitted less radiation than surrounding areas. The emission of higher than average amounts of radiation later were observed from the solar [[facula]]e.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arctowski |first=Henryk |year=1940 |title=On Solar Faculae and Solar Constant Variations |journal=Proc.

They showed that the Sun rotated, and their comings and goings showed that the Sun changed, contrary to Aristotle, who had taught that all celestial bodies were perfect, unchanging spheres.\n\nSunspots were rarely recorded between 1650 and 1699. Later analysis revealed the problem to a reduced number of sunspots, rather than observational lapses. Building upon [[Gustav Sp\u00f6rer]]'s work, [[Edward Maunder]] suggested that the Sun had changed from a period in which sunspots all but disappeared to a renewal of sunspot cycles starting in about 1700. Adding to this understanding of the absence of solar cycles were observations of [[polar aurora|aurorae]], which were absent at the same time.

This pattern is best visualized in the form of the so-called butterfly diagram, first constructed by [[Edward Walter Maunder]] and [[Annie Scott Dill Maunder]] in the early twentieth century (see graph). Images of the Sun are divided into latitudinal strips, and the monthly-averaged fractional surface of sunspots calculated. This is plotted vertically as a color-coded bar, and the process is repeated month after month to produce a time-series diagram.\n\n[[Image:Sunspot butterfly graph.gif|thumb|600px|center|F2|The sunspot butterfly diagram. This modern version is constructed (and regularly updated) by the solar group at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.]]\n\nHalf a century later, the father-and-son team of [[Harold Babcock|Harold]] and [[Horace Babcock]] showed that the solar surface is magnetized even outside of sunspots; that this weaker magnetic field is to first order a [[dipole]]; and that this dipole undergoes polarity reversals with the same period as the sunspot cycle (see graph below). These observations established that the solar cycle is a spatiotemporal magnetic process unfolding over the Sun as a whole.\n\n[[Image:Synoptic-solmag.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Time vs. solar latitude diagram of the radial component of the solar magnetic field, averaged over successive solar rotation. The \"butterfly\" signature of sunspots is clearly visible at low latitudes. Diagram constructed (and regularly updated) by the solar group at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.]]\n\n=== Photography ===\nThe Sun was photographed for the first time, on 2 April 1845, by French physicists [[Louis Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]]. Sunspots, as well as the [[limb darkening]] effect, are visible in their [[daguerrotypes]]. Photography assisted in the study of solar prominences, [[Solar granulation|granulation]] and spectroscopy. Charles A. Young first captured a prominence in 1870. Solar eclipses were also photographed, with the most useful early images taken in 1851 by Berkowski and in 1860 by De la Rue's team in Spain.<ref name=\"HAO timeline 18006\"/>\n\n=== Rotation ===\nEarly estimates of the Sun's rotation period varied between 25 and 28 days. The cause was determined independently in 1858 by Richard C. Carrington and [[Gustav Sp\u00f6rer|Sp\u00f6rer]]. They discovered that the latitude with the most sunspots decreases from 40\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 during each cycle, and that at higher latitudes sunspots rotate more slowly. The Sun's rotation was thus shown to vary by latitude and that its outer layer must be fluid. In 1871 [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Hermann Vogel]], and shortly thereafter by [[Charles Augustus Young|Charles Young]] confirmed this spectroscopically. [[Nils D\u00faner]]'s spectroscopic observation in the 1880s showed a 30% difference between the Sun's faster equatorial regions and its slower polar regions.<ref name=\"HAO timeline 18006\"/>\n\n=== Space weather ===\nThe first modern, and clearly described, accounts of a solar flare and coronal mass ejection occurred in 1859 and 1860 respectively. On 1 September 1859, Richard C. Carrington, while observing sunspots, saw patches of increasingly bright light within a group of sunspots, which then dimmed and moved across that area within a few minutes. This event, also reported by R. Hodgson, is a description of a solar flare. The widely viewed total solar eclipse on 18 July 1860 resulted in many drawings, depicting an anomalous feature that corresponds with modern CME observations.<ref name=\"HAO timeline 18007\"/>\n\nFor many centuries, the earthly effects of solar variation were noticed but not understood. E.g., displays of [[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] light have long been observed at high latitudes, but were not linked to the Sun.\n\nIn 1724, [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] reported that the needle of a [[magnetic compass]] was regularly deflected from [[magnetic north]] over the course of each day. This effect was eventually attributed to overhead electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere by [[Balfour Stewart]] in 1882, and confirmed by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1889 from analysis of magnetic observatory data.\n\nIn 1852, astronomer and British major general [[Edward Sabine]] showed that the probability of the occurrence of magnetic storms on Earth was correlated with the number of [[sunspots]], thus demonstrating a novel solar-terrestrial interaction. In 1859, a great [[Solar storm of 1859|magnetic storm]] caused brilliant auroral displays and disrupted global [[telegraph]] operations. [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] correctly connected the storm with a [[solar flare]] that he had observed the day before in the vicinity of a large sunspot group\u2014thus demonstrating that specific solar events could affect the Earth.\n\n[[Kristian Birkeland]] explained the physics of aurora by creating artificial aurora in his laboratory and predicted the [[solar wind]].\n\n== 20th century ==\n\n=== Observatories ===\nEarly in the 20th century, interest in astrophysics grew in America, and multiple observatories were built.<ref name=\"history King\">{{cite book |last1 = King|first1 = Henry C.|title = The history of the telescope|date = 2003|publisher = Dover Publications|location = Mineola, N.Y.|isbn = 0486432653|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC}}</ref>{{rp|320}} Solar telescopes (and thus, solar observatories), were installed at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in California in 1904,<ref name=\"history King\" />{{rp|324}} and in the 1930s at [[McMath-Hulbert Observatory]].<ref>{{cite web|title = History|url = http://www.mcmath-hulbert.org/history.htm|publisher = Mcmath-Hulbert Solar Observatory|accessdate = 30 August 2014}}</ref> Interest also grew in other parts of the world, with the establishment of the [[Kodaikanal Solar Observatory]] in India at the turn of the century,<ref>{{cite web|title = Kodaikanal Observatory|url = http://www.iiap.res.in/centers/kodai|publisher = Indian Institute of Astrophysics|accessdate = 30 August 2014|date = 2 July 2014}}</ref> the [[Einstein Tower|Einsteinturm]] in Germany in 1924,<ref>{{cite news|last1 = Ouellette|first1 = Jennifer|title = Einstein's Not-So-Ivory Tower|url = http://news.discovery.com/space/einsteins-not-so-ivory-tower.htm|accessdate = 30 August 2014|work = Discovery News|date = 7 March 2011}}</ref> and the Solar Tower Telescope at the National Observatory of Japan in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|title = Solar Tower Telescope|url = http://solarwww.mtk.nao.ac.jp/en/tower.html|publisher = National Observatory of Japan|accessdate = 30 August 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060310014822/http://solarwww.mtk.nao.ac.jp/en/tower.html|archivedate = 10 March 2006|date = 14 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nAround 1900, researchers began to explore connections between solar variations and Earth's weather. [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) assigned [[Charles Greeley Abbot|Abbot]] and his team to detect changes in the radiation of the Sun. They began by inventing instruments to measure solar radiation. Later, when Abbot was SAO head, they established a solar station at [[Calama, Chile]] to complement its data from [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. He detected 27 harmonic periods within the 273-month [[Hale cycle]]s, including 7, 13, and 39-month patterns. He looked for connections to weather by means such as matching opposing solar trends during a month to opposing urban temperature and precipitation trends. With the advent of [[dendrochronology]], scientists such as Glock attempted to connect variation in tree growth to periodic solar variations and infer long-term secular variability in the [[solar constant]] from similar variations in millennial-scale chronologies.<ref name=\"frits\">{{cite book |author=Fritts, Harold C. |title=Tree rings and climate |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1976 |isbn=0-12-268450-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Coronagraph ===\nUntil the 1930s, little progress was made on understanding the Sun's corona, as it could only be viewed during infrequent total solar eclipses.

Another famous German agent in Persia (especially during [[World War I]]) was [[Wilhelm Wassmuss]], nicknamed the \"German Lawrence\".\n\nAmong commercial treaties between Persia and Germany at this time, one can mention the June 6th, 1873 treaty signed in [[Berlin]] between [[Prince Bismarck]] and Mirza Hussein Khan.\n\n=== The first Pahlavi era and Nazi Germany ===\n[[File:Iran Parliament speaker Hitler meeting.jpg|thumb|[[Mirza Hassan Khan Esfandiary|Hassan Esfandiary]], and Mussa Nuri Esfandiari Iranian ambassador to the  [[German Reich]] meeting [[Adolf Hitler]]]]\nThe shelling of Iran's parliament by the Russians, and the signing of the 1919 Treaty, firmly planted the roots of suspicion against Britain and Russia.

Although the country has been known as [[Iran]] to the native people themselves for many centuries, Westerners came to know the nation as [[Persia]] through ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] accounts. The goal was to distract attention from the traditional Western designation \u201cPersia\u201d (a term Greek in origin). \u201cPersian\u201d was the historical name of one of the ethnic groups in Iran. With the reforms Reza Shah was implementing, the adoption of a new name for the country was seen as restoring Iran\u2019s historical legacy. While Persia had fallen victim to imperialism, Iran would be free from foreign control.\n\nIn 1936, the Hitler Cabinet declared Iranians to be immune to the Nuremberg Laws, as they were considered to be \"pure Aryans\".<ref>''Russia and the West in Iran 1918-1948.''

Trading with Germany appealed to Iran because the Germans did not have a history of imperialism in the region, unlike the British and Russians.\n\nFrom 1939 to 1941 Iran's top foreign trade partner (nearly 50% of its total trade) was Germany, which helped Iran open modern sea and air communications with the rest of the world.<ref>''Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution''.

In commercial links, West Germany however remained well ahead of other European countries, even the United States, until 1974.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1972, following the visit to [[Tehran]] of the West German chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], Iran and West Germany signed an economic agreement which provided for Iranian exports of oil and natural gas to Germany, with West German exports to and investments in Iran in return. However, given its huge surplus in foreign trade in 1974-5, the Iranian government bought 25% of the shares of [[Krupp|Krupp H\u00fcttenwerke]] (German for ''[[smelting]] plants''), the steel subsidiary of the German conglomerate Krupp, in September 1974. While this provided the much needed cash injection to Krupp, it gave Iran access to German expertise to expand its [[steel]] industry. Iran's [[Bushehr]] nuclear power plant was also designed and partially built by the German [[Kraftwerk Union]] of [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], an agreement which was inked during the same years.\n\nIn 1975 West Germany became the 2nd most important supplier of non-military goods to Iran. Valued at $404 million, West German imports amounted to nearly one fifth of total Iranian imports.<ref>''Iran Under the Ayatollahs''.

As repression in Iran became more intense, these demonstrations became more vigorous.

His followers who refused British occupation in the Iranian government such as [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] <ref>{{cite book|last=Louis|first=Wm.

In commercial links, West Germany however remained well ahead of other European countries, even the United States, until 1974.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1972, following the visit to [[Tehran]] of the West German chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], Iran and West Germany signed an economic agreement which provided for Iranian exports of oil and natural gas to Germany, with West German exports to and investments in Iran in return. However, given its huge surplus in foreign trade in 1974-5, the Iranian government bought 25% of the shares of [[Krupp|Krupp H\u00fcttenwerke]] (German for ''[[smelting]] plants''), the steel subsidiary of the German conglomerate Krupp, in September 1974. While this provided the much needed cash injection to Krupp, it gave Iran access to German expertise to expand its [[steel]] industry. Iran's [[Bushehr]] nuclear power plant was also designed and partially built by the German [[Kraftwerk Union]] of [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], an agreement which was inked during the same years.\n\nIn 1975 West Germany became the 2nd most important supplier of non-military goods to Iran. Valued at $404 million, West German imports amounted to nearly one fifth of total Iranian imports.<ref>''Iran Under the Ayatollahs''.

As repression in Iran became more intense, these demonstrations became more vigorous.

{"title_page": "State Basketball League All-Star Five", "text_new": "{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nThe '''State Basketball League All-Star Five''' is an annual [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) honour bestowed on the best players in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL following every season. Various SBL All-Stars and All-Star teams have been announced over the years, with a number of All-Star games occurring between 1990 and 1993, and various All-Star teams being named yearly between 1996 and 2004. In 1995, an All-Star Five and an All-Star Ten was named for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. In 2005 and 2006, MSBL and WSBL All-Star Five teams were named. The SBL then introduced a first, second, and third team All-Star (or \"All-SBL\") format for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The SBL returned to a five-player All-Star team in 2009 for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. The term \"All-Star Five\" has been used by the SBL in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nOn a few occasions, due to the different voting systems, the Most Valuable Player has not been named in the All-Star Five.\n\n==Selections==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has been selected\n|-\n|'''Player<br><small>(in bold text)'''\n|Indicates the player who won the [[State Basketball League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in the same year\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n===1995===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| \n!colspan=2| WSBL\n!colspan=2| MSBL\n!rowspan=2| Ref\n|-\n!Players!!Teams\n!Players!!Teams\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Five\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]] ||rowspan=15 align=center|<ref>{{cite book |year=1995 |title=Annual Report 1995 |publisher=[[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.)]] |page=56 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gina Stevens]] || [[Stirling Senators]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Katie Watts || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || Alan Erickson || [[Cockburn Cougars]]\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Ken Epperson || [[Swan City Mustangs]]\n|-\n| Katrine Linssen || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Pete Hansen || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]]\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n|rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Ten\n| Sue Arthur || [[Rockingham Flames]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| [[Shelly Boston]] || [[Rockingham Flames]] || Robin Behrendorff || Rainbow Coast Raiders\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Wade Bennett || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| '''[[Tanya Fisher]]''' || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Greg Brown || [[Geraldton Buccaneers]]\n|-\n| Linda Jose || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || [[C.

"{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nThe '''State Basketball League All-Star Five''' is an annual [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) honour bestowed on the best players in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL following every season. Various SBL All-Stars and All-Star teams have been announced over the years, with a number of All-Star games occurring between 1990 and 1993, and various All-Star teams being named yearly between 1996 and 2004. In 1995, an All-Star Five and an All-Star Ten was named for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. In 2005 and 2006, MSBL and WSBL All-Star Five teams were named. The SBL then introduced a first, second, and third team All-Star (or \"All-SBL\") format for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The SBL returned to a five-player All-Star team in 2009 for both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. The term \"All-Star Five\" has been used by the SBL in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nOn a few occasions, due to the different voting systems, the Most Valuable Player has not been named in the All-Star Five.\n\n==Selections==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has been selected\n|-\n|'''Player<br><small>(in bold text)'''\n|Indicates the player who won the [[State Basketball League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in the same year\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n===1995===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| \n!colspan=2| WSBL\n!colspan=2| MSBL\n!rowspan=2| Ref\n|-\n!Players!!Teams\n!Players!!Teams\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Five\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]] ||rowspan=15 align=center|<ref>{{cite book |year=1995 |title=Annual Report 1995 |publisher=[[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.)]] |page=56 }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gina Stevens]] || [[Stirling Senators]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Katie Watts || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || Alan Erickson || [[Cockburn Cougars]]\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Ken Epperson || [[Swan City Mustangs]]\n|-\n| Katrine Linssen || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Pete Hansen || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]]\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n|rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| All-Star Ten\n| Sue Arthur || [[Rockingham Flames]] || James Fitch || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| [[Natasha Bargeus]] || [[Joondalup Wolves|Wanneroo Wolves]] || '''John Pierce''' || [[Stirling Senators]]\n|-\n| Shelley Boston || [[Rockingham Flames]] || Robin Behrendorff || Rainbow Coast Raiders\n|-\n| Liza Dagostino || [[Perry Lakes Hawks]] || Wade Bennett || [[South West Slammers]]\n|-\n| '''[[Tanya Fisher]]''' || [[Perth Redbacks]] || Greg Brown || [[Geraldton Buccaneers]]\n|-\n| Linda Jose || [[Swan City Mustangs]] || [[C.
