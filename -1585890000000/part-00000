The grapefruit first appeared as an illustration entitled \"The Forbidden Fruit Tree\" in ''The Natural History of Barbados'' (1750) by Rev. Griffith Hughes. This accords with the scientific name which literally is \"citrus of paradise\". The fruit seems to have been fairly commonly available around that time, since George Washington in his Barbados Journal (1750-1751) mentions \"the Forbidden Fruit\" as one of the local fruit available at a dinner party he attended. The plant was later described in the 1837 ''Flora of Jamaica'' as the Barbados Grapefruit.

[[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]]. They also live as minorities in other regions of China (e.g. [[Xinjiang]]), as well as in [[Russia]]. Mongolian people belonging to the [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] subgroups live predominantly in the Russian federal subjects of [[Buryatia]] and [[Kalmykia]].\n\nThe Mongols are bound together by a common heritage and [[ethnic identity]]. Their indigenous dialects are collectively known as the [[Mongolian language]]. The ancestors of the modern-day Mongols are referred to as [[Proto-Mongols]].\n\n== Definition ==\nBroadly defined, the term includes the Mongols proper (also known as the [[Khalkha Mongols]]), [[Buryats]], [[Oirats]], the [[Kalmyk people]] and the Southern Mongols. The latter comprises the [[Abaga Mongols]], [[Abaganar]], [[Aohans]], [[Baarins]], [[Gorlos Mongols]], [[Jalaids]], [[Jaruud]], [[Khishigten]], [[Khuuchid]], [[Muumyangan]] and [[Onnigud]].\n\nThe designation \"Mongol\" briefly appeared in 8th century records of [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] to describe a tribe of [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. It resurfaced in the late 11th century during the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty]]. After the fall of the Liao in 1125, the [[Khamag Mongol]]s became a leading tribe on the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. However, their wars with the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Tatar confederation]] had weakened them.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, the word Mongol grew into an umbrella term for a large group of [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic-speaking]] tribes united under the rule of [[Genghis Khan]].<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n  | title = Mongolia: Ethnography of Mongolia\n  | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-27420/Mongolia#394579.hook\n  | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]\n  | accessdate = 2007-07-22\n}}</ref>\n\n{{History of the Mongols}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Mongolia}}\n\nIn various times Mongolic peoples have been equated with the [[Scythians]], the [[Gog and Magog|Magog]], and the [[Tungusic peoples]]. Based on Chinese historical texts the ancestry of the Mongolic peoples can be traced back to the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], a nomadic confederation occupying eastern Mongolia and [[Manchuria]]. The identity of the [[Xiongnu]] (H\u00fcnn\u00fc) is still debated today. Although some scholars maintain that they were [[proto-Mongols]], they were more likely a multi-ethnic group of Mongolic and [[Turkic tribes]].<ref name=\"Geng 2005\">Geng 2005</ref> It has been suggested that the language of the [[Huns]] was related to the H\u00fcnn\u00fc.<ref>\u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re, Xiongnu.

Katalin Csornai, 2007, Budapest, Hungary [http://hunsarecoming.oxyhost.com/articles/asianhuns_chinesesources.htm summary]</ref> -->\n\nThe Donghu, however, can be much more easily labeled proto-Mongol since the Chinese histories trace only Mongolic tribes and kingdoms ([[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]] peoples) from them, although some historical texts claim a mixed Xiongnu-Donghu ancestry for some tribes (e.g. the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]).<ref>[[Frances Wood]], ''The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia'', p. 48</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nSee [[Genetic history of East Asians]]\n\n=== In the Chinese classics ===\n{{see also|Timeline of Mongols prior to the Mongol Empire}}\nThe Donghu are mentioned by [[Sima Qian]] as already existing in [[Inner Mongolia]] north of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] in 699\u2013632 BCE along with the [[Shanrong]]. Mentions in the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' (\"Lost Book of Zhou\") and the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' indicate the Donghu were also active during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600\u20131046 BCE).\n\nThe Xianbei formed part of the Donghu confederation, but had earlier times of independence, as evidenced by a mention in the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' (\"\u6649\u8a9e\u516b\" section), which states that during the reign of [[King Cheng of Zhou]] (reigned 1042\u20131021 BCE) they came to participate at a meeting of Zhou subject-lords at Qiyang (\u5c90\u9633) (now [[Qishan County]]) but were only allowed to perform the fire ceremony under the supervision of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] since they were not vassals by covenant (\u8bf8\u4faf). The Xianbei chieftain was appointed joint guardian of the ritual torch along with [[Xiong Yi]].\n\nThese early Xianbei came from the nearby [[Zhukaigou culture]] (2200\u20131500 BCE) in the [[Ordos Desert]], where maternal DNA corresponds to the Mongol [[Daur people]] and the Tungusic [[Evenks]]. The Zhukaigou Xianbei (part of the [[Ordos culture]] of Inner Mongolia and northern [[Shaanxi]]) had trade relations with the Shang. In the late 2nd century, the Han dynasty scholar Fu Qian (\u670d\u8654) wrote in his commentary \"Jixie\" (\u96c6\u89e3) that \"[[Shanrong]] and [[Beidi]] are ancestors of the present-day Xianbei\". Again in Inner Mongolia another closely connected core Mongolic Xianbei region was the [[Upper Xiajiadian culture]] (1000\u2013600 BCE) where the Donghu confederation was centered.\n\nAfter the Donghu were defeated by Xiongnu king [[Modu Chanyu]], the Xianbei and [[Wuhuan]] survived as the main remnants of the confederation. [[Tadun]] Khan of the Wuhuan (died 207 AD) was the ancestor of the proto-Mongolic [[Kumo Xi]].<ref>[[Xin Tangshu]] 219. 6173.</ref> The Wuhuan are of the direct Donghu royal line and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' says that in 209 BCE, Modu Chanyu defeated the Wuhuan instead of using the word Donghu. The Xianbei, however, were of the lateral Donghu line and had a somewhat separate identity, although they shared the same language with the Wuhuan. In 49 CE the Xianbei ruler Bianhe (Bayan Khan?) raided and defeated the Xiongnu, killing 2000, after having received generous gifts from [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]]. The Xianbei reached their peak under Tanshihuai Khan (reigned 156\u2013181) who expanded the vast, but short lived, [[Xianbei state]] (93\u2013234).\n\nThree prominent groups split from the [[Xianbei state]] as recorded by the Chinese histories: the [[Rouran]] (claimed by some to be the [[Pannonian Avars]]), the [[Khitan people]] and the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] (a subtribe called the \"Shiwei Menggu\" is held to be the origin of the Genghisid Mongols).<ref>University of California, Berkeley. Project on Linguistic Analysis, ''Journal of Chinese linguistics'', p. 154</ref> Besides these three Xianbei groups, there were others such as the [[Murong]], [[Duan (tribe)|Duan]] and [[Tuoba]]. Their culture was nomadic, their religion [[shamanism]] or [[Buddhism]] and their military strength formidable. There is still no direct evidence that the Rouran spoke [[Mongolic languages]], although most scholars agree that they were Proto-Mongolic.<ref>Thomas Hoppe, ''Die ethnischen Gruppen Xinjiangs: Kulturunterschiede und interethnische'', p. 66</ref> The Khitan, however, had two scripts of their own and many Mongolic words are found in their half-deciphered writings.\n\nGeographically, the [[Tuoba]] Xianbei ruled the southern part of Inner Mongolia and northern China, the Rouran ([[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun]] was the first to use the title [[khagan]] in 402) ruled eastern Mongolia, western Mongolia, the northern part of Inner Mongolia and northern Mongolia, the Khitan were concentrated in eastern part of Inner Mongolia north of [[Korea]] and the Shiwei were located to the north of the Khitan. These tribes and kingdoms were soon overshadowed by the rise of the [[Turkic Khaganate]] in 555, the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 745 and the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] states in 840. The Tuoba were eventually absorbed into China. The Rouran fled west from the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and either disappeared into obscurity or, as some say, invaded Europe as the Avars under their Khan, [[Bayan I]]. Some Rouran under Tatar Khan migrated east, founding the [[Tatar confederation]], who became part of the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. The Khitan, who were independent after their separation from the [[Kumo Xi]] (of [[Wuhuan]] origin) in 388, continued as a minor power in Manchuria until one of them, Ambagai (872\u2013926), established the [[Liao dynasty]] (907\u20131125) as [[Emperor Taizu of Liao]].\n\n=== Era of the Mongol Empire and Northern Yuan ===\n{{Main|Mongol Empire|Northern Yuan dynasty}}\n[[File:Asia 500ad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Asia in 500, showing the [[Rouran Khaganate]] and its neighbors, including the Northern Wei and the Tuyuhun Khanate, all of them were established by Proto-Mongols]]\n\nThe destruction of Uyghur Khaganate by the Kirghiz resulted in the end of Turkic dominance in Mongolia. According to historians, Kirghiz were not interested in assimilating newly acquired lands; instead, they controlled local tribes through various manaps (tribal leader). The Khitans occupied the areas vacated by the Turkic Uyghurs bringing them under their control. The [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] state was centered on [[Khakassia]] and they were expelled from Mongolia by the Khitans in 924. Beginning in the 10th century, the Khitans, under the leadership of [[Abaoji]], prevailed in several military campaigns against the [[Tang Dynasty]]{{'}}s border guards, and the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]], [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] nomadic groups.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = The Other Press| isbn = 978-983-9541-88-5| last = San| first = Tan Koon| title = Dynastic China: An Elementary History| date = 2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Khitan fled west after being defeated by the [[Jurchens]] (later known as [[Manchu people|Manchu]]) and founded the [[Qara Khitai]] (1125\u20131218) in eastern [[Kazakhstan]]. In 1218, Genghis Khan destroyed the Qara Khitai after which the Khitan passed into obscurity. With the expansion of the Mongol Empire, the Mongolic peoples settled over almost all [[Eurasia]] and carried on military campaigns from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[Indonesia]]n [[Java]] island and from [[Mongol invasion of Japan|Japan]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] ([[Gaza City|Gaza]]). They simultaneously became [[Padishah]]s of [[Persia]], [[Emperors of China]], and [[Great Khans]] of Mongolia, and one became [[Sultan of Egypt]] ([[Al-Adil Kitbugha]]). The Mongolic peoples of the [[Golden Horde]] established themselves to govern Russia by 1240.<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\">Jerry Bentley, \"Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchange in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 136.</ref> By 1279, they conquered the Song dynasty and brought all of China under control of the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\"/>\n\n[[File:Mooko-Suenaga.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Mongols using [[China|Chinese]] [[gunpowder]] bombs during the [[Mongol Invasions of Japan]], 1281]]\n\nWith the breakup of the empire, the dispersed Mongolic peoples quickly adopted the mostly Turkic cultures surrounding them and were assimilated, forming parts of [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Karakalpaks]], [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Turkmens]], [[Uyghurs]], [[Nogays]], [[Kyrgyzs]], [[Kazakhs]], [[People of Caucasus|Caucasaus peoples]], [[Iranian peoples]] and [[Mughal (tribe)|Moghuls]]; linguistic and cultural [[Persianization]] also began to be prominent in these territories. Some Mongols assimilated into the [[Yakuts]] after their migration to Northern Siberia and about 30% of [[Yakut language|Yakut words]] have Mongol origin. However, most of the Yuan Mongols returned to Mongolia in 1368, retaining their language and culture. There were 250,000 Mongols in Southern China and many Mongols were massacred by the rebel army. The survivors were trapped in southern china and eventually assimilated. The [[Dongxiangs]], [[Bonans]], [[Yugur]] and [[Monguor people]] were invaded by Chinese [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, the Mongols continued to rule the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]] in Mongolia homeland. However, the [[Oirad]]s began to challenge the Eastern Mongolic peoples under the [[Borjigin]] monarchs in the late 14th century and Mongolia was divided into two parts: [[Western Mongolia]] ([[Oirats]]) and Eastern Mongolia ([[Khalkha]], [[Inner Mongols]], [[Barga Mongols|Barga]], [[Buryats]]). The earliest written references to the [[plough]] in [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongolian]] language sources appear towards the end of the 14th c.<ref>MOLN\u00c1R, \u00c1D\u00c1M. \"THE PLOUGH AND PLOUGHING AMONG THE ALTAIC PEOPLES.\" Central Asiatic Journal 26, no. 3/4 (1982): 215-24.</ref>\n\nIn 1434, Eastern Mongolian [[Taisun Khan]]'s (1433\u20131452) prime minister Western Mongolian Togoon Taish reunited the Mongols after killing Eastern Mongolian another king Adai ([[Khorchin]]). Togoon died in 1439 and his son [[Esen Taish]] became prime minister. Esen carried out successful policy for Mongolian unification and independence. The Ming Empire attempted to invade Mongolia in the 14\u201316th centuries, however, the Ming Empire was defeated by the Oirat, Southern Mongol, Eastern Mongol and united Mongolian armies. Esen's 30,000 cavalries defeated 500,000 Chinese soldiers in [[Tumu Crisis|1449]]. Within eighteen months of his defeat of the titular Khan Taisun, in 1453, Esen himself took the title of [[Great Khan]] (1454\u20131455) of the [[Great Yuan]].<ref>Sechin Jagchid, Van Jay Symons \u2013 Peace, war, and trade along the Great Wall: Nomadic-Chinese interaction through two millennia, p.49</ref>\n\nThe Khalkha emerged during the reign of [[Dayan Khan]] (1479\u20131543) as one of the six [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]s of the Eastern Mongolic peoples. They quickly became the dominant Mongolic clan in Mongolia proper.<ref>[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]] ''The Mongolic languages'', p.177</ref><ref>Elizabeth E. Bacon ''Obok: A Study of Social Structure in Eurasia'', p.82</ref> He reunited the Mongols again. The Mongols voluntarily reunified during Eastern Mongolian [[T\u00fcmen Zasagt Khan]] rule (1558\u20131592) for the last time (the Mongol Empire united all Mongols before this).\n\nEastern Mongolia was divided into three parts in the 17th century: [[Outer Mongolia]] (Khalkha), [[Inner Mongolia]] (Inner Mongols) and the Buryat region in southern [[Siberia]].\n\nThe last Mongol khagan was [[Ligdan Khan|Ligdan]] in the early 17th century. He got into conflicts with the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] over the looting of Chinese cities, and managed to alienate most Mongol tribes. In 1618, Ligdan signed a treaty with the [[Ming dynasty]] to protect their northern border from the Manchus attack in exchange for thousands of taels of silver. By the 1620s, only the [[Chahars]] remained under his rule.\n\n=== Qing-era Mongols ===\n{{see also|Mongolia under Qing rule}}\nThe Chahar army was defeated in 1625 and 1628 by the Inner Mongol and Manchu armies due to Ligdan's faulty tactics. The Qing forces secured their control over Inner Mongolia by 1635, and the army of the last khan Ligdan moved to battle against Tibetan [[Gelugpa]] sect (Yellow Hat sect) forces. The Gelugpa forces supported the Manchus, while Ligdan supported [[Kagyu]] sect (Red Hat sect) of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Ligden died in 1634 on his way to [[Tibet]]. By 1636, most Inner Mongolian nobles had submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] founded by the Manchus. Inner Mongolian Tengis [[noyan]] revolted against the Qing in the 1640s and the Khalkha battled to protect Sunud.\n\nWestern Mongolian Oirats and Eastern Mongolian Khalkhas vied for domination in Mongolia since the 15th century and this conflict weakened Mongolian strength. In 1688, Western Mongolian [[Dzungar Khanate]]'s king [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan Boshugtu]] attacked Khalkha after murder of his younger brother by Tusheet Khan Chakhundorj (main or Central Khalkha leader) and the Khalkha-Oirat War began. Galdan threatened to kill Chakhundorj and [[Zanabazar]] (Javzandamba Khutagt I, spiritual head of Khalkha) but they escaped to Sunud (Inner Mongolia). Many Khalkha nobles and folks fled to Inner Mongolia because of the war.

The Mongol-Oirat's Code (a treaty of alliance) against foreign invasion between the Oirats and Khalkhas was signed in 1640, however, the Mongols could not unite against foreign invasions. Chakhundorj fought against Russian invasion of [[Outer Mongolia]] until 1688 and stopped Russian invasion of [[Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Province]]. Zanabazar struggled to bring together the Oirats and Khalkhas before the war.\n\nGaldan Boshugtu sent his army to \"liberate\" Inner Mongolia after defeating the Khalkha's army and called Inner Mongolian nobles to fight for Mongolian independence. Some Inner Mongolian nobles, [[Tibetans]], [[Kumul Khanate]] and some [[Moghulistan]]'s nobles supported his war against the Manchus, however, Inner Mongolian nobles did not battle against the Qing.\n\nThere were three khans in Khalkha and Zasagt Khan Shar (Western Khalkha leader) was Galdan's ally. Tsetsen Khan (Eastern Khalkha leader) did not engage in this conflict. While Galdan was fighting in Eastern Mongolia, his nephew [[Tseveenravdan]] seized the Dzungarian throne in 1689 and this event made Galdan impossible to fight against the Qing Empire. The Russian and Qing Empires supported his action because this coup weakened Western Mongolian strength. Galdan Boshugtu's army was defeated by the outnumbering Qing army in 1696 and he died in 1697. The Mongols who fled to the Buryat region and Inner Mongolia returned after the war.

Linguists have traditionally proposed a link to the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language families, included alongside Mongolic in the broader group of [[Altaic languages]], though this remains controversial. Today the Mongolian peoples speak at least one of several Mongolic languages including Mongolian, Buryat, Oirat, Dongxiang, Tu, Bonan, Hazaragi, and Aimaq. Additionally, many Mongols speak either Russian or Mandarin Chinese as languages of inter-ethnic communication.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolian Shamanism}}\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Buryatia August 2009-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Buddhist temple in [[Buryatia]], Russia]]\nThe original religion of the Mongolic peoples was [[Shamanism]]. The Xianbei came in contact with [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]] but eventually adopted [[Buddhism]]. However, the Xianbeis in Mongolia and Rourans followed a form of Shamanism. In the 5th century the Buddhist monk Dharmapriya was proclaimed State Teacher of the Rouran Khaganate and given 3000 families and some Rouran nobles became Buddhists. In 511 the Rouran [[Douluofubadoufa Khan]] sent Hong Xuan to the Tuoba court with a pearl-encrusted statue of the Buddha as a gift. The Tuoba Xianbei and Khitans were mostly Buddhists, although they still retained their original Shamanism. The Tuoba had a \"sacrificial castle\" to the west of their capital where ceremonies to spirits took place. Wooden statues of the spirits were erected on top of this sacrificial castle. One ritual involved seven princes with milk offerings who ascended the stairs with 20 female shamans and offered prayers, sprinkling the statues with the sacred milk. The Khitan had their holiest shrine on Mount Muye where portraits of their earliest ancestor Qishou Khagan, his wife Kedun and eight sons were kept in two temples. Mongolic peoples were also exposed to [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheism]], [[Nestorianism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Islam]] from the west. The Mongolic peoples, in particular the Borjigin, had their holiest shrine on [[Burkhan Khaldun|Mount Burkhan Khaldun]] where their ancestor B\u00f6rte Chono (Blue Wolf) and Goo Maral (Beautiful Doe) had given birth to them. [[Genghis Khan]] usually fasted, prayed and meditated on this mountain before his campaigns. As a young man he had thanked the mountain for saving his life and prayed at the foot of the mountain sprinkling offerings and bowing nine times to the east with his belt around his neck and his hat held at his chest. Genghis Khan kept a close watch on the Mongolic supreme shaman Kokochu Teb who sometimes conflicted with his authority. Later the imperial cult of Genghis Khan (centered on the [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|eight white gers]] and nine white banners in [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]]) grew into a highly organized indigenous religion with scriptures in the [[Mongolian script]]. Indigenous moral precepts of the Mongolic peoples were enshrined in oral wisdom sayings (now collected in several volumes), the anda (blood-brother) system and ancient texts such as the ''Chinggis-un Bilig'' (Wisdom of Genghis) and ''Oyun Tulkhuur'' (Key of Intelligence). These moral precepts were expressed in poetic form and mainly involved truthfulness, fidelity, help in hardship, unity, self-control, fortitude, veneration of nature, veneration of the state and veneration of parents.\n\n[[File:Tamerlan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Timur]] of Mongolic origin himself had converted almost all the [[Borjigin]] leaders to [[Islam]].]]\n\nIn 1254 [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] organized a formal religious debate (in which [[William of Rubruck]] took part) between Christians, Muslims and Buddhists in [[Karakorum]], a cosmopolitan city of many religions. The Mongolic Empire was known for its religious tolerance, but had a special leaning towards Buddhism and was sympathetic towards Christianity while still worshipping [[Tengri]]. The Mongolic leader [[Abaqa Khan]] sent a delegation of 13\u201316 to the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274), which created a great stir, particularly when their leader 'Zaganus' underwent a public baptism. A joint crusade was announced in line with the [[Franco-Mongol alliance]] but did not materialize because Pope Gregory X died in 1276. [[Yahballaha III]] (1245\u20131317) and [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] (c. 1220\u20131294) were famous Mongolic Nestorian Christians. The [[Keraites]] in central Mongolia were Christian. In Istanbul the [[Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols]] stands as a reminder of the [[Byzantine-Mongol alliance]]. The western Khanates, however, eventually adopted Islam (under [[Berke]] and [[Ghazan]]) and the Turkic languages (because of its commercial importance), although allegiance to the Great Khan and limited use of the Mongolic languages can be seen even in the 1330s. In 1521 the first Mughal emperor Babur took part in a military banner milk-sprinkling ceremony in the Chagatai Khanate where the Mongolian language was still used. [[Al-Adil Kitbugha]] (reigned 1294-1296), a Mongol Sultan of Egypt, and the half-Mongol [[An-Nasir Muhammad]] (reigned till 1341) built the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad]] in Cairo, Egypt. An-Nasir's Mongol mother was Ashlun bint Shaktay. The Mongolic nobility during the [[Yuan dynasty]] studied Confucianism, built Confucian temples (including [[Beijing Confucius Temple]]) and translated Confucian works into Mongolic but mainly followed the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism under [[Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa|Phags-pa Lama]]. The general populace still practised [[Shamanism]]. [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] and [[Bonan people|Bonan Mongols]] adopted Islam, as did [[Moghol language|Moghol]]-speaking peoples in Afghanistan. In the 1576 the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism became the state religion of the Mongolia. The Red Hat school of Tibetan Buddhism coexisted with the Gelug Yellow Hat school which was founded by the half-Mongol [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357-1419). Shamanism was absorbed into the [[Buddhism in Mongolia|state religion]] while being marginalized in its purer forms, later only surviving in far northern Mongolia. Monks were some of the leading intellectuals in Mongolia, responsible for much of the literature and art of the pre-modern period. Many Buddhist philosophical works lost in Tibet and elsewhere are preserved in older and purer form in Mongolian ancient texts (e.g. the Mongol [[Kangyur|Kanjur]]). [[Zanabazar]] (1635\u20131723), [[Zaya Pandita]] (1599\u20131662) and [[Danzanravjaa]] (1803\u20131856) are among the most famous Mongol holy men. The 4th Dalai Lama [[Yonten Gyatso]] (1589\u20131617), a Mongol himself, is recognized as the only non-Tibetan [[Dalai Lama]] although the current 14th Dalai Lama is of Mongolic [[Monguor people|Monguor]] extraction.<ref name=\"hill\">Hill, Nathan.

Thus wife-giving clans were considered \"elder\" or \"bigger\" in relation to wife-taking clans, who were considered \"younger\" or \"smaller\".<ref>Vreeland 1962:160</ref><ref>Aberle 1953:23\u201324</ref> This distinction, symbolized in terms of \"elder\" and \"younger\" or \"bigger\" and \"smaller\", was carried into the clan and family as well, and all members of a lineage were terminologically distinguished by generation and age, with senior superior to junior.\n\nIn the traditional Mongolian family, each son received a part of the family herd as he married, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The youngest son would remain in the parental tent caring for his parents, and after their death he would inherit the parental tent in addition to his own part of the herd. This inheritance system was mandated by law codes such as the [[Yassa]], created by [[Genghis Khan]].<ref>[http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm THE INFLUENCE OF THE GREAT CODE \u201cYASA\u201d ON THE MONGOLIAN EMPIRE] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130615073730/http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm |date=2013-06-15 }}</ref> Likewise, each son inherited a part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The eldest son inherited the farthest camping lands and pastures, and each son in turn inherited camping lands and pastures closer to the family tent until the youngest son inherited the camping lands and pastures immediately surrounding the family tent. Family units would often remain near each other and in close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations. It is probable that the Yasa simply put into written law the principles of customary law.\n{{quotation|It is apparent that in many cases, for example in family instructions, the yasa tacitly accepted the principles of customary law and avoided any interference with them. For example, Riasanovsky said that killing the man or the woman in case of adultery is a good illustration. Yasa permitted the institutions of polygamy and concubinage so characteristic of southerly nomadic peoples. Children born of concubines were legitimate. Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom.)|Nilg\u00fcn Dalkesen|Gender roles and women's status in Central Asia and Anatolia between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries<ref>http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12608663/index.pdf</ref>}}\n\nAfter the family, the next largest social units were the subclan and clan. These units were derived from groups claiming patrilineal descent from a common ancestor, ranked in order of seniority (the \"conical clan\"). By the [[Chingissid]] era this ranking was symbolically expressed at formal feasts, in which tribal chieftains were seated and received particular portions of the slaughtered animal according to their status.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22Mongols%22+%22seniority%22+%22conical+clan%22#v=onepage&q=%22Mongols%22%20%22seniority%22%20%22conical%20clan%22&f=false | title=Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History| isbn=9781566398329| last1=Adas| first1=Michael| year=2001}}</ref> The lineage structure of [[Central Asia]] had three different modes. It was organized on the basis of genealogical distance, or the proximity of individuals to one another on a graph of kinship; generational distance, or the rank of generation in relation to a common ancestor, and birth order, the rank of brothers in relation to each another.<ref>Cuisenier (1975:67)</ref> The paternal descent lines were collaterally ranked according to the birth of their founders, and were thus considered senior and junior to each other. Of the various collateral patrilines, the senior in order of descent from the founding ancestor, the line of eldest sons, was the most noble. In the steppe, no one had his exact equal; everyone found his place in a system of collaterally ranked lines of descent from a common ancestor.<ref>Krader (1963:322, 269)</ref> It was according to this idiom of superiority and inferiority of lineages derived from birth order that legal claims to superior rank were couched.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 178975|title = Kinship Structure and Political Authority: The Middle East and Central Asia|journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume = 28|issue = 2|pages = 334\u2013355|last1 = Lindholm|first1 = Charles|year = 1986|doi = 10.1017/S001041750001389X|hdl = 2144/3845}}</ref>\n\nThe Mongol kinship is one of a particular patrilineal type classed as [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]], in which relatives are grouped together under separate terms that crosscut generations, age, and even sexual difference. Thus, a man's father's sister's children, his sister's children, and his daughter's children are all called by another term. A further attribute is strict terminological differentiation of siblings according to seniority.\n\nThe division of Mongolian society into senior elite lineages and subordinate junior lineages was waning by the twentieth century. During the 1920s the [[Communist]] regime was established. The remnants of the Mongolian aristocracy fought alongside the [[Japan]]ese and against [[China|Chinese]], [[Soviets]] and Communist Mongols during [[World War II]], but were defeated.\n\nThe anthropologist Herbert Harold Vreeland visited three Mongol communities in 1920 and published a highly detailed book with the results of his fieldwork, ''Mongol community and kinship structure''.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008324819;view=1up;seq=1 Mongol community and kinship structure.

[[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]]. They also live as minorities in other regions of China (e.g. [[Xinjiang]]), as well as in [[Russia]]. Mongolian people belonging to the [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] subgroups live predominantly in the Russian federal subjects of [[Buryatia]] and [[Kalmykia]].\n\nThe Mongols are bound together by a common heritage and [[ethnic identity]]. Their indigenous dialects are collectively known as the [[Mongolian language]]. The ancestors of the modern-day Mongols are referred to as [[Proto-Mongols]].\n\n== Definition ==\nBroadly defined, the term includes the Mongols proper (also known as the [[Khalkha Mongols]]), [[Buryats]], [[Oirats]], the [[Kalmyk people]] and the Southern Mongols. The latter comprises the [[Abaga Mongols]], [[Abaganar]], [[Aohans]], [[Baarins]], [[Gorlos Mongols]], [[Jalaids]], [[Jaruud]], [[Khishigten]], [[Khuuchid]], [[Muumyangan]] and [[Onnigud]].\n\nThe designation \"Mongol\" briefly appeared in 8th century records of [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] to describe a tribe of [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. It resurfaced in the late 11th century during the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty]]. After the fall of the Liao in 1125, the [[Khamag Mongol]]s became a leading tribe on the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. However, their wars with the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Tatar confederation]] had weakened them.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, the word Mongol grew into an umbrella term for a large group of [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic-speaking]] tribes united under the rule of [[Genghis Khan]].<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n  | title = Mongolia: Ethnography of Mongolia\n  | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-27420/Mongolia#394579.hook\n  | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]\n  | accessdate = 2007-07-22\n}}</ref>\n\n{{History of the Mongols}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Mongolia}}\n\nIn various times Mongolic peoples have been equated with the [[Scythians]], the [[Gog and Magog|Magog]], and the [[Tungusic peoples]]. Based on Chinese historical texts the ancestry of the Mongolic peoples can be traced back to the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], a nomadic confederation occupying eastern Mongolia and [[Manchuria]]. The identity of the [[Xiongnu]] (H\u00fcnn\u00fc) is still debated today. Although some scholars maintain that they were [[proto-Mongols]], they were more likely a multi-ethnic group of Mongolic and [[Turkic tribes]].<ref name=\"Geng 2005\">Geng 2005</ref> It has been suggested that the language of the [[Huns]] was related to the H\u00fcnn\u00fc.<ref>\u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re, Xiongnu.

Katalin Csornai, 2007, Budapest, Hungary [http://hunsarecoming.oxyhost.com/articles/asianhuns_chinesesources.htm summary]</ref> -->\n\nThe Donghu, however, can be much more easily labeled proto-Mongol since the Chinese histories trace only Mongolic tribes and kingdoms ([[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]] peoples) from them, although some historical texts claim a mixed Xiongnu-Donghu ancestry for some tribes (e.g. the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]).<ref>[[Frances Wood]], ''The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia'', p. 48</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nSee [[Genetic history of East Asians]]\n\n=== In the Chinese classics ===\n{{see also|Timeline of Mongols prior to the Mongol Empire}}\nThe Donghu are mentioned by [[Sima Qian]] as already existing in [[Inner Mongolia]] north of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] in 699\u2013632 BCE along with the [[Shanrong]]. Mentions in the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' (\"Lost Book of Zhou\") and the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' indicate the Donghu were also active during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600\u20131046 BCE).\n\nThe Xianbei formed part of the Donghu confederation, but had earlier times of independence, as evidenced by a mention in the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' (\"\u6649\u8a9e\u516b\" section), which states that during the reign of [[King Cheng of Zhou]] (reigned 1042\u20131021 BCE) they came to participate at a meeting of Zhou subject-lords at Qiyang (\u5c90\u9633) (now [[Qishan County]]) but were only allowed to perform the fire ceremony under the supervision of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] since they were not vassals by covenant (\u8bf8\u4faf). The Xianbei chieftain was appointed joint guardian of the ritual torch along with [[Xiong Yi]].\n\nThese early Xianbei came from the nearby [[Zhukaigou culture]] (2200\u20131500 BCE) in the [[Ordos Desert]], where maternal DNA corresponds to the Mongol [[Daur people]] and the Tungusic [[Evenks]]. The Zhukaigou Xianbei (part of the [[Ordos culture]] of Inner Mongolia and northern [[Shaanxi]]) had trade relations with the Shang. In the late 2nd century, the Han dynasty scholar Fu Qian (\u670d\u8654) wrote in his commentary \"Jixie\" (\u96c6\u89e3) that \"[[Shanrong]] and [[Beidi]] are ancestors of the present-day Xianbei\". Again in Inner Mongolia another closely connected core Mongolic Xianbei region was the [[Upper Xiajiadian culture]] (1000\u2013600 BCE) where the Donghu confederation was centered.\n\nAfter the Donghu were defeated by Xiongnu king [[Modu Chanyu]], the Xianbei and [[Wuhuan]] survived as the main remnants of the confederation. [[Tadun]] Khan of the Wuhuan (died 207 AD) was the ancestor of the proto-Mongolic [[Kumo Xi]].<ref>[[Xin Tangshu]] 219. 6173.</ref> The Wuhuan are of the direct Donghu royal line and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' says that in 209 BCE, Modu Chanyu defeated the Wuhuan instead of using the word Donghu. The Xianbei, however, were of the lateral Donghu line and had a somewhat separate identity, although they shared the same language with the Wuhuan. In 49 CE the Xianbei ruler Bianhe (Bayan Khan?) raided and defeated the Xiongnu, killing 2000, after having received generous gifts from [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]]. The Xianbei reached their peak under Tanshihuai Khan (reigned 156\u2013181) who expanded the vast, but short lived, [[Xianbei state]] (93\u2013234).\n\nThree prominent groups split from the [[Xianbei state]] as recorded by the Chinese histories: the [[Rouran]] (claimed by some to be the [[Pannonian Avars]]), the [[Khitan people]] and the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] (a subtribe called the \"Shiwei Menggu\" is held to be the origin of the Genghisid Mongols).<ref>University of California, Berkeley. Project on Linguistic Analysis, ''Journal of Chinese linguistics'', p. 154</ref> Besides these three Xianbei groups, there were others such as the [[Murong]], [[Duan (tribe)|Duan]] and [[Tuoba]]. Their culture was nomadic, their religion [[shamanism]] or [[Buddhism]] and their military strength formidable. There is still no direct evidence that the Rouran spoke [[Mongolic languages]], although most scholars agree that they were Proto-Mongolic.<ref>Thomas Hoppe, ''Die ethnischen Gruppen Xinjiangs: Kulturunterschiede und interethnische'', p. 66</ref> The Khitan, however, had two scripts of their own and many Mongolic words are found in their half-deciphered writings.\n\nGeographically, the [[Tuoba]] Xianbei ruled the southern part of Inner Mongolia and northern China, the Rouran ([[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun]] was the first to use the title [[khagan]] in 402) ruled eastern Mongolia, western Mongolia, the northern part of Inner Mongolia and northern Mongolia, the Khitan were concentrated in eastern part of Inner Mongolia north of [[Korea]] and the Shiwei were located to the north of the Khitan. These tribes and kingdoms were soon overshadowed by the rise of the [[Turkic Khaganate]] in 555, the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 745 and the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] states in 840. The Tuoba were eventually absorbed into China. The Rouran fled west from the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and either disappeared into obscurity or, as some say, invaded Europe as the Avars under their Khan, [[Bayan I]]. Some Rouran under Tatar Khan migrated east, founding the [[Tatar confederation]], who became part of the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. The Khitan, who were independent after their separation from the [[Kumo Xi]] (of [[Wuhuan]] origin) in 388, continued as a minor power in Manchuria until one of them, Ambagai (872\u2013926), established the [[Liao dynasty]] (907\u20131125) as [[Emperor Taizu of Liao]].\n\n=== Era of the Mongol Empire and Northern Yuan ===\n{{Main|Mongol Empire|Northern Yuan dynasty}}\n[[File:Asia 500ad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Asia in 500, showing the [[Rouran Khaganate]] and its neighbors, including the Northern Wei and the Tuyuhun Khanate, all of them were established by Proto-Mongols]]\n\nThe destruction of Uyghur Khaganate by the Kirghiz resulted in the end of Turkic dominance in Mongolia. According to historians, Kirghiz were not interested in assimilating newly acquired lands; instead, they controlled local tribes through various manaps (tribal leader). The Khitans occupied the areas vacated by the Turkic Uyghurs bringing them under their control. The [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] state was centered on [[Khakassia]] and they were expelled from Mongolia by the Khitans in 924. Beginning in the 10th century, the Khitans, under the leadership of [[Abaoji]], prevailed in several military campaigns against the [[Tang Dynasty]]{{'}}s border guards, and the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]], [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] nomadic groups.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = The Other Press| isbn = 978-983-9541-88-5| last = San| first = Tan Koon| title = Dynastic China: An Elementary History| date = 2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Khitan fled west after being defeated by the [[Jurchens]] (later known as [[Manchu people|Manchu]]) and founded the [[Qara Khitai]] (1125\u20131218) in eastern [[Kazakhstan]]. In 1218, Genghis Khan destroyed the Qara Khitai after which the Khitan passed into obscurity. With the expansion of the Mongol Empire, the Mongolic peoples settled over almost all [[Eurasia]] and carried on military campaigns from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[Indonesia]]n [[Java]] island and from [[Mongol invasion of Japan|Japan]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] ([[Gaza City|Gaza]]). They simultaneously became [[Padishah]]s of [[Persia]], [[Emperors of China]], and [[Great Khans]] of Mongolia, and one became [[Sultan of Egypt]] ([[Al-Adil Kitbugha]]).

However, most of the Yuan Mongols returned to Mongolia in 1368, retaining their language and culture. There were 250,000 Mongols in Southern China and many Mongols were massacred by the rebel army. The survivors were trapped in southern china and eventually assimilated. The [[Dongxiangs]], [[Bonans]], [[Yugur]] and [[Monguor people]] were invaded by Chinese [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, the Mongols continued to rule the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]] in Mongolia homeland. However, the [[Oirad]]s began to challenge the Eastern Mongolic peoples under the [[Borjigin]] monarchs in the late 14th century and Mongolia was divided into two parts: [[Western Mongolia]] ([[Oirats]]) and Eastern Mongolia ([[Khalkha]], [[Inner Mongols]], [[Barga Mongols|Barga]], [[Buryats]]).

The Ming Empire attempted to invade Mongolia in the 14\u201316th centuries, however, the Ming Empire was defeated by the Oirat, Southern Mongol, Eastern Mongol and united Mongolian armies. Esen's 30,000 cavalries defeated 500,000 Chinese soldiers in [[Tumu Crisis|1449]].

He got into conflicts with the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] over the looting of Chinese cities, and managed to alienate most Mongol tribes. In 1618, Ligdan signed a treaty with the [[Ming dynasty]] to protect their northern border from the Manchus attack in exchange for thousands of taels of silver. By the 1620s, only the [[Chahars]] remained under his rule.\n\n=== Qing-era Mongols ===\n{{see also|Mongolia under Qing rule}}\nThe Chahar army was defeated in 1625 and 1628 by the Inner Mongol and Manchu armies due to Ligdan's faulty tactics. The Qing forces secured their control over Inner Mongolia by 1635, and the army of the last khan Ligdan moved to battle against Tibetan [[Gelugpa]] sect (Yellow Hat sect) forces. The Gelugpa forces supported the Manchus, while Ligdan supported [[Kagyu]] sect (Red Hat sect) of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Ligden died in 1634 on his way to [[Tibet]]. By 1636, most Inner Mongolian nobles had submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] founded by the Manchus. Inner Mongolian Tengis [[noyan]] revolted against the Qing in the 1640s and the Khalkha battled to protect Sunud.\n\nWestern Mongolian Oirats and Eastern Mongolian Khalkhas vied for domination in Mongolia since the 15th century and this conflict weakened Mongolian strength. In 1688, Western Mongolian [[Dzungar Khanate]]'s king [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan Boshugtu]] attacked Khalkha after murder of his younger brother by Tusheet Khan Chakhundorj (main or Central Khalkha leader) and the Khalkha-Oirat War began. Galdan threatened to kill Chakhundorj and [[Zanabazar]] (Javzandamba Khutagt I, spiritual head of Khalkha) but they escaped to Sunud (Inner Mongolia). Many Khalkha nobles and folks fled to Inner Mongolia because of the war. Few Khalkhas fled to the Buryat region and Russia threatened to exterminate them if they did not submit, but many of them submitted to Galdan Boshugtu.\n\nIn 1683 [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan]]'s armies reached [[Tashkent]] and the [[Syr Darya]] and crushed two armies of the [[Kazakhs]]. After that Galdan subjugated the [[Kyrgyz people|Black Khirgizs]] and ravaged the [[Fergana Valley]]. From 1685 Galdan's forces aggressively pushed the Kazakhs.

The Mongol-Oirat's Code (a treaty of alliance) against foreign invasion between the Oirats and Khalkhas was signed in 1640, however, the Mongols could not unite against foreign invasions. Chakhundorj fought against Russian invasion of [[Outer Mongolia]] until 1688 and stopped Russian invasion of [[Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Province]]. Zanabazar struggled to bring together the Oirats and Khalkhas before the war.\n\nGaldan Boshugtu sent his army to \"liberate\" Inner Mongolia after defeating the Khalkha's army and called Inner Mongolian nobles to fight for Mongolian independence. Some Inner Mongolian nobles, [[Tibetans]], [[Kumul Khanate]] and some [[Moghulistan]]'s nobles supported his war against the Manchus, however, Inner Mongolian nobles did not battle against the Qing.\n\nThere were three khans in Khalkha and Zasagt Khan Shar (Western Khalkha leader) was Galdan's ally. Tsetsen Khan (Eastern Khalkha leader) did not engage in this conflict. While Galdan was fighting in Eastern Mongolia, his nephew [[Tseveenravdan]] seized the Dzungarian throne in 1689 and this event made Galdan impossible to fight against the Qing Empire. The Russian and Qing Empires supported his action because this coup weakened Western Mongolian strength. Galdan Boshugtu's army was defeated by the outnumbering Qing army in 1696 and he died in 1697. The Mongols who fled to the Buryat region and Inner Mongolia returned after the war. Some Khalkhas mixed with the Buryats.\n\n[[File:Langshiming mao.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A Mongol soldier called [[Ayusi]] from the high Qing era, by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit painter)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], 1755]]\n\nThe Buryats fought against Russian [[Russian conquest of Siberia|invasion]] since the [[Expansion of Russia 1500\u20131800|1620s]] and thousands of Buryats were massacred. The Buryat region was formally annexed to Russia by treaties in 1689 and 1727, when the territories on both the sides of [[Lake Baikal]] were separated from Mongolia. In 1689 the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] established the northern border of [[Manchuria]] north of the present line.

The Statement of Reunification of Mongolia was adopted by Mongolian [[People's Republic of Mongolia|revolutionist leaders]] in 1921. The Soviet, however, considered Mongolia to be Chinese territory in 1924 during secret meeting with the Republic of China.

Linguists have traditionally proposed a link to the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language families, included alongside Mongolic in the broader group of [[Altaic languages]], though this remains controversial. Today the Mongolian peoples speak at least one of several Mongolic languages including Mongolian, Buryat, Oirat, Dongxiang, Tu, Bonan, Hazaragi, and Aimaq. Additionally, many Mongols speak either Russian or Mandarin Chinese as languages of inter-ethnic communication.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolian Shamanism}}\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Buryatia August 2009-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Buddhist temple in [[Buryatia]], Russia]]\nThe original religion of the Mongolic peoples was [[Shamanism]]. The Xianbei came in contact with [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]] but eventually adopted [[Buddhism]]. However, the Xianbeis in Mongolia and Rourans followed a form of Shamanism. In the 5th century the Buddhist monk Dharmapriya was proclaimed State Teacher of the Rouran Khaganate and given 3000 families and some Rouran nobles became Buddhists. In 511 the Rouran [[Douluofubadoufa Khan]] sent Hong Xuan to the Tuoba court with a pearl-encrusted statue of the Buddha as a gift. The Tuoba Xianbei and Khitans were mostly Buddhists, although they still retained their original Shamanism. The Tuoba had a \"sacrificial castle\" to the west of their capital where ceremonies to spirits took place. Wooden statues of the spirits were erected on top of this sacrificial castle. One ritual involved seven princes with milk offerings who ascended the stairs with 20 female shamans and offered prayers, sprinkling the statues with the sacred milk. The Khitan had their holiest shrine on Mount Muye where portraits of their earliest ancestor Qishou Khagan, his wife Kedun and eight sons were kept in two temples. Mongolic peoples were also exposed to [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheism]], [[Nestorianism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Islam]] from the west. The Mongolic peoples, in particular the Borjigin, had their holiest shrine on [[Burkhan Khaldun|Mount Burkhan Khaldun]] where their ancestor B\u00f6rte Chono (Blue Wolf) and Goo Maral (Beautiful Doe) had given birth to them. [[Genghis Khan]] usually fasted, prayed and meditated on this mountain before his campaigns. As a young man he had thanked the mountain for saving his life and prayed at the foot of the mountain sprinkling offerings and bowing nine times to the east with his belt around his neck and his hat held at his chest. Genghis Khan kept a close watch on the Mongolic supreme shaman Kokochu Teb who sometimes conflicted with his authority. Later the imperial cult of Genghis Khan (centered on the [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|eight white gers]] and nine white banners in [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]]) grew into a highly organized indigenous religion with scriptures in the [[Mongolian script]]. Indigenous moral precepts of the Mongolic peoples were enshrined in oral wisdom sayings (now collected in several volumes), the anda (blood-brother) system and ancient texts such as the ''Chinggis-un Bilig'' (Wisdom of Genghis) and ''Oyun Tulkhuur'' (Key of Intelligence). These moral precepts were expressed in poetic form and mainly involved truthfulness, fidelity, help in hardship, unity, self-control, fortitude, veneration of nature, veneration of the state and veneration of parents.\n\n[[File:Tamerlan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Timur]] of Mongolic origin himself had converted almost all the [[Borjigin]] leaders to [[Islam]].]]\n\nIn 1254 [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] organized a formal religious debate (in which [[William of Rubruck]] took part) between Christians, Muslims and Buddhists in [[Karakorum]], a cosmopolitan city of many religions. The Mongolic Empire was known for its religious tolerance, but had a special leaning towards Buddhism and was sympathetic towards Christianity while still worshipping [[Tengri]]. The Mongolic leader [[Abaqa Khan]] sent a delegation of 13\u201316 to the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274), which created a great stir, particularly when their leader 'Zaganus' underwent a public baptism. A joint crusade was announced in line with the [[Franco-Mongol alliance]] but did not materialize because Pope Gregory X died in 1276. [[Yahballaha III]] (1245\u20131317) and [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] (c. 1220\u20131294) were famous Mongolic Nestorian Christians. The [[Keraites]] in central Mongolia were Christian. In Istanbul the [[Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols]] stands as a reminder of the [[Byzantine-Mongol alliance]]. The western Khanates, however, eventually adopted Islam (under [[Berke]] and [[Ghazan]]) and the Turkic languages (because of its commercial importance), although allegiance to the Great Khan and limited use of the Mongolic languages can be seen even in the 1330s. In 1521 the first Mughal emperor Babur took part in a military banner milk-sprinkling ceremony in the Chagatai Khanate where the Mongolian language was still used. [[Al-Adil Kitbugha]] (reigned 1294-1296), a Mongol Sultan of Egypt, and the half-Mongol [[An-Nasir Muhammad]] (reigned till 1341) built the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad]] in Cairo, Egypt. An-Nasir's Mongol mother was Ashlun bint Shaktay. The Mongolic nobility during the [[Yuan dynasty]] studied Confucianism, built Confucian temples (including [[Beijing Confucius Temple]]) and translated Confucian works into Mongolic but mainly followed the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism under [[Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa|Phags-pa Lama]]. The general populace still practised [[Shamanism]]. [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] and [[Bonan people|Bonan Mongols]] adopted Islam, as did [[Moghol language|Moghol]]-speaking peoples in Afghanistan. In the 1576 the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism became the state religion of the Mongolia. The Red Hat school of Tibetan Buddhism coexisted with the Gelug Yellow Hat school which was founded by the half-Mongol [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357-1419). Shamanism was absorbed into the [[Buddhism in Mongolia|state religion]] while being marginalized in its purer forms, later only surviving in far northern Mongolia. Monks were some of the leading intellectuals in Mongolia, responsible for much of the literature and art of the pre-modern period. Many Buddhist philosophical works lost in Tibet and elsewhere are preserved in older and purer form in Mongolian ancient texts (e.g. the Mongol [[Kangyur|Kanjur]]). [[Zanabazar]] (1635\u20131723), [[Zaya Pandita]] (1599\u20131662) and [[Danzanravjaa]] (1803\u20131856) are among the most famous Mongol holy men. The 4th Dalai Lama [[Yonten Gyatso]] (1589\u20131617), a Mongol himself, is recognized as the only non-Tibetan [[Dalai Lama]] although the current 14th Dalai Lama is of Mongolic [[Monguor people|Monguor]] extraction.<ref name=\"hill\">Hill, Nathan.

During the socialist period religion was officially banned, although it was practiced in clandestine circles. Today, a sizable proportion of Mongolic peoples are [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. In the most recent census in Mongolia, almost forty percent of the population reported as being atheist, while the majority religion was Tibetan Buddhism, with 53%.<ref>[http://www.toollogo2010.mn/doc/Main%20results_20110615_to%20EZBH_for%20print.pdf National Census 2010 Preliminary results] '''(Mongolian)'''</ref> Having survived suppression by the Communists, Buddhism among the Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Mongols is today primarily of the [[Gelugpa]] (Yellow Hat sect) school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Wives were brought for each of the sons, while daughters were married off to other clans. Wife-taking clans stood in a relation of inferiority to wife-giving clans. Thus wife-giving clans were considered \"elder\" or \"bigger\" in relation to wife-taking clans, who were considered \"younger\" or \"smaller\".<ref>Vreeland 1962:160</ref><ref>Aberle 1953:23\u201324</ref> This distinction, symbolized in terms of \"elder\" and \"younger\" or \"bigger\" and \"smaller\", was carried into the clan and family as well, and all members of a lineage were terminologically distinguished by generation and age, with senior superior to junior.\n\nIn the traditional Mongolian family, each son received a part of the family herd as he married, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The youngest son would remain in the parental tent caring for his parents, and after their death he would inherit the parental tent in addition to his own part of the herd. This inheritance system was mandated by law codes such as the [[Yassa]], created by [[Genghis Khan]].<ref>[http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm THE INFLUENCE OF THE GREAT CODE \u201cYASA\u201d ON THE MONGOLIAN EMPIRE] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130615073730/http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm |date=2013-06-15 }}</ref> Likewise, each son inherited a part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The eldest son inherited the farthest camping lands and pastures, and each son in turn inherited camping lands and pastures closer to the family tent until the youngest son inherited the camping lands and pastures immediately surrounding the family tent. Family units would often remain near each other and in close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations. It is probable that the Yasa simply put into written law the principles of customary law.\n{{quotation|It is apparent that in many cases, for example in family instructions, the yasa tacitly accepted the principles of customary law and avoided any interference with them. For example, Riasanovsky said that killing the man or the woman in case of adultery is a good illustration. Yasa permitted the institutions of polygamy and concubinage so characteristic of southerly nomadic peoples. Children born of concubines were legitimate. Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom.)|Nilg\u00fcn Dalkesen|Gender roles and women's status in Central Asia and Anatolia between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries<ref>http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12608663/index.pdf</ref>}}\n\nAfter the family, the next largest social units were the subclan and clan. These units were derived from groups claiming patrilineal descent from a common ancestor, ranked in order of seniority (the \"conical clan\"). By the [[Chingissid]] era this ranking was symbolically expressed at formal feasts, in which tribal chieftains were seated and received particular portions of the slaughtered animal according to their status.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22Mongols%22+%22seniority%22+%22conical+clan%22#v=onepage&q=%22Mongols%22%20%22seniority%22%20%22conical%20clan%22&f=false | title=Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History| isbn=9781566398329| last1=Adas| first1=Michael| year=2001}}</ref> The lineage structure of [[Central Asia]] had three different modes. It was organized on the basis of genealogical distance, or the proximity of individuals to one another on a graph of kinship; generational distance, or the rank of generation in relation to a common ancestor, and birth order, the rank of brothers in relation to each another.<ref>Cuisenier (1975:67)</ref> The paternal descent lines were collaterally ranked according to the birth of their founders, and were thus considered senior and junior to each other. Of the various collateral patrilines, the senior in order of descent from the founding ancestor, the line of eldest sons, was the most noble. In the steppe, no one had his exact equal; everyone found his place in a system of collaterally ranked lines of descent from a common ancestor.<ref>Krader (1963:322, 269)</ref> It was according to this idiom of superiority and inferiority of lineages derived from birth order that legal claims to superior rank were couched.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 178975|title = Kinship Structure and Political Authority: The Middle East and Central Asia|journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume = 28|issue = 2|pages = 334\u2013355|last1 = Lindholm|first1 = Charles|year = 1986|doi = 10.1017/S001041750001389X|hdl = 2144/3845}}</ref>\n\nThe Mongol kinship is one of a particular patrilineal type classed as [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]], in which relatives are grouped together under separate terms that crosscut generations, age, and even sexual difference. Thus, a man's father's sister's children, his sister's children, and his daughter's children are all called by another term. A further attribute is strict terminological differentiation of siblings according to seniority.\n\nThe division of Mongolian society into senior elite lineages and subordinate junior lineages was waning by the twentieth century. During the 1920s the [[Communist]] regime was established. The remnants of the Mongolian aristocracy fought alongside the [[Japan]]ese and against [[China|Chinese]], [[Soviets]] and Communist Mongols during [[World War II]], but were defeated.\n\nThe anthropologist Herbert Harold Vreeland visited three Mongol communities in 1920 and published a highly detailed book with the results of his fieldwork, ''Mongol community and kinship structure''.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008324819;view=1up;seq=1 Mongol community and kinship structure.
