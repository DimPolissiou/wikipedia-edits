Opened in 1952, the length of the [[waterway]] is {{convert|101|km|abbr=on}}, {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} through [[river]]s and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]].\n\nThe canal forms a part of the [[Unified Deep Water System of European Russia]]. Together with the lower Volga and the lower Don, the Volga\u2013Don Canal provides the most direct navigable connection between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the world's oceans via the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Don\u2013Volga-Portage}}\nThe idea of trade and military route between the major rivers [[Volga]] and [[Don River|Don]], has dated back to early human history. The existence of the [[Tanais]] in the Don River delta which dates backs in c. 438 BC \u2013 c. 370 AD during the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] indicated that this route may have existed for more than two thousands years. [[Sarkel]] was a fortress located in the left bank of the lower Don River and it controlled the [[Volga trade route]].<ref> Elhaik E(2020)Diverse genetic origins of medieval steppe nomad conquerors \u2013 a response to Mikheyev et al(2019). </ref> Both [[Sarkel]] and [[Tanais]] were located in the [[Volga trade route]].\n{{Multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| image1 = Varangian_routes.png\n| width1 = 288\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Sarkel]] and [[Tanais]] in [[Volga trade route]]\n| image2 = Sarkel.jpg\n| width2 = 276\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Sarkel]] fortress\n}}\nDon\u2013Volga Portage has got its name from about 1000 years ago while its  significant  trade importance<ref>https://www.ca-c.org/c-g/2009/journal_eng/c-g-1/14.shtml</ref>. The first attempts to connects Volga and Don river canal was made by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]<ref>https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-is-the-volga-don-canal.html</ref>. After capturing [[Azov]] in 1696, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] decided to build the canal, but, because of a lack of resources and other problems, this attempt was abandoned in 1701 without success. In 1701, he initiated a second attempt (the so-called [[Ivanovsky Canal]] at [[Yepifan]]) under the administration of [[Knyaz]] [[Matvey Gagarin]]. Instead of connecting the lower course of the Don with the lower course of the Volga near the present canal, the Ivanovsky Canal connected the upper course of the Don in what is now [[Tula Oblast]]. Between 1702 and 1707, twenty-four [[ship lock|lock]]s were constructed, and, in 1707, about 300 ships passed the canal under remarkably difficult navigation conditions.

Construction works continued from 1948 to 1952; navigation was opened 1 June 1952. The canal and its facilities were built by about 900,000 workers including some 100,000 German POWs and 100,000 [[gulag]] prisoners.

After capturing [[Azov]] in 1696, [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] decided to build the canal, but, because of a lack of resources and other problems, this attempt was abandoned in 1701 without success. In 1701, he initiated a second attempt (the so-called [[Ivanovsky Canal]] at [[Yepifan]]) under the administration of [[Knyaz]] [[Matvey Gagarin]]. Instead of connecting the lower course of the Don with the lower course of the Volga near the present canal, the Ivanovsky Canal connected the upper course of the Don in what is now [[Tula Oblast]]. Between 1702 and 1707, twenty-four [[ship lock|lock]]s were constructed, and, in 1707, about 300 ships passed the canal under remarkably difficult navigation conditions. In 1709 due to financial difficulties caused by the [[Great Northern War]], the project was halted. the canal get the name [[\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432_\u0432\u0430\u043b_(\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b)|Petrov Val]] and the city [[Petrov Val]] got its name from this attempts.\n{{Multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| image1 = Petrov_Val_canal.jpg\n| width1 = 272\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Petrov Val canal\n| image2 = Scheme_of_Tanais_fortifications.jpg\n| width2 = 253\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Scheme of Tanais fortifications\n}}\nIn 1711, under terms of the [[Treaty of the Pruth]], Russia left Azov and Peter the Great lost all interest in the canal, which was abandoned and fell into ruin.<ref name=\"\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0446. \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0445 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\">{{cite web | script-title=ru:\u041f\u043b\u0435\u0447\u043a\u043e \u041b.\u0410.: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438 | website=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0446. \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0445 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430 | url=http://www.skitalets.ru/books/star_puti/index.htm | language=ru | access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0435\">{{cite web | script-title=ru:\u044d\u0442\u043e... \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b? | website=\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0435 | url=https://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/brokgauz_efron/43688/%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9 | language=ru | access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref> Over time, other projects for connecting the two rivers were proposed, but none was attempted.

Water is also taken from the canal and used for [[irrigation]].\n\nTypes of [[cargo]] transported from the Don region to the Volga region include [[coal]] from [[Donetsk, Ukraine]], [[mineral]]s, [[building material]]s, and [[cereal|grain]]. Cargoes from the Volga to the Don include [[lumber]], [[pyrite]]s, and [[petroleum products]] (carried mostly by [[Volgotanker]] boats). Tourist ships travel in both directions.\n\nThe Volga\u2013Don Canal, together with the Tsimlyansky water-engineering system (chief architect [[Leonid Polyakov]]), form part of an [[Stalinist architecture|architectural ensemble]] dedicated to the battles for [[Tsaritsyn]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] and for [[Stalingrad]] during the [[German-Soviet War]].
