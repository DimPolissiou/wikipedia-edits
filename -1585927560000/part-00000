Detection of antibodies ([[serology]]) can be used both for clinical purposes and population surveillance. Antibody tests allow us to find out how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were so minor that they were shrugged off. In this way we can find the true mortality rate of the disease as well as how much [[herd immunity]] has been built up in society.\n\nDue to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.<ref>{{cite news|title=A fiasco in the making?

It was formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia or the Agricultural University of Malaysia. Now, UPM offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in most fields such as science, engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine, business and social science.\n\nIt was ranked as the 159th best university in the world in 2020 by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM QS World Ranking|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> and it was ranked 34th in Best Asian Universities and the 2nd best university in Malaysia.\n\n== History ==\nThe School of Agriculture was officially instituted on 21 May 1931 by John Scott,<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/?aktvt=content&kat=D&kod=20060424114103210172165493|title=UPM History|date=1 October 2007|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=25 June 2008}}</ref> an administrative officer of the British colonial [[Straits Settlements]]. The school was on a 22-acre piece of land in Serdang and offered two programmes: a three-year diploma programme and a one-year certificate course in Agriculture.\n\nIn 1947, the school was declared the College of Agriculture Malaya by Sir [[Edward Gent]], the then Governor of the Malayan Union. The establishment of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia came about when the College of Agriculture in Serdang merged with the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Malaya. Dr. Mohd. Rashdan bin Haji Baba, the then principal of the College of Agriculture Malaya, was appointed as the first vice-chancellor by virtue of the provisions of Section 18 of the Universities and University Colleges Act, 1971. With the first intake of 1,559 students, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia had its first academic session in July 1973 in the three central faculties and one basic division: the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Forestry, Faculty of Agriculture, and a Division of Foundation Studies.\n\nIn the early 80s, UPM extended its area of studies to include the field of Science and Technology (S&T). In 1997, the name Universiti Pertanian Malaysia was changed to Universiti Putra Malaysia by Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, as a strategic gesture to portray the status of UPM as a centre of higher education capable of providing fields of studies, especially in science and information technology, which facilitate national development in the new millennium.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM History|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/about_us/TheStoryBehindUPM?LANG=en|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe list of the vice-chancellor of Universiti Putra Malaysia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Vice-Chancellor'''\n!'''Academic Qualification'''\n!'''Term in office'''\n|-\n| '''1''' Professor Tan Sri Datuk Dr. [[Mohd Rashdan Baba]]\n| Diploma of Agriculture(Malaya Agriculture College), Bachelor of Agriculture Science(Reading, UK), PhD in Agriculture Science(Leeds, UK).\n| 4th November 1971\u201328th February 1982\n|-\n| '''2''' Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Nayan Ariffin]]\n| \n| 1st March 1982\u20134th June 1994\n|-\n| '''3''' Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Syed Jalaluddin Syed Salim]]\n|\n| 5th June 1994-17th April 2001\n|-\n| '''4''' Professor Dato\u2019 Ir.

The faculty now has six departments \u2014 Crop Science, Animal Science, Plant Protection, Land Management, Agribusiness and Information System, and Agriculture Technology.\n\nFaculty of Agriculture comprises seven main departments:\n\n# Department of Crop Science\n# Department of Plant Protection\n# Department of Land Management\n# Department of Animal Science\n# Department of Agribusiness and Information Systems\n# Department of Agriculture Technology\n# Department of Aquaculture\n\n===Faculty of Forestry===\n\nThe Faculty of Forestry<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Forestry|url=http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> is one of the founding faculties during the establishment of Universiti Putra Malaysia, formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia in 1971.\n\nFaculty of Forestry comprises three main departments and one section:\n\n# Department of Forest Management\n# Department of Forest Production\n# Department of Recreation and Eco-tourism\n# Forest & Plantation Section\n\n===Faculty of Veterinary Medicine===\n\nFaculty of Veterinary Medicine has six main departments:\n\n# Department of Veterinary Pathology & Microbiology\n# Department of Pre-Clinical Veterinary\n# Department of Veterinary Clinical Studies\n# Department of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostics\n# Department of Medicine Companion Animal Surgery\n# Department of Medicine and Exotic & Farm Animal Surgery\n\n===Faculty of Economics and Management===\n\nThe Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP)<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Economics and Management|url=http://www.econ.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> (formerly known as the Faculty of Resource Economics and Agribusiness) was established in January 1974, as the fourth faculty in Universiti Putra Malaysia (formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia). It was established in response to the needs for competent professionals in the fields of agribusiness and resource economics.\n\nEver since its inception, FEP has grown in student intake, number of academic programs offered, research activities, and professional services. This is the first faculty in Malaysia gaining AACSB status. This accreditation is awarded to the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP) and Putra Business School or PBS (formerly known as the Graduate School of Management or GSM).\n\nThe achievement of UPM and seven other international universities was announced by the President and Chief Executive Officer of AACSB International, John J. Fernandes at Tampa, Florida via www.aacsb.edu recently.\n\nTo cater to the education needs of working adults, FEP established Executive Program Unit (UPE) in 1997 by offering part-time programs to candidates with working experience in the public or private sector. This program has thus expanded through collaboration with Malaysian Airlines (MAS) Academy in 2000.\n\nThe same year, FEP established External Program Unit and Distance Learning Unit in 2001.\n\nFEP offers three bachelor-level programs: Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Economics and Bachelor of Business Administration. At the graduate level, FEP offers Masters of Economics, Masters of Science and PhD in Economics.\n\nFaculty of Economics and Management comprises three main departments:\n\n# Department of Economics\n# Department of Management and Marketing\n# Department of Accounting and Finance\n\n===Faculty of Engineering===\n\nThe Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Engineering|url=http://www.eng.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> of Universiti Putra Malaysia was established on 1 January 1975 at the main Serdang Campus, some 22 kilometres to the south of Kuala Lumpur. It is one of the largest faculties at UPM with a student population of over 3000. The campus\u2019 location at the heart of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) provides the faculty with access to the array of IT and multimedia facilities available in the Corridor.\n\nThe eight academic departments housed in the faculty offer a similar number of Bachelor of Engineering degree programs. Out of 800 postgraduates, almost 50% are international students. In addition to providing facilities and opportunities for teaching and research, the faculty has established Research Centres in engineering and related fields.\n\nThe \"Centres of Excellence\" organise research and development programs, consultancy and professional training using expertise from disciplines in the university. The objective is to secure contracts from the public or private sectors to generate income for the faculty. Centers of Excellence have been established as listed below.\n* Road Safety Research Center (RSRC)\n* Housing Research Center (HRC)\n* Mountainous Terrain Development Research Center (MTDRC)\n* Centre of Excellence for Wireless and Photonic Network (WiPNET)\n* Centre of Excellence on Lightning Protection (CELP)\n\nThe Eighth Malaysia Plan ended in 2005 and, during its duration, most of the approved research projects were completed. Under the Ninth Malaysia Plan, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation offers three research grants: Technofund, Innofund, and Sciencefund.  In addition, the Ministry of Higher Education initiated the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme and UPM offers the Research University Grant Scheme.\n\nFaculty of Engineering comprises eight main departments:\n\n# Aerospace\n# Biological and Agricultural\n# Civil\n# Electric and Electronic\n# Chemical and Environment\n# Computer and Communication Systems\n# Mechanical and Manufacturing\n# Process and Food.\n\n===Faculty of Educational Studies===\n\nThe Faculty of Educational Studies<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Educational Studies|url=http://www.educ.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> serves to produce teachers who can teach at the secondary school level as well as professionals who are responsible for human resource development. At present, the faculty offers Bachelor of Education degrees in Agricultural Science, Home Science, Physical Education, the Teaching of Bahasa Malaysia as the First Language, the Teaching of English as a Second Language, Guidance and Counselling as well as Information Technology.\n\nFaculty of Educational Studies has six main departments:\n\n# Department of Foundations of Education\n# Department of Sport Studies\n# Department of Science and Technical Education\n# Department of Language and Humanities Education\n# Department of Professional Development and Continuing Education\n# Department of Counselor Education and Counseling Psychology\n\n===Faculty of Science===\n\nThe Faculty of Science<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Science|url=http://www.escience.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established as the Division of Basic Sciences in 1972. Its objective was to offer basic science courses required by other faculties in the university. In 1975, the status of the division was upgraded to a faculty and named the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies.\n\nSince then the faculty has set up the Department of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Computer Sciences which later were upgraded to form two new faculties and the transfer of the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology to the newly formed Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences. Ever since the restructuring, it was renamed as the Faculty of Science in 2004.\n\nFaculty of Science comprises four main departments and one centre:\n\n# Department of Biology\n# Department of Physics\n# Department of Chemistry\n# Department of Mathematics\n# Catalysis Science and Technology Research Centre (PutraCAT)\n\n===Faculty of Food Science and Technology===\n\nThe Faculty of Food Science and Technology<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Food Science and Technology|url=http://www.food.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> had its humble beginnings in 1976 with the establishment of the Department of Food Science and Technology under the Faculty of Agriculture. The establishment of the department is in line with the need of the country to fulfill the shortage of skilled employees in the field of science-based food. At that time, only one undergraduate program was offered: Bachelor of Food Science and Technology.\n\nOn 1 March 1982, the Department of Food Science and Technology was upgraded to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology. There were two departments under the faculty: Department of Food Technology and Department of Food Science. In 1986, the Faculty was renamed Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology (FSMB) with the establishment of the Department of Biotechnology that offered the Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) program with six modules: Plant Biotechnology, Molecular Biotechnology, Food Biotechnology, Industrial Biotechnology, Environmental Biotechnology, and Management.\n\nIn 1996, the faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Studies) program with two options: Food Quality Management and Food Management. In 1997 and 2000, the Food Service Administration and Food Marketing options were offered through the same program. On 1 August 2004, the faculty was renamed to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology when the Department of Biotechnology formed a separate faculty. In January 2005, the Department of Food Service and Management was established to strengthen the existing programs in the faculty. The faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Service Management) and Master of Food Technology in September 2012.\n\nFaculty of Food Science and Technology comprises three main departments:\n\n# Department of Food Science\n# Department of Food Technology\n# Department of Food Service and Management\n\n===Faculty of Human Ecology===\n\nThe Faculty of Human Ecology<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Human Ecology|url=http://www.eco1.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was officially established on 1 April {{Year missing|date=August 2017}} through the merger of the Department of Human Development Studies from the Faculty of Agriculture with the Department of Social Sciences from the Faculty of Educational Studies.

Both units were combined to form the Language Division in 1971 which was subsequently upgraded into the Language Department in 1972 and was placed under the Faculty of Agriculture.\n\nOn 15 January 1975, the Language Department was placed in the Faculty of Educational Studies. On 4 January 1995, the Language Department was upgraded to the Faculty of Language Studies. On 1 January 1999, the Department of Development Communication (which was in the Faculty of Human Ecology) was transferred to the Faculty of Modern Languages as the Department of Communication. With this restructuring, the Faculty of Language Studies was renamed as the Faculty of Modern Languages and Communication (FBMK).\n\nCurrently, Faculty of Modern Languages & Communication comprises four main departments:\n\n# Department of Malay Language and Linguistics\n# Department of English Language\n# Department of Foreign Languages\n# Department of Communication\n\n===Faculty of Design & Architecture===\n\nThe idea to establish the Faculty of Design and Architecture<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Design & Architecture|url=http://www.frsb.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> in UPM originated with a proposal paper titled \"Proposed Establishment of the Faculty of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture.\" It was submitted to the Faculty Agriculture in 1976. However, the proposal was never brought up for further consideration by the Faculty's administration. Nevertheless, a group of teaching staff in Landscape Architecture was recruited in 1980 to teach \"landscape subjects\" in the diploma and bachelor of agriculture programmes.\n\nThe first landscape course was offered in 1984. It was a three-credit course titled \"AGRO 472 \u2013 An Approach to Landscape Design\". It became popular and managed to attract many agricultural students who later graduated and continued their studies in landscape architecture at the undergraduate and graduate level overseas. Many of these early graduates have since returned and assumed successful practice or became professors at institutions of higher learning.\n\nIn 1991, the Faculty of Engineering, UPM proposed to offer the Architecture programme in UPM. However, the idea never materialised until the Faculty of Agriculture was given the task by the university's management to look into the feasibility of offering landscape architecture and architecture in UPM. A committee was formed in the Faculty of Agriculture 1994 and in 1995 a report was sent to the vice-chancellor proposing the setting up of a new faculty offering courses in design and the creative arts. With the strong support of the university's management the Faculty of Design and Architecture was approved by the University's Senate, Board of Directors and the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe new faculty was officially established on 26 June 1996 and began its operation with the offering of the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture programmes under the new Department of Landscape Architecture. Subsequently, the Department of Architecture was established in 1999 and the Department of Industrial Design in 2002. The faculty began with an enrolment of 40 students.

This establishment has submitted proposals to the management of the University in 2003 and was approved at the Management Committee Meeting University 110th on 26 and 31 March 2003. However, the establishment of this institute can not be implemented because of financial problems the university at the time. Therefore, Faculty of Food Science and Technology has taken the initiative to establish the Halal Food Unit in June 2003.\n\nIn August 2004, the Halal Food Unit in collaboration with Yayasan Dakwah Islamiah Malaysia (YADIM) has organised a \"Workshop on Global Halal Hub Development Malaysia\" in conjunction with the 1st Malaysian International Halal Showcase (Mihas) 2004. Resolution of the workshop titled \"Proposed Development of Halal Food Hub Global Malaysia\" was presented to the Honorable Prime Minister of Malaysia by Y.Bhg. Vice-Chancellor of the university in the opening MIHAS 2004 on 16 August 2004. Following this development, the Ministry of Higher Education has approved and agreed that UPM lead the national agricultural education center on 30 August 2004. To support this initiative, UPM has proposed the establishment of Halal Food Institute and has received approval from the Ministry of Higher Education on 1 June 2005. this initiative was implemented to help Malaysia to realise the aspiration to emerge as a global hub for halal food.\n\nFollowing the change in administration policy UPM, several workshops were held to address the future direction related issues RMK9 and strengthen the position of UPM as a research university. To enhance research excellence, UPM has held workshops directions from 25\u201327 May 2006 and has established eight universities and research focus areas Halal products have been placed as one of the focus areas.\n\nThus, on 1 July 2006, after UPM implement changes Basically, the name Halal Food Institute (IMH) was converted to Halal Products Research Institute (IPPH).<ref>{{cite web|title=Halal Product Research Institute (IPPH)|url=http://www.halal.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> This amendment is to broaden the scope of research IPPH beyond the scope of food and put some new research scope of consumables Muslims and Islamic business.

The establishment of this institute was the outcome of the restructuring and rationalisation process of institutes, academy, and centres in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). This rationalisation process was implemented as a proactive and integrated effort taken to strengthen UPM status as a Research University (RU) and to become the center of excellence in agriculture education in Malaysia.\n\nIn line with UPM mission to have an efficient and effective administration structure via the lean and mean concept, the University has identified six new research clusters: Agriculture, Food, Forestry and Environment, Health, Social Science and Science, and Engineering and Technology to enhance research activities in UPM. In addition, UPM has identified eight specific research thrusts for each cluster, in line with the government's emphasis on the country's agriculture development agenda.\n\nThree of the eight identified thrusts \u2014 Food Crops, Plantation Crops and Animal Production \u2014 will be ITA's research focus.\n\n==Schools==\n\n===School Of Graduate Studies===\n\nThe School of Graduate Studies (SGS)<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Graduate Studies (SGS)|url=http://www.sgs.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> is a service and administrative centre established to assist postgraduate students in the processes involved from their registration at UPM up to the completion of their studies. SGS is the core support system which helps ease and enhance the postgraduate experience for UPM students, and plays a crucial role in fostering the relationship between UPM and its graduates.\n\nInitially set up as a Graduate Study Unit in 1978, SGS then proceeded to become a fully functioning Graduate School Office (GSO) in February 1993, to serve the growing population of postgraduate students at UPM. In March 2002, it continued to flourish as it was officially renamed the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) and was established as a service centre which had a status equivalent to a faculty at the university. This entailed its bigger role in the co-ordination of all postgraduate programmes and activities at UPM.\n\nIn its original inception, its key role also included an active involvement in research and development in postgraduate studies. In other words, SGS was conceptualised not only as a service centre to facilitate the general running of matters related to postgraduate students, but it was deemed to play a more active and crucial role in bolstering UPM's status as a research university.\n\nAmong its main roles as stated in the 1992 proposal for its establishment are:\n* To cultivate and nurture a research culture through efficient and effective management of postgraduate research activities\n* To help the university produce graduates who are knowledgeable and skilled to meet the nation's needs\n* To improve the quality of postgraduate programmes and therefore reduce the need for overseas postgraduate training\n* To increase the international student population and contribute to UPM's internationalisation through the intensification of publication and research training for staff.\n\n===Putra Business School===\n\nPutra Business School<ref>{{cite web|title=Putra Business School|url=http://putrabusinessschool.edu.my/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> \u2013 formerly the Graduate School of Management, in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang.\n\nPUTRA became the first business programme in Malaysia to receive accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

The University of Melbourne is the only Australian university invited to participate in this initiative.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, Split PhD scholarships are being offered by the Malaysian universities to their academic staff to undertake PhD training at the University of Melbourne. These scholarships are in addition to the regular full-time scholarships for overseas study offered by the MOHE through Malaysian public universities.  The Split PhD scholarship enables the scholarship recipients to undertake the three year full-time University of Melbourne PhD degree over four years and candidates are expected to split their PhD study equally between The University of Melbourne and their respective Malaysian university.\n\nThe following seven Malaysian universities have been selected by the Malaysian Government to be involved in the Split-PhD and research collaboration initiative with the University of Melbourne:\n* Universiti Malaya (UM)\n* Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)\n* Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)\n* International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS)\n* Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) <ref name=\"http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705235816/http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |archive-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==University Agriculture Park==\nUniversity Agriculture Park (TPU)<ref>{{cite web|title=University Agriculture Park (TPU)|url=http://www.tpu.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established on 1 December 2001 to facilitate in the teaching and research in agriculture related fields and also provide services for the students, staffs and the community.\n\nUniversity Agriculture Park was originally established as the Farm Division, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia in 1971 with its function then was to provide students with agriculture practical training and to give services to the campus community.\n\nIn 1998, Farm Division was restructured to become University Research Park, Universiti Putra Malaysia to facilitated research and services in agriculture.\n\n[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 01.jpg|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 02.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 03.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]\n\n== Ayer Hitam UPM Research Forest ==\nThe research forest is at the Ayer Hitam Reserved Forest, Puchong, with a space of 1,248 hectares. The forest is 20&nbsp;km from the capital city Kuala Lumpur and 10&nbsp;km from the main campus of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Serdang. The Selangor State Government gave the research forest in a long term agreement for 80 years beginning 1996 for the purpose of education and research. The forest is managed by the Selangor Forestry Department and Faculty of Forestry UPM  based on sustainable forest management. The Forest Management Plan for Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve is prepared by the faculty.\n\nThe forest area is the only well-managed Lowland Dipterocarp Forest in the Klang Valley. The facilities include a partially enclosed multipurpose hall, prayer room, kitchen, bathrooms, toilets and a playing field. The base camp can accommodate around 100 to 150 person at a time.\n\nThe forest is also used for teaching purposes in the field of forestry, wood science, and park and recreation management. There are field plots for research activities in silviculture, wildlife management, forest ecology, forest survey, forest engineering, and hydrology. The extension programmes include forestry, science, motivation, interpretation and ecological camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728104810/http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|archive-date=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== UPM \u2013 Mitsubishi Corporation Forest Restoration Project ==\nThe Joint Research Project on Rehabilitation of Tropical Rainforest Ecosystem was initiated in July 1991 by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and [[Yokohama National University]], Japan (YNU) with sponsorship from [[Mitsubishi Corporation]]. The project is based on the success of restoration of native forest land in Japan and results of some field surveys conducted in the forests of South East Asian countries since 1978. The scientific basis of the project is based on the concept of vegetation association by Prof. Akira Miyawaki from Yokohama National University.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to assess the health of rehabilitated forest through measuring the indicators of forest health and the sustainability of forest resources. The project conducts research in soil science, plant physiology, water science, biodiversity (terrestrial floral, wildlife, aquatic flora and fauna, insect and microbes) and in microclimatic conditions that indicate the health of the rehabilitated forest.\n\nThe project was initiated in UPM Bintulu campus Sarawak (Phase 1) at a 47.5 ha site. In 2010, 350,000 seedlings were planted representing 128 species native to Sarawak. In addition, 100 research plots were established in the rehabilitated area.\n\nIn July 2008, a new agreement between UPM and Mitsubishi Corporation was signed to establish a model planted forest of indigenous tree species in an urban setting at UPM main campus Serdang, Selangor. The second phase of the project was launched on 26 November 2008 covering an area of 27 hectares. To date 1,350,000 seedlings representing 136 species have been planted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=17 March 2012|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801095712/http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|archive-date=1 August 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Logo ==\n[[File:Official Logo of Universiti Putra Malaysia.png|thumb|Logo UPM]]\nThe logo is simple, yet eloquent. It embodies the tradition, philosophy and vision of the university.\n\nThe design of the logo is based on the shape of a shield, which traditionally symbolises strong principles, stability and preservation of knowledge for the good of mankind.\n\nThe water droplet symbolises the commitment of the university in preserving the environment. Water is also fundamental in life, as is knowledge in human development.\n\nThe thin lines represent electronic circuits, which symbolise the university's sophisticated approach in the era of information and knowledge. The three lines on the left and right are the symbols of branches, which depict the importance of agriculture. These lines also represent the three main functions of the university, which are teaching, research and services.\n\nIn addition, these lines symbolise the setting up of UPM with its three pioneering faculties: Agriculture, Forestry, and Veterinary and Animal Science.\n\nThe colour red symbolises the quest for knowledge. It also symbolises the pioneering spirit, courage and persistence in confronting challenges.

It was formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia or the Agricultural University of Malaysia. Now, UPM offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in most fields such as science, engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine, business and social science.\n\nIt was ranked as the 159th best university in the world in 2020 by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM QS World Ranking|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> and it was ranked 34th in Best Asian Universities and the 2nd best university in Malaysia.\n\n== History ==\nThe School of Agriculture was officially instituted on 21 May 1931 by John Scott,<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/?aktvt=content&kat=D&kod=20060424114103210172165493|title=UPM History|date=1 October 2007|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=25 June 2008}}</ref> an administrative officer of the British colonial [[Straits Settlements]]. The school was on a 22-acre piece of land in Serdang and offered two programmes: a three-year diploma programme and a one-year certificate course in Agriculture.\n\nIn 1947, the school was declared the College of Agriculture Malaya by Sir [[Edward Gent]], the then Governor of the Malayan Union. The establishment of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia came about when the College of Agriculture in Serdang merged with the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Malaya. Dr. Mohd. Rashdan bin Haji Baba, the then principal of the College of Agriculture Malaya, was appointed as the first vice-chancellor by virtue of the provisions of Section 18 of the Universities and University Colleges Act, 1971. With the first intake of 1,559 students, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia had its first academic session in July 1973 in the three central faculties and one basic division: the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Forestry, Faculty of Agriculture, and a Division of Foundation Studies.\n\nIn the early 80s, UPM extended its area of studies to include the field of Science and Technology (S&T). In 1997, the name Universiti Pertanian Malaysia was changed to Universiti Putra Malaysia by Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, as a strategic gesture to portray the status of UPM as a centre of higher education capable of providing fields of studies, especially in science and information technology, which facilitate national development in the new millennium.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPM History|url=http://www.upm.edu.my/about_us/TheStoryBehindUPM?LANG=en|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe list of the vice-chancellor of Universiti Putra Malaysia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Vice-Chancellor'''\n!'''Academic Qualification'''\n!'''Term in office'''\n|-\n| '''1''' Professor Tan Sri Datuk Dr. [[Mohd Rashdan Baba]]\n| Diploma of Agriculture(Malaya Agriculture College), Bachelor of Agriculture Science(Reading, UK), PhD in Agriculture Science(Leeds, UK).\n| 4th November 1971\u201328th February 1982\n|-\n| '''2''' Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Nayan Ariffin]]\n| \n| 1st March 1982\u20134th June 1994\n|-\n| '''3''' Professor Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. [[Syed Jalaluddin Syed Salim]]\n|\n| 5th June 1994-17th April 2001\n|-\n| '''4''' Professor Dato\u2019 Ir.

It was established in response to the needs for competent professionals in the fields of agribusiness and resource economics.\n\nEver since its inception, FEP has grown in student intake, number of academic programs offered, research activities, and professional services. This is the first faculty in Malaysia gaining AACSB status. This accreditation is awarded to the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP) and Putra Business School or PBS (formerly known as the Graduate School of Management or GSM).\n\nThe achievement of UPM and seven other international universities was announced by the President and Chief Executive Officer of AACSB International, John J. Fernandes at Tampa, Florida via www.aacsb.edu recently.\n\nTo cater to the education needs of working adults, FEP established Executive Program Unit (UPE) in 1997 by offering part-time programs to candidates with working experience in the public or private sector. This program has thus expanded through collaboration with Malaysian Airlines (MAS) Academy in 2000.\n\nThe same year, FEP established External Program Unit and Distance Learning Unit in 2001.\n\nFEP offers three bachelor-level programs: Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Economics and Bachelor of Business Administration. At the graduate level, FEP offers Masters of Economics, Masters of Science and PhD in Economics.\n\nFaculty of Economics and Management comprises three main departments:\n\n# Department of Economics\n# Department of Management and Marketing\n# Department of Accounting and Finance\n\n===Faculty of Engineering===\n\nThe Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Engineering|url=http://www.eng.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> of Universiti Putra Malaysia was established on 1 January 1975 at the main Serdang Campus, some 22 kilometres to the south of Kuala Lumpur. It is one of the largest faculties at UPM with a student population of over 3000. The campus\u2019 location at the heart of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) provides the faculty with access to the array of IT and multimedia facilities available in the Corridor.\n\nThe eight academic departments housed in the faculty offer a similar number of Bachelor of Engineering degree programs. Out of 800 postgraduates, almost 50% are international students. In addition to providing facilities and opportunities for teaching and research, the faculty has established Research Centres in engineering and related fields.\n\nThe \"Centres of Excellence\" organise research and development programs, consultancy and professional training using expertise from disciplines in the university. The objective is to secure contracts from the public or private sectors to generate income for the faculty. Centers of Excellence have been established as listed below.\n* Road Safety Research Center (RSRC)\n* Housing Research Center (HRC)\n* Mountainous Terrain Development Research Center (MTDRC)\n* Centre of Excellence for Wireless and Photonic Network (WiPNET)\n* Centre of Excellence on Lightning Protection (CELP)\n\nThe Eighth Malaysia Plan ended in 2005 and, during its duration, most of the approved research projects were completed. Under the Ninth Malaysia Plan, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation offers three research grants: Technofund, Innofund, and Sciencefund.  In addition, the Ministry of Higher Education initiated the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme and UPM offers the Research University Grant Scheme.\n\nFaculty of Engineering comprises eight main departments:\n\n# Aerospace\n# Biological and Agricultural\n# Civil\n# Electric and Electronic\n# Chemical and Environment\n# Computer and Communication Systems\n# Mechanical and Manufacturing\n# Process and Food.\n\n===Faculty of Educational Studies===\n\nThe Faculty of Educational Studies<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Educational Studies|url=http://www.educ.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> serves to produce teachers who can teach at the secondary school level as well as professionals who are responsible for human resource development. At present, the faculty offers Bachelor of Education degrees in Agricultural Science, Home Science, Physical Education, the Teaching of Bahasa Malaysia as the First Language, the Teaching of English as a Second Language, Guidance and Counselling as well as Information Technology.\n\nFaculty of Educational Studies has six main departments:\n\n# Department of Foundations of Education\n# Department of Sport Studies\n# Department of Science and Technical Education\n# Department of Language and Humanities Education\n# Department of Professional Development and Continuing Education\n# Department of Counselor Education and Counseling Psychology\n\n===Faculty of Science===\n\nThe Faculty of Science<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Science|url=http://www.escience.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established as the Division of Basic Sciences in 1972. Its objective was to offer basic science courses required by other faculties in the university. In 1975, the status of the division was upgraded to a faculty and named the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies.\n\nSince then the faculty has set up the Department of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Computer Sciences which later were upgraded to form two new faculties and the transfer of the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology to the newly formed Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences. Ever since the restructuring, it was renamed as the Faculty of Science in 2004.\n\nFaculty of Science comprises four main departments and one centre:\n\n# Department of Biology\n# Department of Physics\n# Department of Chemistry\n# Department of Mathematics\n# Catalysis Science and Technology Research Centre (PutraCAT)\n\n===Faculty of Food Science and Technology===\n\nThe Faculty of Food Science and Technology<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Food Science and Technology|url=http://www.food.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> had its humble beginnings in 1976 with the establishment of the Department of Food Science and Technology under the Faculty of Agriculture. The establishment of the department is in line with the need of the country to fulfill the shortage of skilled employees in the field of science-based food. At that time, only one undergraduate program was offered: Bachelor of Food Science and Technology.\n\nOn 1 March 1982, the Department of Food Science and Technology was upgraded to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology. There were two departments under the faculty: Department of Food Technology and Department of Food Science. In 1986, the Faculty was renamed Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology (FSMB) with the establishment of the Department of Biotechnology that offered the Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) program with six modules: Plant Biotechnology, Molecular Biotechnology, Food Biotechnology, Industrial Biotechnology, Environmental Biotechnology, and Management.\n\nIn 1996, the faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Studies) program with two options: Food Quality Management and Food Management. In 1997 and 2000, the Food Service Administration and Food Marketing options were offered through the same program. On 1 August 2004, the faculty was renamed to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology when the Department of Biotechnology formed a separate faculty. In January 2005, the Department of Food Service and Management was established to strengthen the existing programs in the faculty. The faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Service Management) and Master of Food Technology in September 2012.\n\nFaculty of Food Science and Technology comprises three main departments:\n\n# Department of Food Science\n# Department of Food Technology\n# Department of Food Service and Management\n\n===Faculty of Human Ecology===\n\nThe Faculty of Human Ecology<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Human Ecology|url=http://www.eco1.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was officially established on 1 April {{Year missing|date=August 2017}} through the merger of the Department of Human Development Studies from the Faculty of Agriculture with the Department of Social Sciences from the Faculty of Educational Studies.

Both units were combined to form the Language Division in 1971 which was subsequently upgraded into the Language Department in 1972 and was placed under the Faculty of Agriculture.\n\nOn 15 January 1975, the Language Department was placed in the Faculty of Educational Studies. On 4 January 1995, the Language Department was upgraded to the Faculty of Language Studies. On 1 January 1999, the Department of Development Communication (which was in the Faculty of Human Ecology) was transferred to the Faculty of Modern Languages as the Department of Communication. With this restructuring, the Faculty of Language Studies was renamed as the Faculty of Modern Languages and Communication (FBMK).\n\nCurrently, Faculty of Modern Languages & Communication comprises four main departments:\n\n# Department of Malay Language and Linguistics\n# Department of English Language\n# Department of Foreign Languages\n# Department of Communication\n\n===Faculty of Design & Architecture===\n\nThe idea to establish the Faculty of Design and Architecture<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Design & Architecture|url=http://www.frsb.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> in UPM originated with a proposal paper titled \"Proposed Establishment of the Faculty of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture.\" It was submitted to the Faculty Agriculture in 1976. However, the proposal was never brought up for further consideration by the Faculty's administration. Nevertheless, a group of teaching staff in Landscape Architecture was recruited in 1980 to teach \"landscape subjects\" in the diploma and bachelor of agriculture programmes.\n\nThe first landscape course was offered in 1984. It was a three-credit course titled \"AGRO 472 \u2013 An Approach to Landscape Design\". It became popular and managed to attract many agricultural students who later graduated and continued their studies in landscape architecture at the undergraduate and graduate level overseas. Many of these early graduates have since returned and assumed successful practice or became professors at institutions of higher learning.\n\nIn 1991, the Faculty of Engineering, UPM proposed to offer the Architecture programme in UPM. However, the idea never materialised until the Faculty of Agriculture was given the task by the university's management to look into the feasibility of offering landscape architecture and architecture in UPM. A committee was formed in the Faculty of Agriculture 1994 and in 1995 a report was sent to the vice-chancellor proposing the setting up of a new faculty offering courses in design and the creative arts. With the strong support of the university's management the Faculty of Design and Architecture was approved by the University's Senate, Board of Directors and the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe new faculty was officially established on 26 June 1996 and began its operation with the offering of the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture programmes under the new Department of Landscape Architecture. Subsequently, the Department of Architecture was established in 1999 and the Department of Industrial Design in 2002. The faculty began with an enrolment of 40 students. Today, it has expanded rapidly offering five programmes with an enrolment of more than 400 students at the undergraduate, master and doctoral levels.\n\nFaculty of Design and Architecture comprises three main departments:\n\n# Landscape Architecture Department\n# Industrial Design Department\n# Architecture Department\n\n===Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences===\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences|url=http://www.medic.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established on 1 August 1996 as a result of the merger between the Department of Biomedical of the Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Science with Nutrition and Community Health Department of the Faculty Human Ecology.

This establishment has submitted proposals to the management of the University in 2003 and was approved at the Management Committee Meeting University 110th on 26 and 31 March 2003. However, the establishment of this institute can not be implemented because of financial problems the university at the time. Therefore, Faculty of Food Science and Technology has taken the initiative to establish the Halal Food Unit in June 2003.\n\nIn August 2004, the Halal Food Unit in collaboration with Yayasan Dakwah Islamiah Malaysia (YADIM) has organised a \"Workshop on Global Halal Hub Development Malaysia\" in conjunction with the 1st Malaysian International Halal Showcase (Mihas) 2004. Resolution of the workshop titled \"Proposed Development of Halal Food Hub Global Malaysia\" was presented to the Honorable Prime Minister of Malaysia by Y.Bhg. Vice-Chancellor of the university in the opening MIHAS 2004 on 16 August 2004. Following this development, the Ministry of Higher Education has approved and agreed that UPM lead the national agricultural education center on 30 August 2004. To support this initiative, UPM has proposed the establishment of Halal Food Institute and has received approval from the Ministry of Higher Education on 1 June 2005. this initiative was implemented to help Malaysia to realise the aspiration to emerge as a global hub for halal food.\n\nFollowing the change in administration policy UPM, several workshops were held to address the future direction related issues RMK9 and strengthen the position of UPM as a research university. To enhance research excellence, UPM has held workshops directions from 25\u201327 May 2006 and has established eight universities and research focus areas Halal products have been placed as one of the focus areas.\n\nThus, on 1 July 2006, after UPM implement changes Basically, the name Halal Food Institute (IMH) was converted to Halal Products Research Institute (IPPH).<ref>{{cite web|title=Halal Product Research Institute (IPPH)|url=http://www.halal.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> This amendment is to broaden the scope of research IPPH beyond the scope of food and put some new research scope of consumables Muslims and Islamic business.

The establishment of this institute was the outcome of the restructuring and rationalisation process of institutes, academy, and centres in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). This rationalisation process was implemented as a proactive and integrated effort taken to strengthen UPM status as a Research University (RU) and to become the center of excellence in agriculture education in Malaysia.\n\nIn line with UPM mission to have an efficient and effective administration structure via the lean and mean concept, the University has identified six new research clusters: Agriculture, Food, Forestry and Environment, Health, Social Science and Science, and Engineering and Technology to enhance research activities in UPM. In addition, UPM has identified eight specific research thrusts for each cluster, in line with the government's emphasis on the country's agriculture development agenda.\n\nThree of the eight identified thrusts \u2014 Food Crops, Plantation Crops and Animal Production \u2014 will be ITA's research focus.\n\n==Schools==\n\n===School Of Graduate Studies===\n\nThe School of Graduate Studies (SGS)<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Graduate Studies (SGS)|url=http://www.sgs.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> is a service and administrative centre established to assist postgraduate students in the processes involved from their registration at UPM up to the completion of their studies. SGS is the core support system which helps ease and enhance the postgraduate experience for UPM students, and plays a crucial role in fostering the relationship between UPM and its graduates.\n\nInitially set up as a Graduate Study Unit in 1978, SGS then proceeded to become a fully functioning Graduate School Office (GSO) in February 1993, to serve the growing population of postgraduate students at UPM. In March 2002, it continued to flourish as it was officially renamed the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) and was established as a service centre which had a status equivalent to a faculty at the university. This entailed its bigger role in the co-ordination of all postgraduate programmes and activities at UPM.\n\nIn its original inception, its key role also included an active involvement in research and development in postgraduate studies. In other words, SGS was conceptualised not only as a service centre to facilitate the general running of matters related to postgraduate students, but it was deemed to play a more active and crucial role in bolstering UPM's status as a research university.\n\nAmong its main roles as stated in the 1992 proposal for its establishment are:\n* To cultivate and nurture a research culture through efficient and effective management of postgraduate research activities\n* To help the university produce graduates who are knowledgeable and skilled to meet the nation's needs\n* To improve the quality of postgraduate programmes and therefore reduce the need for overseas postgraduate training\n* To increase the international student population and contribute to UPM's internationalisation through the intensification of publication and research training for staff.\n\n===Putra Business School===\n\nPutra Business School<ref>{{cite web|title=Putra Business School|url=http://putrabusinessschool.edu.my/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> \u2013 formerly the Graduate School of Management, in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang.\n\nPUTRA became the first business programme in Malaysia to receive accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

The University of Melbourne is the only Australian university invited to participate in this initiative.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, Split PhD scholarships are being offered by the Malaysian universities to their academic staff to undertake PhD training at the University of Melbourne. These scholarships are in addition to the regular full-time scholarships for overseas study offered by the MOHE through Malaysian public universities.  The Split PhD scholarship enables the scholarship recipients to undertake the three year full-time University of Melbourne PhD degree over four years and candidates are expected to split their PhD study equally between The University of Melbourne and their respective Malaysian university.\n\nThe following seven Malaysian universities have been selected by the Malaysian Government to be involved in the Split-PhD and research collaboration initiative with the University of Melbourne:\n* Universiti Malaya (UM)\n* Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)\n* Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)\n* International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS)\n* Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS)\n* Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) <ref name=\"http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705235816/http://www.gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/future/splitphd.html |archive-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==University Agriculture Park==\nUniversity Agriculture Park (TPU)<ref>{{cite web|title=University Agriculture Park (TPU)|url=http://www.tpu.upm.edu.my/?LANG=en&uri=/|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> was established on 1 December 2001 to facilitate in the teaching and research in agriculture related fields and also provide services for the students, staffs and the community.\n\nUniversity Agriculture Park was originally established as the Farm Division, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia in 1971 with its function then was to provide students with agriculture practical training and to give services to the campus community.\n\nIn 1998, Farm Division was restructured to become University Research Park, Universiti Putra Malaysia to facilitated research and services in agriculture.\n\n[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 01.jpg|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 02.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]<br />[[File:Universiti Putra Malaysia 03.JPG|thumb|University Agriculture Park]]\n\n== Ayer Hitam UPM Research Forest ==\nThe research forest is at the Ayer Hitam Reserved Forest, Puchong, with a space of 1,248 hectares.

The Selangor State Government gave the research forest in a long term agreement for 80 years beginning 1996 for the purpose of education and research. The forest is managed by the Selangor Forestry Department and Faculty of Forestry UPM  based on sustainable forest management. The Forest Management Plan for Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve is prepared by the faculty.\n\nThe forest area is the only well-managed Lowland Dipterocarp Forest in the Klang Valley. The facilities include a partially enclosed multipurpose hall, prayer room, kitchen, bathrooms, toilets and a playing field. The base camp can accommodate around 100 to 150 person at a time.\n\nThe forest is also used for teaching purposes in the field of forestry, wood science, and park and recreation management. There are field plots for research activities in silviculture, wildlife management, forest ecology, forest survey, forest engineering, and hydrology. The extension programmes include forestry, science, motivation, interpretation and ecological camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=18 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728104810/http://www.forr.upm.edu.my/eng/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=187|archive-date=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== UPM \u2013 Mitsubishi Corporation Forest Restoration Project ==\nThe Joint Research Project on Rehabilitation of Tropical Rainforest Ecosystem was initiated in July 1991 by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and [[Yokohama National University]], Japan (YNU) with sponsorship from [[Mitsubishi Corporation]]. The project is based on the success of restoration of native forest land in Japan and results of some field surveys conducted in the forests of South East Asian countries since 1978. The scientific basis of the project is based on the concept of vegetation association by Prof. Akira Miyawaki from Yokohama National University.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to assess the health of rehabilitated forest through measuring the indicators of forest health and the sustainability of forest resources. The project conducts research in soil science, plant physiology, water science, biodiversity (terrestrial floral, wildlife, aquatic flora and fauna, insect and microbes) and in microclimatic conditions that indicate the health of the rehabilitated forest.\n\nThe project was initiated in UPM Bintulu campus Sarawak (Phase 1) at a 47.5 ha site. In 2010, 350,000 seedlings were planted representing 128 species native to Sarawak. In addition, 100 research plots were established in the rehabilitated area.\n\nIn July 2008, a new agreement between UPM and Mitsubishi Corporation was signed to establish a model planted forest of indigenous tree species in an urban setting at UPM main campus Serdang, Selangor. The second phase of the project was launched on 26 November 2008 covering an area of 27 hectares. To date 1,350,000 seedlings representing 136 species have been planted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|title=Faculty of Forestry|date=17 March 2012|publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia|accessdate=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801095712/http://www.forr2.upm.edu.my/frp/index.php|archive-date=1 August 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Logo ==\n[[File:Official Logo of Universiti Putra Malaysia.png|thumb|Logo UPM]]\nThe logo is simple, yet eloquent. It embodies the tradition, philosophy and vision of the university.\n\nThe design of the logo is based on the shape of a shield, which traditionally symbolises strong principles, stability and preservation of knowledge for the good of mankind.\n\nThe water droplet symbolises the commitment of the university in preserving the environment. Water is also fundamental in life, as is knowledge in human development.\n\nThe thin lines represent electronic circuits, which symbolise the university's sophisticated approach in the era of information and knowledge. The three lines on the left and right are the symbols of branches, which depict the importance of agriculture. These lines also represent the three main functions of the university, which are teaching, research and services.\n\nIn addition, these lines symbolise the setting up of UPM with its three pioneering faculties: Agriculture, Forestry, and Veterinary and Animal Science.\n\nThe colour red symbolises the quest for knowledge. It also symbolises the pioneering spirit, courage and persistence in confronting challenges. The colour grey symbolises information technology, neutrality, versatility and consistency.\n\nThe combination of these colours represents harmony, stability, happiness, maturity and dynamics.\n\n==Rankings==\n\n===Quacquarelli Symonds===\n\n{| width=90% class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=8%  | Year\n! width=8% | Rank\n! width=25% | Valuer\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2012||align=\"center\"|360||align=\"center\" rowspan=\"8\" |  [[QS World University Rankings]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2014||align=\"center\"|411\u2014420\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2015||align=\"center\"|376\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2016||align=\"center\"|=331\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2017||align=\"center\"|270\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2018||align=\"center\"|229\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2019||align=\"center\"|202\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|2020||align=\"center\"|159\n|}\n\n===UI-Greenmetric===\n\nIn 2019, Universiti Putra Malaysia is ranked 28th in the world.

It has also been used to denote a chief or leader of a tribe or group. It is used as a Persian synonym of the Arabic title ''[[Emir]]''.\n\nThe term and its cognates originate from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''sard\u0101r'' ({{lang|fa|[[wikt:\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631|\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631]]}}) and have been historically used across [[Islamic Persia|Persia]] ([[Iran]]), [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]] (as \"[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]\"), [[Mesopotamia]] (now [[Iraq]]), [[Syria]], [[South Asia]] ([[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]), the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Egypt]] (as \"[[Sirdar]]\").<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Sirdar |volume=25 |page=154}}</ref>\n\nThe term was widely used by [[Maratha]] nobility, who held important positions in various [[List of Maratha dynasties and states|Maratha States]] of the imperial [[Maratha Empire]].\n\nAfter the decline of [[feudalism]], ''Sardar'' later indicated a [[Head of State]], a [[Commander-in-chief]], and an Army [[military rank]]. As a military rank, a ''Sardar'' typically marked the [[Commander-in-Chief]] or the highest-ranking [[military officer]] in an Army, akin to the modern [[Field Marshal]], [[General of the Army]] or [[Chief of Army (disambiguation)|Chief of Army]]. The more administrative title ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor-General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote province, akin to a British [[Viceroy]].\n\nIn [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[mountaineering]], a ''Sirdar'' is a local leader of the [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Sayre  | first = Woodrow Wilson | title = Four Against Everest  | url = https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr  | url-access = registration  | publisher = Prentice-Hall | year = 1964  | location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA  | id = Library of Congress Catalog Card No: 64-15208  | page = [https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr/page/223 223] }}</ref> Among other duties, he records the heights reached by the individual Sherpas, which factors into their compensation.

Recipients enjoyed the titles of ''Sardar-i-Ala'' or ''Sardar-i-Ali'' before their names and also received grants of land. The original Order was disbanded in 1929, and was later revived by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Muhammad Zahir Shah]].\n* In [[Ottoman Turkey]], Serdar was a rank in Montenegro and Serbia. Serdar was also used in the [[Principality of Montenegro]] and the [[Principality of Serbia]] as an honorary \"title\" below that of [[Voivode|Vojvoda]]. For example, [[Janko Vukoti\u0107]] who was a military leader and former prime minister of Montenegro with title of ''Serdar''. However, this were not noble titles as there was no nobility in Serbia and Montenegro and no hereditary titles apart from those borne by members of the reigning families of both countries.\n* In [[Persia]], ''Sardar-i-Bozorg'' was the title of both [[Hossein Khan Sardar]] and his brother Hasan Khan Qajar. Both were uncles of [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Khan Qajar]], the King-Emperor of Persia and the Commander-in-chief under Emperor [[Fat\u2032h-Ali Shah Qajar]] in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Russo-Persian Wars of 1804]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u20131828)|1826]].\n* The early [[feudal]] [[Maratha Empire]] prior to [[Peshwa]] administration (1674\u20131749) used the title ''Sardar'' to identify an imperial court [[Minister (government)|minister]] with military and diplomatic functions. If granted land (''[[jagir]]''), the title ''Sardar'' also marked a [[feudal superior]] responsible for administration, defense and taxing of the granted territory (equivalent to the European title [[Count]], from the French ''comte'' meaning the \"companion\" or delegate to the [[Emperor]] that administered a [[county]]). These ''Sardars'' of the early [[Maratha Empire]] were [[life peers]]; the title was not hereditary.\n* If the ''Sardar'' was appointed to [[Commander-in-Chief]] of all [[Maratha]] forces, the style ''[[Senapati]]'' was used in combination (e.g., ''Sardar Senapati'' or ''Sarsenapati'' Khanderao Yesajirao [[Dabhade]]. The title [[Senapati]] is a [[primogeniture]] hereditary title, as is evidenced by the current ''[[Senapati]]'' Shrimant Sardar Padmasenraje [[Dabhade]] of [[Talegaon Dabhade]].\n* In the [[Maratha Empire]], the more administrative role of ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote [[province]]; this best equates to a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ''[[Subahdar]]'' or British [[Viceroy]] in function and rank.\n* The title ''Sirdar'' was used by Englishmen to describe native noblemen in [[British India]] (e.g., ''Sirdars'' of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]).\n\n==Aristocrats==\n* In the [[Hazara Division]] of Pakistan, the word ''Sardar'' is used by the [[Karlal]] tribe before their names, traditionally, to stress their upper-caste status, e.g., ''Sardar'' Muhammad Aslam, ''Sardar'' Haider Zaman etc.\n*In the small district of [[Sudhanoti]], [[Kashmir]], ''Sardar'' is used by the hybrid [[Sudhan]] tribe to refer to their putative part-descent from the [[Sadduzai]] clan of King [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].  Also, Poonch families in this region use ''Sardar'' at the beginning of their names.\n* Similarly ''Sardar'' is used by [[Khattar (tribe)|Khattar]] tribe noble men, native to the districts of [[Attock]] and adjacent areas of [[Rawalpindi]]. \n*''Sardar'' was used for important political, tribal, military and religious officers rankings by the [[Sikh]]s during the period of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] and this title was borrowed from Muslims.\n\n==Head of state==\n* In Persian, ''Sardar i-Azam'' was occasionally used as an alternative title for the [[Shahanshah]]'s Head of government, normally styled ''[[Vazir i-Azam]]'', notably in 1904-06 for a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] prince, Prince [[Major General]] [[Abdol Majid Mirza]].\n* [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister of India was referred to as Sardar Patel; he is also now known as the \"Iron Man of India\".\n* ''Sadr-e-Riyasat'' was the title of one Constitutional [[Head of State]] of the princely state of [[Kashmir]], Yuvaraj Shri Karan Singhji Bahadur, who was appointed as Heir Apparent in 1931. After his father had acceded to India, ending the sovereign Monarchy, Regent in 1949 to 1956. ''Sardar-i-Riyasat'' 1956 to 1965 (succeeded on the death of his father as Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1961, no longer carrying any hereditary power), next Governor of the Indian constitutive State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] 1965 to 1967.\n* [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], the authoritarian ruler of [[Turkmenistan]] in 1990\u20142006, carried a few glorifying titles, one of which was ''Serdar'' (\u201cLeader\u201d).<ref>{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Sally N.|date=2010|title= Symbolism and Power in Central Asia: Politics of the Spectacular|url=|location=Milton, United Kingdom|publisher=Routledge|pages=91-92|isbn= 978-0415575676}}</ref>\n\n==Military title==\n[[File:A Sikh sardar.jpg|right|thumb|A Sikh sardar]]\n[[File:Bhakti Thapa Sardar.jpg|thumb|[[Bhakti Thapa]] - a [[Gorkhali]] Sardar]]\n* The later [[Maratha Empire]] under [[Peshwa]] administration (1749\u20131818) used the title ''Sardar'' to denote a [[Field Marshal]] or [[General of the Army]].\n* ''[[Sirdar (Egypt)|Sirdar]]'' was the official title of the British [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Anglo-Egyptian army.<ref name=EB1911/>\n* The title ''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]'' is also common amongst [[Ottomans]] in referring to a Commander-in-Chief.

It has also been used to denote a chief or leader of a tribe or group. It is used as a Persian synonym of the Arabic title ''[[Emir]]''.\n\nThe term and its cognates originate from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''sard\u0101r'' ({{lang|fa|[[wikt:\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631|\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631]]}}) and have been historically used across [[Islamic Persia|Persia]] ([[Iran]]), [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]] (as \"[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]\"), [[Mesopotamia]] (now [[Iraq]]), [[Syria]], [[South Asia]] ([[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]), the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Egypt]] (as \"[[Sirdar]]\").<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Sirdar |volume=25 |page=154}}</ref>\n\nThe term was widely used by [[Maratha]] nobility, who held important positions in various [[List of Maratha dynasties and states|Maratha States]] of the imperial [[Maratha Empire]].\n\nAfter the decline of [[feudalism]], ''Sardar'' later indicated a [[Head of State]], a [[Commander-in-chief]], and an Army [[military rank]]. As a military rank, a ''Sardar'' typically marked the [[Commander-in-Chief]] or the highest-ranking [[military officer]] in an Army, akin to the modern [[Field Marshal]], [[General of the Army]] or [[Chief of Army (disambiguation)|Chief of Army]]. The more administrative title ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor-General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote province, akin to a British [[Viceroy]].\n\nIn [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[mountaineering]], a ''Sirdar'' is a local leader of the [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Sayre  | first = Woodrow Wilson | title = Four Against Everest  | url = https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr  | url-access = registration  | publisher = Prentice-Hall | year = 1964  | location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA  | id = Library of Congress Catalog Card No: 64-15208  | page = [https://archive.org/details/fouragainstevere00sayr/page/223 223] }}</ref> Among other duties, he records the heights reached by the individual Sherpas, which factors into their compensation.

Recipients enjoyed the titles of ''Sardar-i-Ala'' or ''Sardar-i-Ali'' before their names and also received grants of land. The original Order was disbanded in 1929, and was later revived by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Muhammad Zahir Shah]].\n* In [[Ottoman Turkey]], Serdar was a rank in Montenegro and Serbia. Serdar was also used in the [[Principality of Montenegro]] and the [[Principality of Serbia]] as an honorary \"title\" below that of [[Voivode|Vojvoda]]. For example, [[Janko Vukoti\u0107]] who was a military leader and former prime minister of Montenegro with title of ''Serdar''. However, this were not noble titles as there was no nobility in Serbia and Montenegro and no hereditary titles apart from those borne by members of the reigning families of both countries.\n* In [[Persia]], ''Sardar-i-Bozorg'' was the title of both [[Hossein Khan Sardar]] and his brother Hasan Khan Qajar. Both were uncles of [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Khan Qajar]], the King-Emperor of Persia and the Commander-in-chief under Emperor [[Fat\u2032h-Ali Shah Qajar]] in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u20131813)|Russo-Persian Wars of 1804]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u20131828)|1826]].\n* The early [[feudal]] [[Maratha Empire]] prior to [[Peshwa]] administration (1674\u20131749) used the title ''Sardar'' to identify an imperial court [[Minister (government)|minister]] with military and diplomatic functions. If granted land (''[[jagir]]''), the title ''Sardar'' also marked a [[feudal superior]] responsible for administration, defense and taxing of the granted territory (equivalent to the European title [[Count]], from the French ''comte'' meaning the \"companion\" or delegate to the [[Emperor]] that administered a [[county]]). These ''Sardars'' of the early [[Maratha Empire]] were [[life peers]]; the title was not hereditary.\n* If the ''Sardar'' was appointed to [[Commander-in-Chief]] of all [[Maratha]] forces, the style ''[[Senapati]]'' was used in combination (e.g., ''Sardar Senapati'' or ''Sarsenapati'' Khanderao Yesajirao [[Dabhade]]. The title [[Senapati]] is a [[primogeniture]] hereditary title, as is evidenced by the current ''[[Senapati]]'' Shrimant Sardar Padmasenraje [[Dabhade]] of [[Talegaon Dabhade]].\n* In the [[Maratha Empire]], the more administrative role of ''Sirdar-Bahadur'' denoted a [[Governor General]] or [[Chief Minister]] of a remote [[province]]; this best equates to a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ''[[Subahdar]]'' or British [[Viceroy]] in function and rank.\n* The title ''Sirdar'' was used by Englishmen to describe native noblemen in [[British India]] (e.g., ''Sirdars'' of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]).\n\n==Aristocrats==\n* In the [[Hazara Division]] of Pakistan, the word ''Sardar'' is used by the [[Karlal]] tribe before their names, traditionally, to stress their upper-caste status, e.g., ''Sardar'' Muhammad Aslam, ''Sardar'' Haider Zaman etc.\n*In the small district of [[Sudhanoti]], [[Kashmir]], ''Sardar'' is used by the hybrid [[Sudhan]] tribe to refer to their putative part-descent from the [[Sadduzai]] clan of King [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].

He was referred to by Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]] as the \"greatest Jewish leader of ''Zarfat'' ([[Medieval Hebrew]] for France, a reference to [[Charlemagne]]'s rule of Germany)\" alive at the time.\n\n==Biography==\n\nRabbi Meir was born between 1215 and 1220 in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. He came from a long line of rabbis. His first teacher was his father. He continued his training in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] under [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] and in [[France]], where he remained until 1242, his teachers being [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise]], and [[Samuel of \u00c9vreux]], witnessing the [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|burning of the Talmud]] on June 17, 1244, in [[Paris]]. He then settled in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], opening a [[yeshiva]] in his house. After the death of his father in 1281, he settled in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. In 1286, King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] instituted a new political status for the Jewish community, declaring them ''servi camerae'' (\"serfs of the treasury\"), allowing direct royal taxation of the Jewish community. Since Rudolf did not prohibit local nobles from also taxing the Jews, the burden on the communities could be devastating. Along with many others, Meir left Germany with family and followers, but was captured in the mountains of [[Lombardy]] having been recognized by a baptized Jew named Kneppe,  and imprisoned in a fortress near [[Ensisheim]] in [[Alsace]]. Tradition has it that a large ransom of 23,000 [[Mark (weight)|marks]] silver was raised for him (by [[Asher ben Jehiel|the Rosh]]), but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis.  He ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McManus|first1=Shani|title=Responding to terror explored|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/palm/fl-jjpn-school-0715-20150713-story.html|agency=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=July 13, 2015|quote=The Jewish people have experienced similar situations throughout our arduous history,\" Rabbi Zalman Abraham of JLI headquarters in New York noted. \"When Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg was imprisoned for ransom in the Middle Ages, he ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.\"}}</ref> He died in prison after seven years.

His disciple the Rosh (Rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]]) codified much of his teaching.\n\n*His ''responsa'' are of great importance to advanced students of the Talmud, as well as to students of Jewish life and customs of those days, especially for the picture which they give of the condition of the German Jews, and of their sufferings from the caprice of princes and from heavy taxation.

He was referred to by Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]] as the \"greatest Jewish leader of ''Zarfat'' ([[Medieval Hebrew]] for France, a reference to [[Charlemagne]]'s rule of Germany)\" alive at the time.\n\n==Biography==\n\nRabbi Meir was born between 1215 and 1220 in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. He came from a long line of rabbis. His first teacher was his father. He continued his training in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] under [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] and in [[France]], where he remained until 1242, his teachers being [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise]], and [[Samuel of \u00c9vreux]], witnessing the [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|burning of the Talmud]] on June 17, 1244, in [[Paris]]. He then settled in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], opening a [[yeshiva]] in his house. After the death of his father in 1281, he settled in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. In 1286, King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] instituted a new political status for the Jewish community, declaring them ''servi camerae'' (\"serfs of the treasury\"), allowing direct royal taxation of the Jewish community. Since Rudolf did not prohibit local nobles from also taxing the Jews, the burden on the communities could be devastating. Along with many others, Meir left Germany with family and followers, but was captured in the mountains of [[Lombardy]] having been recognized by a baptized Jew named Kneppe,  and imprisoned in a fortress near [[Ensisheim]] in [[Alsace]]. Tradition has it that a large ransom of 23,000 [[Mark (weight)|marks]] silver was raised for him (by [[Asher ben Jehiel|the Rosh]]), but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis.  He ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McManus|first1=Shani|title=Responding to terror explored|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/palm/fl-jjpn-school-0715-20150713-story.html|agency=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=July 13, 2015|quote=The Jewish people have experienced similar situations throughout our arduous history,\" Rabbi Zalman Abraham of JLI headquarters in New York noted. \"When Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg was imprisoned for ransom in the Middle Ages, he ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.\"}}</ref> He died in prison after seven years.

Among them are Daniel and his three companions, who refuse to touch the royal food and wine. Their overseer fears for his life in case the health of his charges deteriorates, but Daniel suggests a trial and the four emerge healthier than their counterparts from ten days of nothing but vegetables and water. They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king's food, and to Daniel God gives insight into visions and dreams.

When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation, the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth.

The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked\u2014or more accurately, paid\u2014to be allowed to make Jerusalem a ''[[polis]]'', or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nAntiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BC with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168 BC, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenisation: the Jewish Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 BC an \"abomination of desolation\", probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple.{{sfn|Sacchi|2004|pp=225\u2013226}} With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nThe crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the defilement of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BC (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase \"evenings and mornings\" recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices.{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=407}} But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 BC and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate, the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40\u201343) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44\u201345) was inaccurate (he died in Persia).{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=6\u20137}} The obvious conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164 BC, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem, and the consensus of modern scholarship is accordingly that the book dates to the period 167\u2013163 BCE.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=7}}{{sfn|Ryken|Longman|2010|p=325}}\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Songe Nabuchodonosor arbre.jpg|thumb|upright|Nebuchadnezzar's dream: the felled tree (France, 15th century).]]\n\n=== Development ===\nIt is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=42}} The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second century BC.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=34}} Chapter 1 was composed (in Aramaic) at this time as a brief introduction of  to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}} The visions of chapters 7\u201312 were added and chapter 1 translated into Hebrew at the third stage when the final book was being drawn together.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n=== Authorship ===\nDaniel is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them [[pseudonym]]ous.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|p=2}} The stories of the first half are considered legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] period (2nd century BC).{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}\n\nAlthough the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, chapters 1\u20136 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; only the second half (chapters 7\u201312) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10.{{sfn|Wesselius|2002|p=295}} The real author/editor of Daniel was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community. The book is a product of \"Wisdom\" circles, but the type of wisdom is [[Wiktionary:mantic|mantic]] (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning\u2014the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God's revelation.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002b|pp=229\u2013230, 243}}{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=340}}\n\nIt is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=180}} [[Ezekiel]], who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with [[Noah]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=69}} \"The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character&nbsp;... serves as the principal human 'hero' in the biblical book that now bears his name\"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=4}}\n\n=== Dating ===\n\nThe prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BC), the desecration of the Temple (the \"abomination of desolation\"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164 BC. Chapters 10\u201312 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BC. There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=101}}\n\nFurther evidence of the book's date is in the fact that Daniel is excluded from the Hebrew Bible's [[Nevi'im|canon of the prophets]], which was closed around 200 BC, and the Wisdom of [[Sirach]], a work dating from around 180 BC, draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it. Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the [[Sibylline Oracles]] commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known from the middle of that century.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter [[Masoretic Text]] and in two longer Greek versions, the original [[Septuagint]] version, c. 100&nbsp;BC, and the later [[Theodotion]] version from c. 2nd century AD. Both Greek texts contain three [[additions to Daniel]]: [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]; the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susannah and the Elders]]; and the story of [[Bel and the Dragon]]. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself.{{sfn|Harrington|1999|pp=119\u2013120}}{{sfn|Spencer|2002|p=89}}{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3}}\n\nEight copies of the Book of Daniel, all incomplete, have been found at [[Qumran]], two in [[Qumran Caves|Cave 1]], five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6.

All eight manuscripts were copied between 125&nbsp;BC (4QDan<sup>c</sup>) and about 50 AD (4QDan<sup>b</sup>), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only about 40 years after its composition. All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text. None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>b</sup>, and 4QDan<sup>d</sup>) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], switches to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.{{sfn|VanderKam|Flint|2013|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n== Genre, meaning, symbolism and chronology ==\n[[File:Daniel dans la fosse aux lions.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniel in the lions' den saved by [[Habakkuk]] (France, 15th century).]]\n\n''(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)''\n\n=== Genre ===\nThe Book of Daniel is an [[apocalypse]], a [[literary genre]] in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient;

he is one of the [[maskil (honorific)|''maskilim'']] (\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd), the wise ones, who have the task of teaching righteousness and whose number may be considered to include the authors of the book itself.{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp= 397\u2013406}} The book is also an [[eschatology]], as the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a predicted moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom.{{sfn|Carroll|2000|pp= 420\u2013421}} It gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and those Jews who have cooperated with them.{{sfn|Redditt|2009|p= 187}}\n\n=== Meaning, symbolism and chronology ===\nThe message of the Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression.{{sfn|Brettler|2005|p=218}} The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd-century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament\u2014\"the Son of God\", \"the Son of Man\", Christ and the Antichrist\u2014the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=1\u20132}} The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars.\n\n* The ''four kingdoms'' and the ''little horn'' (Daniel 2 and 7): The concept of four successive world empires stems from Greek theories of mythological history.{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} Most modern interpreters agree that the four represent [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], the [[Medes]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and the [[Macedonian Empire|Greeks]], ending with Hellenistic [[Seleucid Syria]] and with Hellenistic [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=34\u201336}} The traditional interpretation of the dream identifies the four empires as the Babylonian (the head), Medo-Persian (arms and shoulders), Greek (thighs and legs), and Roman (the feet) empires.{{sfn|Miller|1994|p=96}} The symbolism of four metals in the statue in chapter 2 comes from Persian writings,{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} while the four \"beasts from the sea\" in chapter 7 reflect Hosea 13:7\u20138, in which God threatens that he will be to Israel like a lion, a leopard, a bear or a wild beast.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=80}} The consensus among scholars is that the four beasts of chapter 7 symbolise the same four world empires.{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260,269}} The modern interpretation views [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] (reigned 175\u2013164 BC) as the \"small horn\" that uproots three others (Antiochus usurped the rights of several other claimants to become king of the Seleucid Empire).{{sfn|Matthews|Moyes|2012|pp=260, 269}}\n* The ''Ancient of Days'' and the ''one like a son of man'' (Daniel 7): The portrayal of God in Daniel [http://biblehub.com/text/daniel/7-13.htm 7:13] resembles the portrayal of the [[Canaan]]ite god [[El (deity)|El]] as an ancient divine king presiding over the divine court.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=3\u20134}} The \"Ancient of Days\" gives dominion over the earth to \"one like a [[son of man]]\", and then in [http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm Daniel 7:27] to \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\", whom scholars consider the son of man to represent. These people can be understood as the ''maskilim'' (sages), or as the Jewish people broadly.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002a|pp=60\u201361, 282}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Son of Man\">\"Son of man\" (''bar 'ena\u0161'' in Hebrew) simply means \"a human being\", but in the context of Daniel 7 it may be a heavenly figure, possibly the archangel Michael functioning as a representative of the Jewish people (Collins 1977:144\u201346; opposed by Davies 1985:105\u2013106). Scholars almost universally agree that this human figure represents \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\" of Daniel 7:27, originally the ''maskilim'' community or group responsible for the composition of Daniel, but in later interpretation it is taken to mean the Jewish people as a whole. See Grabbe 2002a.</ref>\n*''The ram and he-goat'' (Daniel 8) as conventional astrological symbols represent Persia and Syria, as the text explains. The \"mighty horn\" stands for [[Alexander the Great]]  (reigned 336\u2013323 BC) and the \"four lesser horns\" represent the four principal generals ([[Diadochi]]) who fought over the Greek empire following Alexander's death. The \"little horn\" again represents Antiochus IV. The key to the symbols lies in the description of the little horn's actions: he ends the continual burnt offering and overthrows the Sanctuary, a clear reference to Antiochus' desecration of the Temple.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=87}}\n* The ''anointed ones'' and the ''seventy years'' (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'s \"seventy years\" prophecy regarding the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon. From the point of view of the Maccabean era, Jeremiah's promise was obviously not true\u2014the gentiles still oppressed the Jews, and the \"desolation of Jerusalem\" had not ended. Daniel therefore reinterprets the seventy years as seventy \"weeks\" of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven \"weeks\" from the \"going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem\" to the coming of an \"anointed one\", while the final \"week\" is marked by the violent death of another \"anointed one\", probably the High Priest [[Onias III]] (ousted to make way for [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple. The point of this for Daniel is that the period of gentile power is predetermined, and is coming to an end.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260}}\n* ''Kings of north and south'': Chapters 10 to 12 concern the war between these kings, the events leading up to it, and its heavenly meaning.

The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12 the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last \"for a time, times and half a time\", or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the \"desolation\" will last for 1290 days (12:11); and finally, 1335 days (12:12). Verse 12:11 was presumably added after the lapse of the 1150 days of chapter 8, and 12:12 after the lapse of the number in 12:11.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=99}}\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:Merian's Daniel 7 engraving.jpg|thumb|320px|Engraving of Daniel's vision of the four beasts in chapter 7 by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], 1630.]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe concepts of [[immortality]] and [[resurrection]], with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2002|pp=86\u201387}} Without this belief, [[Christianity]], in which the [[resurrection of Jesus]] plays a central role, would have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=2}}\n\nDaniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century AD as predicting the imminent end-time.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=244}} Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the [[Montanism|Montanists]] of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their [[millennialism]], to the more extreme elements of the 16th-century Reformation such as the [[Zwickau prophets]] and the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=2\u20133}} During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchy Men]] took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allow them to form a \"government of saints\" in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus.{{sfn|Weber|2007|p=374}} Daniel remains one of the most influential apocalypses in modern America, foretelling the history of Jesus and the [[Second Coming]].{{sfn|Boyer|1992|pp=24, 30\u201331}}\n\nThe influence of Daniel has not been confined to Judaism and Christianity: In the Middle Ages Muslims created horoscopes whose authority was attributed to Daniel. More recently the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] movement, which originated in Persian Shi'ite Islam, justified its existence on the 1260-day prophecy of Daniel, holding that it foretold the coming of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] and an age of peace and justice in the year 1844, which is the year 1260 of the [[Hijri year|Muslim era]].{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n=== Western culture ===\nDaniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophecy but as a historical book, \"a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man\".{{sfn|Godden|2013|p=231}} In the early modern period the physicist [[Isaac Newton]] paid special attention to it, and [[Francis Bacon]] borrowed a [[motto]] from it for his work ''[[Novum Organum]]''. Philosophers, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] drew on it. In the 20th century its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of [[Carl Jung]]. The book has also inspired musicians, from medieval liturgical drama to the 20th century compositions of [[Darius Milhaud]].  Artists including [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] have all drawn on its imagery.{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biblical numerology]]\n* [[Christian eschatology]]\n* [[Daniel (Old English poem)]]\n* [[Greek Apocalypse of Daniel]]\n* [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Daniel]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist |group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bandstra\n  | first     = Barry L.\n  | title     = Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2008\n  | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 978-0495391050\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bar\n  | first     = Shaul\n  | title     = A Letter That Has Not Been Read: Dreams in the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2001\n  | publisher = Hebrew Union College Press\n  | location  = Cincinnati\n  | isbn      = 978-0-87820-424-3\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=zs3gup4iFu4C\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Boyer\n  | first     = Paul S.\n  | title     = When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern American Culture\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=FyTeW7vQ8K4C\n  | year      = 1992\n  | publisher = Harvard University Press\n  | isbn      = 978-0-674-95129-7\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n*  {{cite book\n  | last      = Brettler\n  | first     = Mark Zvi\n  | title     = How To Read the Bible\n  | year      = 2005\n  | publisher = Jewish Publication Society\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=39nQafdJ_ssC\n  | \n| isbn     = 9780827610019\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Carroll\n  | first     = John T.\n  | chapter   = Eschatology\n  | editor1-last                   = Freedman \n  | editor1-first                  = David Noel  \n  | editor2-last                   = Myers\n  | editor2-first                  = Allen C.\n  | title     = Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible\n  | year      = 2000\n  | publisher = Eerdmans\n  | chapter-url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&pg=PA422\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9789053565032\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Cohn\n  | first     = Shaye J.D.\n  | title     = From the Maccabees to the Mishnah\n  | year      = 2006\n  | publisher = Westminster John Knox Press\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=H5hLLIrh6n8C\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9780664227432\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last       = Collins\n  | first      = John J.\n  | authorlink = John J.

Among them are Daniel and his three companions, who refuse to touch the royal food and wine. Their overseer fears for his life in case the health of his charges deteriorates, but Daniel suggests a trial and the four emerge healthier than their counterparts from ten days of nothing but vegetables and water. They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king's food, and to Daniel God gives insight into visions and dreams. When their training is done Nebuchadnezzar finds them 'ten times better' than all the wise men in his service and therefore keeps them at his court, where Daniel continues until the first year of King [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=19\u201320}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Cyrus\">Cyrus: Persian conqueror of Babylon, 539 BC.</ref>\n\n=== Nebuchadnezzar's dream of four kingdoms (chapter 2) ===\n{{Main|Daniel 2}}\nIn the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation, the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth.

The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked\u2014or more accurately, paid\u2014to be allowed to make Jerusalem a ''[[polis]]'', or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nAntiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BC with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168 BC, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenisation: the Jewish Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 BC an \"abomination of desolation\", probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple.{{sfn|Sacchi|2004|pp=225\u2013226}} With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nThe crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the defilement of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BC (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase \"evenings and mornings\" recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices.{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=407}} But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 BC and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate, the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40\u201343) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44\u201345) was inaccurate (he died in Persia).{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=6\u20137}} The obvious conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164 BC, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem, and the consensus of modern scholarship is accordingly that the book dates to the period 167\u2013163 BCE.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=7}}{{sfn|Ryken|Longman|2010|p=325}}\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Songe Nabuchodonosor arbre.jpg|thumb|upright|Nebuchadnezzar's dream: the felled tree (France, 15th century).]]\n\n=== Development ===\nIt is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=42}} The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second century BC.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=34}} Chapter 1 was composed (in Aramaic) at this time as a brief introduction of  to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}} The visions of chapters 7\u201312 were added and chapter 1 translated into Hebrew at the third stage when the final book was being drawn together.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n=== Authorship ===\nDaniel is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them [[pseudonym]]ous.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|p=2}} The stories of the first half are considered legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] period (2nd century BC).{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}\n\nAlthough the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, chapters 1\u20136 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; only the second half (chapters 7\u201312) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10.{{sfn|Wesselius|2002|p=295}} The real author/editor of Daniel was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community. The book is a product of \"Wisdom\" circles, but the type of wisdom is [[Wiktionary:mantic|mantic]] (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning\u2014the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God's revelation.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002b|pp=229\u2013230, 243}}{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=340}}\n\nIt is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=180}} [[Ezekiel]], who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with [[Noah]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=69}} \"The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character&nbsp;... serves as the principal human 'hero' in the biblical book that now bears his name\"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=4}}\n\n=== Dating ===\n\nThe prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BC), the desecration of the Temple (the \"abomination of desolation\"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164 BC. Chapters 10\u201312 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BC. There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=101}}\n\nFurther evidence of the book's date is in the fact that Daniel is excluded from the Hebrew Bible's [[Nevi'im|canon of the prophets]], which was closed around 200 BC, and the Wisdom of [[Sirach]], a work dating from around 180 BC, draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it. Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the [[Sibylline Oracles]] commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known from the middle of that century.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter [[Masoretic Text]] and in two longer Greek versions, the original [[Septuagint]] version, c. 100&nbsp;BC, and the later [[Theodotion]] version from c. 2nd century AD. Both Greek texts contain three [[additions to Daniel]]: [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]; the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susannah and the Elders]]; and the story of [[Bel and the Dragon]]. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself.{{sfn|Harrington|1999|pp=119\u2013120}}{{sfn|Spencer|2002|p=89}}{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3}}\n\nEight copies of the Book of Daniel, all incomplete, have been found at [[Qumran]], two in [[Qumran Caves|Cave 1]], five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6.

All eight manuscripts were copied between 125&nbsp;BC (4QDan<sup>c</sup>) and about 50 AD (4QDan<sup>b</sup>), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only about 40 years after its composition. All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text. None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>b</sup>, and 4QDan<sup>d</sup>) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], switches to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.{{sfn|VanderKam|Flint|2013|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n== Genre, meaning, symbolism and chronology ==\n[[File:Daniel dans la fosse aux lions.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniel in the lions' den saved by [[Habakkuk]] (France, 15th century).]]\n\n''(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)''\n\n=== Genre ===\nThe Book of Daniel is an [[apocalypse]], a [[literary genre]] in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient;

he is one of the [[maskil (honorific)|''maskilim'']] (\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd), the wise ones, who have the task of teaching righteousness and whose number may be considered to include the authors of the book itself.{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp= 397\u2013406}} The book is also an [[eschatology]], as the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a predicted moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom.{{sfn|Carroll|2000|pp= 420\u2013421}} It gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and those Jews who have cooperated with them.{{sfn|Redditt|2009|p= 187}}\n\n=== Meaning, symbolism and chronology ===\nThe message of the Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression.{{sfn|Brettler|2005|p=218}} The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd-century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament\u2014\"the Son of God\", \"the Son of Man\", Christ and the Antichrist\u2014the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=1\u20132}} The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars.\n\n* The ''four kingdoms'' and the ''little horn'' (Daniel 2 and 7): The concept of four successive world empires stems from Greek theories of mythological history.{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} Most modern interpreters agree that the four represent [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], the [[Medes]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and the [[Macedonian Empire|Greeks]], ending with Hellenistic [[Seleucid Syria]] and with Hellenistic [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=34\u201336}} The traditional interpretation of the dream identifies the four empires as the Babylonian (the head), Medo-Persian (arms and shoulders), Greek (thighs and legs), and Roman (the feet) empires.{{sfn|Miller|1994|p=96}} The symbolism of four metals in the statue in chapter 2 comes from Persian writings,{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} while the four \"beasts from the sea\" in chapter 7 reflect Hosea 13:7\u20138, in which God threatens that he will be to Israel like a lion, a leopard, a bear or a wild beast.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=80}} The consensus among scholars is that the four beasts of chapter 7 symbolise the same four world empires.{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260,269}} The modern interpretation views [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] (reigned 175\u2013164 BC) as the \"small horn\" that uproots three others (Antiochus usurped the rights of several other claimants to become king of the Seleucid Empire).{{sfn|Matthews|Moyes|2012|pp=260, 269}}\n* The ''Ancient of Days'' and the ''one like a son of man'' (Daniel 7): The portrayal of God in Daniel [http://biblehub.com/text/daniel/7-13.htm 7:13] resembles the portrayal of the [[Canaan]]ite god [[El (deity)|El]] as an ancient divine king presiding over the divine court.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=3\u20134}} The \"Ancient of Days\" gives dominion over the earth to \"one like a [[son of man]]\", and then in [http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm Daniel 7:27] to \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\", whom scholars consider the son of man to represent. These people can be understood as the ''maskilim'' (sages), or as the Jewish people broadly.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002a|pp=60\u201361, 282}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Son of Man\">\"Son of man\" (''bar 'ena\u0161'' in Hebrew) simply means \"a human being\", but in the context of Daniel 7 it may be a heavenly figure, possibly the archangel Michael functioning as a representative of the Jewish people (Collins 1977:144\u201346; opposed by Davies 1985:105\u2013106). Scholars almost universally agree that this human figure represents \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\" of Daniel 7:27, originally the ''maskilim'' community or group responsible for the composition of Daniel, but in later interpretation it is taken to mean the Jewish people as a whole. See Grabbe 2002a.</ref>\n*''The ram and he-goat'' (Daniel 8) as conventional astrological symbols represent Persia and Syria, as the text explains. The \"mighty horn\" stands for [[Alexander the Great]]  (reigned 336\u2013323 BC) and the \"four lesser horns\" represent the four principal generals ([[Diadochi]]) who fought over the Greek empire following Alexander's death. The \"little horn\" again represents Antiochus IV. The key to the symbols lies in the description of the little horn's actions: he ends the continual burnt offering and overthrows the Sanctuary, a clear reference to Antiochus' desecration of the Temple.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=87}}\n* The ''anointed ones'' and the ''seventy years'' (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'s \"seventy years\" prophecy regarding the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon. From the point of view of the Maccabean era, Jeremiah's promise was obviously not true\u2014the gentiles still oppressed the Jews, and the \"desolation of Jerusalem\" had not ended. Daniel therefore reinterprets the seventy years as seventy \"weeks\" of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven \"weeks\" from the \"going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem\" to the coming of an \"anointed one\", while the final \"week\" is marked by the violent death of another \"anointed one\", probably the High Priest [[Onias III]] (ousted to make way for [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple. The point of this for Daniel is that the period of gentile power is predetermined, and is coming to an end.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260}}\n* ''Kings of north and south'': Chapters 10 to 12 concern the war between these kings, the events leading up to it, and its heavenly meaning.

The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12 the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last \"for a time, times and half a time\", or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the \"desolation\" will last for 1290 days (12:11); and finally, 1335 days (12:12). Verse 12:11 was presumably added after the lapse of the 1150 days of chapter 8, and 12:12 after the lapse of the number in 12:11.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=99}}\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:Merian's Daniel 7 engraving.jpg|thumb|320px|Engraving of Daniel's vision of the four beasts in chapter 7 by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], 1630.]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe concepts of [[immortality]] and [[resurrection]], with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2002|pp=86\u201387}} Without this belief, [[Christianity]], in which the [[resurrection of Jesus]] plays a central role, would have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=2}}\n\nDaniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century AD as predicting the imminent end-time.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=244}} Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the [[Montanism|Montanists]] of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their [[millennialism]], to the more extreme elements of the 16th-century Reformation such as the [[Zwickau prophets]] and the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=2\u20133}} During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchy Men]] took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allow them to form a \"government of saints\" in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus.{{sfn|Weber|2007|p=374}} Daniel remains one of the most influential apocalypses in modern America, foretelling the history of Jesus and the [[Second Coming]].{{sfn|Boyer|1992|pp=24, 30\u201331}}\n\nThe influence of Daniel has not been confined to Judaism and Christianity: In the Middle Ages Muslims created horoscopes whose authority was attributed to Daniel. More recently the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] movement, which originated in Persian Shi'ite Islam, justified its existence on the 1260-day prophecy of Daniel, holding that it foretold the coming of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] and an age of peace and justice in the year 1844, which is the year 1260 of the [[Hijri year|Muslim era]].{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n=== Western culture ===\nDaniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophecy but as a historical book, \"a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man\".{{sfn|Godden|2013|p=231}} In the early modern period the physicist [[Isaac Newton]] paid special attention to it, and [[Francis Bacon]] borrowed a [[motto]] from it for his work ''[[Novum Organum]]''. Philosophers, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] drew on it. In the 20th century its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of [[Carl Jung]]. The book has also inspired musicians, from medieval liturgical drama to the 20th century compositions of [[Darius Milhaud]].  Artists including [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] have all drawn on its imagery.{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biblical numerology]]\n* [[Christian eschatology]]\n* [[Daniel (Old English poem)]]\n* [[Greek Apocalypse of Daniel]]\n* [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Daniel]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist |group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bandstra\n  | first     = Barry L.\n  | title     = Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2008\n  | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 978-0495391050\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Bar\n  | first     = Shaul\n  | title     = A Letter That Has Not Been Read: Dreams in the Hebrew Bible\n  | year      = 2001\n  | publisher = Hebrew Union College Press\n  | location  = Cincinnati\n  | isbn      = 978-0-87820-424-3\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=zs3gup4iFu4C\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Boyer\n  | first     = Paul S.\n  | title     = When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern American Culture\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=FyTeW7vQ8K4C\n  | year      = 1992\n  | publisher = Harvard University Press\n  | isbn      = 978-0-674-95129-7\n  | ref       = harv\n}}\n*  {{cite book\n  | last      = Brettler\n  | first     = Mark Zvi\n  | title     = How To Read the Bible\n  | year      = 2005\n  | publisher = Jewish Publication Society\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/?id=39nQafdJ_ssC\n  | \n| isbn     = 9780827610019\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Carroll\n  | first     = John T.\n  | chapter   = Eschatology\n  | editor1-last                   = Freedman \n  | editor1-first                  = David Noel  \n  | editor2-last                   = Myers\n  | editor2-first                  = Allen C.\n  | title     = Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible\n  | year      = 2000\n  | publisher = Eerdmans\n  | chapter-url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&pg=PA422\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9789053565032\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last      = Cohn\n  | first     = Shaye J.D.\n  | title     = From the Maccabees to the Mishnah\n  | year      = 2006\n  | publisher = Westminster John Knox Press\n  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=H5hLLIrh6n8C\n  | ref       = harv\n| isbn     = 9780664227432\n  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last       = Collins\n  | first      = John J.\n  | authorlink = John J.
