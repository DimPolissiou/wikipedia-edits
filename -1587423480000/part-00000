Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, plus that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: \"Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn't tell.\" He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes--\"certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I'd ever met up with.\" In ''The Mysterious Island'', the sixty-something captain sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror.

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, plus that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's character in the novels is largely seen through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', when Nemo is about forty years of age and described as a reticent man, tall and swarthy in appearance, with a straight nose and wide-set eyes. In ''The Mysterious Island'', the aged Captain Nemo sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror.

The HUAC was created in 1938 to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having [[Fascism|Fascist]] or  [[Communism|Communist]] ties.

The subcommittee investigated German as well as [[Bolshevik]] elements in the United States.<ref name=\"schmidt136\">Schmidt, p. 136</ref>\n\nThis committee was originally concerned with investigating pro-German sentiments in the American liquor industry. After [[World War I]] ended in November 1918, and the German threat lessened, the committee began investigating Bolshevism, which had appeared as a threat during the [[First Red Scare]] after the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917. The committee's hearing into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted February 11 to March 10, 1919, had a decisive role in constructing an image of a radical threat to the United States during the first Red Scare.<ref name=\"schmidt144\">Schmidt, p. 144</ref>\n\n====Fish Committee (1930)====\nCongressman [[Hamilton Fish III]] (R-NY), who was a fervent anti-communist, introduced, on May 5, 1930, House Resolution 180, which proposed to establish a committee to investigate communist activities in the United States. The resulting committee, commonly known as the Fish Committee, undertook extensive investigations of people and organizations suspected of being involved with or supporting communist activities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Complete Digitized Testimonies: The U.S. Congress Special Committee on Communist Activities in Washington State Hearings (1930)|url=http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/cpproject/fish-hearings.shtml|publisher=Communism in Washington State History and Memory Project|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref> Among the committee's targets were the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and communist presidential candidate [[William Z.

The committee was widely known as the McCormack\u2013Dickstein committee. Its mandate was to get \"information on how foreign subversive propaganda entered the U.S. and the organizations that were spreading it\". Its records are held by the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] as records related to HUAC.\n\nIn 1934, the Special Committee subpoenaed most of the leaders of the fascist movement in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Chip |last1= Berlet|first2=Matthew Nemiroff |last2 = Lyons |title=Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort|url=https://archive.org/details/rightwingpopulis00berlrich|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-57230-562-5}}</ref> Beginning in November 1934, the committee investigated allegations of a [[fascism|fascist]] plot to seize the [[White House]], known as the \"[[Business Plot]]\".

Flanagan was called to testify for only a part of one day, while a clerk from the project was called in for two entire days. It was during this investigation that one of the committee members, [[Joe Starnes]] (D-Ala.), famously asked Flanagan whether the [[Elizabethan era]] playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]] was a member of the Communist Party, and mused \"[[Euripides|Mr. Euripides]]\" preached [[class conflict|class warfare]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DA153DF93BA2575AC0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=Mr. Euripides Goes To Washington | first1=Benedict | last1=Nightingale | date=September 18, 1988 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, the committee investigated people involved with pro-Nazi organizations such as [[Oscar C.

A significant step for HUAC was its investigation of the charges of espionage brought against [[Alger Hiss]] in 1948. This investigation ultimately resulted in Hiss's trial and conviction for perjury, and convinced many of the usefulness of congressional committees for uncovering communist subversion.<ref>Doug Linder, ''[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hiss/hiss.html The Alger Hiss Trials \u2013 1949\u201350] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830171725/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hiss/hiss.html |date=August 30, 2006 }}, 2003.</ref>\n\n===Hollywood blacklist===\n{{Main|Hollywood blacklist}}\nIn 1947, the committee held nine days of hearings into alleged communist propaganda and influence in the [[Hollywood]] motion picture industry.

Eventually, more than 300 artists \u2013 including directors, radio commentators, actors, and particularly screenwriters \u2013 were boycotted by the studios. Some, like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Alan Lomax]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[Yip Harburg]], left the U.S or went underground to find work. Others like [[Dalton Trumbo]] wrote under [[Pen name|pseudonyms]] or the names of colleagues. Only about ten percent succeeded in rebuilding careers within the entertainment industry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nIn 1947, studio executives told the committee that wartime films &ndash; such as ''[[Mission to Moscow]]'', ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'', and ''[[Song of Russia]]'' &ndash; could be considered pro-Soviet [[propaganda]], but claimed that the films were valuable in the context of the Allied war effort, and that they were made (in the case of ''Mission to Moscow'') at the request of White House officials. In response to the House investigations, most studios produced a number of anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda films such as ''[[The Red Menace (film)|The Red Menace]]'' (August 1949), ''[[The Red Danube]]'' (October 1949), ''[[The Woman on Pier 13]]'' (October 1949), ''[[Guilty of Treason]]'' (May 1950, about the ordeal and trial of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]), ''[[I Was a Communist for the FBI]]'' (May 1951, Academy Award nominated for best documentary 1951, also serialized for radio), ''[[Red Planet Mars]]'' (May 1952), and [[John Wayne]]'s ''[[Big Jim McLain]]'' (August 1952).<ref>Dan Georgakas, \"[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/blacklist.html Hollywood Blacklist]\", in: ''Encyclopedia Of The American Left'', 1992.</ref> [[Universal-International Pictures]] was the only major studio that did not produce such a film.\n\n=== Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss ===\n[[File:Whittaker Chambers.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Whittaker Chambers]] (1948)]]\nOn July 31, 1948, the committee heard testimony from [[Elizabeth Bentley]], an American who had been working as a Soviet agent in New York. Among those whom she named as communists was [[Harry Dexter White]], a senior U.S. Treasury department official. The committee subpoenaed [[Whittaker Chambers]] on August 3, 1948. Chambers, too, was a former Soviet spy, by then a senior editor of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Alger Hiss (1950).jpg|thumb|right|[[Alger Hiss]] (1950)]]\n\nChambers named more than a half-dozen government officials including White as well as [[Alger Hiss]] (and Hiss' brother Donald). Most of these former officials refused to answer committee questions, citing the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. White denied the allegations, and died of a heart attack a few days later. Hiss also denied all charges; doubts about his testimony though, especially those expressed by freshman Congressman [[Richard Nixon]], led to further investigation that strongly suggested Hiss had made a number of false statements. Hiss challenged Chambers to repeat his charges outside a Congressional committee, which Chambers did. Hiss sued for libel, leading Chambers to produce copies of State Department documents which he claimed Hiss had given him in 1938. Hiss denied this before a grand jury, was indicted for perjury, and subsequently convicted and imprisoned.<ref name=Witness>{{Cite book\n | last = Chambers\n | first = Whittaker\n | title = Witness\n | publisher = Random House\n | year = 1952\n | isbn = 978-0-89526-571-5}}</ref><ref name=Perjury>{{Cite book\n | last = Weinstein\n | first = Allen\n | title = Perjury\n | publisher = Hoover Institution Press\n | year = 2013\n | isbn = 978-0-8179-1225-3}}</ref>\nThe present-day House of Representatives website on HUAC states, \"In the 1990s, relying on Soviet archives and records from the [[Venona project]] \u2013 a secret U.S. program that decrypted Soviet intelligence messages \u2013 some scholars argued that Hiss had indeed been a spy on the Kremlin's payroll.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artandhistory.house.gov/highlights.aspx?action=view&intID=169 |title=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916043311/http://artandhistory.house.gov/highlights.aspx?action=view&intID=169 |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Ichord-Richard-1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Democrat [[Richard Howard Ichord Jr.]] of Missouri was chair of the renamed House Internal Security Committee from 1969 until its termination in January 1975.]]\n\nIn the wake of the downfall of McCarthy (who never served in the House, nor on HUAC), the prestige of HUAC began a gradual decline in the late 1950s.

HUAC subpoenaed [[Jerry Rubin]] and [[Abbie Hoffman]] of the [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] in 1967, and again in the aftermath of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. The Yippies used the media attention to make a mockery of the proceedings. Rubin came to one session dressed as a Revolutionary War soldier and passed out copies of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] to those in attendance. Rubin then \"blew giant gum bubbles, while his co-witnesses taunted the committee with [[Nazi salute]]s\".<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/Youth_International_Party Youth International Party], 1992.</ref> Rubin attended another session dressed as [[Santa Claus]]. On another occasion, police stopped Hoffman at the building entrance and arrested him for wearing the United States flag.

Some, like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Alan Lomax]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[Yip Harburg]], left the U.S or went underground to find work. Others like [[Dalton Trumbo]] wrote under [[Pen name|pseudonyms]] or the names of colleagues. Only about ten percent succeeded in rebuilding careers within the entertainment industry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nIn 1947, studio executives told the committee that wartime films &ndash; such as ''[[Mission to Moscow]]'', ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'', and ''[[Song of Russia]]'' &ndash; could be considered pro-Soviet [[propaganda]], but claimed that the films were valuable in the context of the Allied war effort, and that they were made (in the case of ''Mission to Moscow'') at the request of White House officials. In response to the House investigations, most studios produced a number of anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda films such as ''[[The Red Menace (film)|The Red Menace]]'' (August 1949), ''[[The Red Danube]]'' (October 1949), ''[[The Woman on Pier 13]]'' (October 1949), ''[[Guilty of Treason]]'' (May 1950, about the ordeal and trial of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]), ''[[I Was a Communist for the FBI]]'' (May 1951, Academy Award nominated for best documentary 1951, also serialized for radio), ''[[Red Planet Mars]]'' (May 1952), and [[John Wayne]]'s ''[[Big Jim McLain]]'' (August 1952).<ref>Dan Georgakas, \"[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/blacklist.html Hollywood Blacklist]\", in: ''Encyclopedia Of The American Left'', 1992.</ref> [[Universal-International Pictures]] was the only major studio that did not produce such a film.\n\n=== Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss ===\n[[File:Whittaker Chambers.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Whittaker Chambers]] (1948)]]\nOn July 31, 1948, the committee heard testimony from [[Elizabeth Bentley]], an American who had been working as a Soviet agent in New York.

Most of these former officials refused to answer committee questions, citing the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. White denied the allegations, and died of a heart attack a few days later. Hiss also denied all charges; doubts about his testimony though, especially those expressed by freshman Congressman [[Richard Nixon]], led to further investigation that strongly suggested Hiss had made a number of false statements. Hiss challenged Chambers to repeat his charges outside a Congressional committee, which Chambers did. Hiss sued for libel, leading Chambers to produce copies of State Department documents which he claimed Hiss had given him in 1938.

HUAC subpoenaed [[Jerry Rubin]] and [[Abbie Hoffman]] of the [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] in 1967, and again in the aftermath of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. The Yippies used the media attention to make a mockery of the proceedings. Rubin came to one session dressed as a Revolutionary War soldier and passed out copies of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] to those in attendance.
