It was published by [[Nintendo]] and released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America in July&nbsp;1990 and in Europe on March&nbsp;27, 1991. It was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Mega Drive]] and released by [[Sega]] in June&nbsp;1993. The game features two snakes, Rattle and Roll, as they make their way through eleven 3D [[Isometric adventure game|isometric]] [[Level (video games)|level]]s. The object is to navigate the obstacles in each level and eat enough \"Nibbley Pibbleys\" to ring a weigh-in bell located in the level, which will allow the snakes to exit. The game can be played by a [[single-player|single player]] or by [[multiplayer|two players simultaneously]].\n\n''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' was developed by Rare members [[Stamper brothers|Tim Stamper]] and [[Mark Betteridge]], with music inspired by \"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]\", is a bad game and should be avoided  as well as other [[1950s in music|1950s-era]] [[oldies]], composed by [[David Wise (composer)|David Wise]]. It was well received by various video gaming magazines, being praised for its well-designed 3D environments and graphics, playability and controls, and level of challenge. A follow-up for the [[Game Boy]], titled ''Sneaky Snakes'', was released by [[Tradewest]] in 1991. ''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' has been named one of the top games released on the NES and one of the top games released by Rare. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation for the [[Xbox One]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' features two snakes (Rattle and Roll) making their way through 11  [[Isometric adventure game|isometric]] [[Level (video games)|level]]s. The object in each level is to eat enough \"Nibbley Pibbleys\" \u2013 small round creatures found throughout each level \u2013 to gain enough weight to ring a bell on top of a weighing machine located at the end of the level; this causes a door for the next level to open.<ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite journal |last=Regan |first=Matt |last2=Rignall |first2=Julian |authorlink1=Matt Regan |authorlink2=Julian Rignall |title=Nintendo Review: ''Snake Rattle n Roll'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines]] |issue=4 |date=January 1991 |pages=72\u201374 |issn=0960-4952 |oclc=500020318 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=[[Peterborough]]}}</ref> Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat; snakes grow more quickly when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys of their own color, and they grow the most when they eat yellow ones. Located in each level are dispensers which randomly spew out Nibbley Pibbleys; however, they also spew out bombs which can damage the snakes.<ref name=\"Manual5\">Instruction Manual, p. 5.</ref> When a snake reaches a long enough length, the tail begins to flash, which means the snake is heavy enough to exit that level.  At that point, they must find and jump on the scale to ring the bell and open the exit door.<ref name=\"InstructionManual\">Instruction Manual, p. 6.</ref>\n\nEach level contains various obstacles and enemies. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments.<ref name=\"Manual5\" /> Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends when players lose all their lives, but they have several [[continue (video games)|continue]]s in which they can restart the game from where they left off.<ref name=\"Manual7\">Instruction Manual, p. 7.</ref> Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them.<ref name=\"InstructionManual\" /> Players can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, provide extra lives and continues, add time bonuses, award invisibility diamonds, speed up the snakes, or reverse their directional controls.<ref name=\"Manual9\">Instruction Manual, p. 9.</ref> Located throughout the game are \"lids\" (in the shape of manhole covers) which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies.<ref name=\"MeanMachines\" /><ref name=\"Manual12\">Instruction Manual, p. 12.</ref> Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.<ref name=\"Manual12\" />\n\n==Development==\n[[Image:Snakerattlenroll.png|frame|left|''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' features a 3D [[Isometric adventure game|isometric]] playing field in which the snakes must avoid obstacles, collect items, and eat \"Nibbley Pibbleys\".]]\n''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' was developed primarily by Rare employees [[Stamper brothers|Tim Stamper]] and [[Mark Betteridge]]. As with Rare's other NES games, it was executive produced by [[Howard Phillips (consultant)|Howard Phillips]], who soon left [[Nintendo]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Interview: Howard Phillips\">{{cite interview | title=Interview: Howard Phillips (Ex-Nintendo Power Co-Editor) | date=April 14, 2013 | first=Howard | last=Phillips | subject-link=Howard Phillips (consultant) | interviewer=Michael Levy | url=https://www.retrocollect.com/Articles/interview-howard-phillips-ex-nintendo-power-co-editor.html | accessdate=July 9, 2019}}</ref> Stamper worked on the game's graphics and concepts, while Betteridge worked on the game program itself. Most of the ideas behind the game came from Betteridge, who had challenged himself to get the smallest file size for a NES game possible. According to Rare member Brendan Gunn, Betteridge found out how to develop cheap backgrounds that took up little space. After thinking about what and how to move objects on such backgrounds, he came up with the idea for a snake. Much of the game derived from another isometric video game ''[[Marble Madness]]'', of which Rare published the NES version in 1989.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer\">{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |title=A Rare Glimpse |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=84 |date=December 2010 |pages=28\u201343 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=[[Bournemouth]]}}</ref> They also used the same type of high speed scrolling that was used in the NES port of ''Marble Madness'', which, according to a ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' overview of Rare, \"many said couldn't be done on the NES\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The British Invasion \u2013 A Tour of English Developers |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |issue=23 |date=April 1991 |page=46 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]]}}</ref> Rare's future [[Creative Director]], [[Gregg Mayles]], started with the company play-testing ''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll''.

He also composed music for ''[[Wizards & Warriors]]'', ''[[Battletoads]]'', and the ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' series.

The object in each level is to eat enough \"Nibbley Pibbleys\" \u2013 small round creatures found throughout each level \u2013 to gain enough weight to ring a bell on top of a weighing machine located at the end of the level; this causes a door for the next level to open.<ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite journal |last=Regan |first=Matt |last2=Rignall |first2=Julian |authorlink1=Matt Regan |authorlink2=Julian Rignall |title=Nintendo Review: ''Snake Rattle n Roll'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines]] |issue=4 |date=January 1991 |pages=72\u201374 |issn=0960-4952 |oclc=500020318 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=[[Peterborough]]}}</ref> Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat; snakes grow more quickly when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys of their own color, and they grow the most when they eat yellow ones. Located in each level are dispensers which randomly spew out Nibbley Pibbleys; however, they also spew out bombs which can damage the snakes.<ref name=\"Manual5\">Instruction Manual, p. 5.</ref> When a snake reaches a long enough length, the tail begins to flash, which means the snake is heavy enough to exit that level.  At that point, they must find and jump on the scale to ring the bell and open the exit door.<ref name=\"InstructionManual\">Instruction Manual, p. 6.</ref>\n\nEach level contains various obstacles and enemies. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments.<ref name=\"Manual5\" /> Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends when players lose all their lives, but they have several [[continue (video games)|continue]]s in which they can restart the game from where they left off.<ref name=\"Manual7\">Instruction Manual, p. 7.</ref> Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them.<ref name=\"InstructionManual\" /> Players can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, provide extra lives and continues, add time bonuses, award invisibility diamonds, speed up the snakes, or reverse their directional controls.<ref name=\"Manual9\">Instruction Manual, p. 9.</ref> Located throughout the game are \"lids\" (in the shape of manhole covers) which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies.<ref name=\"MeanMachines\" /><ref name=\"Manual12\">Instruction Manual, p. 12.</ref> Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.<ref name=\"Manual12\" />\n\n==Development==\n[[Image:Snakerattlenroll.png|frame|left|''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' features a 3D [[Isometric adventure game|isometric]] playing field in which the snakes must avoid obstacles, collect items, and eat \"Nibbley Pibbleys\".]]\n''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' was developed primarily by Rare employees [[Stamper brothers|Tim Stamper]] and [[Mark Betteridge]]. As with Rare's other NES games, it was executive produced by [[Howard Phillips (consultant)|Howard Phillips]], who soon left [[Nintendo]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Interview: Howard Phillips\">{{cite interview | title=Interview: Howard Phillips (Ex-Nintendo Power Co-Editor) | date=April 14, 2013 | first=Howard | last=Phillips | subject-link=Howard Phillips (consultant) | interviewer=Michael Levy | url=https://www.retrocollect.com/Articles/interview-howard-phillips-ex-nintendo-power-co-editor.html | accessdate=July 9, 2019}}</ref> Stamper worked on the game's graphics and concepts, while Betteridge worked on the game program itself. Most of the ideas behind the game came from Betteridge, who had challenged himself to get the smallest file size for a NES game possible. According to Rare member Brendan Gunn, Betteridge found out how to develop cheap backgrounds that took up little space. After thinking about what and how to move objects on such backgrounds, he came up with the idea for a snake. Much of the game derived from another isometric video game ''[[Marble Madness]]'', of which Rare published the NES version in 1989.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer\">{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |title=A Rare Glimpse |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=84 |date=December 2010 |pages=28\u201343 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=[[Bournemouth]]}}</ref> They also used the same type of high speed scrolling that was used in the NES port of ''Marble Madness'', which, according to a ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' overview of Rare, \"many said couldn't be done on the NES\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The British Invasion \u2013 A Tour of English Developers |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |issue=23 |date=April 1991 |page=46 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]]}}</ref> Rare's future [[Creative Director]], [[Gregg Mayles]], started with the company play-testing ''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll''.

He also composed music for ''[[Wizards & Warriors]]'', ''[[Battletoads]]'', and the ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' series.

Regan praised the game's 3D environment, fun gameplay, and level of humor, as noted by the odd objects such as toilet seats. Rignall called the game's graphics \"stunning, with beautifully drawn scrolling forced perspective 3D backdrops and some great sprites\"; he also lauded the game's playability and simple controls, challenging difficulty, and overall fun factor. Overall, they said ''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' was \"one of the most original games seen in years\" and was \"a firm favourite here in the ''MEAN MACHINES'' offices\".<ref name=\"MeanMachines\" />\n\nThe game received further reviews and praise in other video gaming magazines in 1991. German magazine ''Video Games'' called ''Snake Rattle 'n' Roll'' \"a quaint and original game\" that includes high-quality graphics. The reviewer praised the animations in the characters, especially after the snakes eat Nibbly Pibbleys, and he enjoyed the two-player simultaneous mode; however, he said that the game lacked in variety, though the gameplay and challenge remained consistent throughout the course of the game.<ref name=\"Video Games\" /> Another German magazine, ''[[Power Play (magazine)|Power Play]]'', gave a similar review, and it compared the game to the 1988 Rare game ''[[R.C.

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old. The technical term for \"fraternal\" is \"polyzygotic\".]]\n[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.]]\nTerms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:\n*two offspring \u2013 [[twins]]\n*three offspring \u2013 triplets\n*four offspring \u2013 quadruplets\n*five offspring \u2013 quintuplets\n*six offspring \u2013 sextuplets\n*seven offspring \u2013 septuplets\n*eight offspring \u2013 octuplets\n*nine offspring \u2013 nonuplets\n*ten offspring \u2013 decuplets\n\nTerms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:\n*Monozygotic \u2013 multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single [[zygote]]\n*Polyzygotic \u2013 multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes:\n\n:*Dizygotic \u2013 multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes\n:*Trizygotic \u2013 three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes\n:*Sesquizygotic \u2013 an egg which is fertilized by 2 sperms, which produce 2 fetuses\n\nMultiple pregnancies are also classified by how the fetuses are surrounded by one or more [[placenta]]s and [[amniotic sac]]s; the placentas are referenced as \"chorions\":<ref>{{cite web |title=Glossary: Multiple pregnancy: antenatal care for twin and triplet pregnancies |url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg129/chapter/appendix-e-definitions-of-key-terms |publisher=NICE |date=September 2011}}</ref>\n* Monochorionic fetuses share one placenta; dichorionic twins, trichorionic triplets, etc. each has a separate placenta.\n* Monoamniotic fetuses share one amniotic sac; diamniotic twins each have their own sac, as do triamniotic triplets, etc. \n* There are many combinations possible\u2014for example with dichorionic triamniotic triplets, one fetus has a separate placenta and two of the fetuses share a placenta, and each has its own amniotic sac.\n\n==Human multiple births==\nIn humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than [[gestation]]) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218\u20132225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}</ref>\n\n===Twins===\n{{Main|Twin}}\n\nTwins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bellefonds |first1=Colleen |title=Do Twins Really Run in Families? |url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/twins-and-multiples/do-twins-really-run-in-families/ |website=What to Expect |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Triplets===\n{{further|List of triplets}}\n[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]\n[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|A pediatric nurse checking recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2004]]\n[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nTriplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg. In this case the original zygote divides into two, and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not.\n[[File:2004-03-29 Evangel Triplets 10 cropped.jpg|thumb|Recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria March 29, 2004.]]\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" />\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets).

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available.

One of the twins ([[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]], [[Heracles]]) is the illegitimate son of the god [[Zeus]]; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]).

Out of all the assisted reproductive technology available that is currently in practice, in vitro fertilization has the highest chance of producing multiple offspring. Per each female egg, IVF currently has a 60-70% chance of conceiving. Fertilization is made possible by administering a fertility drug to the eggs or by directly injecting semen into the eggs.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is an increased chance for women over the age of 35 to have multiple births.<ref name=\"pmid16497698\" /> IVF is a common genetic and ethical topic.

[[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bellefonds |first1=Colleen |title=Do Twins Really Run in Families? |url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/twins-and-multiples/do-twins-really-run-in-families/ |website=What to Expect |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Triplets===\n{{further|List of triplets}}\n[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]\n[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|A pediatric nurse checking recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2004]]\n[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nTriplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg. In this case the original zygote divides into two, and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not.\n[[File:2004-03-29 Evangel Triplets 10 cropped.jpg|thumb|Recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria March 29, 2004.]]\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" />\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets).

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available.

One of the twins ([[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]], [[Heracles]]) is the illegitimate son of the god [[Zeus]]; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called ''[[superfecundation#Use in mythology|superfecundation]]''.\n\nIn certain medieval European [[chivalric romance]]s, such as [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Le Fresne (lai)|Le Fresne]]'', a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children.<ref>Laura A.

Out of all the assisted reproductive technology available that is currently in practice, in vitro fertilization has the highest chance of producing multiple offspring. Per each female egg, IVF currently has a 60-70% chance of conceiving. Fertilization is made possible by administering a fertility drug to the eggs or by directly injecting semen into the eggs.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is an increased chance for women over the age of 35 to have multiple births.<ref name=\"pmid16497698\" /> IVF is a common genetic and ethical topic. Through IVF individuals can produce offspring successfully when natural procreation is not viable. However, in vitro can become genetically specific and allow for the selection of particular genes or expressible traits to be dominantly present in the formed embryo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigalos|first=George \u0391.|last2=Triantafyllidou|first2=Olga|last3=Vlahos|first3=Nikos F.|date=2016-09-15|title=Novel embryo selection techniques to increase embryo implantation in IVF attempts|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|volume=294|issue=6|pages=1117\u20131124|doi=10.1007/s00404-016-4196-5|pmid=27628754|issn=0932-0067}}</ref> Ethical dilemmas arise when determining health care coverage and the deviation from natural selection and gene variations.

[[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.
