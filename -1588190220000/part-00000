The previous event was the [[March 1997 lunar eclipse]], being slightly partial.\n\n== Duration==\nTotality lasted only 4 minutes and 44 seconds,<ref>http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2015Apr04T.pdf</ref> making it the shortest lunar totality in almost five centuries since 17 October 1529 (which lasted 1 minute and 42 seconds). Due to the oblateness of the Earth, it may have actually just been a partial eclipse.<ref>http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/the-lunar-eclipse-wasnt-total-after-all-04062015/</ref>. It was the sixth total lunar eclipse out of nine with totality under 5 minutes in a five millennium period between 2,000 BC and 3,000 AD. The eclipsed moon was 12.9% smaller in apparent diameter than the supermoon [[September 2015 lunar eclipse]], measured as 29.66' and 33.47' in diameter from the center of the earth. It occurred 3 days before [[apogee]] at 29.42'.\n:[[File:Supermoon lunar eclipse 2015.png|320px]]\n\n== Visibility ==\nThe eclipse was visible across the Pacific, including all of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. It was visible near sunrise for [[North America]], and after sunset for eastern Asia including [[India]].\n{|\n|[[File:Lunar eclipse from moon-2015Apr04.png|320px]]<BR>View of earth from moon at greatest eclipse\n|}\n\n===Map===\n[[File:Visibility Lunar Eclipse 2015-04-04.png|480px]]\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{main|Lunar eclipse}}\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes within Earth's [[umbra]] (shadow). As the eclipse begins, Earth's shadow first darkens the Moon slightly. Then, the shadow begins to \"cover\" part of the Moon, turning it a dark red-brown color (typically - the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions). The Moon appears to be reddish because of [[Rayleigh scattering]] (the same effect that causes sunsets to appear reddish) and the refraction of that light by Earth's atmosphere into its umbra.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visual Appearance of Lunar Eclipses|work=NASA|author=Fred Espenak and Jean Meeus|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/appearance.html|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following simulation shows the approximate appearance of the Moon passing through Earth's shadow. The Moon's brightness is exaggerated within the umbral shadow. The southern portion of the Moon will be closest to the center of the shadow, making it darkest, and most red in appearance.\n\n[[File:Animation April 4 2015 lunar eclipse appearance.gif]]\n\n==Timing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Local times of contacts\n|- valign=top\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2| Time Zone<BR>adjustments from<BR>[[UTC]]\n!

It is the former of two total lunar eclipses in 2015, and the third in a [[Tetrad (astronomy)|''tetrad'']] (four total lunar eclipses in series). Other eclipses in the tetrad are those of [[April 2014 lunar eclipse|15 April 2014]], [[October 2014 lunar eclipse|8 October 2014]], and [[September 2015 lunar eclipse|28 September 2015]].\n\nThis is the 30th member of [[Lunar Saros 132]], and the first total eclipse. The previous event was the [[March 1997 lunar eclipse]], being slightly partial.\n\n== Duration==\nTotality lasted only 4 minutes and 44 seconds,<ref>http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2015Apr04T.pdf</ref> making it the shortest lunar totality in almost five centuries since 17 October 1529 (which lasted 1 minute and 42 seconds). Due to the oblateness of the Earth, it may have actually just been a partial eclipse.<ref>http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/the-lunar-eclipse-wasnt-total-after-all-04062015/</ref>. It was the sixth total lunar eclipse out of nine with totality under 5 minutes in a five millennium period between 2,000 BC and 3,000 AD. The eclipsed moon was 12.9% smaller in apparent diameter than the supermoon [[September 2015 lunar eclipse]], measured as 29.66' and 33.47' in diameter from the center of the earth. It occurred 3 days before [[apogee]] at 29.42'.\n:[[File:Supermoon lunar eclipse 2015.png|320px]]\n\n== Visibility ==\nThe eclipse was visible across the Pacific, including all of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. It was visible near sunrise for [[North America]], and after sunset for eastern Asia including [[India]].\n{|\n|[[File:Lunar eclipse from moon-2015Apr04.png|320px]]<BR>View of earth from moon at greatest eclipse\n|}\n\n===Map===\n[[File:Visibility Lunar Eclipse 2015-04-04.png|480px]]\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{main|Lunar eclipse}}\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes within Earth's [[umbra]] (shadow). As the eclipse begins, Earth's shadow first darkens the Moon slightly. Then, the shadow begins to \"cover\" part of the Moon, turning it a dark red-brown color (typically - the color can vary based on atmospheric conditions). The Moon appears to be reddish because of [[Rayleigh scattering]] (the same effect that causes sunsets to appear reddish) and the refraction of that light by Earth's atmosphere into its umbra.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visual Appearance of Lunar Eclipses|work=NASA|author=Fred Espenak and Jean Meeus|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/appearance.html|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following simulation shows the approximate appearance of the Moon passing through Earth's shadow. The Moon's brightness is exaggerated within the umbral shadow. The southern portion of the Moon will be closest to the center of the shadow, making it darkest, and most red in appearance.\n\n[[File:Animation April 4 2015 lunar eclipse appearance.gif]]\n\n==Timing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Local times of contacts\n|- valign=top\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2| Timezone<BR>adjustments from<BR>[[UTC]]\n!
