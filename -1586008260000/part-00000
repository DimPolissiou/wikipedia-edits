RFE was founded as an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] propaganda source in 1949 by the [[National Committee for a Free Europe]]. RL was founded two years later and the two organizations merged in 1976.  Communist governments frequently sent agents to infiltrate RFE's headquarters, and the [[KGB]] regularly [[radio jamming|jammed its signals]].

The committee was composed of an \"''A'' list\" of powerful U.S. citizens including former ambassador and first NCFE chairman [[Joseph Grew]]; ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' owner [[DeWitt Wallace]]; former diplomat and the co-founder of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' Dewitt Clinton Poole; and prominent New York [[investment banker]] [[Frank Altschul]].<ref name=\"Puddington 2003 12\">{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=12}}</ref><ref>Weiner, Tim: \"Legacy of Ashes\", p. 36.

Most of this material came from a network of well-connected [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s and interviews with travelers and defectors. RFE did not use paid agents inside the [[Iron Curtain]] and based its bureaus in regions popular with exiles.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=39}}</ref> RFE also extensively monitored [[Warsaw Pact|Communist bloc]] publications and radio services, creating an impressive body of information that would later serve as a resource for organizations across the world.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=40}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its regular broadcasts, RFE spread broadcasts through a series of operations that distributed [[airborne leaflet propaganda|leaflets]] via [[meteorological balloon]]s; one such operation, Prospero, sent messages to [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_using_balloons_to_breach_iron_curtain/1844564.html Using Balloons to Breach The Iron Curtain], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (August 22, 2016).</ref> From October 1951 to November 1956, the skies of Central Europe were filled with more than 350,000 balloons carrying over 300 million leaflets, posters, books, and other printed matter.<ref name=\"Cummings|2008|p=169\"/> The nature of the leaflets varied, and included messages of support and encouragement to citizens suffering under communist oppression, satirical criticisms of communist regimes and leaders, information about dissident movements and human rights campaigns, and messages expressing the solidarity of the American people with the residents of Eastern European nations.

Although some remained on staff for extended periods of time, government authorities discouraged their agents from interfering with broadcast activity, fearing that this could arouse suspicions and detract from their original purpose of gathering information on the radio station's activities. From 1965 to 1971 an agent of the [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]] (Communist Poland's security service) successfully infiltrated the station with an operative, Captain Andrzej Czechowicz. According to former [[Voice of America]] Polish service director Ted Lipien, \"Czechowicz is perhaps the most well known communist-era Polish spy who was still an active agent while working at RFE in the late 1960s. Technically, he was not a journalist. As a historian by training, he worked in the RFE's media analysis service in Munich. After more than five years, Czechowicz returned to Poland in 1971 and participated in programs aimed at embarrassing Radio Free Europe and the United States government.\"<ref>Lipien, Ted (23 June 2007), \"[http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=10038 Old spy scandals still haunting US broadcasters?]\", ''Spero News''.</ref>\n\nOther espionage incidents also included a failed attempt by a Czechoslovak Intelligence Service (StB) agent in 1959 to poison the salt shakers in the organization's cafeteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globeatlantic.org/index.php?option=com_newsfeeds&catid=18&Itemid=49|title=Cummings, Richard, \"The Best Spy Stories of the Cold War\"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313045921/http://www.globeatlantic.org/index.php?option=com_newsfeeds&catid=18&Itemid=49|archivedate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1960, an upheaval in the Czechoslovak service led to a number of dramatic changes in the organization's structure. RFE's New York headquarters could no longer effectively manage their [[Munich]] subsidiary, and as a result major management responsibilities were transferred to Munich, making RFE a European-based organization.<ref>{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=115}}</ref>\n\nPolish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] and Russian reformer [[Grigory Yavlinsky]] would later recall secretly listening to the broadcasts despite the heavy jamming.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=310}}</ref>\n\n===Jamming===\nThe Soviet government turned its efforts towards blocking reception of Western programs. To limit access to foreign broadcasts, the Central Committee decreed that factories should remove all components allowing short wave reception from [[Soviet Union|USSR]]-made radio receivers. However, consumers easily found out that the necessary spare parts were available on the black market while electronics engineers opposing the idea would gladly convert radios back to being able to receive short wave transmissions.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=781}}</ref>\n\nThe most extensive form of reception obstruction was [[radio jamming]].<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=214}}</ref> This was controlled by the [[KGB]], which in turn reported to the Central Committee. Jamming was an expensive and arduous procedure, and its efficacy is still debated. In 1958, the Central Committee mentioned that the sum spent on jamming was greater than the sum spent on domestic and international broadcasting combined.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=786}}</ref> The Central Committee has admitted that circumventing jamming was both possible and practised in the Soviet Union. Due to limited resources, authorities prioritized jamming based on the location, language, time, and theme of Western transmissions.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=783}}</ref> Highly political programs in Russian, broadcast at prime time to urban centers, were perceived as the most dangerous. Seen as less politically threatening, Western music such as [[jazz]] was often transmitted unjammed.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=784}}</ref> The intensity of jamming fluctuated over time. During and after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in late 1962, jamming was intensified. The Cuban Missile Crisis, however, was followed by a five-year period when the jamming of most foreign broadcasters ceased, only to intensify again with the Prague Spring in 1968. It ceased again in 1973, when [[Henry Kissinger]] became the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]]. The end to jamming came abruptly on 21 November 1988 when  Soviet and Eastern European jamming of virtually all foreign broadcasts including RFE/RL services ceased at 21:00 CET.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=A.

Although its non-governmental status spared it from full scale [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] investigations, several RFE journalists including the director of the Czech service, [[Ferdinand Peroutka]], were accused of being soft on Communism.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=83}}</ref> [[Fulton Lewis]], a U.S. [[radio commentator]] and fervent anti-communist, was one of RFE's sharpest critics throughout the 1950s. His critical broadcasts inspired other journalists to investigate the inner workings of the organization including its connection to the CIA. When its CIA ties were exposed in the 1960s, funding responsibility shifted to Congress.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1-JjwDPcOLQC \"Historical dictionary of American propaganda\"], Martin J.

Further investigation into the CIA's funding activities revealed its connection to both RFE and RL, sparking significant media outrage.<ref name=\"Mickelson 1983 126\"/>\n\nIn 1971 the radio stations came under public spotlight once again when prominent [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Clifford Case]] introduced [[Senate Bill]] 18, which would have removed funding for RFE and RL from the CIA's budget, appropriated $30 million to pay for [[fiscal year]] 1972 activities, and required the State Department to temporarily oversee the radio stations.<ref name=\"Puddington, Arch 2003\"/> This was only a temporary solution, however, as the State Department was reluctant to take on such a significant long-term responsibility.\n\nIn May 1972 President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed a [[Presidential Commission (United States)|special commission]] to deliberate RFE/RL's future.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=209}}</ref> The commission proposed that funding come from the United States Congress and that a new organization, the [[Board for International Broadcasting]] (BIB) would simultaneously link the stations and the federal government, and serve as an editorial buffer between them.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=210}}</ref>\n\nAlthough both radio stations initially received most of their funding from the CIA, RFE maintained a strong sense of autonomy. Under [[Cord Meyer]], the CIA officer in charge of overseeing broadcast services from 1954 to 1971, the CIA took a position of minimal government interference in radio affairs and programming.<ref name=\"Puddington 2003 30\"/>\n\nThe CIA stopped funding Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in 1972.<ref name=\"Puddington, Arch 2003\">{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=196}}</ref> In 1974 they came under the control of an organization called the [[Board for International Broadcasting]] (BIB).

President [[Ronald Reagan]], a fervent opponent of Communism, urged the stations to be more critical of the communist regimes. This presented a challenge to RFE/RL's broadcast strategy, which had been very cautious since the controversy over its alleged role in the Hungarian Revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=254}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era in the Soviet Union, RFE/RL worked hand in hand with [[Glasnost]] and benefited significantly from the Soviet Union's new openness. Gorbachev stopped the practice of jamming the broadcasts, and dissident politicians and officials could be freely interviewed by RFE/RL for the first time without fearing persecution or imprisonment.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=287}}</ref> By 1990 Radio Liberty had become the most listened-to Western radio station broadcasting to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=209}}</ref>\n\nIts coverage of the 1991 [[August coup]] enriched sparse domestic coverage of the event and drew in a wide audience from throughout the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=216}}</ref> The broadcasts allowed Gorbachev and [[Boris Yeltsin]] to stay in touch with the Russian people during this turbulent period.  Boris Yeltsin later expressed his gratitude through a [[presidential decree]] allowing Radio Liberty to open a permanent bureau in Moscow.<ref>{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=219}}</ref>\n\nRFE/RL also played a significant role in the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], which brought an end to the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Following the [[Velvet Revolution#Friday, November 17, 1989|November 17 demonstrations]] and brutal crackdown by Czechoslovak riot police, RFE/RL's Czechoslovak service reported that a student, [[Martin \u0160m\u00edd]], had been killed during the clashes. Although the report later turned out to be false \u2013 \u0160mid was alive and well \u2013 the story is credited by many sources with inspiring Czechoslovak citizens to join the subsequent (larger) demonstrations which eventually brought down the communist government.\n\nUpon hearing about the story, RFE/RL did not run it immediately, but attempted to find a second corroborating source for the story, as per official RFE/RL policy. While a second source was never found, RFE/RL eventually decided to run the story of \u0160m\u00edd's death after it was reported by several major news organizations, including [[Reuters]], the [[Associated Press]], and the [[Voice of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_smid_death_story/1879520.html|title=Unraveling the \u0160mid death story|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Pavel Pech\u00e1\u010dek, the director of RFE/RL's Czechoslovak service at the time, was mistakenly granted a visa to enter the country by the Czechoslovak authorities prior to the demonstrations. He reported live from the demonstrations in [[Wenceslas Square]], and was virtually the only reporter covering the events fully and openly in the Czech language for a Czech audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_front_row_seat_to_revolution/1881688.html|title=Front Row Seat To The Revolution|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==After the dissolution of the Soviet Union==\nIn 1995, RFE/RL moved its headquarters from Munich to Prague, to the building of the [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovak Federal Assembly]], which had been unoccupied since the 1992 [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]]. The [[Clinton Administration]] reduced funding significantly and placed the service under the [[United States Information Agency]]'s oversight.<ref name=\"Puddington 2003 30\">{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=30}}</ref>\n\nRFE/RL ended broadcasts to [[Hungary]] in 1993 and stopped broadcasts to [[Poland]] in 1997. In the late 1990s RFE/RL launched broadcast to [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]] in Albanian and to [[North Macedonia]] in Macedonian. Broadcast to the [[Czech Republic]] proceeded for three more years under the agreement with Czech Radio. In 2004 RFE/RL stopped broadcasting to [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]]. However, on January 31, 2004, RFE/RL launched broadcasts to the former [[Yugoslavia]] in Serbo-Croatian (Serbian-Croatian-Bosnian-Montenegrin).\n\n[[File:Vinohradsk\u00e1 str, Prague Vinohrady.jpg|thumb|250px|In 1994\u20132008, RFE/RL used the former [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Federal Parliament]] building of the abolished [[Czechoslovakia]] in [[New Town, Prague|Prague New Town]].

Although some remained on staff for extended periods of time, government authorities discouraged their agents from interfering with broadcast activity, fearing that this could arouse suspicions and detract from their original purpose of gathering information on the radio station's activities. From 1965 to 1971 an agent of the [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]] (Communist Poland's security service) successfully infiltrated the station with an operative, Captain Andrzej Czechowicz. According to former [[Voice of America]] Polish service director Ted Lipien, \"Czechowicz is perhaps the most well known communist-era Polish spy who was still an active agent while working at RFE in the late 1960s. Technically, he was not a journalist. As a historian by training, he worked in the RFE's media analysis service in Munich. After more than five years, Czechowicz returned to Poland in 1971 and participated in programs aimed at embarrassing Radio Free Europe and the United States government.\"<ref>Lipien, Ted (23 June 2007), \"[http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=10038 Old spy scandals still haunting US broadcasters?]\", ''Spero News''.</ref>\n\nOther espionage incidents also included a failed attempt by a Czechoslovak Intelligence Service (StB) agent in 1959 to poison the salt shakers in the organization's cafeteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globeatlantic.org/index.php?option=com_newsfeeds&catid=18&Itemid=49|title=Cummings, Richard, \"The Best Spy Stories of the Cold War\"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313045921/http://www.globeatlantic.org/index.php?option=com_newsfeeds&catid=18&Itemid=49|archivedate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1960, an upheaval in the Czechoslovak service led to a number of dramatic changes in the organization's structure. RFE's New York headquarters could no longer effectively manage their [[Munich]] subsidiary, and as a result major management responsibilities were transferred to Munich, making RFE a European-based organization.<ref>{{harvnb|Mickelson|1983|p=115}}</ref>\n\nPolish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] and Russian reformer [[Grigory Yavlinsky]] would later recall secretly listening to the broadcasts despite the heavy jamming.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=310}}</ref>\n\n===Jamming===\nThe Soviet government turned its efforts towards blocking reception of Western programs. To limit access to foreign broadcasts, the Central Committee decreed that factories should remove all components allowing short wave reception from [[Soviet Union|USSR]]-made radio receivers. However, consumers easily found out that the necessary spare parts were available on the black market while electronics engineers opposing the idea would gladly convert radios back to being able to receive short wave transmissions.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=781}}</ref>\n\nThe most extensive form of reception obstruction was [[radio jamming]].<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=214}}</ref> This was controlled by the [[KGB]], which in turn reported to the Central Committee. Jamming was an expensive and arduous procedure, and its efficacy is still debated. In 1958, the Central Committee mentioned that the sum spent on jamming was greater than the sum spent on domestic and international broadcasting combined.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=786}}</ref> The Central Committee has admitted that circumventing jamming was both possible and practised in the Soviet Union. Due to limited resources, authorities prioritized jamming based on the location, language, time, and theme of Western transmissions.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=783}}</ref> Highly political programs in Russian, broadcast at prime time to urban centers, were perceived as the most dangerous. Seen as less politically threatening, Western music such as [[jazz]] was often transmitted unjammed.<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkonen|2010|p=784}}</ref> The intensity of jamming fluctuated over time. During and after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in late 1962, jamming was intensified. The Cuban Missile Crisis, however, was followed by a five-year period when the jamming of most foreign broadcasters ceased, only to intensify again with the Prague Spring in 1968. It ceased again in 1973, when [[Henry Kissinger]] became the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]]. The end to jamming came abruptly on 21 November 1988 when  Soviet and Eastern European jamming of virtually all foreign broadcasts including RFE/RL services ceased at 21:00 CET.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=A.

Although its non-governmental status spared it from full scale [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] investigations, several RFE journalists including the director of the Czech service, [[Ferdinand Peroutka]], were accused of being soft on Communism.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=83}}</ref> [[Fulton Lewis]], a U.S. [[radio commentator]] and fervent anti-communist, was one of RFE's sharpest critics throughout the 1950s. His critical broadcasts inspired other journalists to investigate the inner workings of the organization including its connection to the CIA. When its CIA ties were exposed in the 1960s, funding responsibility shifted to Congress.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1-JjwDPcOLQC \"Historical dictionary of American propaganda\"], Martin J.

Further investigation into the CIA's funding activities revealed its connection to both RFE and RL, sparking significant media outrage.<ref name=\"Mickelson 1983 126\"/>\n\nIn 1971 the radio stations came under public spotlight once again when prominent [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Clifford Case]] introduced [[Senate Bill]] 18, which would have removed funding for RFE and RL from the CIA's budget, appropriated $30 million to pay for [[fiscal year]] 1972 activities, and required the State Department to temporarily oversee the radio stations.<ref name=\"Puddington, Arch 2003\"/> This was only a temporary solution, however, as the State Department was reluctant to take on such a significant long-term responsibility.\n\nIn May 1972 President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed a [[Presidential Commission (United States)|special commission]] to deliberate RFE/RL's future.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=209}}</ref> The commission proposed that funding come from the United States Congress and that a new organization, the [[Board for International Broadcasting]] (BIB) would simultaneously link the stations and the federal government, and serve as an editorial buffer between them.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=210}}</ref>\n\nAlthough both radio stations initially received most of their funding from the CIA, RFE maintained a strong sense of autonomy. Under [[Cord Meyer]], the CIA officer in charge of overseeing broadcast services from 1954 to 1971, the CIA took a position of minimal government interference in radio affairs and programming.<ref name=\"Puddington 2003 30\"/>\n\nThe CIA stopped funding Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in 1972.<ref name=\"Puddington, Arch 2003\">{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=196}}</ref> In 1974 they came under the control of an organization called the [[Board for International Broadcasting]] (BIB).

President [[Ronald Reagan]], a fervent opponent of Communism, urged the stations to be more critical of the communist regimes. This presented a challenge to RFE/RL's broadcast strategy, which had been very cautious since the controversy over its alleged role in the Hungarian Revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=254}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era in the Soviet Union, RFE/RL worked hand in hand with [[Glasnost]] and benefited significantly from the Soviet Union's new openness. Gorbachev stopped the practice of jamming the broadcasts, and dissident politicians and officials could be freely interviewed by RFE/RL for the first time without fearing persecution or imprisonment.<ref>{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=287}}</ref> By 1990 Radio Liberty had become the most listened-to Western radio station broadcasting to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=209}}</ref>\n\nIts coverage of the 1991 [[August coup]] enriched sparse domestic coverage of the event and drew in a wide audience from throughout the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=216}}</ref> The broadcasts allowed Gorbachev and [[Boris Yeltsin]] to stay in touch with the Russian people during this turbulent period.  Boris Yeltsin later expressed his gratitude through a [[presidential decree]] allowing Radio Liberty to open a permanent bureau in Moscow.<ref>{{harvnb|Sosin|1999|p=219}}</ref>\n\nRFE/RL also played a significant role in the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], which brought an end to the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Following the [[Velvet Revolution#Friday, November 17, 1989|November 17 demonstrations]] and brutal crackdown by Czechoslovak riot police, RFE/RL's Czechoslovak service reported that a student, [[Martin \u0160m\u00edd]], had been killed during the clashes. Although the report later turned out to be false \u2013 \u0160mid was alive and well \u2013 the story is credited by many sources with inspiring Czechoslovak citizens to join the subsequent (larger) demonstrations which eventually brought down the communist government.\n\nUpon hearing about the story, RFE/RL did not run it immediately, but attempted to find a second corroborating source for the story, as per official RFE/RL policy. While a second source was never found, RFE/RL eventually decided to run the story of \u0160m\u00edd's death after it was reported by several major news organizations, including [[Reuters]], the [[Associated Press]], and the [[Voice of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_smid_death_story/1879520.html|title=Unraveling the \u0160mid death story|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Pavel Pech\u00e1\u010dek, the director of RFE/RL's Czechoslovak service at the time, was mistakenly granted a visa to enter the country by the Czechoslovak authorities prior to the demonstrations. He reported live from the demonstrations in [[Wenceslas Square]], and was virtually the only reporter covering the events fully and openly in the Czech language for a Czech audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/off_mic_front_row_seat_to_revolution/1881688.html|title=Front Row Seat To The Revolution|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==After the dissolution of the Soviet Union==\nIn 1995, RFE/RL moved its headquarters from Munich to Prague, to the building of the [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovak Federal Assembly]], which had been unoccupied since the 1992 [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]]. The [[Clinton Administration]] reduced funding significantly and placed the service under the [[United States Information Agency]]'s oversight.<ref name=\"Puddington 2003 30\">{{harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=30}}</ref>\n\nRFE/RL ended broadcasts to [[Hungary]] in 1993 and stopped broadcasts to [[Poland]] in 1997. In the late 1990s RFE/RL launched broadcast to [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]] in Albanian and to [[North Macedonia]] in Macedonian. Broadcast to the [[Czech Republic]] proceeded for three more years under the agreement with Czech Radio. In 2004 RFE/RL stopped broadcasting to [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]]. However, on January 31, 2004, RFE/RL launched broadcasts to the former [[Yugoslavia]] in Serbo-Croatian (Serbian-Croatian-Bosnian-Montenegrin).\n\n[[File:Vinohradsk\u00e1 str, Prague Vinohrady.jpg|thumb|250px|In 1994\u20132008, RFE/RL used the former [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|Federal Parliament]] building of the abolished [[Czechoslovakia]] in [[New Town, Prague|Prague New Town]].

They first appear during the [[Early Pennsylvanian]] epoch (i.e.: ''[[Archaeothyris]]'', and perhaps an even earlier genus, ''[[Protoclepsydrops]]''), and represent just one of the many stages in the acquiring of mammal-like characteristics (Kemp 1982), in contrast to their earlier amniote ancestors.  The [[synapomorphy|defining characteristics]] which separate these animals from the [[Caseasauria]] (also pelycosaurs) are based on details of proportion of certain bones of the [[skull]].  These include a long, narrow [[Skull#Temporal fenestrae|supratemporal bone]] (in contrast to caseasaurs where this bone is almost as wide as it is long), and a [[frontal bone]] with a wider connection to the upper margin of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] (Laurin and Reisz 1997).\n\n==Evolution==\nMany non-therapsid eupelycosaurs were the dominant land animals from the latest [[Carboniferous]] to the end of the [[Cisuralian|Early Permian]] epoch. [[Ophiacodontids]] were common from their appearance in the late [[Carboniferous]] ([[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]]) to the early Permian, but they became progressively smaller as the early Permian progressed. The [[edaphosaurids]], along with the [[caseids]], were the dominant [[herbivore]]s in the early part of the Permian, ranging from the size of a [[pig]] to the size of a [[rhinoceros]]. The most renowned edaphosaurid is ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'', a large [{{convert|10|-|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}] herbivore which had a sail on its back, probably used for thermoregulation and mating. [[Sphenacodontidae|Sphenacodontid]]s, a family of carnivorous eupelycosaurs, included the famous ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', which is sometimes mistaken for a [[dinosaur]], and was the largest predator of the period. Like ''Edaphosaurus'', ''Dimetrodon'' also had a distinctive sail on its back, and it probably served the same purpose - regulating heat. The [[Varanopidae|varanopid]] family passingly resembled today's [[monitor lizard]]s and may have had the same lifestyle.<ref>[http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/Unit390/000.html Paleos Synapsida] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060313/http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/Unit390/000.html |date=2006-03-13 }}</ref>\n\n[[Therapsids]] descended from a clade closely related to the sphenacodontids.

The national defense also assures the fulfillment of the international military agreements of the State, accordingly with the national interest.\n\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces are responsible for the military defense, which is the military component of the national defense.\n\n===The Armed Forces===\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces are an essential pillar of the national defense and are the structure of the State that has as its main mission the military defense of the Republic. They obey to the competent bodies of sovereignty, accordingly with the [[Constitution of Portugal|Constitution]] and the [[Law of Portugal|law]], being integrated in the State direct administration through the Ministry of National Defense. The bodies of State directly responsible for the national defense and the Armed Forces are the following:\n* [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]]\n* [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]]\n* [[Government of Portugal|Government]]\n* Superior Council of National Defense\n\nThe [[Ministry of National Defense (Portugal)|Minister of National Defense]] is the political responsible for the elaboration and execution of the military component of the national defense policy, for the administration of the Armed Forces and for the results of their employment.\n\n===System of forces===\n[[File:Exercise TRIDENT JUNCTURE (22778497686).jpg|thumb|350px|A female soldier of the Portuguese Armed Forces in position, with her Hecker and Koch G3 Rifle, during a field exercise]] \nThe system of forces defines the set of capacities that should exist for the fulfillment of the missions of the Armed Forces. It encompasses the set of systems of forces of all branches of the Armed Forces. The system of forces includes two components:\n* Operational component - includes the set of assets and forces to be employed operationally. It is the dynamic part of the system of forces, including mainly deployable elements, such as [[frigate]]s, infantry [[battalion]]s and [[squadron (aviation)|flying squadrons]]. The operational component includes also some non-deployable operational command bodies. \n* Fix component - is the set of commands, units, establishments, bodies and services that are essential to the organization and general support of the Armed Forces and their branches. It is the static part of the system of forces, including only non-deployable elements, such as [[naval base|naval facilities]], [[regiment]]s and [[air base]]s.\n\n===Structure of the armed forces===\nThe Portuguese armed forces' structure includes:\n* the General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMGFA)\n* the three branches of the Armed Forces: [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], [[Portuguese Army|Army]] and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]\n* the military bodies of command: Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMGFA), the Chief of Staff of the Navy, the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force\n* the military bodies of advisement\n\n===Guidelines===\nThe Armed Forces activity is mainly defined and oriented by the following strategic guidelines:\n* The National Defense Law (''Lei da Defesa Nacional'', LDN) defines the general guidelines of the national defense, including the concept of national defense, the national defense policy, the responsibilities of the several bodies of State regarding national defense, the assignments and general structure of the Ministry of National Defense and of the Armed Forces, the participation of the citizens in the Homeland defense and the situation of State of War. The LDN is regularly updated, with the present version being the Law 21-A/2006.\n* The Strategic Concept of National Defense (''Conceito Estrat\u00e9gico de Defesa Nacional'', CEDN) is the component of the national defense policy which defines the State's priorities in terms of defense, accordingly with the national interest. The present version of the CEDN was approved by the [[Council of Ministers of Portugal|Council of Ministers]] through its Resolution 19/2013.\n* The Organic Basic Law of the Organization of the Armed Forces (''Lei Org\u00e2nica de Bases da Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das For\u00e7as Armadas'', LOBOFA) defines the organization of the Armed Forces. The present version of the LOBOFA is the Organic Law 1-A/2009.\n* The Strategic Military Concept (''Conceito Estrat\u00e9gico Militar'', CEM) \u2013 due to the Strategic Concept of National Defense, it defines the conceptual guidelines of actuation of the Armed Forces and the general guidelines for its preparation, employment and sustainment. It is elaborated by the Council of Chiefs of Staff, approved by the Minister of National Defense and confirmed by the Superior Council of National Defense. The present CEM in force is the CEM 2014.\n* The Military Programming Law (''Lei de Programa\u00e7\u00e3o Militar'', LPM) establishes the programming of the public investment of the Armed Forces in terms of armament and equipment, for the modernization and operationalization of the system of forces, through the building of their capacities. The present version of the LPM is the Organic Law 7/2015.\n\n==Current deployments==\nThe national deployed forces (''for\u00e7as nacionais destacadas'' or FND) are units or teams deployed by the Portuguese Armed Forces in foreign missions, mostly in the scope of NATO, the United Nations or the European Union.

Since the early beginning, the Kingdom had naval and ground forces. The Portuguese Navy exists as a permanent force since 1317, however non-permanent naval forces existed already before, with their first known naval engagement occurring in 1180. The Portuguese ground forces were established as a [[standing army]] in 1570, however they had existed since the 12th century, as the non-permanent [[hueste|''hoste'']]. The Navy and the Army would remain independent from each other for hundreds of years.\n\nBy the early 20th century, some joint military and national defense bodies had been created but these had mostly mere political coordination responsibilities. The administration of the several forces of the military remained in charge of separate [[Ministry (government department)|government departments]], respectively the [[Navy Ministry (Portugal)|Navy Ministry]] for the Navy (''Marinha''), the [[War Ministry (Portugal)|War Ministry]] for the Metropolitan Army (''Ex\u00e9rcito Metropolitano'') and the [[Overseas Ministry (Portugal)|Colonies Ministry]] for the Colonial Military Forces (''For\u00e7as Militares Coloniais''). Operationally, the service branches were also completely independent from each other, with totally separated chains of command.\n\nDuring the 1930s, plans were laid to merge all of the previously mentioned ministries under a single defense ministry. However, the service branches lobbies for the maintenance of their autonomy \u2013 represented by their separate government departments \u2013 politically opposed and were able to block this reorganization for the next couple of decades.\n\nNevertheless, the need to defend the [[Portuguese Empire|Overseas Empire]] against possible foreign aggression during [[World War II]], did lead to a significant step being taken during this period for an increased integration of the several military services, when the Colonial Military Forces were placed under the dependency of the War Ministry, which then became in charge of all Portuguese ground forces (metropolitan and colonial).\n\n===Establishment of the unified Armed Forces===\nLessons learned from World War II, the start of the [[Cold War]] and the creation of [[NATO]] (which Portugal integrated as a founding member<ref>{{cite web|title=MILESTONES: 1945\u20131952|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/nato|website=history.state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>) partially ended the objections for the creation of a joint command for the military forces. In 1950, the roles of Minister of National Defense and of [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of Portugal#The Chief of the General Staff|Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces]] (CEMGFA) are created.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historial \u2013 O p\u00f3s guerra|url=http://www.exercito.pt/EP/Paginas/historial/22.aspx|website=exercito.pt|publisher=Ex\u00e9rcito Portugu\u00eas|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107141450/http://www.exercito.pt/EP/Paginas/historial/22.aspx|archivedate=7 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> To the CEMGFA were given almost all the responsibilities until then assigned to the majors-generals of the Navy and of the Army (service branches military commanders), whose roles were at the same time extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decreto-lei 37909|url=https://dre.pt/application/file/481065|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> This can be considered the beginning of the existence of the Portuguese Armed Forces as an unified organization.\n[[File:Fap-instrucao-pilotos-north-american-t-6-texan.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Training of pilots of the Portuguese Armed Forces in the early 1960s, in [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 aircraft]]]]\nHowever, opposition from both of the then existing military branches prevented the formation of a single ministry for the military. The political solution for this was to keep the existing Navy and Army ministries and to create the role of Minister of National Defense but without its own ministry, instead integrating the [[Cabinet of Portugal|Government's Presidency Office]]. The Minister of National Defense directed an [[umbrella organization]], named the National Defense Department which included the CEMGFA, the General Secretariat of National Defense (SGDN, ''Secretariado-Geral da Defesa Nacional'') and the Under-Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics (''Subsecretariado de Estado da Aeron\u00e1utica''). As the Navy and Army ministers continued to exist and to administer their own branches, the Minister of Defense had merely coordinating roles regarding the Navy and the Army. The SGDN served as the Defense staff support organization, being headed by the CEMGFA. It was foreseen to be remodeled in order to be transformed in the general staff and joint management body of the Armed Forces, but this transformation would only occur in 1974, when the SGDN became the General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMGFA).\n\nDespite all the challenges, the operational integration of the Armed Forces rapidly progressed in the 1950s. As part of this integration, the role of [[commander-in-chief]] was established in each of the Overseas territories, as a permanent unified commander of the local forces of the three branches. Mainly during the Overseas War, these commanders-in-chief would assume increasing responsibilities, until achieving full operational command of all forces assigned to their [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]], leaving the territorial service branch leadership with mere logistical responsibilities.\n \nThe Military Aeronautics (Army aviation branch) \u2013 which already had a high degree of autonomy since 1937 \u2013 becomes an entirely separate branch of service of the Armed Forces in 1952, at the same time starting to control the [[Portuguese Naval Aviation]] (Navy aviation service). This third branch of the Armed Forces would soon become officially designated \"Portuguese Air Force\" (''For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Portuguesa''), with the fully integration of the previous Naval Aviation becoming complete in 1958. Unlike the other services which had their own separate ministries, the Air Force was under the fully dependency of the Minister of National Defense via the Under-Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics. In 1961, the status of this department would be upgraded, it becoming the Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics.\n\nIn 1953, the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]] ceased policing the military, with the establishment of the [[Army Police (Portugal)|Military Police]] by the Army.<ref>{{cite web|title=Regimento de Lanceiros N\u00ba2 \u2013 Historial|url=http://www.exercito.pt/sites/RL2/Historial/Paginas/default.aspx|website=exercito.pt|publisher=Ex\u00e9rcito Portugu\u00eas|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref> Later, the other service branches would create their respective [[military police]] type forces: the [[Pol\u00edcia A\u00e9rea|Air Police]] for the Air Force and the Naval Police for the Navy.\n\n===Overseas conflicts===\n{{Main article|1961 Indian annexation of Goa|Portuguese Colonial War}}\n[[File:AssaltonaMatadaSanga.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Portuguese paratroopers jump from an [[Alouette III]] helicopter in an air-mobile assault in Angola, in the early stages of the Overseas Wars]]\nBetween 1961 and 1974, the Portuguese Armed Forces would be engaged against emerging nationalist movements in several of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese African provinces]]. These set of conflicts are collectively referred as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Overseas War]] in Portugal. In the scope of the Cold War, it was a decisive ideological struggle and armed conflict in African (Portuguese Africa and surrounding nations) and Portuguese European mainland scenarios. Unlike other European nations, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]] did not leave its African overseas provinces during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=PORTUGAL E OS VENTOS DA HIST\u00d3RIA|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=126|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> Several armed independence movements, most prominently led by [[communist parties]] who cooperated under the [[CONCP]] umbrella and pro US groups became active in these areas (especially in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=MAPA DA GUERRA|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=134|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces were able to maintain a large [[military campaign]] for 13 years, in these three different theaters of operations, thousands of kilometers apart from each other and from the European mainland. This was achieved with almost no external support, in contrast with the nationalist movements which were backed by communist countries and even by some western ones. The Army suffered the majority of the casualties with 8290 soldiers killed in action while the Air Force lost 346 airmen and the Navy lost 195 sailors.\n\nDuring the conflict, in each [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]], the operational command of the forces of the navy, army and air force was successively transferred from each territorial service branch command to joint commands, led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in that specific theater. Thus the three branches of the military were able to achieve a high level of operational integration, allowing for an effective cooperation between them, the optimization of their scarce assets and the ability to fight as a single cohesive force. The [[military logistics|logistics]] side however was not able to reach such high levels of integration, mainly because each service branch continued to be administered by its own government department with its own [[supply chain]] and different standards.\n\nDue to the nature of the conflict, [[commando]]-type forces achieved great importance. With the war's evolution, these assumed almost all of the mobile and offensive operations, with the more conventional forces remaining responsible mainly for the defensive assignments. By 1961, each service branch had created its own [[light infantry]] force oriented for asymmetric warfare. The Air Force created the [[Parachute Troops School|Parachute Rifles]] (''Ca\u00e7adores P\u00e1raquedistas'') in 1956,<ref>{{cite web|title=P\u00c1RA-QUEDISTAS|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=320|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> the Army first raised the [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Rifles]] (''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'') in 1960<ref>{{cite web|title=CA\u00c7ADORES|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=152|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> which were later replaced by the [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] (''Comandos'')<ref>{{cite web|title=COMANDOS|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=153|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> in 1962 and the Navy deployed the [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marines]] (''Fuzileiros''), a force reactivated in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|title=FUZILEIROS|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=155|website=guerracolonia.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> The Portuguese military also counted with a number of [[Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War|paramilitary forces]], including the [[Special Groups (Portugal)|Special Groups]] (''Grupos Especiais'') and the [[Flechas|Arrows]] (''Flechas'').\n\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces were also involved in a brief conventional armed conflict with the Indian military, when the latter invaded the [[Portuguese India]] in December 1961. Facing overwhelmingly superior forces and after 36 hours of combat, the Portuguese India Commander-in-Chief, General [[Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Vassalo e Silva|Vassalo e Silva]], surrendered to the [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian Forces]]. Portuguese forces suffered 30 dead and 57 wounded, with almost 5000 personnel being taken as [[prisoners of war]], these being released six months later.

By the summer of 1975, the tension between these was so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. The forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched a further ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 25 November but the Group of Nine, a moderate military faction, immediately initiated a counter-coup. The main episode of this confrontation was the successful assault on the barracks of the left-wing dominated [[2nd Lancers Regiment (Portugal)|Military Police Regiment]] by the moderate forces of the Commando Regiment, resulting in three soldiers [[killed in action]]. The Group of Nine emerged victorious, thus preventing the establishment of a [[Communism|communist]] state in Portugal and ending the period of political instability in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=25 de Novembro, o fim do Ver\u00e3o Quente|url=http://www.areamilitar.net/HistBCR.aspx?N=139|website=areamilitar.net|publisher=\u00c1reamilitar|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of National Defense would be created during this period of instability. However this ministry had no power over the Armed Forces, his role was simply to act as a connection between the military and the Government. It was the [[Revolution Council (Portugal)|Revolution Council]] \u2013 created in 1975, consisting only of military officers and chaired by the President of the Republic \u2013 that had the full control over the Armed Forces, which meant these were completely independent from the civilian administration. The Government military departments (Navy Ministry, Army Ministry and Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics) were disbanded, with each service branch chief of staff assuming the roles of the former ministers, under the coordination of the CEMGFA, to whom was given a status equivalent to that of the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. This organization would remain in place until 1982, when the Revolution Council was disbanded after the first revision to the [[Constitution of Portugal|1976 Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lei n.\u00ba 1/82, de 30 de Setembro|url=http://www.pgdlisboa.pt/leis/lei_mostra_articulado.php?nid=8&tabela=leis|website=pgdlisboa.pt|publisher=Procuradoria-Geral Distrital de Lisboa|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The Armed Forces were again placed under the subordination of the civilian administration, more specifically being integrated in the Ministry of National Defense.\n\nWith the [[decolonization]] and the end of the Overseas War, the Portuguese military would change from an asymmetric war oriented force to a conventional war oriented force, focused in defense of [[Western Europe#Cold War|Western Europe]] from a possible Soviet invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1980s would see the creation of [[special operations]], namely the Army's [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Operations Forces]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Centro de Tropas de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais \u2013 Historial|url=http://www.exercito.pt/sites/CTOE/Historial/Paginas/default.aspx|website=exercito.pt|publisher=Ex\u00e9rcito Portugu\u00eas|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> and the Navy's [[Special Actions Detachment]].<ref>{{cite web|title=O DESTACAMENTO DE AC\u00c7\u00d5ES ESPECIAIS \u2013 Zebros e Skua|url=http://www.operacional.pt/o-destacamento-de-accoes-especiais/|website=operacional.pt|publisher=Operacional \u2013 defesa, for\u00e7as armadas e de seguran\u00e7a|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> In 1990, the Air Force would create Combat Rescue teams (''Resgate em Combate'' or ''RESCOM'') for [[Combat search and rescue|CSAR]] operations but in 2006 these were extinct and replaced by the Force Protection Unit (''Unidade de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o da For\u00e7a'' or ''UPF'') whose mission is to provide security for the Air Force elements deployed on international missions.<ref>{{cite web|title=AFEGANIST\u00c3O: UNIDADE DE PROTEC\u00c7\u00c3O DA FOR\u00c7A EM OPERA\u00c7\u00d5ES|url=http://www.operacional.pt/afeganistao-unidade-de-proteccao-da-forca-em-operacoes/|website=operacional.pt|publisher=Operacional \u2013 defesa, for\u00e7as armadas e de seguran\u00e7a|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Current===\n[[File:020602-F-EF201-020 Portuguese soldiers from the 2nd Armored Division use Chaimite V200 Armored Personnel Carriers to steer their way.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Portuguese National Deployed Force in [[Bosnia]] in 2002]]\nThe collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] triggered a deep transformation of the Armed Forces. They transited from being a conscription based and defensive oriented Armed Forces to gradually becoming a fully professional and [[expeditionary warfare]] oriented force, starting to participate in international missions, most of them under the mandate of the United Nations, the [[European Union]] and the [[NATO]], besides organizing some unilateral missions abroad on their own.\n\nThe conscription was gradually reduced since the early 1990s, with almost no conscripts serving the Armed Forces by the end of that decade. The formal abolishment of the conscription in time of peace for all men was however only implemented in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 118/2004 de 21 Maio|url=http://www.dgap.gov.pt/upload/Legis/2004_dl_118_21_05.pdf|website=dgap.gov.pt|publisher=XV Governo Constitucional de Portugal|accessdate=2 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505160953/http://www.dgap.gov.pt/upload/Legis/2004_dl_118_21_05.pdf|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Portuguese Army deployed a communications battalion to Mozambique, as part of the [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|UNOMOZ]], this being the first participation of the Portuguese Armed Forces in international missions, with a complete military unit. After Mozambique, the Portuguese Military deployed forces to international missions in a number of countries, including Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Timor-Leste, Kosovo, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Lithuania, besides deploying military observers and other individual elements to other countries. Recent Defense policy confirmed the assumption that most considerable operations would be undertaken under international organizations mandates, with Portugal not entering alone in a major military engagement since the 1961\u20131974 overseas conflict.\n\nNonetheless, the Portuguese Military have also conducted a number of unilateral and independent peace-enforcing and humanitarian military missions, namely in Guinea-Bissau (1990, 1998, and 1999) and in Angola (1992). The Operation Crocodile conducted in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 was notable, by evidencing the capacity of the Portuguese Armed Forces \u2013 despite its small size and limitation of means \u2013 to rapidly mount a military operation abroad in a scale that is typically only achievable by major military powers. This operations was mainly aimed at the rescuing of thousands of Portuguese and other foreign nationals caught in the middle of the civil conflict that erupted in Guinea-Bissau and included the deployment of naval and air forces, the landing and occupation of the Port of [[Bissau]] by Portuguese Marines, amphibious and helicopter landings in several places of the Guinean coast for the rescuing of civilians, medical and humanitarian aid to the civil population and the support to the peace talks between the two antagonizing parties.\n\nA Military Programation Law (''Lei de Programa\u00e7\u00e3o Militar'') was launched in 2002 to start the complete modernization of the Armed Forces. Considerable re-equipment of the military started in 2003, led by Defense Minister [[Paulo Portas]], who managed to launch a series of re-equipment programs, including those of new submarines ([[Tridente-class submarine|''Tridente''-class]]), frigates ([[Karel Doorman-class frigate|''Bartolomeu Dias''-class]]) and off shore patrol ships ([[Viana do Castelo-class patrol vessel|Project NPO 2000 / ''Viana do Castelo'' class]]) for the Navy, of armored vehicles ([[Portuguese Pandur|Pandur]]) for the Army and of heavy helicopters ([[AgustaWestland AW101|EH-101]]) for the Air Force. Ironically one of the most basic challenges \u2013 the replacement of the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62\u00d751mm]] [[battle rifle]]s by [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56\u00d745mm]] [[assault rifle]]s \u2013 failed during his mandate due to the soldiers clinging onto their cheap and highly reliable locally made [[F\u00e1brica de Bra\u00e7o de Prata|FBP]] [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]].\n\nSome important re-equipment programs were however latter canceled or suspended mainly due to cuts in the Defense budget, including the building of a [[amphibious transport dock|multipurpose amphibious ship]] (Project NavPoL), the building of coastal patrol ships (Project NPC 2000) and the acquisition of helicopters ([[Eurocopter EC635|EC635]] and [[NHIndustries NH90|NH90]]) for the [[Portuguese Army Light Aviation Unit|Army Light Aviation Unit]]. Another important challenge faced, in terms of equipment, is the lack of funds for the replacement of the [[Alouette III]] helicopters and the [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]] advanced trainer jets of the Air Force, which, if not addressed in due course, may compromise the future capacity of the Armed Forces to continue to do the complete training of their own aircraft pilots.\n\nDespite the financial cuts in Defense, all international missions assigned to the Portuguese military have been fulfilled without limitations.\n\nRecently purchased equipment include new [[main battle tank]]s ([[Leopard 2]]A6) in 2008 and new coastal patrol vessels ([[Flyvefisken-class patrol vessel|''Tejo''-class]]) in 2014. The process acquisition of the ex-French [[French ship Siroco (L9012)|amphibious assault ship ''Siroco'']] \u2013 as an alternative to the suspended NavPoL \u2013 failed in 2015, with the Portuguese Armed Forces continuing not having an asset which allows them to easily deploy forces to abroad on a larger scale, enhancing its expeditionary capacity.\n\nIn the 2010s, the Portuguese Armed Forces created the Immediate Reaction Force (FRI, ''For\u00e7a de Rea\u00e7\u00e3o Imediata''), aimed at providing an autonomous national response capability to intervene abroad in complex situations to conduct operations as the possible of evacuation of Portuguese citizens from countries under crisis or tension. The FRI includes naval, ground, air and special operations components. Its initial core has an operational readiness of 48 hours and has permanently assigned assets of the three branches of the Armed Forces.\n\n=== Future ===\n[[File:MASS DROP-EXCHANGE BETWEEN PARATROOPERS FORCES OF THE MULTINATIONAL BRIGADE- TRIDENT JUNCTURE 2015 EXERCISE (21975886874).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mass drop of Portuguese paratroopers, which will continue to be an important component of the Portuguese Immediate Reaction Force (FRI)]]\nIn April 2013, the [[Portuguese Government]] approved a structural reform of the National Defense, named \"Defense 2020\" (''Defesa 2020'').<ref>{{cite web|title=RESOLU\u00c7\u00c3O DO CONSELHO DE MINISTROS, \"DEFESA 2020\"|url=http://www.operacional.pt/resolucao-do-conselho-de-ministros-defesa-2020/|website=operacional.pt|publisher=Operacional \u2013 defesa, for\u00e7as armadas e de seguran\u00e7a|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> It was done with the objective of defining the level of ambition of the Armed Forces by establishing the guidance parameters for strategic planning, reinforcing the leading responsibility of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in the execution of the approved [[military strategy]], reducing human resources while at the same time improving their management and enhancing the coordination between the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the branches of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of National Defense.\n\nDefense 2020 establishes the existence of three sets of force:\n* Immediate Reaction Force (FRI, ''For\u00e7a de Rea\u00e7\u00e3o Imediata'') \u2013 a rapid action force, focused in missions such as the evacuation of Portuguese citizens in crisis or conflict areas and response in national complex emergency situations.\n* Permanent Forces in Sovereignty Action  (FPAS, ''For\u00e7as Permanentes em A\u00e7\u00e3o de Soberania'') \u2013 forces focused in the continuous missions of national sovereignty or jurisdiction areas of national responsibility, including the air defense, the maritime and aerial patrolling, surveillance and inspection, land surveillance when required, search and rescue and finally the nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological defense, public interest and disaster response.\n* Modular Set of Forces (CMF, ''Conjunto Modular de For\u00e7as'') \u2013 forces assigned to Portuguese international commitments deployed for periods of six months, capable of engaging in three simultaneous minor operations or in a single major operation.

In May 2015, a new Military Programming Law was published, which will regulate the founding of the military investments programs until 2026.

The sustainment of the forces and assets referred before is under the branches of service responsibility, with the respective chiefs of staff being under the CEMGFA dependency for that.\n\nThe branch of service chief of staff who is longer in the function replaces the CEMGFA, in case of his absence or impediment.\n\n===Branches of the Armed Forces===\n[[File:Portuguese Fuzileiros in a boat making a visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) drill during Phoenix Express 2010 (PE-10).jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Visit, board, search, and seizure|VBSS]] action carried by a boarding team of the frigate NRP ''Bartolomeu Dias'' of the Portuguese Navy]]\n[[File:Firing Range of the Portuguese Field Artillery, Trident Juncture 15 (22387967049).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Firing of a [[L118 light gun]] 105 mm howitzer of the Portuguese Army]]\n[[File:Portuguese Navy Rescue Chopper Over the Atlantic (15613348118) (3).jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Search and rescue|SAR]] operation performed by an [[AgustaWestland EH101|EH101]] helicopter of the Portuguese Air Force]]\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces include three branches, these being the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. Created centuries ago, the Navy and the Army are much older than the integrated Armed Forces themselves. The Air Force is however younger, being created as a separate branch already after the establishment of the integrated Armed Forces. The branches of service have as their principal mission to participate, in an integrated form, in the defense of the Republic, in the terms defined by the Constitution and the law, being mainly aimed for the generation, preparation and sustainment of the forces of the operational component of the system of forces. The branches also guarantee their own specific missions established by particular laws and also guarantee the operational missions given to them by the CEMGFA.\n\nThe increasing integration and standardization of the different branches of service meant that their organizations gradually approached. Presently, all the three branches have an identical organizational model that includes: \n* a chief of staff\n* a branch staff\n* central bodies of administration and management\n* a component command\n* bodies of advisement\n* bodies of inspection\n* base bodies \n* elements of the operational component of the system of forces\n\nThe chiefs of staff serve as the branch commanders. The staffs are the bodies for planning and decision support of the respective chiefs of staff, being able also to assume roles of management, control, advisement or inspection. The central bodies of administration and management have a functional character and are intended to guarantee the management and execution in specific fundamental areas and activities as the human, material, financial, information and infrastructures resources management. The component commands (naval, land and air) are intended to support the chiefs of staff in their command roles. The component commands can be put under the direct dependency of the CEMGFA for the exercise of his command roles. The bodies of advisement are intended to support the decision of the chiefs of staff in special and important matters regarding the preparedness, discipline and administration of the branch. The bodies of inspection are intended to support the control and evaluation function of the chiefs of staff. The base bodies are those aimed at the training, the sustainment and the general support of the branch. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces are the forces and assets of the branch intended for the accomplishment of the operational missions.\n\nBesides the above referred standard bodies, the Navy also includes the Hydrographic Institute and the Maritime Search and Rescue Service, while the Air Force also includes the Air Search and Rescue Service.\n\nUntil recently, the Navy also included the National Maritime Authority. Statutorily, the Maritime Authority is now an entirely separate legal entity, but it continues to be headed by the Chief of Staff of the Navy and continues to be mainly administered, supported and staffed by the Navy. The same happens with the National Aeronautic Authority in relation to the Air Force, the difference being that this Authority was already created as a separate legal entity.\n\n===Chiefs of staff of the branches===\nThe chiefs of staff of the Navy, of the Army and of the Air Force command their respective branches, being the military chiefs with the higher authority in each of the branches hierarchy and being the principal advisors of the Minister of National Defense and of the CEMGFA in all matters related with their branches. Inside each branch, the respective chief of staff is the only officer with a [[four-star rank]] (admiral in the Navy and general in the other two branches).\n\nThe chiefs of staff are part of the operational command structure of the Armed Forces, serving as deputy commanders of the CEMGFA. While they report to the CEMGFA in the operational, military intelligence and security, military higher learning, military health and other joint matters, they report directly to the Minister of National Defense in the matters related with the current management of their branches resources.\n\nThe chiefs of staff of the branches are appointed by the President of the Republic, by government proposal, in an analogous process of that of the CEMGFA appointment. The CEMGFA must be heard before a name is proposed to the President.\n\n===Military bodies of advisement===\nThe military bodies of advisement of the armed forces are the Council of Chiefs of Staff and the higher councils of the several branches.\n\nThe Council of Chiefs of Staff is the principal military coordinating body, being also the body of advisement of the CEMGFA. It is presided over by the CEMGFA and also includes the chiefs of staff of the three branches of service. Other military entities may be invited to participate in their meetings, but without voting rights.\n\nIn each of the branches, there is a higher council presided by the respective chief of staff. These are the Council of the Admiralty, the Higher Council of the Army and the Higher Council of the Air Force. The branches may have other advisement bodies like the military careers councils (the councils of class in the Navy, the councils of arm or service in the Army and the councils of specialty in the Air Force).\n\n==Branches of the armed forces==\n\n===Navy===\n{{Main article|Portuguese Navy}}\n[[File:Portuguese frigate NRP Corte Real (F332) underway in the Atlantic Ocean on 6 November 2017 (171106-N-UY653-245).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Portuguese Navy's frigate NRP ''Corte Real'']]\nThe Navy (''Marinha'', with its armed branch also being referred as the ''Armada'') is the naval component of the Portuguese Armed Forces. It includes around 9000 military personnel (including around 1500 marines), 40 commissioned ships and 50 auxiliary vessels. Unlike the other service branches that have an almost purely military role, the Navy historically has had a wide scope of non-military activities, namely serving as the Portuguese maritime administration, and being responsible for the tutelage over of the [[merchant marine]], [[fisheries]], [[Maritime Authority System|maritime authority]] and maritime research affairs. The responsibility over the non-military maritime activities has however been gradually transferred to other organizations since the disbandment of the Navy Ministry in 1974, with only a few \u2013 as the maritime authority and the hydrographic survey \u2013 remaining now under the Navy tutelage.\n\nThe Portuguese Navy is one of the oldest in the world, with its first known naval engagement occurring in 1180. A permanent Navy exists since 1317, when the role of Admiral of Portugal was created.\n\nThe Navy is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Navy and includes the Navy Staff, the Personnel, the Material, the Finance and the Information Technologies superintendences, the Naval Command (naval component command, with five subordinate maritime zone commands), the Council of the Admiralty and the Inspection-General of the Navy. The base bodies of the branch include the [[Lisbon Naval Base]], the Support Unit of the Central Facilities of the Navy, the [[Naval School (Portugal)|Naval School]], the technical schools (Marines, Hydrography and Oceanography, Divers and Naval Technologies), the Integrated Center of Naval Training and Evaluation and the squadrons (Surface Ships, Submarines and Helicopters). The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Navy include the [[Portuguese Marines|Marine Corps Command]], the naval and marine forces, the operational naval, marine and divers assets and units, the command centers and posts and the operations support centers. The Navy includes the Marine Corps (''Corpo de Fuzileiros''), which is a [[naval infantry]] force that serves in the roles of naval [[force protection]], amphibious [[force projection]] and maritime special operations. The Marines themselves include the [[Special Actions Detachment]], which is the [[special operations]] unit of the Navy. The [[Sappers Divers Group]] is the [[List of military diving units|combat divers unit]] of the Navy. The Navy further includes the Hydrographic Institute, the Maritime Search and Rescue Service and the International Maritime Law Commission.<ref>{{cite web|title=DL n\u00ba233/2009 Cap\u00edtulo II Artigo 6\u00ba|url=http://www.emgfa.pt/documents/nyc9vxdb67sg.pdf|website=emgfa.pt|publisher=XVII Governo Constitucional de Portugal|accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Army===\n{{Main article|Portuguese Army}}\n[[File:Exercise TRIDENT JUNCTURE (22677283415).jpg|right|thumb|300px|Portuguese Army's [[Portuguese Pandur|Pandur]] armored vehicles]]\nThe Army (''Ex\u00e9rcito'') is the land component of the Portuguese Armed Forces and its larger branch. Presently, it includes around 16 000 military personnel. The principal equipment of the Army includes around 100 main battle tanks ([[Leopard 2A6]] and [[M60 Patton]]), 280 tracked [[armored personnel carrier|APC]]s ([[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113]]), 180 wheeled APCs ([[Portuguese Pandur|Pandur II]]), 90 other armored vehicles and 60 field artillery weapons. The principal infantry weapon is still the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62mm]] [[Heckler & Koch G3|HK G3]] [[battle rifle]], although paratroopers and other special troops use instead several models of [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56mm]] [[assault rifle]]s.\n\nThe Portuguese Army can be considered one of the oldest armies of the world, with its origins going back to the [[Hueste|Royal ''Hoste'']] of the 12th century, in the early period of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The foundations of a standing army were established in 1570, with the creation of the ''[[Ordenan\u00e7as]]''. In the middle of the 17th century, the Portuguese land forces started to be referred as the ''Ex\u00e9rcito''.\n\nThe Army is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Army and includes the Army Staff, the Personnel and the Logistics commands, the Directorate of Finance, the Land Forces Command (land component command, with two subordinate military zone commands) and the Inspection-General of the Army. The base bodies of the branch are divided by the scopes of obtainment and administration of human resources (including psychology, recruiting and selection centers and offices), of readying of forces (including 21 regiments of several arms, the [[Special Operations Troops Centre]] and the Army Intelligence and Military Security Center), of logistical support (including the [[Centro de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Geoespacial do Ex\u00e9rcito|Army Geospatial Intelligence Center]], two service support regiments, the Army Material General Support Unit and two health centers), of teaching and training (including the [[Military Academy (Portugal)|Military Academy]], the School of the Arms, the School of the Services, the Army Sergeants School, the [[Col\u00e9gio Militar|Military College]] and the [[Pupilos do Ex\u00e9rcito|Army Pupils Institute]]) and of divulgation and preservation of military culture (including military museums, archives, the Army Band and the Army Fanfare). The Army includes also bodies that support other branches of the Armed Forces, including the Military Prison Establishment, the Military Laboratorial Unit of Biological and Chemical Defense and the Military Unit of Veterinary Medicine. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Army include the Land Forces Command, the formations and operational units commands, the military zones commands and the general support and emergency military support forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=DL n\u00ba231/2009 Cap\u00edtulo II Artigo 6\u00ba|url=http://www.emgfa.pt/documents/87h9rcksmpfj.pdf|website=emgfa.pt|publisher=XVII Governo Constitucional de Portugal|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> The formations include the [[Rapid Reaction Brigade (Portugal)|Rapid Reaction Brigade]], the [[Mechanized Brigade (Portugal)|Mechanized Brigade]] and the [[Intervention Brigade (Portugal)|Intervention Brigade]]. The special troops of the Army include the [[Portuguese Paratroopers|Paratroopers]], the [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] and the [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Operations Troops]], whose units are now all integrated in the Rapid Reaction Brigade.\n\nTraditionally, the Army used to be divided in branches that were designated \"arms\" if they had a mainly combatant role and designated \"services\" if their role was logistical. The main branches were the arms of cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineering and communications and the services of health, military administration, materiel and transportation. Each branch constituted an organization that usually included a branch directorate, a branch school, units and a cadre of personnel. As organizations, these branches were abolished in 1993, but they still exist as occupational groups. Also, most of the Army units continue to be associated to a branch, which in most cases correspond to the main role of the respective unit.\n\n===Air Force===\n{{Main article|Portuguese Air Force}}\n[[File:20151026 christian.timmig Portuguese Aircraft 08 (22495887796).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Portuguese Air Force's [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters]]\nThe Air Force (''For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea'') is the air component of the Portuguese Armed Forces and its younger branch. It includes around 6600 personnel and 100 aircraft.\n\nThe Portuguese Air Force was established as an independent branch of service in 1952, when the Military Aeronautics arm was completely separated from the Army, at the same time starting to control the [[Portuguese Naval Aviation|Naval Aviation]] that was part of the Navy.\n\nThe Air Force is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and includes the Air Force Staff, the Air Force Personnel and the Air Force Logistics commands, the Air Force Directorate of Finance, the Air Command (air component command, with two subordinate air zone commands) and the Inspection-General of the Air Force. The base bodies of the branch include the [[Portuguese Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]], the [[Military and Technical Training Center of the Air Force]], five air bases, two maneuver aerodromes, a transit aerodrome and four radar stations. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Air Force include the operational planning bodies, the Air Command and Control System, the flying units and the anti-aircraft intervention units. The flying units include two training squadrons ([[Socata TB 30 Epsilon|TB 30 Epsilon]] and [[Alpha-Jet]]), one fighter squadron ([[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 AM]]), one attack squadron (F-16 AM), three transport squadrons ([[Lockheed C-130|C-130]], [[C-295]]M and [[Dassault Falcon 50|Falcon 50]]), two helicopter squadrons ([[Alouette III]] and [[AgustaWestland AW101|EH-101]]), one maritime patrol squadron ([[Lockheed P-3]]C) and one Air Force Academy squadron ([[Schleicher ASK 21|ASK-21]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|OGMA Chipmunk Mk 20 (modif)]] and [[LET L-23 Super Blan\u00edk|L-23 Super Blan\u00edk]]). The ''[[Pol\u00edcia A\u00e9rea]]'' (Air Police) is the ground combat force of the Air Force, which serves as its military police, [[force protection]] and ground anti-aircraft defense element, including a special forces unit, this being the Tactical Operations of Protection Core (NOTP).\n\n==The National Republican Guard==\n{{Main article|National Republican Guard (Portugal)}}\n[[File:Render da Guarda no Palacio de Belem 28.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Changing of the GNR guard of the Presidential Palace]]\nThe Nacional Republican Guard (GNR, ''Guarda Nacional Republicana'') is a special corps of troops that has the special feature of being a military force that is not part of the Armed Forces.\n\nIt is a [[gendarmerie]] type security force, made up of around 26 000 military personnel, that is part of the internal security system. It is responsible for the [[preventive police|preventive policing]] of most of the rural areas of the country, the [[Highway patrol|patrolling]] of the [[Roads in Portugal|major highways]], the customs enforcement and the coastal control. It also performs some special missions like the providing of ceremonial military State [[Guard of honour|honor guards]], the security of the [[Pal\u00e1cio de Bel\u00e9m|Presidential]], [[Pal\u00e1cio de S\u00e3o Bento|Parliament]] and [[Pal\u00e1cio das Necessidades|Foreign Ministry]] palaces, the environment and nature protection and the rescue and forest firefighting. In time of peace, the GNR is subordinated to the [[Ministry of Internal Administration (Portugal)|minister of Internal Administration]], except in the scope of uniforms, military doctrine, equipment and armament within which is subordinated to the minister of National Defense.\n\nAlthough not being part of the Armed Forces, the GNR can be placed under the operational command of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in the cases foreseen in the statutes governing the National Defense, the Armed Forces, the state of siege and the [[state of emergency]]. In the scope of its military missions, the GNR is specially adapted for the fulfillment of [[military operations other than war]]. Forces of the GNR have been deployed in international missions in high conflict countries that did not fit with the use of a civilian police force, but where it was not considered politically appropriate to deploy units of the Armed Forces. These international deployments may be done in the scope of the multinational specialized units (MSU) of the [[European Gendarmerie Force]], as it happened with the GNR deployment in Iraq.\n\n==Special forces==\n[[File:Portuguese Naval Special Forces, Portugal, NATO Trident Juncture 15 (22551475570).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Operators of the Portuguese Navy's Special Actions Detachment]]\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces include a number of different types of special forces, distributed by its three branches.\n\nIn the Army, these are generically referred as the \"special troops\" or the \"light infantry\" and represent more than 20% of the total strength of the branch. The Army special troops include the Paratroopers, the [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] and the [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Operations Troops]]. The Paratroopers are a mainly parachute light infantry force, that however also include some non-infantry specialized units. The Paratroopers in turn include the [[Pathfinders Company (Portugal)|Air-Land Pathfinders Company]], which is a special parachute reconnaissance unit. The Commandos are a light assault infantry force, specialized in conducting high risk conventional operations. The Special Operations Troops is the Army unit specialized in unconventional warfare.\n\nThe Navy has the Marines Corps (''Corpo de Fuzileiros'') as its special forces. These are a light naval infantry force, specialized in amphibious landings, base and ship security, high seas boarding and naval military police. The Marines include the [[Special Actions Detachment]] which is the Navy's special operations unit dedicated to the unconventional warfare in naval and coastal environment. The Marines also include the PelBoard (Boarding Platoon) teams, that are specialized in high risk [[Visit, board, search, and seizure|visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS)]] actions. The [[Sappers Divers Group]] is the Navy's specialized combat divers unit, which however is not usually considered a special forces unit.\n\nThe present special forces unit of the Air Force is the Tactical Operations of Protection Core (NOTP). This unit is part of the [[Pol\u00edcia A\u00e9rea|Air Police]] and is mainly dedicated to the protection of the forces and assets of the Air Force deployed in high risk areas.\n\n==Personnel==\nCurrently, the Portuguese Armed Forces include 32,992 military personnel, of which 12% are women. The majority of the personnel is in the Army (54%), followed by the Navy (26%) and the Air Force (20%). Conscription in time of peace was fully abolished in 2004 and, since then, 100% of the military personnel is professional.\n\n===Military service===\nThe defense of the Fatherland is a right and a duty of all the Portuguese. The Portuguese citizens have military obligations from the age of 18 years to the age of 35 years.\n\nThe military service include the following situations:\n* Effective service - is the situation of the citizens when they are at the service of the Armed Forces. It includes effective service in the QP (career personnel), RC (contract personnel) and RV (volunteer personnel) or due to call or mobilization.\n* Recruiting reserve - is made of the Portuguese citizens, from the age of 18 years to the age of 35 years, who never served in the Armed Forces, but can be object of an exceptional recruiting.\n* Availability reserve - is made of the Portuguese citizens who have served in the Armed Forces, from the end of their effective service until the end of their military obligations. To call effects, the availability reserve situation includes the six subsequent years after the effective service.\n\nIn time of war, the military obligations age limits can be changed by law.\n\n===Career and voluntary personnel===\nIn time of peace, the military personnel falls in two main groups: career personnel (permanent personnel) and volunteer (temporary personnel). In case of war, these two groups are added with conscript personnel.\n\nCareer personnel (QP, ''Quadro Permanente'') includes the persons who choose the military profession as their permanent life career. Admission to this career requires the [[academic degree|graduation]] in one of the higher education [[military academy|service academies]] for officers or in one of the military technical schools for non-officers. QP personnel only includes officers and sergeants in the Army and the Air Force, but it also includes other ranks in the Navy. Other ranks in the Army and the Air Force are entirely volunteer.\n\nVolunteer personnel includes the persons who usually have a civilian profession, but volunteer to serve temporarily in the military. They might serve in roles related specifically with their civilian professions (e.g.: engineers, [[legal professionals|legal]]s, [[psychologist]]s or [[medic]]s) or in general military roles. They include officers, sergeants and other ranks. Volunteer personnel are further subdivided in two groups: contract regime (RC, ''Regime de Contrato'') and volunteer regime (RV, ''Regime de Voluntariado''). While RC personnel serves for between two and six years, RV personnel serves only for 12 months. Special RC regimes with the duration of up to 20 years are foreseen to be created for roles whose training and technical demands make desirable long periods of service. Personnel in RV can apply to serve in RC after their termination of their period of service.\n\n===Ranks and categories===\n{{main article|Military ranks of Portugal}}\nAccordingly, with their level of responsibility and authority, Portuguese military personnel are divided in three categories: [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] (''oficiais''), [[sergeant]]s (''sargentos'') and other ranks (''pra\u00e7as''). Officers are further divided in three subcategories: [[general officer]]s (''oficiais generais''), [[Military rank#Field or senior officers|senior officers]] (''oficiais superiores'') and [[junior officer]]s (''oficiais subalternos'').\n\n===Occupational groups===\nAccordingly, with their training and role, each member of the Portuguese Armed Forces is part of an occupational group, to each of which corresponds a career and a particular list of promotion. These occupational groups have different specific designations in each branch of service.\n\nThe Navy occupational groups are named \"classes\". For the officers, the classes are navy (M), [[naval engineer]]s (EN), naval administration (AN), marines (FZ), [[physician|naval physicians]] (MN), naval senior technicians (TSN), technical service (ST), health technicians (TS) and musicians (MUS). For the enlisted, the classes are administrative (L), communications (C), auto mechanics-drivers (V), electro mechanics (EM), electro technicians (ET), marines (FZ), maneuvers (M), naval machinists (MQ), [[Underwater diving|diver]]s (U), musicians (B), operations (O), stewards (T) and weapons technicians (A).\n\nThe Army occupational groups are designated \"corps of general officers\", \"arms\" and \"services\". The corps of general officers include all generals, who may originate from the arms or from some of the services officer careers, but with only those originating from the arms being able to achieve the ranks above that of major-general. The arms are mostly careers associated with combatant roles while the services are mostly careers associated with logistical roles. For the officers, the arms are [[infantry]] (INF), [[artillery]] (ART), [[cavalry]] (CAV), [[military engineering|engineering]] (ENG) and [[military communications|communications]] (TM) and the services are military administration (ADMIL), [[Army engineering maintenance|materiel]] (MAT), medicine (MED), pharmacy (FARM), veterinary (VET), dentistry (DENT), nursery, diagnostic and therapeutic technicians (TEDT), chiefs of music band (CBMUS), communications exploration technicians (TEXPTM), communications maintenance technicians (TMANTM), [[materiel]] maintenance technicians (TMANMAT), personnel and secretariat technicians (TPESSECR), transportations technicians (TTRANS), Army general service (SGE) and parachutist general service (SGPQ). For the sergeants, the arms are infantry (INF), artillery (ART), cavalry (CAV), engineering (ENG), communications (TM) and parachutists (PARAQ) and the services are military administration (AM), materiel (MAT), medicine (MED), pharmacy (FARM), veterinary (VET), music (MUS), clarions (CLAR), personnel and secretariat (PESSECR), transportations (TRANS), Army general service (SGE) and amanuensis (AMAN).\n\nThe Army volunteers occupational groups are analogous to the arms and services, but correspond to more specific qualifications. They include functional areas subdivided in specialties for officers and sergeants and specialties for other ranks. The functional areas for the officers and sergeants are mechanized/motorized infantry (AF01), light infantry (AF02), [[field artillery]] (AF03), [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (AF04), cavalry (AF05), [[Army Police (Portugal)|Army police]] (AF06), communications (AF10), transportation (AF18), materiel (AF21), administration (AF22), personnel and secretariat (AF23), engineering (AF24), senior support technicians (AF25), health \u2013 medicine (AF26), health \u2013 nursery (AF26), health \u2013 nursery, diagnostic and therapeutic (AF27), dental health (AF28), veterinary health (AF29) and pharmacy. The specialties for the other ranks are field (Esp-01), mechanics (Esp-02), [[auto mechanic]]s (Esp-03), engineering equipment mechanics (Esp-04), [[panel beater]] mechanics (Esp-05), auto body painter mechanics (Esp-06), services (Esp-07), audiovisual-multimedia (Esp-08), audiovisual-graphics (Esp-09), services saddler-upholstery (Esp-10), services psychometric laboratory operator (Esp-11), engineering [[sapper]] (Esp-12), [[CBRN defense|NBC]] sapper (Esp-13), military light vehicles driving (Esp-14), military heavy vehicles driving (Esp-15), Army police (Esp-16), communications (Esp-17), music (Esp-18), health (Esp-19), paratroopers (Esp-20), special operations (Esp-21), commandos (Esp-22), construction (Esp-23), plumbing (Esp-24), construction carpenter (Esp-25), construction electrician (Esp-26), engineering heavy equipment operator (Esp-27), metalworking (Esp-28), [[farrier]] (Esp-29), catering (Esp-30), bakery (Esp-31) and rescue and assistance systems operator (Esp-32).\n\nThe Air Force occupational groups are designated \"specialties\". The officers specialties include [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilots-aviators]] (PILAV), [[aerospace engineer|aeronautic engineers]] (ENGAER), [[transport engineering#airport engineering|aerodromes engineers]] (ENGAED), [[electrical engineer]]s (ENGEL), physicians (MED), aeronautical administration (ADMAER), jurists (JUR), psychologists (PSI), [[flight navigator|navigators]] (NAV), communications and cryptography operations technicians (TOCC), meteorology operations technicians (TOMET), air circulation and traffic radar operations technicians (TOCART), interception conduct operations technicians (TOCI), air materiel maintenance technicians (TMMA), ground materiel maintenance technicians (TMMT), electrical materiel maintenance technicians (TMMEL), armament and equipment maintenance technicians (TMAEQ), infrastructures maintenance technicians (TMI), supply technicians (TABST), IT technicians (TINF), personnel and administrative support technicians (TPAA), health technicians (TS), air police (PA) and chiefs of music band (CHBM). The enlisted personnel specialties include communications operators (OPCOM), meteorology operators (OPMET), air circulation and traffic radar operators (OPCART), detection radar operators (OPRDET), IT operators (OPINF), assistance and aid systems operators (OPSAS), air materiel mechanics (MMA), ground materiel mechanics (MMT), electricity mechanics (MELECT), electronics mechanics (MELECA), aircraft electricity and instruments mechanics (MELIAV), armament and equipment mechanics (MARME), supply (ABS), infrastructure construction and maintenance (CMI), air police (PA), secretariat and service support (SAS) and musicians (MUS).\n\n===Uniforms and insignia===\nThere is not a standardization of the types of uniforms among the three branches of the Armed Forces. Each branch has its own uniform regulation which is distinct from those of the other service branches. The traditional color of the Portuguese military uniforms, since the middle of the 18th century, was the ''azul ferrete'' (very dark blue). This is still the color of the [[dress uniform|full dress uniforms]] of the three service branches. The [[Service dress|service dress uniform]] colors are the [[navy blue]] (Winter) or [[white]] (Summer) for the Navy, [[grey]] (No.1) or [[olive green]] (No.2) for the Army and [[air force blue]] for the Air Force. All the three branches have a [[military camouflage|camouflaged]] [[battledress|battledress uniform]] in the [[Disruptive Pattern Material|DPM]] pattern (from 1998 to 2010, the Air Force used instead the [[U.S. Woodland]] patern). These camouflage patterns replaced the traditional Portuguese [[Lizard (camouflage)#vertical lizard patterns|vertical lizard pattern]] that was in use in the three service branches from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. In the latte 2018, the Portuguese Army started to experiment the Sistemas de Combate do Soldado (Soldiers Combat Systems) individual equipment system for the dismounted soldiers, which includes a new camouflaged pattern of the [[Multicam]]-style. \n\nThe members of some branches, units or specialties of the three branches of the Armed Forces are identified by the wearing of [[military beret|berets]] whose colors are [[green beret|emerald green]] (Paratroopers), brown (Army generic), navy blue (Marines), [[black beret|black]] (Cavalry, except Cavalry paratroopers), [[blue beret|air force blue]] (Air Police), [[red beret|red]] (Commandos), [[moss green]] (Special Operations) and blue (Navy generic).\n\nOn the contrary of the uniforms, there is a standard common model of rank insignia used in the uniforms of the three service branches. The existence of a common rank insignia system has been in force since 1761, when the Portuguese Army and Navy become one of the first militaries in the world to establish a rank insignia regulation, that was common for the two existing branches at the time. The present system of rank insignia was established in 1911 and is an evolution of the previous ones. Its generic rank devices consists in stars for the general officers, in [[stripe (pattern)|stripes]] for the rest of the officers, in [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese shields]] for the senior sergeants and in [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] for the rest of the sergeants and the other ranks. There is a specific rank insignia for the admirals or generals invested in the office of Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, consisting in four golden stars, which differ from the silver stars worn by the rest of the four-star rank officers (chiefs of staff of the service branches).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Military of Portugal}}\n*[http://www.mdn.gov.pt/ Portuguese Ministry of National Defense]\n*[http://www.emgfa.pt/ Portuguese Armed Forces Chief of Staff]\n*U.S. Mission to NATO, [https://search.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1973NATO03939_b.html 1973NATO03939 Portuguese Forces for NATO], August 22, 1973, released via Wikileaks\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n{{Military of Portugal}}\n{{North Atlantic Treaty Organization}}\n{{Militaries of European Union member states}}\n{{Military of Europe}}\n{{Military of Africa}}\n{{Life in Portugal}}\n\n[[Category:Military of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Permanent Structured Cooperation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2016}}\n{{Infobox national military\n| name               = Portuguese Armed Forces\n| native_name        = For\u00e7as Armadas\n| image              = Military flag of Portugal.svg\n| alt                = \n| caption            = Portuguese military colors \n| image2             =\n| alt2               = \n| caption2           =\n| motto              =\n| founded            =\n| current_form       =\n| disbanded          =\n| branches           = [[Portuguese Army]]<br> [[Portuguese Navy]]<br>[[Portuguese Air Force]]\n| headquarters       = [[Lisbon]]\n| flying_hours       =\n| website            = <!--{{URL|example.mil}}-->\n<!-- Leadership -->\n| commander-in-chief = [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]] \n| commander-in-chief_title = {{nobreak|[[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]]}}\n| chief minister     = [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]]\n| chief minister_title = [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]]\n| minister           = [[Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho - Ministro da Defesa Nacional - Defesa Nacional - XXI Governo - Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa|date=27 January 2019|website=Defesa.pt|url=https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc21/area-de-governo/defesa-nacional/ministro}}</ref>\n| minister_title     = [[Ministry of National Defence (Portugal)|Minister of National Defence]]\n| commander          = Admiral [[Ant\u00f3nio Manuel Fernandes da Silva Ribeiro]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Boas-vindas ao novo Chefe do Estado-Maior-General das For\u00e7as Armadas|url=http://www.emgfa.pt/pt/noticias/1151|work=emgfa.pt|publisher=Estado-Maior-General das For\u00e7as Armadas|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref> \n| commander_title    = [[Armed Forces General Staff (Portugal)|Chief of the General Staff]]\n<!-- Manpower -->\n| age                = \n| conscription       =\n| manpower_data      = 2010<ref>{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html|website=Cia.gov|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n| manpower_age       = 18\u201335\n| available          = 2,566,264\n| available_f        = 2,458,297\n| fit                = 2,103,080 \n| fit_f              = 2,018,004\n| reaching           = 62,208\n| reaching_f         = 54,786\n| active             = 32,992 (88% males, 12% females) (2016<ref>{{cite web|title=Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 As For\u00e7as Armadas|url=http://www.emgfa.pt/pt/organizacao|work=emgfa.pt|publisher=Estado-Maior-General das For\u00e7as Armadas|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref>) \n\n| ranked             =\n| reserve            =\n| deployed           = 600\n<!-- Financial -->\n| amount             = \u20ac2.928 billion ($3.358 billion) (2019)<ref name=\"NATO\">{{cite web |title=Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2012-2019) |url=https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2019_06/20190625_PR2019-069-EN.pdf|date=25 June 2019|publisher=NATO Public Diplomacy Division|access-date=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n| percent_GDP        = 1.41% (2019)<ref name=\"NATO\"/>\n<!-- Industrial -->\n| domestic_suppliers =\n| foreign_suppliers  = {{ubl|Austria|Belgium|Canada|Bulgaria|Finland|France|Germany|Poland|Israel|Italy|Japan|Netherlands|South Africa|Sweden|Switzerland|United Kingdom|United States}}\n| imports            =\n| exports            =\n<!-- Related aricles -->\n| history            = [[Military history of Portugal]]\n| ranks              = [[Military ranks of Portugal]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Portuguese Armed Forces''' ({{lang-pt|For\u00e7as Armadas}}) are the military of [[Portugal]].

The national defense also assures the fulfillment of the international military agreements of the State, accordingly with the national interest.\n\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces are responsible for the military defense, which is the military component of the national defense.\n\n===The Armed Forces===\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces are an essential pillar of the national defense and are the structure of the State that has as its main mission the military defense of the Republic. They obey to the competent bodies of sovereignty, accordingly with the [[Constitution of Portugal|Constitution]] and the [[Law of Portugal|law]], being integrated in the State direct administration through the Ministry of National Defense. The bodies of State directly responsible for the national defense and the Armed Forces are the following:\n* [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]]\n* [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]]\n* [[Government of Portugal|Government]]\n* Superior Council of National Defense\n\nThe [[Ministry of National Defense (Portugal)|Minister of National Defense]] is the political responsible for the elaboration and execution of the military component of the national defense policy, for the administration of the Armed Forces and for the results of their employment.\n\n===System of forces===\n[[File:Exercise TRIDENT JUNCTURE (22778497686).jpg|thumb|350px|A female soldier of the Portuguese Armed Forces in position, with her Hecker and Koch G3 Rifle, during a field exercise]] \nThe system of forces defines the set of capacities that should exist for the fulfillment of the missions of the Armed Forces. It encompasses the set of systems of forces of all branches of the Armed Forces. The system of forces includes two components:\n* Operational component - includes the set of assets and forces to be employed operationally. It is the dynamic part of the system of forces, including mainly deployable elements, such as [[frigate]]s, infantry [[battalion]]s and [[squadron (aviation)|flying squadrons]]. The operational component includes also some non-deployable operational command bodies. \n* Fix component - is the set of commands, units, establishments, bodies and services that are essential to the organization and general support of the Armed Forces and their branches. It is the static part of the system of forces, including only non-deployable elements, such as [[naval base|naval facilities]], [[regiment]]s and [[air base]]s.\n\n===Structure of the armed forces===\nThe Portuguese armed forces' structure includes:\n* the General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMGFA)\n* the three branches of the Armed Forces: [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], [[Portuguese Army|Army]] and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]\n* the military bodies of command: Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMGFA), the Chief of Staff of the Navy, the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force\n* the military bodies of advisement\n\n===Guidelines===\nThe Armed Forces activity is mainly defined and oriented by the following strategic guidelines:\n* The National Defense Law (''Lei da Defesa Nacional'', LDN) defines the general guidelines of the national defense, including the concept of national defense, the national defense policy, the responsibilities of the several bodies of State regarding national defense, the assignments and general structure of the Ministry of National Defense and of the Armed Forces, the participation of the citizens in the Homeland defense and the situation of State of War. The LDN is regularly updated, with the present version being the Law 21-A/2006.\n* The Strategic Concept of National Defense (''Conceito Estrat\u00e9gico de Defesa Nacional'', CEDN) is the component of the national defense policy which defines the State's priorities in terms of defense, accordingly with the national interest. The present version of the CEDN was approved by the [[Council of Ministers of Portugal|Council of Ministers]] through its Resolution 19/2013.\n* The Organic Basic Law of the Organization of the Armed Forces (''Lei Org\u00e2nica de Bases da Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das For\u00e7as Armadas'', LOBOFA) defines the organization of the Armed Forces. The present version of the LOBOFA is the Organic Law 1-A/2009.\n* The Strategic Military Concept (''Conceito Estrat\u00e9gico Militar'', CEM) \u2013 due to the Strategic Concept of National Defense, it defines the conceptual guidelines of actuation of the Armed Forces and the general guidelines for its preparation, employment and sustainment. It is elaborated by the Council of Chiefs of Staff, approved by the Minister of National Defense and confirmed by the Superior Council of National Defense. The present CEM in force is the CEM 2014.\n* The Military Programming Law (''Lei de Programa\u00e7\u00e3o Militar'', LPM) establishes the programming of the public investment of the Armed Forces in terms of armament and equipment, for the modernization and operationalization of the system of forces, through the building of their capacities. The present version of the LPM is the Organic Law 7/2015.\n\n==Current deployments==\nThe national deployed forces (''for\u00e7as nacionais destacadas'' or FND) are units or teams deployed by the Portuguese Armed Forces in foreign missions, mostly in the scope of NATO, the United Nations or the European Union.

Since the early beginning, the Kingdom had naval and ground forces. The Portuguese Navy exists as a permanent force since 1317, however non-permanent naval forces existed already before, with their first known naval engagement occurring in 1180. The Portuguese ground forces were established as a [[standing army]] in 1570, however they had existed since the 12th century, as the non-permanent [[hueste|''hoste'']]. The Navy and the Army would remain independent from each other for hundreds of years.\n\nBy the early 20th century, some joint military and national defense bodies had been created but these had mostly mere political coordination responsibilities. The administration of the several forces of the military remained in charge of separate [[Ministry (government department)|government departments]], respectively the [[Navy Ministry (Portugal)|Navy Ministry]] for the Navy (''Marinha''), the [[War Ministry (Portugal)|War Ministry]] for the Metropolitan Army (''Ex\u00e9rcito Metropolitano'') and the [[Overseas Ministry (Portugal)|Colonies Ministry]] for the Colonial Military Forces (''For\u00e7as Militares Coloniais''). Operationally, the service branches were also completely independent from each other, with totally separated chains of command.\n\nDuring the 1930s, plans were laid to merge all of the previously mentioned ministries under a single defense ministry. However, the service branches lobbies for the maintenance of their autonomy \u2013 represented by their separate government departments \u2013 politically opposed and were able to block this reorganization for the next couple of decades.\n\nNevertheless, the need to defend the [[Portuguese Empire|Overseas Empire]] against possible foreign aggression during [[World War II]], did lead to a significant step being taken during this period for an increased integration of the several military services, when the Colonial Military Forces were placed under the dependency of the War Ministry, which then became in charge of all Portuguese ground forces (metropolitan and colonial).\n\n===Establishment of the unified Armed Forces===\nLessons learned from World War II, the start of the [[Cold War]] and the creation of [[NATO]] (which Portugal integrated as a founding member<ref>{{cite web|title=MILESTONES: 1945\u20131952|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/nato|website=history.state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>) partially ended the objections for the creation of a joint command for the military forces. In 1950, the roles of Minister of National Defense and of [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of Portugal#The Chief of the General Staff|Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces]] (CEMGFA) are created.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historial \u2013 O p\u00f3s guerra|url=http://www.exercito.pt/EP/Paginas/historial/22.aspx|website=exercito.pt|publisher=Ex\u00e9rcito Portugu\u00eas|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107141450/http://www.exercito.pt/EP/Paginas/historial/22.aspx|archivedate=7 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> To the CEMGFA were given almost all the responsibilities until then assigned to the majors-generals of the Navy and of the Army (service branches military commanders), whose roles were at the same time extinct.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decreto-lei 37909|url=https://dre.pt/application/file/481065|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> This can be considered the beginning of the existence of the Portuguese Armed Forces as an unified organization.\n[[File:Fap-instrucao-pilotos-north-american-t-6-texan.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Training of pilots of the Portuguese Armed Forces in the early 1960s, in [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 aircraft]]]]\nHowever, opposition from both of the then existing military branches prevented the formation of a single ministry for the military. The political solution for this was to keep the existing Navy and Army ministries and to create the role of Minister of National Defense but without its own ministry, instead integrating the [[Cabinet of Portugal|Government's Presidency Office]]. The Minister of National Defense directed an [[umbrella organization]], named the National Defense Department which included the CEMGFA, the General Secretariat of National Defense (SGDN, ''Secretariado-Geral da Defesa Nacional'') and the Under-Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics (''Subsecretariado de Estado da Aeron\u00e1utica''). As the Navy and Army ministers continued to exist and to administer their own branches, the Minister of Defense had merely coordinating roles regarding the Navy and the Army. The SGDN served as the Defense staff support organization, being headed by the CEMGFA. It was foreseen to be remodeled in order to be transformed in the general staff and joint management body of the Armed Forces, but this transformation would only occur in 1974, when the SGDN became the General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMGFA).\n\nDespite all the challenges, the operational integration of the Armed Forces rapidly progressed in the 1950s. As part of this integration, the role of [[commander-in-chief]] was established in each of the Overseas territories, as a permanent unified commander of the local forces of the three branches. Mainly during the Overseas War, these commanders-in-chief would assume increasing responsibilities, until achieving full operational command of all forces assigned to their [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]], leaving the territorial service branch leadership with mere logistical responsibilities.\n \nThe Military Aeronautics (Army aviation branch) \u2013 which already had a high degree of autonomy since 1937 \u2013 becomes an entirely separate branch of service of the Armed Forces in 1952, at the same time starting to control the [[Portuguese Naval Aviation]] (Navy aviation service). This third branch of the Armed Forces would soon become officially designated \"Portuguese Air Force\" (''For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Portuguesa''), with the fully integration of the previous Naval Aviation becoming complete in 1958. Unlike the other services which had their own separate ministries, the Air Force was under the fully dependency of the Minister of National Defense via the Under-Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics. In 1961, the status of this department would be upgraded, it becoming the Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics.\n\nIn 1953, the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]] ceased policing the military, with the establishment of the [[Army Police (Portugal)|Military Police]] by the Army.<ref>{{cite web|title=Regimento de Lanceiros N\u00ba2 \u2013 Historial|url=http://www.exercito.pt/sites/RL2/Historial/Paginas/default.aspx|website=exercito.pt|publisher=Ex\u00e9rcito Portugu\u00eas|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref> Later, the other service branches would create their respective [[military police]] type forces: the [[Pol\u00edcia A\u00e9rea|Air Police]] for the Air Force and the Naval Police for the Navy.\n\n===Overseas conflicts===\n{{Main article|1961 Indian annexation of Goa|Portuguese Colonial War}}\n[[File:AssaltonaMatadaSanga.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Portuguese paratroopers jump from an [[Alouette III]] helicopter in an air-mobile assault in Angola, in the early stages of the Overseas Wars]]\nBetween 1961 and 1974, the Portuguese Armed Forces would be engaged against emerging nationalist movements in several of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese African provinces]]. These set of conflicts are collectively referred as the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Overseas War]] in Portugal. In the scope of the Cold War, it was a decisive ideological struggle and armed conflict in African (Portuguese Africa and surrounding nations) and Portuguese European mainland scenarios. Unlike other European nations, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]] did not leave its African overseas provinces during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=PORTUGAL E OS VENTOS DA HIST\u00d3RIA|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=126|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> Several armed independence movements, most prominently led by [[communist parties]] who cooperated under the [[CONCP]] umbrella and pro US groups became active in these areas (especially in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=MAPA DA GUERRA|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=134|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces were able to maintain a large [[military campaign]] for 13 years, in these three different theaters of operations, thousands of kilometers apart from each other and from the European mainland. This was achieved with almost no external support, in contrast with the nationalist movements which were backed by communist countries and even by some western ones. The Army suffered the majority of the casualties with 8290 soldiers killed in action while the Air Force lost 346 airmen and the Navy lost 195 sailors.\n\nDuring the conflict, in each [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]], the operational command of the forces of the navy, army and air force was successively transferred from each territorial service branch command to joint commands, led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in that specific theater. Thus the three branches of the military were able to achieve a high level of operational integration, allowing for an effective cooperation between them, the optimization of their scarce assets and the ability to fight as a single cohesive force. The [[military logistics|logistics]] side however was not able to reach such high levels of integration, mainly because each service branch continued to be administered by its own government department with its own [[supply chain]] and different standards.\n\nDue to the nature of the conflict, [[commando]]-type forces achieved great importance. With the war's evolution, these assumed almost all of the mobile and offensive operations, with the more conventional forces remaining responsible mainly for the defensive assignments. By 1961, each service branch had created its own [[light infantry]] force oriented for asymmetric warfare. The Air Force created the [[Parachute Troops School|Parachute Rifles]] (''Ca\u00e7adores P\u00e1raquedistas'') in 1956,<ref>{{cite web|title=P\u00c1RA-QUEDISTAS|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=320|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> the Army first raised the [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Rifles]] (''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'') in 1960<ref>{{cite web|title=CA\u00c7ADORES|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=152|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> which were later replaced by the [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] (''Comandos'')<ref>{{cite web|title=COMANDOS|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=153|website=guerracolonial.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> in 1962 and the Navy deployed the [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marines]] (''Fuzileiros''), a force reactivated in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|title=FUZILEIROS|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=155|website=guerracolonia.org|publisher=Guerra Colonial :: 1961 \u2013 1974|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref> The Portuguese military also counted with a number of [[Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War|paramilitary forces]], including the [[Special Groups (Portugal)|Special Groups]] (''Grupos Especiais'') and the [[Flechas|Arrows]] (''Flechas'').\n\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces were also involved in a brief conventional armed conflict with the Indian military, when the latter invaded the [[Portuguese India]] in December 1961.

By the summer of 1975, the tension between these was so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. The forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched a further ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 25 November but the Group of Nine, a moderate military faction, immediately initiated a counter-coup. The main episode of this confrontation was the successful assault on the barracks of the left-wing dominated [[2nd Lancers Regiment (Portugal)|Military Police Regiment]] by the moderate forces of the Commando Regiment, resulting in three soldiers [[killed in action]]. The Group of Nine emerged victorious, thus preventing the establishment of a [[Communism|communist]] state in Portugal and ending the period of political instability in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=25 de Novembro, o fim do Ver\u00e3o Quente|url=http://www.areamilitar.net/HistBCR.aspx?N=139|website=areamilitar.net|publisher=\u00c1reamilitar|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of National Defense would be created during this period of instability. However this ministry had no power over the Armed Forces, his role was simply to act as a connection between the military and the Government. It was the [[Revolution Council (Portugal)|Revolution Council]] \u2013 created in 1975, consisting only of military officers and chaired by the President of the Republic \u2013 that had the full control over the Armed Forces, which meant these were completely independent from the civilian administration. The Government military departments (Navy Ministry, Army Ministry and Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics) were disbanded, with each service branch chief of staff assuming the roles of the former ministers, under the coordination of the CEMGFA, to whom was given a status equivalent to that of the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. This organization would remain in place until 1982, when the Revolution Council was disbanded after the first revision to the [[Constitution of Portugal|1976 Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lei n.\u00ba 1/82, de 30 de Setembro|url=http://www.pgdlisboa.pt/leis/lei_mostra_articulado.php?nid=8&tabela=leis|website=pgdlisboa.pt|publisher=Procuradoria-Geral Distrital de Lisboa|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The Armed Forces were again placed under the subordination of the civilian administration, more specifically being integrated in the Ministry of National Defense.\n\nWith the [[decolonization]] and the end of the Overseas War, the Portuguese military would change from an asymmetric war oriented force to a conventional war oriented force, focused in defense of [[Western Europe#Cold War|Western Europe]] from a possible Soviet invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1980s would see the creation of [[special operations]], namely the Army's [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Operations Forces]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Centro de Tropas de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais \u2013 Historial|url=http://www.exercito.pt/sites/CTOE/Historial/Paginas/default.aspx|website=exercito.pt|publisher=Ex\u00e9rcito Portugu\u00eas|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> and the Navy's [[Special Actions Detachment]].<ref>{{cite web|title=O DESTACAMENTO DE AC\u00c7\u00d5ES ESPECIAIS \u2013 Zebros e Skua|url=http://www.operacional.pt/o-destacamento-de-accoes-especiais/|website=operacional.pt|publisher=Operacional \u2013 defesa, for\u00e7as armadas e de seguran\u00e7a|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> In 1990, the Air Force would create Combat Rescue teams (''Resgate em Combate'' or ''RESCOM'') for [[Combat search and rescue|CSAR]] operations but in 2006 these were extinct and replaced by the Force Protection Unit (''Unidade de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o da For\u00e7a'' or ''UPF'') whose mission is to provide security for the Air Force elements deployed on international missions.<ref>{{cite web|title=AFEGANIST\u00c3O: UNIDADE DE PROTEC\u00c7\u00c3O DA FOR\u00c7A EM OPERA\u00c7\u00d5ES|url=http://www.operacional.pt/afeganistao-unidade-de-proteccao-da-forca-em-operacoes/|website=operacional.pt|publisher=Operacional \u2013 defesa, for\u00e7as armadas e de seguran\u00e7a|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Current===\n[[File:020602-F-EF201-020 Portuguese soldiers from the 2nd Armored Division use Chaimite V200 Armored Personnel Carriers to steer their way.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Portuguese National Deployed Force in [[Bosnia]] in 2002]]\nThe collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] triggered a deep transformation of the Armed Forces. They transited from being a conscription based and defensive oriented Armed Forces to gradually becoming a fully professional and [[expeditionary warfare]] oriented force, starting to participate in international missions, most of them under the mandate of the United Nations, the [[European Union]] and the [[NATO]], besides organizing some unilateral missions abroad on their own.\n\nThe conscription was gradually reduced since the early 1990s, with almost no conscripts serving the Armed Forces by the end of that decade. The formal abolishment of the conscription in time of peace for all men was however only implemented in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 118/2004 de 21 Maio|url=http://www.dgap.gov.pt/upload/Legis/2004_dl_118_21_05.pdf|website=dgap.gov.pt|publisher=XV Governo Constitucional de Portugal|accessdate=2 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505160953/http://www.dgap.gov.pt/upload/Legis/2004_dl_118_21_05.pdf|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Portuguese Army deployed a communications battalion to Mozambique, as part of the [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|UNOMOZ]], this being the first participation of the Portuguese Armed Forces in international missions, with a complete military unit. After Mozambique, the Portuguese Military deployed forces to international missions in a number of countries, including Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Timor-Leste, Kosovo, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Lithuania, besides deploying military observers and other individual elements to other countries. Recent Defense policy confirmed the assumption that most considerable operations would be undertaken under international organizations mandates, with Portugal not entering alone in a major military engagement since the 1961\u20131974 overseas conflict.\n\nNonetheless, the Portuguese Military have also conducted a number of unilateral and independent peace-enforcing and humanitarian military missions, namely in Guinea-Bissau (1990, 1998, and 1999) and in Angola (1992). The Operation Crocodile conducted in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 was notable, by evidencing the capacity of the Portuguese Armed Forces \u2013 despite its small size and limitation of means \u2013 to rapidly mount a military operation abroad in a scale that is typically only achievable by major military powers. This operations was mainly aimed at the rescuing of thousands of Portuguese and other foreign nationals caught in the middle of the civil conflict that erupted in Guinea-Bissau and included the deployment of naval and air forces, the landing and occupation of the Port of [[Bissau]] by Portuguese Marines, amphibious and helicopter landings in several places of the Guinean coast for the rescuing of civilians, medical and humanitarian aid to the civil population and the support to the peace talks between the two antagonizing parties.\n\nA Military Programation Law (''Lei de Programa\u00e7\u00e3o Militar'') was launched in 2002 to start the complete modernization of the Armed Forces. Considerable re-equipment of the military started in 2003, led by Defense Minister [[Paulo Portas]], who managed to launch a series of re-equipment programs, including those of new submarines ([[Tridente-class submarine|''Tridente''-class]]), frigates ([[Karel Doorman-class frigate|''Bartolomeu Dias''-class]]) and off shore patrol ships ([[Viana do Castelo-class patrol vessel|Project NPO 2000 / ''Viana do Castelo'' class]]) for the Navy, of armored vehicles ([[Portuguese Pandur|Pandur]]) for the Army and of heavy helicopters ([[AgustaWestland AW101|EH-101]]) for the Air Force. Ironically one of the most basic challenges \u2013 the replacement of the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62\u00d751mm]] [[battle rifle]]s by [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56\u00d745mm]] [[assault rifle]]s \u2013 failed during his mandate due to the soldiers clinging onto their cheap and highly reliable locally made [[F\u00e1brica de Bra\u00e7o de Prata|FBP]] [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]].\n\nSome important re-equipment programs were however latter canceled or suspended mainly due to cuts in the Defense budget, including the building of a [[amphibious transport dock|multipurpose amphibious ship]] (Project NavPoL), the building of coastal patrol ships (Project NPC 2000) and the acquisition of helicopters ([[Eurocopter EC635|EC635]] and [[NHIndustries NH90|NH90]]) for the [[Portuguese Army Light Aviation Unit|Army Light Aviation Unit]]. Another important challenge faced, in terms of equipment, is the lack of funds for the replacement of the [[Alouette III]] helicopters and the [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]] advanced trainer jets of the Air Force, which, if not addressed in due course, may compromise the future capacity of the Armed Forces to continue to do the complete training of their own aircraft pilots.\n\nDespite the financial cuts in Defense, all international missions assigned to the Portuguese military have been fulfilled without limitations.\n\nRecently purchased equipment include new [[main battle tank]]s ([[Leopard 2]]A6) in 2008 and new coastal patrol vessels ([[Flyvefisken-class patrol vessel|''Tejo''-class]]) in 2014. The process acquisition of the ex-French [[French ship Siroco (L9012)|amphibious assault ship ''Siroco'']] \u2013 as an alternative to the suspended NavPoL \u2013 failed in 2015, with the Portuguese Armed Forces continuing not having an asset which allows them to easily deploy forces to abroad on a larger scale, enhancing its expeditionary capacity.\n\nIn the 2010s, the Portuguese Armed Forces created the Immediate Reaction Force (FRI, ''For\u00e7a de Rea\u00e7\u00e3o Imediata''), aimed at providing an autonomous national response capability to intervene abroad in complex situations to conduct operations as the possible of evacuation of Portuguese citizens from countries under crisis or tension. The FRI includes naval, ground, air and special operations components. Its initial core has an operational readiness of 48 hours and has permanently assigned assets of the three branches of the Armed Forces.\n\n=== Future ===\n[[File:MASS DROP-EXCHANGE BETWEEN PARATROOPERS FORCES OF THE MULTINATIONAL BRIGADE- TRIDENT JUNCTURE 2015 EXERCISE (21975886874).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mass drop of Portuguese paratroopers, which will continue to be an important component of the Portuguese Immediate Reaction Force (FRI)]]\nIn April 2013, the [[Portuguese Government]] approved a structural reform of the National Defense, named \"Defense 2020\" (''Defesa 2020'').<ref>{{cite web|title=RESOLU\u00c7\u00c3O DO CONSELHO DE MINISTROS, \"DEFESA 2020\"|url=http://www.operacional.pt/resolucao-do-conselho-de-ministros-defesa-2020/|website=operacional.pt|publisher=Operacional \u2013 defesa, for\u00e7as armadas e de seguran\u00e7a|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> It was done with the objective of defining the level of ambition of the Armed Forces by establishing the guidance parameters for strategic planning, reinforcing the leading responsibility of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in the execution of the approved [[military strategy]], reducing human resources while at the same time improving their management and enhancing the coordination between the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the branches of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of National Defense.\n\nDefense 2020 establishes the existence of three sets of force:\n* Immediate Reaction Force (FRI, ''For\u00e7a de Rea\u00e7\u00e3o Imediata'') \u2013 a rapid action force, focused in missions such as the evacuation of Portuguese citizens in crisis or conflict areas and response in national complex emergency situations.\n* Permanent Forces in Sovereignty Action  (FPAS, ''For\u00e7as Permanentes em A\u00e7\u00e3o de Soberania'') \u2013 forces focused in the continuous missions of national sovereignty or jurisdiction areas of national responsibility, including the air defense, the maritime and aerial patrolling, surveillance and inspection, land surveillance when required, search and rescue and finally the nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological defense, public interest and disaster response.\n* Modular Set of Forces (CMF, ''Conjunto Modular de For\u00e7as'') \u2013 forces assigned to Portuguese international commitments deployed for periods of six months, capable of engaging in three simultaneous minor operations or in a single major operation. These forces are known as National Deployed Forces (FND, ''For\u00e7as Nacionais Destacadas'').\n\nFuture equipment programs are also in course. In May 2015, a new Military Programming Law was published, which will regulate the founding of the military investments programs until 2026. In June 2016, the Portuguese Government confirmed the intention of acquiring the [[Embraer KC-390]] [[military transport aircraft]] to replace the Lockheed C-130 Hercules fleet of the Portuguese Air Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/portugal-e-o-primeiro-pais-a-receber-aeronave-militar-kc-390-5244442.html|title=Defesa \u2013 Portugal \u00e9 o primeiro pa\u00eds a receber aeronave militar KC-390|publisher=}}</ref> The KC-390 incorporates an important percentage of Portuguese developed technology and will be partially built in Portugal.

Before being proposed to the President, the nominee has to be presented by the Minister of National Defense to the Council of Chiefs of Staff for a previous hearing. If the nominee is refused by the President, the Government has to present another option. Traditionally, there is a rotation of the branch of service that provides the CEMGFA, but this is not mandatory and not always happens.\n\nThe CEMGFA is responsible for the planning and implementation of the operational military strategy, having under his hierarchic dependency the chiefs of staff of the branches of service for the matters that evolve the preparedness, the employment and the sustainment of the forces and assets of the operational component of the system of forces and responding before the Government \u2013 through the Minister of National Defense \u2013 for the military response capacity of the Armed Forces. He/she is the operational commander of the Armed Forces, being responsible for the employment of all forces and assets of the operational component of the system of forces in operational missions. The sustainment of the forces and assets referred before is under the branches of service responsibility, with the respective chiefs of staff being under the CEMGFA dependency for that.\n\nThe branch of service chief of staff who is longer in the function replaces the CEMGFA, in case of his absence or impediment.\n\n===Branches of the Armed Forces===\n[[File:Portuguese Fuzileiros in a boat making a visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) drill during Phoenix Express 2010 (PE-10).jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Visit, board, search, and seizure|VBSS]] action carried by a boarding team of the frigate NRP ''Bartolomeu Dias'' of the Portuguese Navy]]\n[[File:Firing Range of the Portuguese Field Artillery, Trident Juncture 15 (22387967049).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Firing of a [[L118 light gun]] 105 mm howitzer of the Portuguese Army]]\n[[File:Portuguese Navy Rescue Chopper Over the Atlantic (15613348118) (3).jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Search and rescue|SAR]] operation performed by an [[AgustaWestland EH101|EH101]] helicopter of the Portuguese Air Force]]\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces include three branches, these being the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. Created centuries ago, the Navy and the Army are much older than the integrated Armed Forces themselves. The Air Force is however younger, being created as a separate branch already after the establishment of the integrated Armed Forces. The branches of service have as their principal mission to participate, in an integrated form, in the defense of the Republic, in the terms defined by the Constitution and the law, being mainly aimed for the generation, preparation and sustainment of the forces of the operational component of the system of forces. The branches also guarantee their own specific missions established by particular laws and also guarantee the operational missions given to them by the CEMGFA.\n\nThe increasing integration and standardization of the different branches of service meant that their organizations gradually approached. Presently, all the three branches have an identical organizational model that includes: \n* a chief of staff\n* a branch staff\n* central bodies of administration and management\n* a component command\n* bodies of advisement\n* bodies of inspection\n* base bodies \n* elements of the operational component of the system of forces\n\nThe chiefs of staff serve as the branch commanders. The staffs are the bodies for planning and decision support of the respective chiefs of staff, being able also to assume roles of management, control, advisement or inspection. The central bodies of administration and management have a functional character and are intended to guarantee the management and execution in specific fundamental areas and activities as the human, material, financial, information and infrastructures resources management. The component commands (naval, land and air) are intended to support the chiefs of staff in their command roles. The component commands can be put under the direct dependency of the CEMGFA for the exercise of his command roles. The bodies of advisement are intended to support the decision of the chiefs of staff in special and important matters regarding the preparedness, discipline and administration of the branch. The bodies of inspection are intended to support the control and evaluation function of the chiefs of staff. The base bodies are those aimed at the training, the sustainment and the general support of the branch. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces are the forces and assets of the branch intended for the accomplishment of the operational missions.\n\nBesides the above referred standard bodies, the Navy also includes the Hydrographic Institute and the Maritime Search and Rescue Service, while the Air Force also includes the Air Search and Rescue Service.\n\nUntil recently, the Navy also included the National Maritime Authority. Statutorily, the Maritime Authority is now an entirely separate legal entity, but it continues to be headed by the Chief of Staff of the Navy and continues to be mainly administered, supported and staffed by the Navy. The same happens with the National Aeronautic Authority in relation to the Air Force, the difference being that this Authority was already created as a separate legal entity.\n\n===Chiefs of staff of the branches===\nThe chiefs of staff of the Navy, of the Army and of the Air Force command their respective branches, being the military chiefs with the higher authority in each of the branches hierarchy and being the principal advisors of the Minister of National Defense and of the CEMGFA in all matters related with their branches. Inside each branch, the respective chief of staff is the only officer with a [[four-star rank]] (admiral in the Navy and general in the other two branches).\n\nThe chiefs of staff are part of the operational command structure of the Armed Forces, serving as deputy commanders of the CEMGFA. While they report to the CEMGFA in the operational, military intelligence and security, military higher learning, military health and other joint matters, they report directly to the Minister of National Defense in the matters related with the current management of their branches resources.\n\nThe chiefs of staff of the branches are appointed by the President of the Republic, by government proposal, in an analogous process of that of the CEMGFA appointment. The CEMGFA must be heard before a name is proposed to the President.\n\n===Military bodies of advisement===\nThe military bodies of advisement of the armed forces are the Council of Chiefs of Staff and the higher councils of the several branches.\n\nThe Council of Chiefs of Staff is the principal military coordinating body, being also the body of advisement of the CEMGFA. It is presided over by the CEMGFA and also includes the chiefs of staff of the three branches of service. Other military entities may be invited to participate in their meetings, but without voting rights.\n\nIn each of the branches, there is a higher council presided by the respective chief of staff. These are the Council of the Admiralty, the Higher Council of the Army and the Higher Council of the Air Force. The branches may have other advisement bodies like the military careers councils (the councils of class in the Navy, the councils of arm or service in the Army and the councils of specialty in the Air Force).\n\n==Branches of the armed forces==\n\n===Navy===\n{{Main article|Portuguese Navy}}\n[[File:Portuguese frigate NRP Corte Real (F332) underway in the Atlantic Ocean on 6 November 2017 (171106-N-UY653-245).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Portuguese Navy's frigate NRP ''Corte Real'']]\nThe Navy (''Marinha'', with its armed branch also being referred as the ''Armada'') is the naval component of the Portuguese Armed Forces. It includes around 9000 military personnel (including around 1500 marines), 40 commissioned ships and 50 auxiliary vessels. Unlike the other service branches that have an almost purely military role, the Navy historically has had a wide scope of non-military activities, namely serving as the Portuguese maritime administration, and being responsible for the tutelage over of the [[merchant marine]], [[fisheries]], [[Maritime Authority System|maritime authority]] and maritime research affairs. The responsibility over the non-military maritime activities has however been gradually transferred to other organizations since the disbandment of the Navy Ministry in 1974, with only a few \u2013 as the maritime authority and the hydrographic survey \u2013 remaining now under the Navy tutelage.\n\nThe Portuguese Navy is one of the oldest in the world, with its first known naval engagement occurring in 1180. A permanent Navy exists since 1317, when the role of Admiral of Portugal was created.\n\nThe Navy is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Navy and includes the Navy Staff, the Personnel, the Material, the Finance and the Information Technologies superintendences, the Naval Command (naval component command, with five subordinate maritime zone commands), the Council of the Admiralty and the Inspection-General of the Navy. The base bodies of the branch include the [[Lisbon Naval Base]], the Support Unit of the Central Facilities of the Navy, the [[Naval School (Portugal)|Naval School]], the technical schools (Marines, Hydrography and Oceanography, Divers and Naval Technologies), the Integrated Center of Naval Training and Evaluation and the squadrons (Surface Ships, Submarines and Helicopters). The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Navy include the [[Portuguese Marines|Marine Corps Command]], the naval and marine forces, the operational naval, marine and divers assets and units, the command centers and posts and the operations support centers. The Navy includes the Marine Corps (''Corpo de Fuzileiros''), which is a [[naval infantry]] force that serves in the roles of naval [[force protection]], amphibious [[force projection]] and maritime special operations. The Marines themselves include the [[Special Actions Detachment]], which is the [[special operations]] unit of the Navy. The [[Sappers Divers Group]] is the [[List of military diving units|combat divers unit]] of the Navy.

Presently, it includes around 16 000 military personnel. The principal equipment of the Army includes around 100 main battle tanks ([[Leopard 2A6]] and [[M60 Patton]]), 280 tracked [[armored personnel carrier|APC]]s ([[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113]]), 180 wheeled APCs ([[Portuguese Pandur|Pandur II]]), 90 other armored vehicles and 60 field artillery weapons. The principal infantry weapon is still the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62mm]] [[Heckler & Koch G3|HK G3]] [[battle rifle]], although paratroopers and other special troops use instead several models of [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56mm]] [[assault rifle]]s.\n\nThe Portuguese Army can be considered one of the oldest armies of the world, with its origins going back to the [[Hueste|Royal ''Hoste'']] of the 12th century, in the early period of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The foundations of a standing army were established in 1570, with the creation of the ''[[Ordenan\u00e7as]]''. In the middle of the 17th century, the Portuguese land forces started to be referred as the ''Ex\u00e9rcito''.\n\nThe Army is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Army and includes the Army Staff, the Personnel and the Logistics commands, the Directorate of Finance, the Land Forces Command (land component command, with two subordinate military zone commands) and the Inspection-General of the Army. The base bodies of the branch are divided by the scopes of obtainment and administration of human resources (including psychology, recruiting and selection centers and offices), of readying of forces (including 21 regiments of several arms, the [[Special Operations Troops Centre]] and the Army Intelligence and Military Security Center), of logistical support (including the [[Centro de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Geoespacial do Ex\u00e9rcito|Army Geospatial Intelligence Center]], two service support regiments, the Army Material General Support Unit and two health centers), of teaching and training (including the [[Military Academy (Portugal)|Military Academy]], the School of the Arms, the School of the Services, the Army Sergeants School, the [[Col\u00e9gio Militar|Military College]] and the [[Pupilos do Ex\u00e9rcito|Army Pupils Institute]]) and of divulgation and preservation of military culture (including military museums, archives, the Army Band and the Army Fanfare). The Army includes also bodies that support other branches of the Armed Forces, including the Military Prison Establishment, the Military Laboratorial Unit of Biological and Chemical Defense and the Military Unit of Veterinary Medicine. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Army include the Land Forces Command, the formations and operational units commands, the military zones commands and the general support and emergency military support forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=DL n\u00ba231/2009 Cap\u00edtulo II Artigo 6\u00ba|url=http://www.emgfa.pt/documents/87h9rcksmpfj.pdf|website=emgfa.pt|publisher=XVII Governo Constitucional de Portugal|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> The formations include the [[Rapid Reaction Brigade (Portugal)|Rapid Reaction Brigade]], the [[Mechanized Brigade (Portugal)|Mechanized Brigade]] and the [[Intervention Brigade (Portugal)|Intervention Brigade]]. The special troops of the Army include the [[Portuguese Paratroopers|Paratroopers]], the [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] and the [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Operations Troops]], whose units are now all integrated in the Rapid Reaction Brigade.\n\nTraditionally, the Army used to be divided in branches that were designated \"arms\" if they had a mainly combatant role and designated \"services\" if their role was logistical. The main branches were the arms of cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineering and communications and the services of health, military administration, materiel and transportation. Each branch constituted an organization that usually included a branch directorate, a branch school, units and a cadre of personnel. As organizations, these branches were abolished in 1993, but they still exist as occupational groups. Also, most of the Army units continue to be associated to a branch, which in most cases correspond to the main role of the respective unit.\n\n===Air Force===\n{{Main article|Portuguese Air Force}}\n[[File:20151026 christian.timmig Portuguese Aircraft 08 (22495887796).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Portuguese Air Force's [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters]]\nThe Air Force (''For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea'') is the air component of the Portuguese Armed Forces and its younger branch. It includes around 6600 personnel and 100 aircraft.\n\nThe Portuguese Air Force was established as an independent branch of service in 1952, when the Military Aeronautics arm was completely separated from the Army, at the same time starting to control the [[Portuguese Naval Aviation|Naval Aviation]] that was part of the Navy.\n\nThe Air Force is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and includes the Air Force Staff, the Air Force Personnel and the Air Force Logistics commands, the Air Force Directorate of Finance, the Air Command (air component command, with two subordinate air zone commands) and the Inspection-General of the Air Force. The base bodies of the branch include the [[Portuguese Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]], the [[Military and Technical Training Center of the Air Force]], five air bases, two maneuver aerodromes, a transit aerodrome and four radar stations. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Air Force include the operational planning bodies, the Air Command and Control System, the flying units and the anti-aircraft intervention units. The flying units include two training squadrons ([[Socata TB 30 Epsilon|TB 30 Epsilon]] and [[Alpha-Jet]]), one fighter squadron ([[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 AM]]), one attack squadron (F-16 AM), three transport squadrons ([[Lockheed C-130|C-130]], [[C-295]]M and [[Dassault Falcon 50|Falcon 50]]), two helicopter squadrons ([[Alouette III]] and [[AgustaWestland AW101|EH-101]]), one maritime patrol squadron ([[Lockheed P-3]]C) and one Air Force Academy squadron ([[Schleicher ASK 21|ASK-21]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|OGMA Chipmunk Mk 20 (modif)]] and [[LET L-23 Super Blan\u00edk|L-23 Super Blan\u00edk]]). The ''[[Pol\u00edcia A\u00e9rea]]'' (Air Police) is the ground combat force of the Air Force, which serves as its military police, [[force protection]] and ground anti-aircraft defense element, including a special forces unit, this being the Tactical Operations of Protection Core (NOTP).\n\n==The National Republican Guard==\n{{Main article|National Republican Guard (Portugal)}}\n[[File:Render da Guarda no Palacio de Belem 28.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Changing of the GNR guard of the Presidential Palace]]\nThe Nacional Republican Guard (GNR, ''Guarda Nacional Republicana'') is a special corps of troops that has the special feature of being a military force that is not part of the Armed Forces.\n\nIt is a [[gendarmerie]] type security force, made up of around 26 000 military personnel, that is part of the internal security system. It is responsible for the [[preventive police|preventive policing]] of most of the rural areas of the country, the [[Highway patrol|patrolling]] of the [[Roads in Portugal|major highways]], the customs enforcement and the coastal control. It also performs some special missions like the providing of ceremonial military State [[Guard of honour|honor guards]], the security of the [[Pal\u00e1cio de Bel\u00e9m|Presidential]], [[Pal\u00e1cio de S\u00e3o Bento|Parliament]] and [[Pal\u00e1cio das Necessidades|Foreign Ministry]] palaces, the environment and nature protection and the rescue and forest firefighting. In time of peace, the GNR is subordinated to the [[Ministry of Internal Administration (Portugal)|minister of Internal Administration]], except in the scope of uniforms, military doctrine, equipment and armament within which is subordinated to the minister of National Defense.\n\nAlthough not being part of the Armed Forces, the GNR can be placed under the operational command of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in the cases foreseen in the statutes governing the National Defense, the Armed Forces, the state of siege and the [[state of emergency]]. In the scope of its military missions, the GNR is specially adapted for the fulfillment of [[military operations other than war]]. Forces of the GNR have been deployed in international missions in high conflict countries that did not fit with the use of a civilian police force, but where it was not considered politically appropriate to deploy units of the Armed Forces. These international deployments may be done in the scope of the multinational specialized units (MSU) of the [[European Gendarmerie Force]], as it happened with the GNR deployment in Iraq.\n\n==Special forces==\n[[File:Portuguese Naval Special Forces, Portugal, NATO Trident Juncture 15 (22551475570).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Operators of the Portuguese Navy's Special Actions Detachment]]\nThe Portuguese Armed Forces include a number of different types of special forces, distributed by its three branches.\n\nIn the Army, these are generically referred as the \"special troops\" or the \"light infantry\" and represent more than 20% of the total strength of the branch. The Army special troops include the Paratroopers, the [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] and the [[Special Operations Troops Centre|Special Operations Troops]]. The Paratroopers are a mainly parachute light infantry force, that however also include some non-infantry specialized units. The Paratroopers in turn include the [[Pathfinders Company (Portugal)|Air-Land Pathfinders Company]], which is a special parachute reconnaissance unit. The Commandos are a light assault infantry force, specialized in conducting high risk conventional operations. The Special Operations Troops is the Army unit specialized in unconventional warfare.\n\nThe Navy has the Marines Corps (''Corpo de Fuzileiros'') as its special forces. These are a light naval infantry force, specialized in amphibious landings, base and ship security, high seas boarding and naval military police. The Marines include the [[Special Actions Detachment]] which is the Navy's special operations unit dedicated to the unconventional warfare in naval and coastal environment. The Marines also include the PelBoard (Boarding Platoon) teams, that are specialized in high risk [[Visit, board, search, and seizure|visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS)]] actions. The [[Sappers Divers Group]] is the Navy's specialized combat divers unit, which however is not usually considered a special forces unit.\n\nThe present special forces unit of the Air Force is the Tactical Operations of Protection Core (NOTP). This unit is part of the [[Pol\u00edcia A\u00e9rea|Air Police]] and is mainly dedicated to the protection of the forces and assets of the Air Force deployed in high risk areas.\n\n==Personnel==\nCurrently, the Portuguese Armed Forces include 32,992 military personnel, of which 12% are women. The majority of the personnel is in the Army (54%), followed by the Navy (26%) and the Air Force (20%). Conscription in time of peace was fully abolished in 2004 and, since then, 100% of the military personnel is professional.\n\n===Military service===\nThe defense of the Fatherland is a right and a duty of all the Portuguese. The Portuguese citizens have military obligations from the age of 18 years to the age of 35 years.\n\nThe military service include the following situations:\n* Effective service - is the situation of the citizens when they are at the service of the Armed Forces. It includes effective service in the QP (career personnel), RC (contract personnel) and RV (volunteer personnel) or due to call or mobilization.\n* Recruiting reserve - is made of the Portuguese citizens, from the age of 18 years to the age of 35 years, who never served in the Armed Forces, but can be object of an exceptional recruiting.\n* Availability reserve - is made of the Portuguese citizens who have served in the Armed Forces, from the end of their effective service until the end of their military obligations. To call effects, the availability reserve situation includes the six subsequent years after the effective service.\n\nIn time of war, the military obligations age limits can be changed by law.\n\n===Career and voluntary personnel===\nIn time of peace, the military personnel falls in two main groups: career personnel (permanent personnel) and volunteer (temporary personnel). In case of war, these two groups are added with conscript personnel.\n\nCareer personnel (QP, ''Quadro Permanente'') includes the persons who choose the military profession as their permanent life career. Admission to this career requires the [[academic degree|graduation]] in one of the higher education [[military academy|service academies]] for officers or in one of the military technical schools for non-officers. QP personnel only includes officers and sergeants in the Army and the Air Force, but it also includes other ranks in the Navy. Other ranks in the Army and the Air Force are entirely volunteer.\n\nVolunteer personnel includes the persons who usually have a civilian profession, but volunteer to serve temporarily in the military. They might serve in roles related specifically with their civilian professions (e.g.: engineers, [[legal professionals|legal]]s, [[psychologist]]s or [[medic]]s) or in general military roles. They include officers, sergeants and other ranks. Volunteer personnel are further subdivided in two groups: contract regime (RC, ''Regime de Contrato'') and volunteer regime (RV, ''Regime de Voluntariado''). While RC personnel serves for between two and six years, RV personnel serves only for 12 months. Special RC regimes with the duration of up to 20 years are foreseen to be created for roles whose training and technical demands make desirable long periods of service. Personnel in RV can apply to serve in RC after their termination of their period of service.\n\n===Ranks and categories===\n{{main article|Military ranks of Portugal}}\nAccordingly, with their level of responsibility and authority, Portuguese military personnel are divided in three categories: [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] (''oficiais''), [[sergeant]]s (''sargentos'') and other ranks (''pra\u00e7as''). Officers are further divided in three subcategories: [[general officer]]s (''oficiais generais''), [[Military rank#Field or senior officers|senior officers]] (''oficiais superiores'') and [[junior officer]]s (''oficiais subalternos'').\n\n===Occupational groups===\nAccordingly, with their training and role, each member of the Portuguese Armed Forces is part of an occupational group, to each of which corresponds a career and a particular list of promotion. These occupational groups have different specific designations in each branch of service.\n\nThe Navy occupational groups are named \"classes\". For the officers, the classes are navy (M), [[naval engineer]]s (EN), naval administration (AN), marines (FZ), [[physician|naval physicians]] (MN), naval senior technicians (TSN), technical service (ST), health technicians (TS) and musicians (MUS). For the enlisted, the classes are administrative (L), communications (C), auto mechanics-drivers (V), electro mechanics (EM), electro technicians (ET), marines (FZ), maneuvers (M), naval machinists (MQ), [[Underwater diving|diver]]s (U), musicians (B), operations (O), stewards (T) and weapons technicians (A).\n\nThe Army occupational groups are designated \"corps of general officers\", \"arms\" and \"services\". The corps of general officers include all generals, who may originate from the arms or from some of the services officer careers, but with only those originating from the arms being able to achieve the ranks above that of major-general. The arms are mostly careers associated with combatant roles while the services are mostly careers associated with logistical roles. For the officers, the arms are [[infantry]] (INF), [[artillery]] (ART), [[cavalry]] (CAV), [[military engineering|engineering]] (ENG) and [[military communications|communications]] (TM) and the services are military administration (ADMIL), [[Army engineering maintenance|materiel]] (MAT), medicine (MED), pharmacy (FARM), veterinary (VET), dentistry (DENT), nursery, diagnostic and therapeutic technicians (TEDT), chiefs of music band (CBMUS), communications exploration technicians (TEXPTM), communications maintenance technicians (TMANTM), [[materiel]] maintenance technicians (TMANMAT), personnel and secretariat technicians (TPESSECR), transportations technicians (TTRANS), Army general service (SGE) and parachutist general service (SGPQ). For the sergeants, the arms are infantry (INF), artillery (ART), cavalry (CAV), engineering (ENG), communications (TM) and parachutists (PARAQ) and the services are military administration (AM), materiel (MAT), medicine (MED), pharmacy (FARM), veterinary (VET), music (MUS), clarions (CLAR), personnel and secretariat (PESSECR), transportations (TRANS), Army general service (SGE) and amanuensis (AMAN).\n\nThe Army volunteers occupational groups are analogous to the arms and services, but correspond to more specific qualifications. They include functional areas subdivided in specialties for officers and sergeants and specialties for other ranks. The functional areas for the officers and sergeants are mechanized/motorized infantry (AF01), light infantry (AF02), [[field artillery]] (AF03), [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (AF04), cavalry (AF05), [[Army Police (Portugal)|Army police]] (AF06), communications (AF10), transportation (AF18), materiel (AF21), administration (AF22), personnel and secretariat (AF23), engineering (AF24), senior support technicians (AF25), health \u2013 medicine (AF26), health \u2013 nursery (AF26), health \u2013 nursery, diagnostic and therapeutic (AF27), dental health (AF28), veterinary health (AF29) and pharmacy. The specialties for the other ranks are field (Esp-01), mechanics (Esp-02), [[auto mechanic]]s (Esp-03), engineering equipment mechanics (Esp-04), [[panel beater]] mechanics (Esp-05), auto body painter mechanics (Esp-06), services (Esp-07), audiovisual-multimedia (Esp-08), audiovisual-graphics (Esp-09), services saddler-upholstery (Esp-10), services psychometric laboratory operator (Esp-11), engineering [[sapper]] (Esp-12), [[CBRN defense|NBC]] sapper (Esp-13), military light vehicles driving (Esp-14), military heavy vehicles driving (Esp-15), Army police (Esp-16), communications (Esp-17), music (Esp-18), health (Esp-19), paratroopers (Esp-20), special operations (Esp-21), commandos (Esp-22), construction (Esp-23), plumbing (Esp-24), construction carpenter (Esp-25), construction electrician (Esp-26), engineering heavy equipment operator (Esp-27), metalworking (Esp-28), [[farrier]] (Esp-29), catering (Esp-30), bakery (Esp-31) and rescue and assistance systems operator (Esp-32).\n\nThe Air Force occupational groups are designated \"specialties\". The officers specialties include [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilots-aviators]] (PILAV), [[aerospace engineer|aeronautic engineers]] (ENGAER), [[transport engineering#airport engineering|aerodromes engineers]] (ENGAED), [[electrical engineer]]s (ENGEL), physicians (MED), aeronautical administration (ADMAER), jurists (JUR), psychologists (PSI), [[flight navigator|navigators]] (NAV), communications and cryptography operations technicians (TOCC), meteorology operations technicians (TOMET), air circulation and traffic radar operations technicians (TOCART), interception conduct operations technicians (TOCI), air materiel maintenance technicians (TMMA), ground materiel maintenance technicians (TMMT), electrical materiel maintenance technicians (TMMEL), armament and equipment maintenance technicians (TMAEQ), infrastructures maintenance technicians (TMI), supply technicians (TABST), IT technicians (TINF), personnel and administrative support technicians (TPAA), health technicians (TS), air police (PA) and chiefs of music band (CHBM). The enlisted personnel specialties include communications operators (OPCOM), meteorology operators (OPMET), air circulation and traffic radar operators (OPCART), detection radar operators (OPRDET), IT operators (OPINF), assistance and aid systems operators (OPSAS), air materiel mechanics (MMA), ground materiel mechanics (MMT), electricity mechanics (MELECT), electronics mechanics (MELECA), aircraft electricity and instruments mechanics (MELIAV), armament and equipment mechanics (MARME), supply (ABS), infrastructure construction and maintenance (CMI), air police (PA), secretariat and service support (SAS) and musicians (MUS).\n\n===Uniforms and insignia===\nThere is not a standardization of the types of uniforms among the three branches of the Armed Forces. Each branch has its own uniform regulation which is distinct from those of the other service branches. The traditional color of the Portuguese military uniforms, since the middle of the 18th century, was the ''azul ferrete'' (very dark blue). This is still the color of the [[dress uniform|full dress uniforms]] of the three service branches. The [[Service dress|service dress uniform]] colors are the [[navy blue]] (Winter) or [[white]] (Summer) for the Navy, [[grey]] (No.1) or [[olive green]] (No.2) for the Army and [[air force blue]] for the Air Force. All the three branches have a [[military camouflage|camouflaged]] [[battledress|battledress uniform]] in the [[Disruptive Pattern Material|DPM]] pattern (from 1998 to 2010, the Air Force used instead the [[U.S. Woodland]] patern). These camouflage patterns replaced the traditional Portuguese [[Lizard (camouflage)#vertical lizard patterns|vertical lizard pattern]] that was in use in the three service branches from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. In the latte 2018, the Portuguese Army started to experiment the Sistemas de Combate do Soldado (Soldiers Combat Systems) individual equipment system for the dismounted soldiers, which includes a new camouflaged pattern of the [[Multicam]]-style. \n\nThe members of some branches, units or specialties of the three branches of the Armed Forces are identified by the wearing of [[military beret|berets]] whose colors are [[green beret|emerald green]] (Paratroopers), brown (Army generic), navy blue (Marines), [[black beret|black]] (Cavalry, except Cavalry paratroopers), [[blue beret|air force blue]] (Air Police), [[red beret|red]] (Commandos), [[moss green]] (Special Operations) and blue (Navy generic).\n\nOn the contrary of the uniforms, there is a standard common model of rank insignia used in the uniforms of the three service branches. The existence of a common rank insignia system has been in force since 1761, when the Portuguese Army and Navy become one of the first militaries in the world to establish a rank insignia regulation, that was common for the two existing branches at the time. The present system of rank insignia was established in 1911 and is an evolution of the previous ones. Its generic rank devices consists in stars for the general officers, in [[stripe (pattern)|stripes]] for the rest of the officers, in [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese shields]] for the senior sergeants and in [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] for the rest of the sergeants and the other ranks. There is a specific rank insignia for the admirals or generals invested in the office of Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, consisting in four golden stars, which differ from the silver stars worn by the rest of the four-star rank officers (chiefs of staff of the service branches).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Military of Portugal}}\n*[http://www.mdn.gov.pt/ Portuguese Ministry of National Defense]\n*[http://www.emgfa.pt/ Portuguese Armed Forces Chief of Staff]\n*U.S. Mission to NATO, [https://search.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1973NATO03939_b.html 1973NATO03939 Portuguese Forces for NATO], August 22, 1973, released via Wikileaks\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n{{Military of Portugal}}\n{{North Atlantic Treaty Organization}}\n{{Militaries of European Union member states}}\n{{Military of Europe}}\n{{Military of Africa}}\n{{Life in Portugal}}\n\n[[Category:Military of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Permanent Structured Cooperation]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces"}
