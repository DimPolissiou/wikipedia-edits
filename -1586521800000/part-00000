{"title_page": "Nadia's Theme", "text_new": "\"'''Nadia's Theme'''\" is a piece of music composed by [[Barry De Vorzon]] and [[Perry Botkin Jr.]] in 1971. It became associated with Olympic gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] during and after the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. The composition has been used as the [[theme music]] to the American television [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' intermittently since the series debuted in 1973. This piece is also used regularly by Steve Wright presenter on BBC Radio 2 Sunday Love songs as a backing bed.\n\n==Origins==\nDe Vorzon and Botkin Jr. composed this piece of music, originally titled \"Cotton's Dream\", as [[incidental music]] for the 1971 theatrical film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]''. The instrumental version was commercially released on [[Bless the Beasts and Children (soundtrack)|that film's soundtrack album]] on [[A&M Records]]. The soundtrack also included \"Lost\", a song set to this melody, performed by Ren\u00e9e Armand.\n\nBotkin Jr. later composed a rearranged version of the instrumental theme for the U.S. TV soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]],'' which debuted on March 26, 1973, on the [[CBS|CBS television network]]. Although a soundtrack album for the TV series was released by [[Pickwick Records|P.I.P. Records]] in 1974, the LP only contained a <!--vocal?-->cover version by [[easy listening]] group [[Sounds of Sunshine]], rather than the original recording by De Vorzon and Botkin.\n\n==Association with Nadia Com\u0103neci==\n\nIn late July or early August 1976, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s sports anthology  program ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' produced a montage of Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]]'s routines during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]<ref>[https://www.olympic.org/nadia-comaneci Nadia Com\u0103neci] at Olympic.org</ref> and used \"Cotton's Dream\" as the background music. It was this American television montage that cemented the association of the tune with Com\u0103neci in the public mind. (Com\u0103neci herself never performed her floor exercises using this piece of music, however. She used a piano arrangement of a medley of the songs \"[[Yes Sir, That's My Baby (song)|Yes Sir, That's My Baby]]\" and \"[[Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump in the Line]]\".)\n\n==1976 releases==\nViewer inquiries about the music from the ''Wide World of Sports'' montage prompted a commercial release of the 1971 version of the song as a [[single (music)|single]] through A&M Records on August 28, 1976. This recording was identical to \"Cotton's Dream,\" with a repeat from the bridge to the end edited in to lengthen the piece. The single was titled \"Nadia's Theme (The Young and the Restless)\" and was a commercial success, charting for 22 weeks and peaking at #8 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on the week ending December 12, 1976. A&M Records failed to credit De Vorzon as the co-writer on the first pressings of the single. He successfully sued the record label for $241,000.\n\nIn October 1976, as the De Vorzon & Botkin version on A&M climbed the charts, P.I.P. Records released a single containing the Sounds of Sunshine's vocal and instrumental versions under the title \"Nadia's Theme (The Young and the Restless)\". The label also re-released the 1974 ''Young and the Restless'' soundtrack LP, now stickered to say it contained \"Nadia's Theme\", although it still only contained the cover version. That same month, Barry De Vorzon capitalized on the success of the song by releasing it on his first album, ''Nadia's Theme (The Young and the Restless)''. Soon after, Sounds of Sunshine released their own ''Nadia's Theme'' album.\n\nOn 23 November 1976, [[CBS]] further entrenched the song's association with Com\u0103neci by using the melody in its broadcast of \"Nadia\u2014From Romania with Love\", a one-hour TV special hosted by [[Flip Wilson]], co-produced by CBS and Romanian television. The De Vorzon & Botkin version of the song was not released on [[Compact disc|CD]] until Eric Records included it on the 2003 compilation ''Hard to Find Orchestral Instrumentals II''. An extract from the tune is used regularly as a jingle by [[BBC Radio 2]] disk jockey [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] on his ''Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs''.\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976\u201377)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Canada ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5143&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5143.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5143|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1976-12-25 |accessdate=2019-03-14}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5132a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5132a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5132a|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1976-12-11 |accessdate=2019-03-14}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|U.S. [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19761204.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, December 4, 1976]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.3893a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.3893a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.3893a|title=Image : RPM Weekly|first=Library and Archives|last=Canada|date=January 16, 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|74\n|-\n|U.S. ([[Joel Whitburn]]'s ''Pop Annual'')<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |date=1999 |title=Pop Annual |url= |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |publisher=Record Research Inc. |page= |isbn=0-89820-142-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|73\n|-\n|U.S. ''Cash Box'' <ref>[http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1976YESP.html Cash Box Year-End Charts: Top 100 Pop Singles, December 25, 1976]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Alternate versions==\nOther versions of \"Nadia's Theme\" have been recorded, including easy listening renditions by such artists as [[Ronnie Aldrich]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Ferrante & Teicher]], the orchestra of ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', [[Roger Williams (pianist)|Roger Williams]] and [[James Galway]]; a semi-rock version by [[The Ventures]]; and [[David Hasselhoff]]'s vocal rendition, which incorporated De Vorzon's and Botkin Jr.'s lyrics, for his 1987 album ''[[Lovin' Feelings]]''. There was also a vocal version by The Sounds Of Sunshine released as a single on p.i.p.(Pickwick International Production) records.\n\nThe ''Young and the Restless'' began using a light remix of \"Nadia's Theme\" in 1988, then switched to a jazz arrangement during a three-year stint in the early 2000s (decade) before returning to the 1988 version.\n\nThe song was sampled in a piece of music from the 1993 [[video game]], ''[[Aero the Acro-Bat]]''\n\n[[Mary J. Blige]] included the instrumental version as a backdrop in her 2001 single, \"[[No More Drama (song)|No More Drama]]\". Botkin, who had never heard of Blige prior to this was delighted to get a writing credit, saying: \"I woke up one morning and I\u2019m on the cutting edge of R&B,\u201d says the composer, who now specializes in electronic music. \u201dThese days, I\u2019m completely removed from pop music \u2014 except when [royalty] checks arrive.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,220129,00.html |title=Daytime 'Drama' |author=Evan Serpick |date=2002-03-27 |work=EW.com |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Sonshine Media Network International]] in the Philippines used the piece as background music following a series of montages for the Glory Mountain in [[Mt.

An extract from the tune is used regularly as a jingle by [[BBC Radio 2]] disk jockey [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] on his ''Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs''.\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976\u201377)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Canada ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5143&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5143.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5143|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1976-12-25 |accessdate=2019-03-14}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5132a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5132a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5132a|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1976-12-11 |accessdate=2019-03-14}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|U.S. [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19761204.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, December 4, 1976]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.3893a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.3893a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.3893a|title=Image : RPM Weekly|first=Library and Archives|last=Canada|date=January 16, 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|74\n|-\n|U.S. ([[Joel Whitburn]]'s ''Pop Annual'')<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |date=1999 |title=Pop Annual |url= |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |publisher=Record Research Inc. |page= |isbn=0-89820-142-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|73\n|-\n|U.S. ''Cash Box'' <ref>[http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1976YESP.html Cash Box Year-End Charts: Top 100 Pop Singles, December 25, 1976]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Alternate versions==\nOther versions of \"Nadia's Theme\" have been recorded, including easy listening renditions by such artists as [[Ronnie Aldrich]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Ferrante & Teicher]], the orchestra of ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', [[Roger Williams (pianist)|Roger Williams]] and [[James Galway]]; a semi-rock version by [[The Ventures]]; and [[David Hasselhoff]]'s vocal rendition, which incorporated De Vorzon's and Botkin Jr.'s lyrics, for his 1987 album ''[[Lovin' Feelings]]''.

Then shortened to K'empala and finally Kampala.\n\nWith \"kasozi\" meaning \"hill\", \n\"ke\" meaning \"of\", and \"empala\" the plural of \"impala\".\n\nAnd hence the name \"Kampala\" came to refer to this initial British colonial settlement that would later on spread out from this occupied [[Old Kampala]] hill near the pre-existing [[Kibuga]] (capital) of the Buganda Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Kampala.html\n| title=Kampala: Origin of The Name\n| publisher=Myetymology.com\n| accessdate=11 June 2014\n| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000657/http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Kampala.html\n| archive-date=31 December 2013\n| url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kampala}}\n[[File:Uganda. Kampala. The city from Cathedral Hill LOC matpc.00324.jpg|thumb|left|Kampala. The city from Cathedral Hill.]]\nThis area of numerous hills and swamps that later become known as Kampala was part of the core of the highly centralized [[Buganda Kingdom]].\n\nIt was also the site of the shifting [[Kibuga]] (capital) of the different Bassekabaka (Kings) of the Buganda Kingdom with each [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] (King) upon coronation or subsequently during their reign setting up their Kibuga (capital) on a new and or different hill as they wished or desired.\n\nThe first written description of this [[Kibuga]] (capital) was by the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] in his book, ''The Lake Region of East Africa'' published in 1860. In the book, Burton relying on the information collected by Snay Bin Amir, an Arab trader, described the Kibuga as\n\n{{Quote|text=\u2026the settlement is not less than a day\u2019s journey in length, the buildings are of cane and rattan. The sultan (Kabaka)\u2019s palace is at least a mile long and the circular huts neatly arranged in a line are surrounded by a strong fence which has only four gates.}}\n\nIn 1862 when explorer [[John Speke]] arrived in Buganda the [[Kibuga]] (capital) was at Bandabarogo, present-day [[Banda, Uganda|Banda Hill]], and the reigning Kabaka (King) was [[Mutesa I of Buganda|Mutesa&nbsp;I]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/journaldiscover02spekgoog/page/n280 | title=Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile| publisher=Harper| year=1864}}</ref>\n\nIn 1875 explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] reported the capital as being at present-day [[Lubaga]] hill where he met the same Kabaka {{nowrap|Mutesa I.}}\nDuring this visit, Henry Stanley Morton wrote a letter that was published in the ''Daily Telegraphy'', inviting missionaries to come to Buganda. He also described the Kibuga in his 1870s dispatches to the ''New York Herald'', thus:\n\n{{Quote|text=As we approached the capital, the highway from Usavara [Busabala] increased in width from {{convert|20|ft|m|0|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us}} to {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us|round=5}}...Arrived at the capital I found the vast collection of huts crowning the eminence were the Royal Quarters, around which ran several palisades and circular courts, between which and the city was a circular road, ranging from {{convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us}} to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us|round=5}}  in width with gardens and huts...|source=Bennet, N.R.

Captain Lugard would, later on, be allocated the hill that would soon be known as [[Old Kampala]], and on which he built a fort.\n\nIn 1895 [[Mengo Senior School]], the first school offering Western education in Kampala, was opened by the [[Church Missionary Society]] at [[Namirembe hill]], where mostly children of chiefs and pages of the royal palaces were the students.\n\nIn 1897 Ssekabaka Mwanga rebelled and waged a war against British rule and was subsequently captured and deported in 1899 to Seychelles alongside Omukama [[Kabalega]], and his 3-year-old son was made king by the combined forces of the British officers, Nubian soldiers and Baganda collaborators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/1370466-1379638-14dfxax/index.html|title=The betrayal and capture of Mwanga and Kabalega|website=Daily Monitor|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\nThis state of affairs later culminated in the signing of the [[Buganda Agreement (1900)]] that formalized British colonial rule in Buganda.\n\nAlso in 1897, Kampala's first Western-style health facility [[Mengo Hospital]] was opened on [[Namirembe]] hill by British doctor and missionary Sir [[Albert Ruskin Cook]]. In addition the same Dr Albert Cook would in 1913 found [[Mulago Hospital]], the current National Referral Hospital, at [[Mulago]] hill.\n\nIn 1899, [[Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa]] founded [[Lubaga Hospital]] at [[Lubaga]] hill.\n\nIn 1900, the regents of the infant king [[Daudi Cwa II of Buganda|Daudi Cwa 11]], that is: [[Apolo Kagwa]] the [[Katikiro]] (Prime Minister) of Buganda, Stanislaus Mugwanya the Mulamuzi (Chief Judge) of Buganda and Zakaria Kisingiri the Muwanika (Chief Treasurer) of Buganda with Bishop [[Alfred Tucker]], signed the [[Buganda Agreement]] on behalf of Buganda with Sir [[Harry Johnston]] who signed on behalf of the British Government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/1370466-1387958-14e15y2/index.html|title=The great Buganda land grab of 1900|website=Daily Monitor|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Townsmen In The Making, Kampala and it's suburbs|last=Gutkind|first=P.C.W|last2=Southall|first2=A.W|publisher=East African Institute Of Social Research|year=1957|isbn=978-0013388883|location=Kampala|pages=4}}</ref>\n\nThis agreement by Sir Harry Johnston created new land tenures such as freehold, Crownland, and ''mailo'', and divided up and allocated the land in such a way that would come to define the development of Kampala.\n\nThe land in Buganda's capital ([[Kibuga]]) including [[Mengo, Uganda|Mengo]] hill, [[Makerere]] hill, etc. was allocated to the young king, the Baganda colonial collaborators, etc. under ''mailo'' and freehold.\n\nThe religious missions were also formally allocated land they were previously occupying. Thus the Catholic White Fathers got [[Lubaga]] hill, the Protestant Church Missionary Society got [[Namirembe]] hill, the Muslims under Prince Nuhu Mbogo's leadership received [[Kibuli]] hill, the British Catholic [[Saint Joseph's Missionary Society of Mill Hill|Mill Hill Missionaries]] received most of [[Nsambya]] hill. and finally, the Uganda Protectorate government got land classified as Crown-lands in the area such as [[Old Kampala]] hill, [[Nakasero]] Hill, etc.\n\nTo legalize the above changes, the following laws and ordinances were subsequently passed: The Crown lands Ordinance of 1903, The Land Law of 1908, The Registration of Land Titles ordinance of 1922 and the Busulu and Envujo law of 1928.<ref>Mukwaya, A.B (1953). \"The Land Tenure System in Buganda: Present day Tendecies\".

Then shortened to K'empala and finally Kampala.\n\nWith \"kasozi\" meaning \"hill\", \n\"ke\" meaning \"of\", and \"empala\" the plural of \"impala\".\n\nAnd hence the name \"Kampala\" came to refer to this initial British colonial settlement that would later on spread out from this occupied [[Old Kampala]] hill near the pre-existing [[Kibuga]] (capital) of the Buganda Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Kampala.html\n| title=Kampala: Origin of The Name\n| publisher=Myetymology.com\n| accessdate=11 June 2014\n| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000657/http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Kampala.html\n| archive-date=31 December 2013\n| url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kampala}}\n[[File:Uganda. Kampala. The city from Cathedral Hill LOC matpc.00324.jpg|thumb|left|Kampala. The city from Cathedral Hill.]]\nThis area of numerous hills and swamps that later become known as Kampala was part of the core of the highly centralized [[Buganda Kingdom]].\n\nIt was also the site of the shifting [[Kibuga]] (capital) of the different Bassekabaka (Kings) of the Buganda Kingdom with each [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] (King) upon coronation or subsequently during their reign setting up their Kibuga (capital) on a new and or different hill as they wished or desired.\n\nThe first written description of this [[Kibuga]] (capital) was by the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] in his book, ''The Lake Region of East Africa'' published in 1860. In the book, Burton relying on the information collected by Snay Bin Amir, an Arab trader, described the Kibuga as\n\n{{Quote|text=\u2026the settlement is not less than a day\u2019s journey in length, the buildings are of cane and rattan. The sultan (Kabaka)\u2019s palace is at least a mile long and the circular huts neatly arranged in a line are surrounded by a strong fence which has only four gates.}}\n\nIn 1862 when explorer [[John Speke]] arrived in Buganda the [[Kibuga]] (capital) was at Bandabarogo, present-day [[Banda, Uganda|Banda Hill]], and the reigning Kabaka (King) was [[Mutesa I of Buganda|Mutesa&nbsp;I]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/journaldiscover02spekgoog/page/n280 | title=Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile| publisher=Harper| year=1864}}</ref>\n\nIn 1875 explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] reported the capital as being at present-day [[Lubaga]] hill where he met the same Kabaka {{nowrap|Mutesa I.}}\nDuring this visit, Henry Stanley Morton wrote a letter that was published in the ''Daily Telegraphy'', inviting missionaries to come to Buganda. He also described the Kibuga in his 1870s dispatches to the ''New York Herald'', thus:\n\n{{Quote|text=As we approached the capital, the highway from Usavara [Busabala] increased in width from {{convert|20|ft|m|0|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us}} to {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us|round=5}}...Arrived at the capital I found the vast collection of huts crowning the eminence were the Royal Quarters, around which ran several palisades and circular courts, between which and the city was a circular road, ranging from {{convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us}} to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr|sp=us|round=5}}  in width with gardens and huts...|source=Bennet, N.R.

Captain Lugard would, later on, be allocated the hill that would soon be known as [[Old Kampala]], and on which he built a fort.\n\nIn 1895 [[Mengo Senior School]], the first school offering Western education in Kampala, was opened by the [[Church Missionary Society]] at [[Namirembe hill]], where mostly children of chiefs and pages of the royal palaces were the students.\n\nIn 1897 Ssekabaka Mwanga rebelled and waged a war against British rule and was subsequently captured and deported in 1899 to Seychelles alongside Omukama [[Kabalega]], and his 3-year-old son was made king by the combined forces of the British officers, Nubian soldiers and Baganda collaborators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/1370466-1379638-14dfxax/index.html|title=The betrayal and capture of Mwanga and Kabalega|website=Daily Monitor|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\nThis state of affairs later culminated in the signing of the [[Buganda Agreement (1900)]] that formalized British colonial rule in Buganda.\n\nAlso in 1897, Kampala's first Western-style health facility [[Mengo Hospital]] was opened on [[Namirembe]] hill by British doctor and missionary Sir [[Albert Ruskin Cook]]. In addition the same Dr Albert Cook would in 1913 found [[Mulago Hospital]], the current National Referral Hospital, at [[Mulago]] hill.\n\nIn 1899, [[Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa]] founded [[Lubaga Hospital]] at [[Lubaga]] hill.\n\nIn 1900, the regents of the infant king [[Daudi Cwa II of Buganda|Daudi Cwa 11]], that is: [[Apolo Kagwa]] the [[Katikiro]] (Prime Minister) of Buganda, Stanislaus Mugwanya the Mulamuzi (Chief Judge) of Buganda and Zakaria Kisingiri the Muwanika (Chief Treasurer) of Buganda with Bishop [[Alfred Tucker]], signed the [[Buganda Agreement]] on behalf of Buganda with Sir [[Harry Johnston]] who signed on behalf of the British Government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/1370466-1387958-14e15y2/index.html|title=The great Buganda land grab of 1900|website=Daily Monitor|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Townsmen In The Making, Kampala and it's suburbs|last=Gutkind|first=P.C.W|last2=Southall|first2=A.W|publisher=East African Institute Of Social Research|year=1957|isbn=978-0013388883|location=Kampala|pages=4}}</ref>\n\nThis agreement by Sir Harry Johnston created new land tenures such as freehold, Crownland, and ''mailo'', and divided up and allocated the land in such a way that would come to define the development of Kampala.\n\nThe land in Buganda's capital ([[Kibuga]]) including [[Mengo, Uganda|Mengo]] hill, [[Makerere]] hill, etc. was allocated to the young king, the Baganda colonial collaborators, etc. under ''mailo'' and freehold.\n\nThe religious missions were also formally allocated land they were previously occupying. Thus the Catholic White Fathers got [[Lubaga]] hill, the Protestant Church Missionary Society got [[Namirembe]] hill, the Muslims under Prince Nuhu Mbogo's leadership received [[Kibuli]] hill, the British Catholic [[Saint Joseph's Missionary Society of Mill Hill|Mill Hill Missionaries]] received most of [[Nsambya]] hill. and finally, the Uganda Protectorate government got land classified as Crown-lands in the area such as [[Old Kampala]] hill, [[Nakasero]] Hill, etc.\n\nTo legalize the above changes, the following laws and ordinances were subsequently passed: The Crown lands Ordinance of 1903, The Land Law of 1908, The Registration of Land Titles ordinance of 1922 and the Busulu and Envujo law of 1928.<ref>Mukwaya, A.B (1953). \"The Land Tenure System in Buganda: Present day Tendecies\".
