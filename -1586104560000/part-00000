CIA officials read the manuscript and told Marchetti and Marks that they had to remove 339 passages, nearly a fifth of the book. After long negotiations the CIA yielded on 171 items. That left 168 censored passages. The publisher, [[Alfred A. Knopf]], decided to go ahead and publish the book with blanks for those passages, and with the sections that the CIA had originally cut then restored printed in boldface.\n\nThe publication of Marchetti and Marks' censored book, which became a bestseller, raised concerns about the way the [[CIA influence on public opinion|CIA was censoring information]]. It contributed to investigative reports by [[Seymour Hersh]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the decision by [[Frank Church]] to establish the [[Church Committee|United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities]] in 1975. The report, ''Foreign and Military Intelligence'', was published in 1976.\n\n===''The Search for the Manchurian Candidate''===\nMarks' 1979 book, ''The Search for the Manchurian Candidate'' describes a wide range of CIA activities during the [[Cold War]], including unethical drug experiments in the context of a [[Project MKULTRA|mind-control and chemical interrogation research program]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Search-Manchurian-Candidate-Behavioral-Sciences/dp/0393307948 The Search for the \"Manchurian Candidate\": The CIA and Mind Control: The Secret History of the Behavioral Sciences: John D.

CIA officials read the manuscript and told Marchetti and Marks that they had to remove 339 passages, nearly a fifth of the book. After long negotiations the CIA yielded on 171 items. That left 168 censored passages. The publisher, [[Alfred A.

It contributed to investigative reports by [[Seymour Hersh]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the decision by [[Frank Church]] to establish the [[Church Committee|United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities]] in 1975.
