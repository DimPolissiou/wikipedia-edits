{"title_page": "Harshat Mata Temple", "text_new": "[[File:Har\u1e63at Mata ka Mandir 2019 (14).jpg|thumb|Harshat Mata Temple in Abaneri, Rajasthan (2019)]]\nThe '''Harshat Mata Temple''' ([[IAST]]: ''Har\u1e63at M\u0101t\u0101 k\u0101 Mandir'') is a [[Hindu temple]] in the [[Abhaneri]] (or \"Abaneri\") village of [[Rajasthan]], in north-western India. The temple is now dedicated to a goddess called Harshat Mata, although some art historians theorize that it was originally a [[Vaishnavite]] shrine.\n\nThe original temple appears to have been built in the ''[[panchayatana (temple)|panchayatana]]'' style, which features a main shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines. Only parts of the main shrine now survive and they have been ruined and modified over several centuries, with the tall [[shikhara]] tower replaced by a roof-dome. Much of the platform survives, with fragments of carved stones from the original structure, but most of the sculptures have been removed to the museums in [[Amber, Rajasthan|Amber]] and [[Central Museum, Jaipur|Jaipur]].\n\nNo [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence survives regarding the temple's construction, but based on an analysis of its architectural and sculptural styles, historians believe that it was built in the early 9th century, shortly after the construction of the adjoining [[Chand Baori]] stepwell. The temple's original builder is unknown, but historians theorize that it may have been built by a [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjara-Pratihara]] king, possibly in association with a local [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] vassal. The temple is now protected by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], but remains in religious use.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:A mound depicting a complete temple.JPG|thumb|left|Stone depicting the original appearance of the temple]]\n\n=== Date ===\nThe original Harshat Mata temple has been ruined and modified over several centuries.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}} No epigraphic evidence been found regarding the construction of the temple or the [[Chand Baori]] [[stepwell]] connected with it.<ref name=\"Chandramani_2002\"/> Based on similarities in style and carvings with the terraced temples of Paranagar and [[Mandore]], the Baodi can be dated to 8th-9th century.<ref name=\"Chandramani_2002\">{{cite book |editor=Chandramani Singh |title=Protected Monuments of Rajasthan |url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&id=i-jVAAAAMAAJ&q=Harshat|year=2002 |publisher=Jawahar Kala Kendra |isbn=978-81-86782-60-6 |pages=176\u2013177}}</ref> The Baodi was likely constructed before the temple,{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1997|p=64}} which can be dated to the 9th century based on stylistic grounds.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=201}} [[Art historian]] Michael W Meister of [[University of Pennsylvania]] dates the temple complex to c. 800\u2013825 CE based on architectural details.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=645}}\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nBased on analysis of sculptures at the temple, art historians such as Meister and R. C. Agrawala (1991) theorize that the temple was originally a [[Vaishnava]] shrine.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=652}} Art historian Cynthia Packert Atherton (1995) theorizes that the temple's iconography is representative of the [[Pancharatra]] movement of Vaishnavism.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=207}} Falk Reitz (1993) of [[University of Bonn]], however, believes that the temple was always a [[Shaktism|Shakta]] temple dedicated to a goddess ([[Devi]]). Reitz associates several sculptural fragments from Abhaneri - now kept in various museums - with the Harshat Mata temple, and concludes that these fragments show strong Shakta and Shaiva influence. According to Reitz, this is not surprising, since Durga and Parvati (Shiva's wife) are considered different aspects of the same goddess.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=649}} Reitz states that the Vaishnava sculptures at the temple have a \"subordinate position\", and cannot be used to make any conclusions about the temple's sectarian affiliation. According to him, [[panchayatana (temple)|panchayatana]] temples tend to be [[religious syncretism|syncretic]], and it is not surprising to find Vaishnava or Shaiva sculptures at a Shakta temple.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=652}}\n\nAccording to Reitz, the two fragments of a [[Durga]] sculpture discovered in the Chand Baori compound may have belonged to the main idol of the original temple. This sculpture appears to have been a {{convert|1.5|m|adj=on}} high statue of Durga in her ''Mahishasura-mardini'' (killer of the [[Mahishasura|buffalo demon]]) form. The bigger fragment shows the lower part of Durga's torso with her left leg, her lion [[vahana]], a male attendant, and a beheaded buffalo. The smaller fragment shows six right arms of the multi-armed Durga, with one of the arms pulling an arrow from the quiver; it also features the remains of a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] in the form of a lotus leaf, and two [[gandharva]]s (heavenly beings).{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=645}} Reitz points out that the intact sculpture would have been similar to the idol in the Pipala-devi Temple at [[Osian, Jodhpur|Osian]], which like the Harshat Mata temple, has been dated to 800\u2013825 CE by Meister.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|pp=645-646}}\n\n=== Builder ===\n\nThe builder of the original temple is unknown.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hamendar Bhisham Pal |title=The Temples of Rajasthan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybPqAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=Prakash |page=83 |quote=The construction of ancient temple of Harshatmata situated at a small village of Abaneri or Abhanagari, four miles from Bandikui Railway Station in Jaipur district has been ascribed to the 9th century.

He notes that [[Shakambhari]] \u2013 the [[tutelary deity]] of the Chahamanas \u2013 has been identified as a form of Durga, and the Bhagavati Barah [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper-plate inscription]] states that Bhagavati (another form of the goddess) was one of the tutelary deities of Nagabhata II.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|pp=652-653}} Atherton notes that the lack of adequate historical information prevents attribution of the temple to a particular ruler with certainty,{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}} but it is more likely that the Gurjara-Pratiharas \u2013 not the Chahamanas \u2013 were the patrons of the temple, with Nagabhata II being the best candidate.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nIn the 20th century, the sanctum had a Durga idol, which was stolen. It was replaced with an idol of goddess [[Lakshmi]], who is now worshipped as Harshat-Mata.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rajendra Yadav |title=Sculptural art of Abaneri: a paradigm |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SejVAAAAMAAJ |year=2006 |publisher=Jawahar Kala Kendra / Literary Circle |page=5 |quote=The ancient ruined temple is popularly known as Harshatmata-ka-Mandir, after the enshrined deity Durga. It was worshiped as Harshatmata which was stolen few decades ago but later inspite of Durga, an image of Lakshmi was installed in the sanctum which is under worship and now it is called as Harshatmata. }}</ref>\n\nThe temple remains in religious use; it was inscribed by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] under Act No. LXXI of 1951 dated 28 November 1951.<ref name=\"ASI\">{{cite web |url=http://asijaipurcircle.nic.in/Harsat%20mata%20ka%20mandir.html |title=Harsat Mata ka Mandir |publisher=Archaeological Survey of India Jaipur Circle |access-date=29 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe original temple appears to have been built in the [[panchayatana (temple)|panchayatana]] style, which features a main shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=645}} Only parts of the main shrine, and the bottom of an open [[mandapa]] with columns survive now, and they have been ruined and modified over several centuries, with roof-domes added.  Much of the platform survives, and carved stones from the original structure lie around it, but most of the sculptures have been removed to the museums in [[Amber, Rajasthan]] and the [[Central Museum, Jaipur]].{{sfn|George Michell|1990|p=273}}\n\nThe entrance to the temple faces east, towards the rising sun. The temple complex is built on two broad stepped terraces (''jagati''), which originally included a [[parikrama|circumambulatory]] path, and are now partially ruined. The boundary of the lower terrace has a relatively plain set of foundation and [[base molding]]s (''vedibandha''), which have decorative patterns at the top. The ruins of two small shrines flank the entrance stairway. The upper terrace is far more decorated, but is largely destroyed; the only image that remains intact is of [[Narasimha]] flanked by warriors.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}}\n\nThe four subsidiary shrines may have been located on the upper terrace.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=645}} Frank Reitz, who believes that the main idol of the temple was always that of Durga, theorizes that the four subsidiary shrines were located to Surya (north-west corner), Ganesha (north-east corner), Karttikeya (south-east corner), and Lakshmi-Narayana or Uma-Maheshvara (south-west). Reitz's theory is based on an analysis of other contemporary and near-contemporary temples, as well as a study of various fragments found at the Chand Baori compound or housed at various museums.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=648}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nHar\u1e63at Mata ka Mandir 2019 (13).jpg | Entrance stairs\nAbhaneri-Harshat Mata-Tempel-16-2018-gje.jpg | Main dome around the ''[[garbhagriha]]''\n\u0906\u092d\u093e\u0928\u0947\u0930\u0940 04.JPG | Harshat Mata's image in the sanctum\nHar\u1e63at Mata ka Mandir 2019 (11).jpg | Stone carvings on the upper terrace\n</gallery>\n\nThe main shrine is erected on a platform (''mancha'') located at the top of the two terraces. The platform is bounded by a circumambulatory path (''sandhara''), which was connected to a pillared porch (''gudhamandapa''). The original path and the porch have been destroyed, and have been rebuilt haphazardly.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}} The platform features figures engaged in amorous activities,{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=203}} which seem to be depictions of encounters between a royal figure and his consorts.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=201}} According to art historian Cynthia Packert Atherton (1995), these are an idealized portrayal of the temple's royal patron, and are symbolic of Vishnu's reign on earth, thus reinforcing the idea of [[divine kingship]].{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=212}}\n\nSeveral sculptural fragments found at the compound of the adjoining [[Chand Baori]] stepwell; the format and dimensions of these fragments suggest that they were once attached to the base moldings on the circumambulatory path.

The temple is now dedicated to a goddess called Harshat Mata, although some art historians theorize that it was originally a [[Vaishnavite]] shrine.\n\nThe original temple appears to have been built in the ''[[panchayatana (temple)|panchayatana]]'' style, which features a main shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines. Only parts of the main shrine now survive and they have been ruined and modified over several centuries, with the tall [[shikhara]] tower replaced by a roof-dome. Much of the platform survives, with fragments of carved stones from the original structure, but most of the sculptures have been removed to the museums in [[Amber, Rajasthan|Amber]] and [[Central Museum, Jaipur|Jaipur]].\n\nNo [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence survives regarding the temple's construction, but based on an analysis of its architectural and sculptural styles, historians believe that it was built in the early 9th century, shortly after the construction of the adjoining [[Chand Baori]] stepwell. The temple's original builder is unknown, but historians theorize that it may have been built by a [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjara-Pratihara]] king, possibly in association with a local [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] vassal. The temple is now protected by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], but remains in religious use.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:A mound depicting a complete temple.JPG|thumb|left|Stone depicting the original appearance of the temple]]\n\n=== Date ===\nThe original Harshat Mata temple has been ruined and modified over several centuries.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}} No epigraphic evidence been found regarding the construction of the temple or the [[Chand Baori]] [[stepwell]] connected with it.<ref name=\"Chandramani_2002\"/> Based on similarities in style and carvings with the terraced temples of Paranagar and [[Mandore]], the Baodi can be dated to 8th-9th century.<ref name=\"Chandramani_2002\">{{cite book |editor=Chandramani Singh |title=Protected Monuments of Rajasthan |url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&id=i-jVAAAAMAAJ&q=Harshat|year=2002 |publisher=Jawahar Kala Kendra |isbn=978-81-86782-60-6 |pages=176\u2013177}}</ref> The Baodi was likely constructed before the temple,{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1997|p=64}} which can be dated to the 9th century based on stylistic grounds.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=201}} [[Art historian]] Michael W Meister of [[University of Pennsylvania]] dates the temple complex to c. 800\u2013825 CE based on architectural details.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=645}}\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nBased on analysis of sculptures at the temple, art historians such as Meister and R. C. Agrawala (1991) theorize that the temple was originally a [[Vaishnava]] shrine.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=652}} Art historian Cynthia Packert Atherton (1995) theorizes that the temple's iconography is representative of the [[Pancharatra]] movement of Vaishnavism.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=207}} Falk Reitz (1993) of [[University of Bonn]], however, believes that the temple was always a [[Shaktism|Shakta]] temple dedicated to a goddess ([[Devi]]). Reitz associates several sculptural fragments from Abhaneri - now kept in various museums - with the Harshat Mata temple, and concludes that these fragments show strong Shakta and Shaiva influence. According to Reitz, this is not surprising, since Durga and Parvati (Shiva's wife) are considered different aspects of the same goddess.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=649}} Reitz states that the Vaishnava sculptures at the temple have a \"subordinate position\", and cannot be used to make any conclusions about the temple's sectarian affiliation. According to him, [[panchayatana (temple)|panchayatana]] temples tend to be [[religious syncretism|syncretic]], and it is not surprising to find Vaishnava or Shaiva sculptures at a Shakta temple.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=652}}\n\nAccording to Reitz, the two fragments of a [[Durga]] sculpture discovered in the Chand Baori compound may have belonged to the main idol of the original temple. This sculpture appears to have been a {{convert|1.5|m|adj=on}} high statue of Durga in her ''Mahishasura-mardini'' (killer of the [[Mahishasura|buffalo demon]]) form. The bigger fragment shows the lower part of Durga's torso with her left leg, her lion [[vahana]], a male attendant, and a beheaded buffalo. The smaller fragment shows six right arms of the multi-armed Durga, with one of the arms pulling an arrow from the quiver; it also features the remains of a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] in the form of a lotus leaf, and two [[gandharva]]s (heavenly beings).{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=645}} Reitz points out that the intact sculpture would have been similar to the idol in the Pipala-devi Temple at [[Osian, Jodhpur|Osian]], which like the Harshat Mata temple, has been dated to 800\u2013825 CE by Meister.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|pp=645-646}}\n\n=== Builder ===\n\nThe builder of the original temple is unknown.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hamendar Bhisham Pal |title=The Temples of Rajasthan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybPqAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=Prakash |page=83 |quote=The construction of ancient temple of Harshatmata situated at a small village of Abaneri or Abhanagari, four miles from Bandikui Railway Station in Jaipur district has been ascribed to the 9th century.

He notes that [[Shakambhari]] \u2013 the [[tutelary deity]] of the Chahamanas \u2013 has been identified as a form of Durga, and the Bhagavati Barah [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper-plate inscription]] states that Bhagavati (another form of the goddess) was one of the tutelary deities of Nagabhata II.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|pp=652-653}} Atherton notes that the lack of adequate historical information prevents attribution of the temple to a particular ruler with certainty,{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}} but it is more likely that the Gurjara-Pratiharas \u2013 not the Chahamanas \u2013 were the patrons of the temple, with Nagabhata II being the best candidate.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nIn the 20th century, the sanctum had a Durga idol, which was stolen.

The temple complex is built on two broad stepped terraces (''jagati''), which originally included a [[parikrama|circumambulatory]] path, and are now partially ruined. The boundary of the lower terrace has a relatively plain set of foundation and [[base molding]]s (''vedibandha''), which have decorative patterns at the top. The ruins of two small shrines flank the entrance stairway. The upper terrace is far more decorated, but is largely destroyed; the only image that remains intact is of [[Narasimha]] flanked by warriors.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}}\n\nThe four subsidiary shrines may have been located on the upper terrace.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=645}} Frank Reitz, who believes that the main idol of the temple was always that of Durga, theorizes that the four subsidiary shrines were located to Surya (north-west corner), Ganesha (north-east corner), Karttikeya (south-east corner), and Lakshmi-Narayana or Uma-Maheshvara (south-west). Reitz's theory is based on an analysis of other contemporary and near-contemporary temples, as well as a study of various fragments found at the Chand Baori compound or housed at various museums.{{sfn|Falk Reitz|1993|p=648}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nHar\u1e63at Mata ka Mandir 2019 (13).jpg | Entrance stairs\nAbhaneri-Harshat Mata-Tempel-16-2018-gje.jpg | Main dome around the ''[[garbhagriha]]''\n\u0906\u092d\u093e\u0928\u0947\u0930\u0940 04.JPG | Harshat Mata's image in the sanctum\nHar\u1e63at Mata ka Mandir 2019 (11).jpg | Stone carvings on the upper terrace\n</gallery>\n\nThe main shrine is erected on a platform (''mancha'') located at the top of the two terraces. The platform is bounded by a circumambulatory path (''sandhara''), which was connected to a pillared porch (''gudhamandapa''). The original path and the porch have been destroyed, and have been rebuilt haphazardly.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=202}} The platform features figures engaged in amorous activities,{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=203}} which seem to be depictions of encounters between a royal figure and his consorts.{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=201}} According to art historian Cynthia Packert Atherton (1995), these are an idealized portrayal of the temple's royal patron, and are symbolic of Vishnu's reign on earth, thus reinforcing the idea of [[divine kingship]].{{sfn|Cynthia Packert Atherton|1995|p=212}}\n\nSeveral sculptural fragments found at the compound of the adjoining [[Chand Baori]] stepwell; the format and dimensions of these fragments suggest that they were once attached to the base moldings on the circumambulatory path.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a \"red\" identifier while retaining the Braves \"Indian Head\" logo.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \"noble savage\" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).

He had a number of influential video parts with Powell during the 1980s, a series of signature models, and roles in several Hollywood movies.

In the 1980s, Welinder and Mullen were competitors in freestyle [[skateboarding]], and Welinder regularly placed 2nd to Mullen's 1st. At a 1983 contest, Mullen (under psychological duress from his father forcing him to soon quit skateboarding, as well as being sick) skated uncharacteristically off and Welinder won.\n\nMullen retired for a year and was soon allowed to return to the scene, overshadowing Welinder and all the other freestylers, but Welinder consistently was the second most popular freestyler in skateboarding. In addition to his freestyle board model, Welinder also had a street model (which was unusual for a freestyler) and this board - with its well-regarded graphic and long nose - was one of the most popular among skateboarders for a few years. This was followed by an unusual, hybrid model of his in 1990 called the \"Nordic Sperm\", which also sold relatively well.\n\nWelinder was featured prominently in the [[Bones Brigade]] videos \"The Bones Brigade Video Show\", \"Future Primitive\", and \"Ban This\". In January, 1992, he left [[Powell Peralta]] to start a new skateboard company, [[Birdhouse Projects]], with fellow team member [[Tony Hawk]] as his partner and main attraction. As Tony Hawk began to achieve superstardom when skateboarding's popularity increased in the mid-1990s, Welinder became a very wealthy man.\n\nIn 2012, Welinder teamed up with longtime skateboard advocate Peter Whitley to author ''Mastering Skateboarding'', which features high-quality full-color photo sequences of all the biggest tricks while spanning techniques and equipment for riders of every level.<ref>{{cite book|last=Welinder|first=Per|title=Mastering Skateboarding|year=2012|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-9599-0|pages=272}}</ref>\n\n== Appearances in 1980s culture ==\nPer Welinder was a stunt double for some of [[Michael J.

Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Park<!-- Not Kim, as Korean women don't follow their husbands' names after marriage. --> Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten light sources]].

Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had sex in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Park<!-- Not Kim, as Korean women don't follow their husbands' names after marriage. --> Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten light sources]].
