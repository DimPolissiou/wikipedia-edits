It was the second film produced by Pixar. Directed by [[John Lasseter]] and co-directed and written by [[Andrew Stanton]], the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, only to recruit a group of insects that turn out to be an inept circus troupe. The film stars the voices of [[Dave Foley]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]] among others.\n\nThe film is inspired by [[Aesop]]'s fable ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | title = A Bug's Life (1998) | last = Maslin | first = Janet | date = November 25, 1998 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = June 16, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302204943/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | archivedate = March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Bug's Life \u2013 The Tale | url = https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | website = pixar.com | publisher = Pixar | accessdate = July 24, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205053510/https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | archivedate = December 5, 2010}}</ref> Production began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Ranft. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. [[Randy Newman]] composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between [[Steve Jobs]] and Lasseter of Pixar and [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] co-founder [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] due to the parallel production of his similar film ''[[Antz]]'', which was released the same year.\n\nThe film was released on November 20, 1998, and grossed $363&nbsp;million in receipts, receiving positive reviews from critics. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released to [[DVD]], and has been released multiple times on home video.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nAnt Island is a colony of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, they are forced to give food to a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.\n\nAt the \"bug city\", which is a heap of trash under a trailer, Flik mistakes a troupe of Circus Bugs (who were recently dismissed by their greedy ringmaster, P.T. Flea) for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are attacked by a bird; while fleeing, they save Dot, Atta's younger sister, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's request, they continue the ruse of being \"warriors\", so the troupe can continue to enjoy the hospitality of the ants. Hearing that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to create a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper tells his gang how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually rebel against them.\n\nThe ants finish constructing the fake bird, but during a celebration, P.T. Flea arrives, searching for his troupe, and inadvertently reveals their secret. Outraged by Flik's deception, the ants exile him, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering to the grasshoppers. However, when Hopper returns to discover the mediocre offering, he takes over the island, and demands the ants' winter food supply, planning to assassinate the Queen afterwards. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island.\n\nAfter the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, who also mistakes it for a real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik in retaliation, saying that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island using P.T. Flea's circus cannon, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon, and abducts Flik. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering in panic that it is real, and is captured and devoured by its chicks.\n\nWith their enemies gone, Flik has improved his inventions along with the quality of life for Ant Island, he and Atta become a couple, and they give Hopper's younger brother Molt, and a few ants to P.T. Flea as new members of his troupe. Atta and Dot respectively become the new queen and princess. The ants congratulate Flik as a hero, and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{anchor|Cast and characters|Cast}}\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Flik, an inventive, but mostly accident-prone, ant.\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Hopper, the ruthless leader of the grasshopper gang.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Princess Atta, the soon-to-be queen of the colony.\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Dot, Princess Atta's younger sister and initially Flik's only friend in the ant colony.\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] as the Queen, the leader of the ant colony.\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Molt, Hopper's dimwitted younger brother.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Slim, a walking stick and Francis and Heimlich's friend.\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Heimlich, a plump, German-accented caterpillar who longs to be a butterfly.\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Francis, a short-tempered male ladybug who is constantly mistaken for a female.\n* [[Jonathan Harris]] as Manny, a praying mantis and magician in P.T.

Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable ''The Ant and the Grasshopper''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> [[Walt Disney]] had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]]''. In addition, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled ''Army Ants'', that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.<ref name=\"bw\">{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | last1 = Burrows | first1 = Peter | title = ''Antz'' vs. ''Bugs'' | work = Business Week | date = November 23, 1998 | accessdate = March 7, 2017 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19991128083348/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | archivedate = November 28, 1999 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAs Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> During an early test screening for ''[[Toy Story]]'' in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title ''Bugs''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 159</ref> Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of ''Toy Story'' was in process.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/> In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">Price, p. 160</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn ''The Ant and the Grasshopper'', a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/><ref name=\"inspiration\">Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, ''A Bugs Life'', The inspiration</ref> After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars \u2013 that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/> He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act.<ref name=commentary>''A Bugs Life'', DVD Commentary</ref> Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nStanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the [[red ant]], and changed him into the character Flik.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">Price, p. 161</ref> The characters \"Tuck and Roll\" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade.<ref name=\"inspiration\"/> Lasseter had come to envision the film as an [[epic film|epic]] in the tradition of [[David Lean]]'s 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.<ref name=\"commentary\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe voice cast was heavy with television [[sitcom]] stars of the time: Flik was voiced by [[Dave Foley]] (from ''[[NewsRadio]]''), Princess Atta was voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] (from ''[[Seinfeld]]''), Molt was voiced by [[Richard Kind]] (from ''[[Spin City]]''), Slim was voiced by [[David Hyde Pierce]] (from ''[[Frasier]]'') and Dim was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] (from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''). [[Joe Ranft]], member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/>\n\nThe casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was [[Robert De Niro]], who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> [[Kevin Spacey]] met John Lasseter at the [[68th Academy Awards|1995 Academy Awards]] and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.<ref name=commentary/>\n\n''A Bug's Life'' was the final film appearance of actor [[Roddy McDowall]], who played Mr. Soil, before dying shortly before the film's theatrical release.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\">{{cite web | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-25/features/9811250037_1_ant-colonies-bug-s-life-ant-hero | title = 'A Bug's Life | first = Michael | last = Wilmington | date = November 25, 1998 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | quote = The players\u2014whose colorful members include Madeline Kahn as Gypsy the moth, Michael McShane as the Hungarian pill bug brothers Tuck & Roll and, in his farewell appearance, Roddy McDowall as the grandfatherly Mr. Soil\u2014all help make \"Bug's Life\" special. | accessdate = January 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Art design and animation===\nIt was more difficult for animators during the production of ''A Bug's Life'' than that of ''Toy Story'', as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and [[Glenn McQueen]]. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's \"Flaming Wall of Death\". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was \"less likely to change\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/> Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on [[Lego]] wheels, which they dubbed as the \"Bugcam\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/><ref name=\"behind the scenes\">''A Bugs Life'', DVD Behind the Scenes</ref> Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a [[stained-glass]] ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from ''[[Microcosmos (film)|Microcosmos]]'' (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nThe transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where ''Toy Story'' focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, ''A Bug's Life'' required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\"/> Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">Price, p. 162</ref> The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\". Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same.<ref name=\"behind the scenes\"/> It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">Price, p. 163</ref>\n\nThe animators also employed [[subsurface scattering]]\u2014developed by Pixar co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] during his graduate student days at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, ''[[Geri's Game]]'' (1997), was attached alongside ''A Bug's Life'' in its theatrical release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\">Price, p. 173</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nDuring the production of ''A Bug's Life'', a public feud erupted between [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]' [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] and planned to rival Disney in animation.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/307 307] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> After DreamWorks' acquisition of [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called ''[[Antz]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">Price, p. 170</ref> By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\">Price, p. 171</ref> Both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'' center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas ''A Bug's Life'' relied chiefly on visual gags, ''Antz'' was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of ''Antz'' was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.<ref name=\"PixarTouch13\"/>\n\nIt was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/> Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on ''Toy Story'' at the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] lot's [[Technicolor]] facility in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch08\"/> When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become ''A Bug's Life'' in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">Price, p. 169</ref> Lasseter had high hopes for ''Toy Story'', and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''\" for computer animation companies, he told various friends.<ref name=\"bw\"/> \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/>\n\nWhen the trades indicated production on ''Antz'', Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed ''Antz'' came from a 1991 story pitch by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.<ref name=\"bw\"/> Another source gives [[Nina Jacobson]], one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the ''Antz'' pitch.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/308 308] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled ''Bugs'' to open the same week as ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/>\n\nKatzenberg moved the opening of ''Antz'' from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"ap\">{{cite news | url = http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm | title = Of Ants, Bugs, and Rug Rats: The Story of Dueling Bug Movies | agency = Associated Press | date = October 2, 1998 | access-date = March 4, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172821/http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm | archive-date = March 3, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref> David Price writes in his 2008 book ''The Pixar Touch'' that a rumor, \"never confirmed\", was that Katzenberg had given PDI \"rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have ''Antz'' ready first, despite Pixar's head start\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of ''Antz'' if Jobs and Disney would move ''A Bug's Life'' so that it did not compete with ''The Prince of Egypt''. Jobs believed it \"a blatant [[Extortion|extortion attempt]]\" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for ''Toy Story'', as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> \"I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you're allowing them to use you to screw me,\" Katzenberg said.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on ''A Bug's Life'' without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put ''Antz'' on hold.<ref name=\"bw\"/> Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\">Price, p. 172</ref>\n\nAs the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed ''Antz'' as a \"schlock version\" of ''A Bug's Life''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\"/> Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen ''Antz'', told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch13\">Price, p. 174</ref> Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Despite the successful box office performance of both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'', tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for ''A Bug's Life'', reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.<ref name=\"Isaacson309\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/309 309] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = A Bug's Life: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Randy Newman]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 27, 1998\n| recorded   = 1998\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score|Score]]\n| length     = 47:32\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Randy Newman]]\n| prev_title = [[Michael (1996 film)|Michael]]\n| prev_year  = 1996\n| next_title = [[Pleasantville (soundtrack)|Pleasantville]]\n| next_year  = 1998\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Pixar]] soundtrack\n | type       = film\n | prev_title = [[Toy Story#Soundtrack|Toy Story]]\n | prev_year  = 1995\n | title      = A Bug's Life\n | year       = 1998\n | next_title = [[Toy Story 2 (soundtrack)|Toy Story 2]]\n | next_year  = 1999\n}}\n}}\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by [[Randy Newman]].

It was the second film produced by Pixar. Directed by [[John Lasseter]] and co-directed and written by [[Andrew Stanton]], the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, only to recruit a group of insects that turn out to be an inept circus troupe. The film stars the voices of [[Dave Foley]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]] among others.\n\nThe film is inspired by [[Aesop]]'s fable ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | title = A Bug's Life (1998) | last = Maslin | first = Janet | date = November 25, 1998 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = June 16, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302204943/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | archivedate = March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Bug's Life \u2013 The Tale | url = https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | website = pixar.com | publisher = Pixar | accessdate = July 24, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205053510/https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | archivedate = December 5, 2010}}</ref> Production began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Ranft. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. [[Randy Newman]] composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between [[Steve Jobs]] and Lasseter of Pixar and [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] co-founder [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] due to the parallel production of his similar film ''[[Antz]]'', which was released the same year.\n\nThe film was released on November 20, 1998, and grossed $363&nbsp;million in receipts, receiving positive reviews from critics. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released to [[DVD]], and has been released multiple times on home video.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nAnt Island is a colony of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, they are forced to give food to a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.\n\nAt the \"bug city\", which is a heap of trash under a trailer, Flik mistakes a troupe of Circus Bugs (who were recently dismissed by their greedy ringmaster, P.T. Flea) for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are attacked by a bird; while fleeing, they save Dot, Atta's younger sister, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's request, they continue the ruse of being \"warriors\", so the troupe can continue to enjoy the hospitality of the ants. Hearing that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to create a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper tells his gang how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually rebel against them.\n\nThe ants finish constructing the fake bird, but during a celebration, P.T. Flea arrives, searching for his troupe, and inadvertently reveals their secret. Outraged by Flik's deception, the ants exile him, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering to the grasshoppers. However, when Hopper returns to discover the mediocre offering, he takes over the island, and demands the ants' winter food supply, planning to assassinate the Queen afterwards. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island.\n\nAfter the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, who also mistakes it for a real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik in retaliation, saying that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island using P.T. Flea's circus cannon, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon, and abducts Flik. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering in panic that it is real, and is captured and devoured by its chicks.\n\nWith their enemies gone, Flik has improved his inventions along with the quality of life for Ant Island, he and Atta become a couple, and they give Hopper's younger brother Molt, and a few ants to P.T. Flea as new members of his troupe. Atta and Dot respectively become the new queen and princess. The ants congratulate Flik as a hero, and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{anchor|Cast and characters|Cast}}\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Flik, an inventive, but mostly accident-prone, ant.\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Hopper, the ruthless leader of the grasshopper gang.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Princess Atta, the soon-to-be queen of the colony.\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Dot, Princess Atta's younger sister and initially Flik's only friend in the ant colony.\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] as the Queen, the leader of the ant colony.\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Molt, Hopper's dimwitted younger brother.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Slim, a walking stick and Francis and Heimlich's friend.\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Heimlich, a plump, German-accented caterpillar who longs to be a butterfly.\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Francis, a short-tempered male ladybug who is constantly mistaken for a female.\n* [[Jonathan Harris]] as Manny, a praying mantis and magician in P.T.

Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable ''The Ant and the Grasshopper''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> [[Walt Disney]] had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]]''. In addition, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled ''Army Ants'', that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.<ref name=\"bw\">{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | last1 = Burrows | first1 = Peter | title = ''Antz'' vs. ''Bugs'' | work = Business Week | date = November 23, 1998 | accessdate = March 7, 2017 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19991128083348/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | archivedate = November 28, 1999 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAs Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> During an early test screening for ''[[Toy Story]]'' in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title ''Bugs''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 159</ref> Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of ''Toy Story'' was in process.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/> In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">Price, p. 160</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn ''The Ant and the Grasshopper'', a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/><ref name=\"inspiration\">Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, ''A Bugs Life'', The inspiration</ref> After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars \u2013 that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/> He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act.<ref name=commentary>''A Bugs Life'', DVD Commentary</ref> Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nStanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the [[red ant]], and changed him into the character Flik.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">Price, p. 161</ref> The characters \"Tuck and Roll\" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade.<ref name=\"inspiration\"/> Lasseter had come to envision the film as an [[epic film|epic]] in the tradition of [[David Lean]]'s 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.<ref name=\"commentary\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe voice cast was heavy with television [[sitcom]] stars of the time: Flik was voiced by [[Dave Foley]] (from ''[[NewsRadio]]''), Princess Atta was voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] (from ''[[Seinfeld]]''), Molt was voiced by [[Richard Kind]] (from ''[[Spin City]]''), Slim was voiced by [[David Hyde Pierce]] (from ''[[Frasier]]'') and Dim was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] (from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''). [[Joe Ranft]], member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/>\n\nThe casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was [[Robert De Niro]], who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> [[Kevin Spacey]] met John Lasseter at the [[68th Academy Awards|1995 Academy Awards]] and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper.

Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and [[Glenn McQueen]]. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's \"Flaming Wall of Death\". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was \"less likely to change\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/> Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on [[Lego]] wheels, which they dubbed as the \"Bugcam\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/><ref name=\"behind the scenes\">''A Bugs Life'', DVD Behind the Scenes</ref> Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a [[stained-glass]] ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from ''[[Microcosmos (film)|Microcosmos]]'' (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nThe transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where ''Toy Story'' focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, ''A Bug's Life'' required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\"/> Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">Price, p. 162</ref> The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\". Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same.<ref name=\"behind the scenes\"/> It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">Price, p. 163</ref>\n\nThe animators also employed [[subsurface scattering]]\u2014developed by Pixar co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] during his graduate student days at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, ''[[Geri's Game]]'' (1997), was attached alongside ''A Bug's Life'' in its theatrical release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\">Price, p. 173</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nDuring the production of ''A Bug's Life'', a public feud erupted between [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]' [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] and planned to rival Disney in animation.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/307 307] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> After DreamWorks' acquisition of [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called ''[[Antz]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">Price, p. 170</ref> By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\">Price, p. 171</ref> Both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'' center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas ''A Bug's Life'' relied chiefly on visual gags, ''Antz'' was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of ''Antz'' was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.<ref name=\"PixarTouch13\"/>\n\nIt was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/> Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on ''Toy Story'' at the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] lot's [[Technicolor]] facility in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch08\"/> When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become ''A Bug's Life'' in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">Price, p. 169</ref> Lasseter had high hopes for ''Toy Story'', and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''\" for computer animation companies, he told various friends.<ref name=\"bw\"/> \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/>\n\nWhen the trades indicated production on ''Antz'', Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed ''Antz'' came from a 1991 story pitch by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.<ref name=\"bw\"/> Another source gives [[Nina Jacobson]], one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the ''Antz'' pitch.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/308 308] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled ''Bugs'' to open the same week as ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/>\n\nKatzenberg moved the opening of ''Antz'' from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"ap\">{{cite news | url = http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm | title = Of Ants, Bugs, and Rug Rats: The Story of Dueling Bug Movies | agency = Associated Press | date = October 2, 1998 | access-date = March 4, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172821/http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm | archive-date = March 3, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref> David Price writes in his 2008 book ''The Pixar Touch'' that a rumor, \"never confirmed\", was that Katzenberg had given PDI \"rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have ''Antz'' ready first, despite Pixar's head start\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of ''Antz'' if Jobs and Disney would move ''A Bug's Life'' so that it did not compete with ''The Prince of Egypt''. Jobs believed it \"a blatant [[Extortion|extortion attempt]]\" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for ''Toy Story'', as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> \"I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you're allowing them to use you to screw me,\" Katzenberg said.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on ''A Bug's Life'' without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put ''Antz'' on hold.<ref name=\"bw\"/> Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\">Price, p. 172</ref>\n\nAs the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed ''Antz'' as a \"schlock version\" of ''A Bug's Life''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\"/> Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen ''Antz'', told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch13\">Price, p. 174</ref> Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Despite the successful box office performance of both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'', tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for ''A Bug's Life'', reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.<ref name=\"Isaacson309\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/309 309] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = A Bug's Life: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Randy Newman]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 27, 1998\n| recorded   = 1998\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score|Score]]\n| length     = 47:32\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Randy Newman]]\n| prev_title = [[Michael (1996 film)|Michael]]\n| prev_year  = 1996\n| next_title = [[Pleasantville (soundtrack)|Pleasantville]]\n| next_year  = 1998\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Pixar]] soundtrack\n | type       = film\n | prev_title = [[Toy Story#Soundtrack|Toy Story]]\n | prev_year  = 1995\n | title      = A Bug's Life\n | year       = 1998\n | next_title = [[Toy Story 2 (soundtrack)|Toy Story 2]]\n | next_year  = 1999\n}}\n}}\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by [[Randy Newman]].

\"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus

[[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe

SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

This includes self-flattery, perfectionism, and arrogance.<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201804/understanding-the-mind-narcissist</ref> The term originated from [[Greek mythology]], where the young [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] fell in love with his own image reflected in a pool of water. Narcissism is a  concept in [[psychoanalytic theory]], which was popularly introduced in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s essay ''[[On Narcissism]]'' (1914). The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has listed the classification [[narcissistic personality disorder]] in its ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) since 1968, drawing on the historical concept of [[megalomania]].\n\nNarcissism is also considered a social or cultural problem.\nIt is a factor in [[trait theory]] used in various [[self-report inventory|self-report inventories]] of personality such as the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]]. It is one of the three [[dark triad]]ic personality traits (the others being [[psychopathy]] and [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellianism]]). Except in the sense of [[primary narcissism]] or [[Healthy narcissism|healthy self-love]], narcissism is usually considered a problem in a person's or group's relationships with self and others.\n\nNarcissism is not the same as [[egocentrism]] or [[egoism]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of narcissism}}\n[[File:Sisyphus Pushing His Stone up a Mountain (486x640).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The myth of [[Sisyphus]] tells about a man punished for his  [[hubris]]tic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself.

The grandiose variant, which is usually measured using the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory|NPI]] is strongly linked to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] conceptualization and is the variant associated with [[narcissistic personality disorder|NPD]], a Cluster B personality disorder which reflect traits related to self-importance, entitlement, aggression, and dominance. Vulnerable narcissism reflects a defensive and fragile grandiosity, which functions mainly as cover for feelings of inadequacy. Vulnerable narcissism characterized by hypersensitivity, defensiveness, and withdrawal and is strongly associated with [[borderline personality disorder|BPD]], which is characterized by fear of abandonment, interpersonal and affective instability, impulsivity, chronic feelings of emptiness, suicidal ideation, and self-mutilation. Pathological narcissism is when both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are concurrent, which is linked to poor self-esteem, lack of empathy, feelings of shame, interpersonal distress, aggression, and significant impairments in personality functioning across both clinical and non-clinical samples. Pathological narcissism, as measured by the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), is embedded within the personality disorders organized at the borderline level, which include antisocial, borderline, narcissistic personality disorders. PNI scales exhibited significant associations with parasuicidal behavior, suicide attempts, homicidal ideation, and several aspects of psychotherapy utilization.<ref name=\"Pincus et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Pincus |first1=AL |last2=Ansell |first2=EB |last3=Pimentel |first3=CA |last4=Cain |first4=NM |last5=Wright |first5=AGC |last6=Levy |first6=KN |title=Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory. |journal=Psychological Assessment |date=September  2009 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=365-379 |doi=10.1037/a0016530 |url=http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/pincus2009.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Seven deadly sins of narcissism ===\nPsychiatrists Hotchkiss and [[James F.

Masterson|Masterson, James F.]] Why Is It Always About You?: The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism (2003)</ref>\n# [[Shame]]lessness: Narcissists are often proudly and openly shameless; they are not bound emotionally by the needs and wishes of others. Narcissists hate criticism, and consider it \"toxic\"{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}, as criticism implies they are not perfect and need to change. Narcissists prefer guilt over shame, as guilt allows them to dissociate their actions from themselves - it's only their actions that are wrong, while their intention is good.\n# [[Magical thinking]]: Narcissists see themselves as perfect, using [[Cognitive distortion|distortion]] and illusion known as [[magical thinking]]. They also use [[psychological projection|projection]] to \"dump\" shame onto others.\n# [[Hubris|Arrogance]]: A narcissist who is feeling deflated may \"reinflate\" their sense of self-importance by diminishing, debasing, or degrading somebody else.\n# [[Envy]]: A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using contempt to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the other person or their achievements.\n# [[Entitlement]]: Narcissists hold unreasonable expectations of particularly favorable treatment and automatic compliance because they consider themselves special. Failure to comply is considered an attack on their superiority, and the perpetrator is considered an \"awkward\" or \"difficult\" person. Defiance of their will is a narcissistic injury that can trigger [[narcissistic rage]].\n# [[wikt:exploit|Exploitation]]: Can take many forms but always involves the exploitation of others without regard for their feelings or interests. Often the other person is in a subservient position where resistance would be difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the subservience is not so much real as assumed. This exploitation may result in [[Casual dating|many brief, short-lived relationships]].\n# [[Personal boundaries|Bad boundaries]]: Narcissists do not recognize that they have boundaries and that others are separate and are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist to meet their needs or may as well not exist at all. Those who provide [[narcissistic supply]] to the narcissist are treated as if they are part of the narcissist and are expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist, there is no boundary between self and other.\n\n== Clinical and research aspects ==\n\n=== Narcissistic personality disorder ===\n{{Main|Narcissistic personality disorder}}\nNarcissistic personality disorder affects an estimated 1% of the general population.<ref name=\"millon1\">{{Cite book\n| first=Theodore\n| last= Millon\n| year= 1996\n| title=Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV-TM and Beyond\n| edition=\n| publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n| location=New York\n| page= 393\n| isbn= 978-0-471-01186-6 }}</ref><ref name=\"AMN\">{{cite web | title = Narcissistic Personality Disorder | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work = Personality Disorders \u2013 Narcissistic Personality Disorder | url=http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/ | year = 2006 | accessdate=2007-02-14 | author1 = Leonard C.

First, how do we differentiate between the concepts of narcissism and egoism? Well, narcissism, I believe, is the libidinal complement to egoism. When we speak of egoism, we have in view only the individual's advantage; when we talk of narcissism we are also taking his libidinal satisfaction into account. As practical motives the two can be traced separately for quite a distance. It is possible to be absolutely egoistic and yet maintain powerful object-cathexes, in so far as libidinal satisfaction in relation to the object forms part of the ego's needs. In that case, egoism will see to it that striving for the object involves no damage to the ego. It is possible to be egoistic and at the same time to be excessively narcissistic\u2014that is to say, to have very little need for an object, whether, once more, for the purpose of direct sexual satisfaction, or in connection with the higher aspirations, derived from sexual need, which we are occasionally in the habit of contrasting with 'sensuality' under the name of 'love'. In all these connections egoism is what is self-evident and constant, while narcissism is the variable element. The opposite to egoism, altruism, does not, as a concept, coincide with libidinal object-cathexis, but is distinguished from it by the absence of longings for sexual satisfaction. When someone is completely in love, however, altruism converges with libidinal object-cathexis. As a rule the sexual object attracts a portion of the ego's narcissism to itself, and this becomes noticeable as what is known as the 'sexual overvaluation' of the object. If in addition there is an altruistic transposition of egoism on to the sexual object, the object becomes supremely powerful; it has, as it were, absorbed the ego.\" (Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' (1919), pp. 417\u201318)}}\n\nWhere the egoist can give up love in narcissism, the altruist can give up on competition, or \"the will,\" in echoism. The individual first has a non-ambivalent relations of ''fusion'' with authority or love figures, which are characterized by the egoistic or altruistic drives. Second, the individual can move to ''defusion'' from authority or love figures which leads to repetitions of ambivalent, narcissistic or echoistic relations. In the third movement the individual becomes the dead or absent parental figure that never returned love to the echoist, or the perfect, grandiose parental figure in narcissism.<ref name=\"Libido 2015\"/> While egoism and narcissism concern dynamics of power and inferiority/superiority, Pederson argues that altruism and echoism concern dynamics of belonging and inclusion/exclusion. Pederson has two types of echoists: the \"subject altruist\" and the \"object altruist\", with the former being concerned with the belonging of others and loving them, and the latter being concerned with their own belonging and being loved. The subject altruist is self-effacing, a people pleaser, and sacrifices her desire to help others who are outsiders become insiders, or to be the submissive helper of an insider. The object altruist is gregarious, a people person, and wants to be interesting which is based on wanting to fit in and not be an outsider or wanting to be unique as an insider. Both types of echoists show issues with being submissive, having problems saying no, and avoiding conflict.<ref name=\"Libido 2015\"/>\n\n==== In relation to the pathological condition ====\nFreud's idea of narcissism described a pathology which manifests itself in the inability to love others, a lack of empathy, emptiness, boredom, and an unremitting need to search for power, while making the person unavailable to others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Analysis of the Self. A systematic approach to the psychoanalytic treatment of narcissistic personality disorders|last=Kohut|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHealthy narcissism has to do with a strong feeling of \"own love\" protecting the human being against illness. Eventually, however, the individual must love the other, \"the object love to not become ill\". The individual becomes ill as a result of the frustration created when he is unable to love the object.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psywilly.be/index.php?page=lezingen|title=Psywilly.be, psychoanalyticus Willy Depecker|first=Stijn|last=Blomme|website=www.psywilly.be|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2018}} In pathological narcissism such as the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the person's libido has been withdrawn from objects in the world and produces [[megalomania]]. The clinical theorists [[Kernberg]], [[Kohut]] and [[Theodore Millon]] all saw pathological narcissism as a possible outcome in response to unempathic and inconsistent early childhood interactions. They suggested that narcissists try to compensate in adult relationships.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/S15327965PLI1204_1 |author=Morf, Caroline C.|author2=Rhodewalt, Frederick |author2link= Frederick Rhodewalt|title=Unraveling the Paradoxes of Narcissism: A Dynamic Self-Regulatory Processing Model |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=177\u201396 |year=2001 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1236233}}</ref> The pathological condition of narcissism is, as Freud suggested, a magnified, extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism.\n\nHealthy narcissism has been suggested to be correlated with good psychological health. [[Self-esteem]] works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health. Therefore, because of their elevated self-esteem, deriving from self-perceptions of competence and likability, high narcissists are relatively free of worry and gloom.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.400 |author=Sedikides, C.|author2=Rudich, E.A.|author3=Gregg, A.P.|author4=Kumashiro, Ml|author5=Rusbult, C. |title=Are Normal Narcissists Psychologically Healthy?: self-esteem matters |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |pages=400\u201316 |year=2004 |issue=3 |pmid=15382988|hdl=1871/17274|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1955465/Sedikides%20Journal%20of%20Personality%20and%20Social%20Psychology%2087(3)%202004%20u.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOther researchers have suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as 'good' or 'bad', but that it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as feeling good about oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.<ref name = caf>{{cite book|last1= Campbell|first1 = W.

Although several versions of the NPI have been proposed in the literature, a forty-item forced-choice version (Raskin & Terry, 1988) is the one most commonly employed in current research. Another shorter version, a sixteen-item version NPI-16 (Ames, Rose & Anderson, 2013) is also present. The NPI is based on the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-III clinical criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), although it was designed to measure these features in the general population. Thus, the NPI is often said to measure \"normal\" or \"subclinical\" (borderline) narcissism (i.e., in people who score very high on the NPI do not necessarily meet criteria for diagnosis with NPD).\n\n==== Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory ====\n{{Main|Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory}}\nThe Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) is a widely used diagnostic test developed by [[Theodore Millon]]. The MCMI includes a scale for Narcissism. The NPI and MCMI have been found to be well correlated, ''r''(146)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.55, ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4806_13 |author=Auerbach JS |title=Validation of two scales for narcissistic personality disorder |journal=J Pers Assess |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=649\u201353 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6520692 }}</ref> Whereas the MCMI measures narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), the NPI measures narcissism as it occurs in the general population.

It comes in both intra-psychic, such as blaming a situation rather than self for failure, and interpersonal forms, such as using a relationship to serve one's own self. Some differences in self-regulation between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder, Sedikides & Elliot (2000)<ref name=\"cre\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jrpe.2000.2282 |author=Campbell, W.K.|author2=Reeder G.D.|author3=Sedikides, C.|author4=Elliot, A.J. |title=Narcissism and Comparative Self-Enhancement Strategies |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=34 |pages=329\u201347 |year=2000 |issue=3 |citeseerx=10.1.1.457.9632}}</ref> who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative [[self-enhancement]] strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy similarly; however, narcissists were found to be more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.\n\nSorokowski et al. (2015) showed that narcissism is related to the frequency of posting [[selfie]]-type pictures on [[social media]].

The study subjects were 175 volunteer twin pairs (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a questionnaire that assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the [[heritability]] of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of [[genetics|genetic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance]] of this trait in the [[identical twins]] was significantly influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have heritability coefficients of greater than 0.5: [[Callous and unemotional traits|callousness]], identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.\n\n=== Stigmatising attitude towards psychiatric illness ===\nArikan found that a [[Social stigma|stigmatising]] attitude to [[psychiatric]] patients is associated with narcissistic personality traits.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42  |issue=4 |pages=248\u201350 |year=2005 |pmid=16618057}}</ref>\n\n=== In evolutionary psychology ===\nThe concept of narcissism is used in [[evolutionary psychology]] in relation to the mechanisms of [[assortative mating]], or the non-random choice of a partner for purposes of procreation. Evidence for assortative mating among humans is well established; humans mate assortatively regarding age, IQ, height, weight, nationality, educational and occupational level, physical and personality characteristics, and family relatedness.<ref>Buston & Emlen 2003, Buss 1989, Epstein & Guttman 1984, Garrison et al. 1968, Ho 1986, Jaffe & Chacon 1995, Spuhler 1968, Rushton 1989</ref> In the \"self seeking like\" hypothesis, individuals unconsciously look for a \"mirror image\" of themselves in others, seeking criteria of beauty or reproductive fitness in the context of self-reference. Alvarez et al. found that facial resemblance between couples was a strong driving force among the mechanisms of assortative mating: human couples resemble each other significantly more than would be expected from random pair formation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Alvarez, L. |title=Narcissism guides mate selection: Humans mate assortatively, as revealed by facial resemblance, following an algorithm of 'self seeking like' |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=2 |pages=177\u201394 |year=2005 |url=http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618224549/http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |archivedate=June 18, 2006 }}</ref> Since facial characteristics are known to be inherited, the \"self seeking like\" mechanism may enhance reproduction between genetically similar mates, favoring the stabilization of genes supporting social behavior, with no kin relationship among them.\n\n== Narcissistic supply ==\n{{Main|Narcissistic supply}}\nNarcissistic supply is a concept introduced into [[Psychoanalysis#Theories|psychoanalytic theory]] by [[Otto Fenichel]] in 1938, to describe a type of [[admiration]], [[Social support|interpersonal support]] or sustenance drawn by an individual from his or her environment and essential to their [[self-esteem]].<ref name=fenichel>{{cite journal|last=Fenichel|first = Otto|date = 1938|title = The Drive to Amass Wealth|url = http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fenichel-The-Drive-to-Amass-Wealth.pdf|journal = They Psychoanalytic Quarterly|volume = 7 |issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/21674086.1938.11925342|pages= 69\u201395}}</ref> The term is typically used in a negative sense, describing a pathological or excessive need for attention or admiration in [[codependents]] and the orally fixated, that does not take into account the feelings, opinions or preferences of other people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/malignant-self-love/narcissists-narcissistic-supply-and-sources-of-supply|title=StackPath|website=www.healthyplace.com|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n== Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury ==\n{{Main|Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury}}\nNarcissistic rage is a reaction to narcissistic injury, which is a perceived threat to a narcissist's [[self-esteem]] or self-worth. ''Narcissistic injury'' and ''narcissistic scar'' are terms used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the 1920s. ''Narcissistic wound'' and ''narcissistic blow'' are other, almost interchangeable, terms.<ref>[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 182</ref>\n\nThe term ''narcissistic rage'' was coined by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1972. Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum from aloofness, to expressions of mild irritation or annoyance, to serious outbursts, including violent attacks.<ref name=\"isbn1-58562-204-4\"/>\n\nNarcissistic rage reactions are not limited to [[personality disorders]].

The Emerging Self: A Developmental Self & Object Relations Approach to the Treatment of the Closet Narcissistic Disorder of the Self, 1993</ref> Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects in the quality of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in [[DSM-IV]] and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist is more likely to be described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the [[Borderline Personality Disorder|borderline]] in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Millon's variations ===\n\nIn 1996 [[Theodore Millon]] identified four variations of narcissist.<ref name=\"millon1\" />  Any individual narcissist may exhibit none or one of the following:\n* unprincipled narcissist: including [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features. A [[charlatan]]\u2014is a fraudulent, [[wikt:exploit|exploitative]], [[Amorality|amoral]], disloyal, deceptive and unscrupulous individual.\n* amorous narcissist: including [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] features. The [[Don Juan]] or [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] of our times\u2014is erotic, tantalizing, enticing; clever, glib and pathological lying.\n*[[Compensation (psychology)|compensatory]] narcissist: including negativistic ([[Passive-aggressive personality disorder|passive-aggressive]]), [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]] features: admirable, exceptional, noteworthy; creating illusions of being superior.\n* [[Elitism|elitist]] narcissist: variant of pure pattern. Corresponds to [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s \"phallic narcissistic\" personality type.\n\n=== Other forms ===\n\n==== Acquired situational narcissism ====\n\nAcquired situational narcissism (ASN) is a form of narcissism that develops in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of [[celebrity]]. It was coined by [[Robert Millman|Robert B. Millman]], professor of [[psychiatry]] at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]]. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society.  Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. \"Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people.\"<ref>Simon Crompton, ''All about me'' (London 2007) p. 171</ref> In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from [[narcissistic personality disorder]], differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. \"The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable,\"<ref>Crompton, p. 171</ref> so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is [[Norma Desmond]], the main character of ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Codependency ====\n\n{{Main|Codependency}}\nCodependency is a tendency to behave in overly passive or excessively caretaking ways that negatively impact one's relationships and quality of life. Narcissists are considered to be natural magnets for the codependent. Rappoport identifies codependents of narcissists as \"co-narcissists\".<ref name=\"co\">Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissistic Parents.

Web. 26 Mar. 2011.</ref> While the classic definition of narcissism focuses on the individual, collective narcissism asserts that one can have a similar excessively high opinion of a group, and that a group can function as a narcissistic entity.<ref name=\"Zavala\" /> Collective narcissism is related to [[ethnocentrism]]; however, ethnocentrism primarily focuses on self-centeredness at an ethnic or cultural level, while collective narcissism is extended to any type of ingroup beyond just cultures and ethnicities.<ref name=\"Zavala\" /><ref name=\"Bizumic\">Bizumic, Boris, and John Duckitt. \"My Group Is Not Worthy of Me\": Narcissism and Ethnocentrism.\" Political Psychology 29.3 (2008): 437\u201353. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. EBSCO. Web. 9 Apr. 2011.</ref>\n\n==== Conversational narcissism ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nConversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist [[Charles Derber]] in his book, ''The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life''.\nDerber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention. In social situations, they tend to steer the [[conversation]] away from others and toward themselves. \"Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America,\" he wrote. \"It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life.\" What Derber describes as \"conversational narcissism\" often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged an egotist.\nDerber distinguishes the \"shift-response\" from the \"support-response,\" as in the following two hypothetical conversation fragments:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n:John: I'm feeling really starved. \n:Mary: Oh, I just ate. (shift-response)\n\n:John: I'm feeling really starved.\n:Mary: When was the last time you ate? (support-response)}}\n\n==== Cultural narcissism ====\n\nIn ''[[The Culture of Narcissism]]'', [[Christopher Lasch]] defines a narcissistic culture as one where every activity and relationship is defined by the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] need to acquire the symbols of wealth,<ref>Lasch, C, The Culture of Narcissism. 1979</ref> this becoming the only expression of rigid, yet covert, social [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It is a culture where [[liberalism]] only exists insofar as it serves a consumer society, and even [[art]], [[sex]] and [[religion]] lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life. Any real sense of community is undermined\u2014or even destroyed\u2014to be replaced by virtual equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.\n\n==== Destructive narcissism ====\n\nDestructive narcissism is the constant exhibition of numerous and intense characteristics usually associated with the [[pathological]] narcissist but having fewer characteristics than pathological narcissism.<ref>Brown, Nina W., The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern, 1998</ref>\n\n==== Malignant narcissism ====\n\n{{Main|Malignant narcissism}}\nMalignant narcissism, a term first coined in a book by [[Erich Fromm]] in 1964,<ref name=\"fromm2\">Fromm, Erich, The Heart of Man, 1964</ref> is a [[syndrome]] consisting of a cross breed of the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the [[antisocial personality disorder]], as well as [[paranoia|paranoid]] traits.  The malignant narcissist differs from one suffering from narcissistic personality disorder in that the malignant narcissist derives higher levels of psychological [[gratification]] from accomplishments over time (thus worsening the disorder).  Because the malignant narcissist becomes more involved in this psychological gratification, in the context of the right conditions, the narcissist is apt to develop the [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], the [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], and the [[schizoid]] personality disorders. The term [[malignant]] is added to the term ''narcissist'' to indicate that individuals with this disorder have a severe form of narcissistic disorder that is characterized also by features of paranoia, psychopathy (anti-social behaviors), aggression, and sadism according to Kernberg and colleagues.<ref>Lenzenweger M.F., Clarkin J.F., Caligor E., Cain N.M., & Kernberg O.F.

[https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/492228 doi:10.1159/000492228].</ref>\n\n==== Medical narcissism ====\n\nMedical narcissism is a term coined by John Banja in his book, ''Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism''.<ref name=\"banja1\">Banja, John, Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism, 2005</ref><ref name=\"banja2\">Banja, John, (as observed by Eric Rangus) [http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2005/February/February7/sandr1.htm John Banja: Interview with the clinical ethicist]</ref> Banja defines \"medical narcissism\" as the need of health professionals to preserve their [[self-esteem]] leading to the compromise of error disclosure to patients. In the book he explores the psychological, ethical and legal effects of [[medical error]]s and the extent to which a need to constantly assert their competence can cause otherwise capable, and even exceptional, professionals to fall into narcissistic traps. He claims that:\n{{blockquote|...most health professionals (in fact, most professionals of any ilk) work on cultivating a self that exudes authority, control, knowledge, competence and respectability. It's the narcissist in us all\u2014we dread appearing stupid or incompetent.}}\n\n==== In the workplace ====\n{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}\nNarcissism as a personality trait, generally assessed with the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]], is related to some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high in narcissism inventories are more likely to engage in [[counterproductive work behavior]] (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = T.

Mouth and anus are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition of prenatal existence \"primordial narcissism.\" It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. Satiation of the gastrointestinal zone, the representative of the instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose, which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to [[Christopher Lasch|Lasch]], [[Bernard Stiegler]] argues in his book, ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'', that [[consumer capitalism]] is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial narcissism, without which it is not possible to extend love to others.<ref name=\"stiegler\">[[Bernard Stiegler]], ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'' (Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2009).</ref> In other words, he is referring to the natural state of an infant as a [[human fetus|fetus]] and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they are human beings with feelings, rather than having anything to do with actual narcissism.\n\n==== {{anchor|Gender narcissism}}Sexual narcissism ====\n\nSexual narcissism has been described as an [[egocentric]] pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability and sexual entitlement.  In addition, sexual narcissism is the erotic preoccupation with oneself as a superb lover through a desire to merge sexually with a mirror image of oneself.  Sexual narcissism is an intimacy dysfunction in which sexual exploits are pursued, generally in the form of extramarital affairs, to overcompensate for low self-esteem and an inability to experience true intimacy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C. |title=Sexual narcissism and the abusive male |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=279\u201392 |year=1991 |pmid=1815094 |doi=10.1080/00926239108404352 }}</ref> This behavioral pattern is believed to be more common in men than in women and has been tied to [[domestic violence]] in men and sexual coercion in couples.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C.|author3= Gasar, S.|author4= Wilson, N.E.|author5=Murphy, Y. |title=Sexual narcissism: a validation study |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=20 |pages=24\u201334 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/00926239408403414 |pmid=8169963|issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9403-9 |author=Ryan, K.M.|author2=Weikel, K.|author3=Sprechini, G. |title=Gender differences in narcissism and courtship violence in dating couples |journal=Sex Roles |volume=58 |pages=802\u201313 |year=2008 |issue=11\u201312 }}</ref> Hurlbert argues that sex is a natural biological given and therefore cannot be deemed as an addiction.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has listed the classification [[narcissistic personality disorder]] in its ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) since 1968, drawing on the historical concept of [[megalomania]].\n\nNarcissism is also considered a social or cultural problem.\nIt is a factor in [[trait theory]] used in various [[self-report inventory|self-report inventories]] of personality such as the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]]. It is one of the three [[dark triad]]ic personality traits (the others being [[psychopathy]] and [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellianism]]). Except in the sense of [[primary narcissism]] or [[Healthy narcissism|healthy self-love]], narcissism is usually considered a problem in a person's or group's relationships with self and others.\n\nNarcissism is not the same as [[egocentrism]] or [[egoism]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of narcissism}}\n[[File:Sisyphus Pushing His Stone up a Mountain (486x640).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The myth of [[Sisyphus]] tells about a man punished for his  [[hubris]]tic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself.

Vulnerable narcissism reflects a defensive and fragile grandiosity, which functions mainly as cover for feelings of inadequacy. Vulnerable narcissism characterized by hypersensitivity, defensiveness, and withdrawal and is strongly associated with [[borderline personality disorder|BPD]], which is characterized by fear of abandonment, interpersonal and affective instability, impulsivity, chronic feelings of emptiness, suicidal ideation, and self-mutilation. Pathological narcissism is when both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are concurrent, which is linked to poor self-esteem, lack of empathy, feelings of shame, interpersonal distress, aggression, and significant impairments in personality functioning across both clinical and non-clinical samples. Pathological narcissism, as measured by the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), is embedded within the personality disorders organized at the borderline level, which include antisocial, borderline, narcissistic personality disorders.

Narcissists hate criticism, and consider it \"toxic\"{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}, as criticism implies they are not perfect and need to change. Narcissists prefer guilt over shame, as guilt allows them to dissociate their actions from themselves - it's only their actions that are wrong, while their intention is good.\n# [[Magical thinking]]: Narcissists see themselves as perfect, using [[Cognitive distortion|distortion]] and illusion known as [[magical thinking]]. They also use [[psychological projection|projection]] to \"dump\" shame onto others.\n# [[Hubris|Arrogance]]: A narcissist who is feeling deflated may \"reinflate\" their sense of self-importance by diminishing, debasing, or degrading somebody else.\n# [[Envy]]: A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using contempt to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the other person or their achievements.\n# [[Entitlement]]: Narcissists hold unreasonable expectations of particularly favorable treatment and automatic compliance because they consider themselves special. Failure to comply is considered an attack on their superiority, and the perpetrator is considered an \"awkward\" or \"difficult\" person. Defiance of their will is a narcissistic injury that can trigger [[narcissistic rage]].\n# [[wikt:exploit|Exploitation]]: Can take many forms but always involves the exploitation of others without regard for their feelings or interests. Often the other person is in a subservient position where resistance would be difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the subservience is not so much real as assumed. This exploitation may result in [[Casual dating|many brief, short-lived relationships]].\n# [[Personal boundaries|Bad boundaries]]: Narcissists do not recognize that they have boundaries and that others are separate and are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist to meet their needs or may as well not exist at all. Those who provide [[narcissistic supply]] to the narcissist are treated as if they are part of the narcissist and are expected to live up to those expectations.

First, how do we differentiate between the concepts of narcissism and egoism? Well, narcissism, I believe, is the libidinal complement to egoism. When we speak of egoism, we have in view only the individual's advantage; when we talk of narcissism we are also taking his libidinal satisfaction into account. As practical motives the two can be traced separately for quite a distance. It is possible to be absolutely egoistic and yet maintain powerful object-cathexes, in so far as libidinal satisfaction in relation to the object forms part of the ego's needs. In that case, egoism will see to it that striving for the object involves no damage to the ego. It is possible to be egoistic and at the same time to be excessively narcissistic\u2014that is to say, to have very little need for an object, whether, once more, for the purpose of direct sexual satisfaction, or in connection with the higher aspirations, derived from sexual need, which we are occasionally in the habit of contrasting with 'sensuality' under the name of 'love'. In all these connections egoism is what is self-evident and constant, while narcissism is the variable element. The opposite to egoism, altruism, does not, as a concept, coincide with libidinal object-cathexis, but is distinguished from it by the absence of longings for sexual satisfaction. When someone is completely in love, however, altruism converges with libidinal object-cathexis. As a rule the sexual object attracts a portion of the ego's narcissism to itself, and this becomes noticeable as what is known as the 'sexual overvaluation' of the object. If in addition there is an altruistic transposition of egoism on to the sexual object, the object becomes supremely powerful; it has, as it were, absorbed the ego.\" (Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' (1919), pp. 417\u201318)}}\n\nWhere the egoist can give up love in narcissism, the altruist can give up on competition, or \"the will,\" in echoism. The individual first has a non-ambivalent relations of ''fusion'' with authority or love figures, which are characterized by the egoistic or altruistic drives. Second, the individual can move to ''defusion'' from authority or love figures which leads to repetitions of ambivalent, narcissistic or echoistic relations. In the third movement the individual becomes the dead or absent parental figure that never returned love to the echoist, or the perfect, grandiose parental figure in narcissism.<ref name=\"Libido 2015\"/> While egoism and narcissism concern dynamics of power and inferiority/superiority, Pederson argues that altruism and echoism concern dynamics of belonging and inclusion/exclusion. Pederson has two types of echoists: the \"subject altruist\" and the \"object altruist\", with the former being concerned with the belonging of others and loving them, and the latter being concerned with their own belonging and being loved. The subject altruist is self-effacing, a people pleaser, and sacrifices her desire to help others who are outsiders become insiders, or to be the submissive helper of an insider. The object altruist is gregarious, a people person, and wants to be interesting which is based on wanting to fit in and not be an outsider or wanting to be unique as an insider. Both types of echoists show issues with being submissive, having problems saying no, and avoiding conflict.<ref name=\"Libido 2015\"/>\n\n==== In relation to the pathological condition ====\nFreud's idea of narcissism described a pathology which manifests itself in the inability to love others, a lack of empathy, emptiness, boredom, and an unremitting need to search for power, while making the person unavailable to others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Analysis of the Self. A systematic approach to the psychoanalytic treatment of narcissistic personality disorders|last=Kohut|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHealthy narcissism has to do with a strong feeling of \"own love\" protecting the human being against illness. Eventually, however, the individual must love the other, \"the object love to not become ill\". The individual becomes ill as a result of the frustration created when he is unable to love the object.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psywilly.be/index.php?page=lezingen|title=Psywilly.be, psychoanalyticus Willy Depecker|first=Stijn|last=Blomme|website=www.psywilly.be|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2018}} In pathological narcissism such as the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the person's libido has been withdrawn from objects in the world and produces [[megalomania]].

Although several versions of the NPI have been proposed in the literature, a forty-item forced-choice version (Raskin & Terry, 1988) is the one most commonly employed in current research. Another shorter version, a sixteen-item version NPI-16 (Ames, Rose & Anderson, 2013) is also present. The NPI is based on the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-III clinical criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), although it was designed to measure these features in the general population. Thus, the NPI is often said to measure \"normal\" or \"subclinical\" (borderline) narcissism (i.e., in people who score very high on the NPI do not necessarily meet criteria for diagnosis with NPD).\n\n==== Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory ====\n{{Main|Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory}}\nThe Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) is a widely used diagnostic test developed by [[Theodore Millon]]. The MCMI includes a scale for Narcissism. The NPI and MCMI have been found to be well correlated, ''r''(146)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.55, ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.001.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4806_13 |author=Auerbach JS |title=Validation of two scales for narcissistic personality disorder |journal=J Pers Assess |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=649\u201353 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6520692 }}</ref> Whereas the MCMI measures narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), the NPI measures narcissism as it occurs in the general population.

Some differences in self-regulation between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder, Sedikides & Elliot (2000)<ref name=\"cre\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jrpe.2000.2282 |author=Campbell, W.K.|author2=Reeder G.D.|author3=Sedikides, C.|author4=Elliot, A.J. |title=Narcissism and Comparative Self-Enhancement Strategies |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=34 |pages=329\u201347 |year=2000 |issue=3 |citeseerx=10.1.1.457.9632}}</ref> who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative [[self-enhancement]] strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy similarly; however, narcissists were found to be more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.\n\nSorokowski et al. (2015) showed that narcissism is related to the frequency of posting [[selfie]]-type pictures on [[social media]]. Sorokowski's study showed that this relationship was stronger among men than women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sorokowski | first1 = P | last2 = Sorokowska | first2 = A | last3 = Oleszkiewicz | first3 = A | last4 = Frackowiak | first4 = T | last5 = Huk | first5 = A | last6 = Pisanski | first6 = K| year = 2015| title = Selfie posting behaviors are associated with narcissism among men | journal = Pers Individ Dif | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 123\u201327 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.05.004}}</ref>\n\nResearch indicates that being in devalued social group can encourage narcissism in some members of that group, as said individuals attempt to compensate for their low social status (due to being a member of a stigmatised group) by exaggerating their own self-worth by engaging in narcissism, which may also help them psychologically cope with negative treatment at the hands of others, though it may also cause them to engage in behaviour detrimental to themselves.<ref>Zeigler-Hill, Virgil, and Marion T.

The study subjects were 175 volunteer twin pairs (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a questionnaire that assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the [[heritability]] of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of [[genetics|genetic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance]] of this trait in the [[identical twins]] was significantly influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have heritability coefficients of greater than 0.5: [[Callous and unemotional traits|callousness]], identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.\n\n=== Stigmatising attitude towards psychiatric illness ===\nArikan found that a [[Social stigma|stigmatising]] attitude to [[psychiatric]] patients is associated with narcissistic personality traits.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42  |issue=4 |pages=248\u201350 |year=2005 |pmid=16618057}}</ref>\n\n=== In evolutionary psychology ===\nThe concept of narcissism is used in [[evolutionary psychology]] in relation to the mechanisms of [[assortative mating]], or the non-random choice of a partner for purposes of procreation. Evidence for assortative mating among humans is well established; humans mate assortatively regarding age, IQ, height, weight, nationality, educational and occupational level, physical and personality characteristics, and family relatedness.<ref>Buston & Emlen 2003, Buss 1989, Epstein & Guttman 1984, Garrison et al. 1968, Ho 1986, Jaffe & Chacon 1995, Spuhler 1968, Rushton 1989</ref> In the \"self seeking like\" hypothesis, individuals unconsciously look for a \"mirror image\" of themselves in others, seeking criteria of beauty or reproductive fitness in the context of self-reference. Alvarez et al. found that facial resemblance between couples was a strong driving force among the mechanisms of assortative mating: human couples resemble each other significantly more than would be expected from random pair formation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Alvarez, L. |title=Narcissism guides mate selection: Humans mate assortatively, as revealed by facial resemblance, following an algorithm of 'self seeking like' |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=2 |pages=177\u201394 |year=2005 |url=http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618224549/http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |archivedate=June 18, 2006 }}</ref> Since facial characteristics are known to be inherited, the \"self seeking like\" mechanism may enhance reproduction between genetically similar mates, favoring the stabilization of genes supporting social behavior, with no kin relationship among them.\n\n== Narcissistic supply ==\n{{Main|Narcissistic supply}}\nNarcissistic supply is a concept introduced into [[Psychoanalysis#Theories|psychoanalytic theory]] by [[Otto Fenichel]] in 1938, to describe a type of [[admiration]], [[Social support|interpersonal support]] or sustenance drawn by an individual from his or her environment and essential to their [[self-esteem]].<ref name=fenichel>{{cite journal|last=Fenichel|first = Otto|date = 1938|title = The Drive to Amass Wealth|url = http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fenichel-The-Drive-to-Amass-Wealth.pdf|journal = They Psychoanalytic Quarterly|volume = 7 |issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/21674086.1938.11925342|pages= 69\u201395}}</ref> The term is typically used in a negative sense, describing a pathological or excessive need for attention or admiration in [[codependents]] and the orally fixated, that does not take into account the feelings, opinions or preferences of other people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/malignant-self-love/narcissists-narcissistic-supply-and-sources-of-supply|title=StackPath|website=www.healthyplace.com|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n== Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury ==\n{{Main|Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury}}\nNarcissistic rage is a reaction to narcissistic injury, which is a perceived threat to a narcissist's [[self-esteem]] or self-worth. ''Narcissistic injury'' and ''narcissistic scar'' are terms used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the 1920s. ''Narcissistic wound'' and ''narcissistic blow'' are other, almost interchangeable, terms.<ref>[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 182</ref>\n\nThe term ''narcissistic rage'' was coined by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1972. Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum from aloofness, to expressions of mild irritation or annoyance, to serious outbursts, including violent attacks.<ref name=\"isbn1-58562-204-4\"/>\n\nNarcissistic rage reactions are not limited to [[personality disorders]]. They may also be seen in [[catatonic]], [[paranoid delusion]], and depressive episodes.<ref name=\"isbn1-58562-204-4\">{{cite book |author= Carl P.

Kepner, ''Body Process'' (1997) p. 73</ref>\nThe term emerged in the late twentieth century due to the works of [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] and other [[Neo-Freudian]]s, rejecting psychoanalysis as being similar to the [[Poisonous pedagogy|poisonous pedagogies]].<ref name=\"rutschky note\">Note: In ''For Your Own Good'', Alice Miller herself credits [[Katharina Rutschky]] and her 1977 work ''Schwarze P\u00e4dagogik'' as the inspiration to consider the concept of ''poisonous pedagogy'',[http://www.nospank.net/fyog5.htm] which is considered as a translation of Rutschky's original term ''Schwarze P\u00e4dagogik'' (literally \"black pedagogy\").

Masterson]] proposed two categories for pathological narcissism, ''[[exhibitionist]]'' and ''closet''.<ref name=\"masterson\">Masterson, James F.  The Emerging Self: A Developmental Self & Object Relations Approach to the Treatment of the Closet Narcissistic Disorder of the Self, 1993</ref> Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects in the quality of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in [[DSM-IV]] and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist is more likely to be described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the [[Borderline Personality Disorder|borderline]] in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Millon's variations ===\n\nIn 1996 [[Theodore Millon]] identified four variations of narcissist.<ref name=\"millon1\" />  Any individual narcissist may exhibit none or one of the following:\n* unprincipled narcissist: including [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features. A [[charlatan]]\u2014is a fraudulent, [[wikt:exploit|exploitative]], [[Amorality|amoral]], disloyal, deceptive and unscrupulous individual.\n* amorous narcissist: including [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] features. The [[Don Juan]] or [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] of our times\u2014is erotic, tantalizing, enticing; clever, glib and pathological lying.\n*[[Compensation (psychology)|compensatory]] narcissist: including negativistic ([[Passive-aggressive personality disorder|passive-aggressive]]), [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]] features: admirable, exceptional, noteworthy; creating illusions of being superior.\n* [[Elitism|elitist]] narcissist: variant of pure pattern. Corresponds to [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s \"phallic narcissistic\" personality type.\n\n=== Other forms ===\n\n==== Acquired situational narcissism ====\n\nAcquired situational narcissism (ASN) is a form of narcissism that develops in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of [[celebrity]]. It was coined by [[Robert Millman|Robert B. Millman]], professor of [[psychiatry]] at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]]. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society.  Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. \"Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people.\"<ref>Simon Crompton, ''All about me'' (London 2007) p. 171</ref> In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from [[narcissistic personality disorder]], differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. \"The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable,\"<ref>Crompton, p. 171</ref> so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is [[Norma Desmond]], the main character of ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Codependency ====\n\n{{Main|Codependency}}\nCodependency is a tendency to behave in overly passive or excessively caretaking ways that negatively impact one's relationships and quality of life. Narcissists are considered to be natural magnets for the codependent. Rappoport identifies codependents of narcissists as \"co-narcissists\".<ref name=\"co\">Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissistic Parents. The Therapist, 2005].</ref>\n\n==== Collective or group narcissism ====\n\n{{main|Collective narcissism}}\nCollective narcissism (or group narcissism) is a type of narcissism where an individual has an inflated [[self-love]] of his or her own [[ingroup]], where an \"ingroup\" is a group in which an individual is personally involved.<ref name=\"Zavala\">Golec de Zavala, A, et al. \"Collective narcissism and its social consequences.\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 97.6 (2009): 1074\u201396. Psyc articles. [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCO]]. Web. 26 Mar. 2011.</ref> While the classic definition of narcissism focuses on the individual, collective narcissism asserts that one can have a similar excessively high opinion of a group, and that a group can function as a narcissistic entity.<ref name=\"Zavala\" /> Collective narcissism is related to [[ethnocentrism]]; however, ethnocentrism primarily focuses on self-centeredness at an ethnic or cultural level, while collective narcissism is extended to any type of ingroup beyond just cultures and ethnicities.<ref name=\"Zavala\" /><ref name=\"Bizumic\">Bizumic, Boris, and John Duckitt. \"My Group Is Not Worthy of Me\": Narcissism and Ethnocentrism.\" Political Psychology 29.3 (2008): 437\u201353. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. EBSCO. Web. 9 Apr. 2011.</ref>\n\n==== Conversational narcissism ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nConversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist [[Charles Derber]] in his book, ''The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life''.\nDerber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention. In social situations, they tend to steer the [[conversation]] away from others and toward themselves. \"Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America,\" he wrote. \"It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life.\" What Derber describes as \"conversational narcissism\" often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged an egotist.\nDerber distinguishes the \"shift-response\" from the \"support-response,\" as in the following two hypothetical conversation fragments:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n:John: I'm feeling really starved. \n:Mary: Oh, I just ate. (shift-response)\n\n:John: I'm feeling really starved.\n:Mary: When was the last time you ate? (support-response)}}\n\n==== Cultural narcissism ====\n\nIn ''[[The Culture of Narcissism]]'', [[Christopher Lasch]] defines a narcissistic culture as one where every activity and relationship is defined by the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] need to acquire the symbols of wealth,<ref>Lasch, C, The Culture of Narcissism. 1979</ref> this becoming the only expression of rigid, yet covert, social [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It is a culture where [[liberalism]] only exists insofar as it serves a consumer society, and even [[art]], [[sex]] and [[religion]] lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life. Any real sense of community is undermined\u2014or even destroyed\u2014to be replaced by virtual equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.\n\n==== Destructive narcissism ====\n\nDestructive narcissism is the constant exhibition of numerous and intense characteristics usually associated with the [[pathological]] narcissist but having fewer characteristics than pathological narcissism.<ref>Brown, Nina W., The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern, 1998</ref>\n\n==== Malignant narcissism ====\n\n{{Main|Malignant narcissism}}\nMalignant narcissism, a term first coined in a book by [[Erich Fromm]] in 1964,<ref name=\"fromm2\">Fromm, Erich, The Heart of Man, 1964</ref> is a [[syndrome]] consisting of a cross breed of the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the [[antisocial personality disorder]], as well as [[paranoia|paranoid]] traits.  The malignant narcissist differs from one suffering from narcissistic personality disorder in that the malignant narcissist derives higher levels of psychological [[gratification]] from accomplishments over time (thus worsening the disorder).  Because the malignant narcissist becomes more involved in this psychological gratification, in the context of the right conditions, the narcissist is apt to develop the [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], the [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], and the [[schizoid]] personality disorders. The term [[malignant]] is added to the term ''narcissist'' to indicate that individuals with this disorder have a severe form of narcissistic disorder that is characterized also by features of paranoia, psychopathy (anti-social behaviors), aggression, and sadism according to Kernberg and colleagues.<ref>Lenzenweger M.F., Clarkin J.F., Caligor E., Cain N.M., & Kernberg O.F.

[https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/492228 doi:10.1159/000492228].</ref>\n\n==== Medical narcissism ====\n\nMedical narcissism is a term coined by John Banja in his book, ''Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism''.<ref name=\"banja1\">Banja, John, Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism, 2005</ref><ref name=\"banja2\">Banja, John, (as observed by Eric Rangus) [http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2005/February/February7/sandr1.htm John Banja: Interview with the clinical ethicist]</ref> Banja defines \"medical narcissism\" as the need of health professionals to preserve their [[self-esteem]] leading to the compromise of error disclosure to patients. In the book he explores the psychological, ethical and legal effects of [[medical error]]s and the extent to which a need to constantly assert their competence can cause otherwise capable, and even exceptional, professionals to fall into narcissistic traps. He claims that:\n{{blockquote|...most health professionals (in fact, most professionals of any ilk) work on cultivating a self that exudes authority, control, knowledge, competence and respectability. It's the narcissist in us all\u2014we dread appearing stupid or incompetent.}}\n\n==== In the workplace ====\n{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}\nNarcissism as a personality trait, generally assessed with the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]], is related to some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high in narcissism inventories are more likely to engage in [[counterproductive work behavior]] (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = T.

According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, ''Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia''.<ref>Hill, Victor (2005) Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia, Pengus Books Australia</ref>\n\n==== Primordial narcissism ====\n\nPsychiatrist [[Ernst Simmel]] first defined primordial narcissism in 1944.<ref name=\"simmel\">{{cite journal |author=Simmel, Ernst |author-link=Ernst Simmel |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]] |volume=XIII |issue=2 | title=Self-Preservation and the Death Instinct |pages=160\u201385 |year=1944 |doi=10.1080/21674086.1944.11925566 }}</ref>  Simmel's fundamental thesis is that the most primitive stage of libidinal development is not the oral, but the gastrointestinal one. Mouth and anus are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition of prenatal existence \"primordial narcissism.\" It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. Satiation of the gastrointestinal zone, the representative of the instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose, which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to [[Christopher Lasch|Lasch]], [[Bernard Stiegler]] argues in his book, ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'', that [[consumer capitalism]] is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial narcissism, without which it is not possible to extend love to others.<ref name=\"stiegler\">[[Bernard Stiegler]], ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'' (Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2009).</ref> In other words, he is referring to the natural state of an infant as a [[human fetus|fetus]] and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they are human beings with feelings, rather than having anything to do with actual narcissism.\n\n==== {{anchor|Gender narcissism}}Sexual narcissism ====\n\nSexual narcissism has been described as an [[egocentric]] pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability and sexual entitlement.  In addition, sexual narcissism is the erotic preoccupation with oneself as a superb lover through a desire to merge sexually with a mirror image of oneself.  Sexual narcissism is an intimacy dysfunction in which sexual exploits are pursued, generally in the form of extramarital affairs, to overcompensate for low self-esteem and an inability to experience true intimacy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C. |title=Sexual narcissism and the abusive male |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=279\u201392 |year=1991 |pmid=1815094 |doi=10.1080/00926239108404352 }}</ref> This behavioral pattern is believed to be more common in men than in women and has been tied to [[domestic violence]] in men and sexual coercion in couples.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C.|author3= Gasar, S.|author4= Wilson, N.E.|author5=Murphy, Y. |title=Sexual narcissism: a validation study |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=20 |pages=24\u201334 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/00926239408403414 |pmid=8169963|issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9403-9 |author=Ryan, K.M.|author2=Weikel, K.|author3=Sprechini, G. |title=Gender differences in narcissism and courtship violence in dating couples |journal=Sex Roles |volume=58 |pages=802\u201313 |year=2008 |issue=11\u201312 }}</ref> Hurlbert argues that sex is a natural biological given and therefore cannot be deemed as an addiction.
