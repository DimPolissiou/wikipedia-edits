Poppies are [[herbaceous plant]]s, often grown for their colourful flowers. One species of poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', is the source of the narcotic drug [[opium]] which contains powerful medicinal [[alkaloid]]s such as [[morphine]] and has been used since ancient times as an [[analgesic]] and [[narcotic]] [[medicine|medicinal]] and [[recreational drug]]. It also produces [[Poppy seed|edible seeds]]. Following the [[trench warfare]] in the poppy fields of [[Flanders]], Belgium during [[World War I]], poppies have become a symbol of [[Remembrance Day|remembrance]] of soldiers who have died during wartime.\n\n==Description==\nPoppies are [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]] or short-lived [[Perennial plant|perennial]] plants. Some species are [[monocarpic]], dying after flowering. Poppies can be over a metre tall with flowers up to 15 centimetres across. Flowers of species (not cultivars) have 4 to 6 petals, many [[stamen]]s forming a conspicuous whorl in the center of the flower and an ovary of from 2 to many fused carpels. The petals are showy, may be of almost any color and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the [[bud]] and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away. In the temperate zones, poppies bloom from spring into early summer.<ref>Simon, J.E., Chadwick, A.F. and Craker L.E.

This has resulted in a number of commercially important cultivars, such as the Shirley poppy, a cultivar of ''Papaver rhoeas'' and semi-double or double (flore plena) forms of the opium poppy ''Papaver somniferum'' and oriental poppy (''Papaver orientale''). Poppies of several other genera are also cultivated in gardens. A few species have other uses, principally as sources of drugs and foods. The [[opium poppy]] is widely cultivated and its worldwide production is monitored by international agencies. It is used for production of dried latex and [[opium]], the principal precursor of narcotic and analgesic [[opiates]] such as [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[codeine]]. [[Poppy seeds]] are rich in oil, carbohydrates, calcium and protein. [[Poppyseed oil|Poppy oil]] is often used as cooking oil, salad dressing oil, or in products such as margarine. Poppy oil can also be added to spices for cakes, or breads. Poppy products are also used in different paints, varnishes, and some cosmetics.<ref name=\"Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393\">Kryzmanski, J. and Jonsson, R. (1999) Poppy.

Poppies are [[herbaceous plant]]s, often grown for their colourful flowers. One species of poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', is the source of the narcotic drug [[opium]] which contains powerful medicinal [[alkaloid]]s such as [[morphine]] and has been used since ancient times as an [[analgesic]] and [[narcotic]] [[medicine|medicinal]] and [[recreational drug]]. It also produces [[Poppy seed|edible seeds]]. Following the [[trench warfare]] in the poppy fields of [[Flanders]], Belgium during [[World War I]], poppies have become a symbol of [[Remembrance Day|remembrance]] of soldiers who have died during wartime.\n\n==Description==\nPoppies are [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]] or short-lived [[Perennial plant|perennial]] plants. Some species are [[monocarpic]], dying after flowering. Poppies can be over a metre tall with flowers up to 15 centimetres across. Flowers of species (not cultivars) have 4 to 6 petals, many [[stamen]]s forming a conspicuous whorl in the center of the flower and an ovary of from 2 to many fused carpels. The petals are showy, may be of almost any color and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the [[bud]] and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away. In the temperate zones, poppies bloom from spring into early summer.<ref>Simon, J.E., Chadwick, A.F. and Craker L.E.

This has resulted in a number of commercially important cultivars, such as the Shirley poppy, a cultivar of ''Papaver rhoeas'' and semi-double or double (flore plena) forms of the opium poppy ''Papaver somniferum'' and oriental poppy (''Papaver orientale''). Poppies of several other genera are also cultivated in gardens. A few species have other uses, principally as sources of drugs and foods. The [[opium poppy]] is widely cultivated and its worldwide production is monitored by international agencies. It is used for production of dried latex and [[opium]], the principal precursor of narcotic and analgesic [[opiates]] such as [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[codeine]]. [[Poppy seeds]] are rich in oil, carbohydrates, calcium and protein. [[Poppyseed oil|Poppy oil]] is often used as cooking oil, salad dressing oil, or in products such as margarine. Poppy oil can also be added to spices for cakes, or breads. Poppy products are also used in different paints, varnishes, and some cosmetics.<ref name=\"Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393\">Kryzmanski, J. and Jonsson, R. (1999) Poppy.

There was a core of NCSY from two early founded regions Midwest Region (founded 1951) and Southern Region (founded in 1952 by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Rosenberg and Mr. Abe Rabhan of B'nai B'rith Jacob synagogue in Savannah, Georgia).\nIn 1954, Harold and Enid Boxer donated the money to create a national organization from the already-existing Southern and Midwest Regions.<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |title=About us |publisher=Cbaj-albany.org |accessdate=2012-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111538/http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |archivedate=2012-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, NCSY hired Rabbi [[Pinchas Stolper]] as the first National Director.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEgcAAAAMAAJ |title=Saul Bernstein, '&#39;The Renaissance of the Torah Jew'&#39; (KTAV Publishing, 1985), pp. 274, 339 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s there was an emphasis on NCSY Publications with many volumes written by Pinchas Stolper and then later the Aryeh Kaplan Series.

It was originally known as \"NCSY Goes to Yeshiva,\" and later changed its name to \"Camp NCSY Sports\".<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the Israel Summer Institute for Jewish teens was founded. Rabbi Stolper assisted NCSY in expanding internationally into Canada, Israel, Australia, Chile, and Ukraine.\n\nBy 2015, NCSY Summer Programs included The Anne Samson Jerusalem (TJJ), NCSY Kollel, NCSY Michlelet, NCSY GIVE (Girls Israel Volunteer Experience), NCSY JOLT (Jewish Overseas Leadership Training), NCSY BILT (Boys Israel Leadership Training), and other summer programs.

They are [[New England]], Upper New York, [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Long Island]], [[New Jersey]], Atlantic Seaboard, Central East, Southern, South [[Florida]], Greater Midwest, Southwest, [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Northwest, and [[Canada]]. Additionally, NCSY runs programming branches in [[Israel]] and now [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Each Region is divided into chapters. A chapter is typically a city, or a group of surrounding towns. In heavily populated Jewish areas like [[New Jersey]], counties may have several chapters.\n\nMany chapters in NCSY appoint or elect a group of NCSYers to serve on a chapter board, who work with the advisors or city directors to assist with programming or outreach. Many regions do the same thing, and have a regional board, who do similar things for the region. The International Board consists of representatives from many different regions.\n\nNCSY's programming is divided into two age groups, \"junior\" and \"senior\"; these generally encompass 5th\u20138th grades and 9th\u201312th grades, respectively. Some programs span both age groups, but most programming is unique for each.\n\n==Programming==\nNCSY's original model was to create the regional [[Shabbaton]], a weekend-long social and educational [[Shabbat]] experience based on learning sessions, following in the model of Abraham Stern of Torah Leadership Seminar.\n\nCurrently, while on [[Shabbaton]]s kids are treated to skits, learning sessions and ebbing, where participants sit in a circle around the \"circle guy\" where they sing songs and do \"funny\" routines.  They are housed either in hotels, camps, or grouped with sponsor families who take them in for the weekend.\n\n== NCSY Summer ==\nNCSY Summer runs 18 different trips to Israel, Europe, and North America. The trips have fluctuated every year, with new programs released and other programs cut.\n\nBoys Trips:\n\n* Camp Sports - \"Camp Sports enables participants to hone their athletic skills while learning Torah with their friends and advisors in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

The investigation began on July 12, 2000, he was indicted in March of that same year and surrendered to authorities and entered a plea of \"not-guilty\" on April 20, 2000. Lanner was convicted on one account of fondling a student on June 27 of 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/lanner_baruch.html|title=Case of Rabbi Baruch Lanner (AKA: Bernard S.

[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E1D61038F934A15751C1A9669C8B63]\n\nAt the time, in 2000 one journalist, Gary Rosenblatt of ''[[The Jewish Week]]'' argued that the Orthodox community had failed to deal with Lanner properly, and argued that NCSY workers often put the ends above means, sometimes with insufficient regard to the family dynamic or the alienation of teens from their parents. It also sometimes tends to a charismatic quality.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5092/is_200008/ai_n18524887 The Dark Side of Outreach: Does NCSY value religious observance over family harmony?

There was a core of NCSY from two early founded regions Midwest Region (founded 1951) and Southern Region (founded in 1952 by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Rosenberg and Mr. Abe Rabhan of B'nai B'rith Jacob synagogue in Savannah, Georgia).\nIn 1954, Harold and Enid Boxer donated the money to create a national organization from the already-existing Southern and Midwest Regions.<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |title=About us |publisher=Cbaj-albany.org |accessdate=2012-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111538/http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |archivedate=2012-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, NCSY hired Rabbi [[Pinchas Stolper]] as the first National Director.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEgcAAAAMAAJ |title=Saul Bernstein, '&#39;The Renaissance of the Torah Jew'&#39; (KTAV Publishing, 1985), pp. 274, 339 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s there was an emphasis on NCSY Publications with many volumes written by Pinchas Stolper and then later the Aryeh Kaplan Series.

They are [[New England]], Upper New York, [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Long Island]], [[New Jersey]], Atlantic Seaboard, Central East, Southern, South [[Florida]], Greater Midwest, Southwest, [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Northwest, and [[Canada]]. Additionally, NCSY runs programming branches in [[Israel]] and now [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Each Region is divided into chapters. A chapter is typically a city, or a group of surrounding towns. In heavily populated Jewish areas like [[New Jersey]], counties may have several chapters.\n\nMany chapters in NCSY appoint or elect a group of NCSYers to serve on a chapter board, who work with the advisors or city directors to assist with programming or outreach. Many regions do the same thing, and have a regional board, who do similar things for the region. The International Board consists of representatives from many different regions.\n\nNCSY's programming is divided into two age groups, \"junior\" and \"senior\"; these generally encompass 5th\u20138th grades and 9th\u201312th grades, respectively. Some programs span both age groups, but most programming is unique for each.\n\n==Programming==\nNCSY's original model was to create the regional [[Shabbaton]], a weekend-long social and educational [[Shabbat]] experience based on learning sessions, following in the model of Abraham Stern of Torah Leadership Seminar.\n\nCurrently, while on [[Shabbaton]]s kids are treated to skits, learning sessions and ebbing, where participants sit in a circle around the \"circle guy\" where they sing songs and do \"funny\" routines.  They are housed either in hotels, camps, or grouped with sponsor families who take them in for the weekend.\n\n<br />\n\n== NCSY Summer ==\nNCSY Summer runs 18 different trips to Israel, Europe, and North America. The trips have fluctuated every year, with new programs released and other programs cut.\n\nBoys Trips:\n\n* Camp Sports - \"Camp Sports enables participants to hone their athletic skills while learning Torah with their friends and advisors in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

Just weeks before Best Buy was prepared to liquidate the entire chain of stores (and after closing several hundred), they found a buyer in [[Sun Capital Partners]], a private equity firm in [[Boca Raton, Florida]], which acquired the chain in a cash-free transaction by acquiring Musicland's liabilities.\n\nIn 2002, Best Buy decided to consolidate some of the acquired stores by converting On Cue stores to the Sam Goody brand.<ref name=\"mspbj-2002may12\">{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2002/05/13/story7.html?page=all |title=On Cue brand will become Sam Goody |work=[[Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal]] |date=May 12, 2002 |first=Andrew |last=Tellijohn}}</ref>\n\nUnder Sun Capital, the company closed more stores and tried to get the business back to basics, but ultimately the challenges of competition and lackluster music industry releases{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} proved too much and in January 2006, The Musicland Group filed for [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]].

It lives in RAM and does not write to any other drive unless strictly specified. However, it is possible to set up an encrypted persistence volume (for example, within the USB Drive where Tails is installed) to save user data. It is also possible to instruct Tails to automatically install some additional software from the persistence drive, to load bookmarks for the Tor Browser, keep GPG keys or to keep configurations data for other applications. It is important to note, that the encrypted space could be detected by forensic analysis and is not hidden like in the case of [[VeraCrypt]] which offers [[plausible deniability]] and therefore should not be distinguishable from random data.<ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html</ref>\n\n===Security===\n\nDuring the shutdown process, Tails will overwrite most of the used RAM to avoid a [[cold boot attack]].<ref name=\"memory-erasure\">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/</ref>\nAn emergency shutdown can be triggered by physically removing the medium where Tails is installed: a watchdog monitors the status of the boot medium, and if removed then the memory erasing process will begin immediately. This should however only be used in an emergency situation because it could break the file system of the persistence volume, if set up.<ref name=\"memory-erasure\">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/</ref><ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/shutdown/index.en.html</ref>\n\n== Release history ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=3 | {{Version|l|show=110101}}\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin-top:0; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#cfc; padding-top:2em; padding-bottom:2em;\" colspan=\"4\"|Release history\n|-\n!

It lives in RAM, and doesn't write to any other drive unless strictly specified. However, it is possible to set up an encrypted persistence volume (for example, within the USB Drive where Tails is installed) to save user data. It is also possible to instruct Tails to automatically install some additional software from the persistence drive, to load bookmarks for the Tor Browser, keep GPG keys or to keep configurations data for other applications. It is important to note, that the encrypted space could be detected by forensic analysis and is not hidden like in the case of [[VeraCrypt]] which offers [[plausible deniability]] and therefore shouldn't be distinguishable from random data.<ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html</ref>\n\n===Security===\n\nDuring the shutdown process, Tails will overwrite most of the used RAM to avoid a [[cold boot attack]].<ref name=\"memory-erasure\">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/</ref>\nAn emergency shutdown can be triggered by physically removing the medium where Tails is installed: a watchdog monitors the status of the boot medium, and if removed then the memory erasing process will begin immediately. This should however only be used in an emergency situation because it could break the file system of the persistence volume, if set up.<ref name=\"memory-erasure\">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/</ref><ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/shutdown/index.en.html</ref>\n\n== Release history ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=3 | {{Version|l|show=110101}}\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin-top:0; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#cfc; padding-top:2em; padding-bottom:2em;\" colspan=\"4\"|Release history\n|-\n!
