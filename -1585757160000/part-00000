It is the busiest airport in the island of [[Mindanao]] and the third busiest in the [[Philippines]] after [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Manila]] and [[Mactan-Cebu International Airport]] in [[Lapu-Lapu, Philippines|Lapu-Lapu City]], [[Cebu]]. The airport has a single 3,000-meter precision [[runway]].\n\nA new terminal replaces the previous airport terminals, which lie just across it, in handling both domestic and international flights operating to and from Davao. The modern facility is designed to handle approximately 2 million passengers annually and 84,600 metric tons of cargo annually. The added capacity is also complemented by the latest navigational, security, and baggage handling equipment.\n\nThe modernization and upgrading of the airport facilities aims to make Davao as a hub for tourism and foreign investment in the region. Development was funded by a forty million-dollar loan from the [[Asian Development Bank]], co-financed by the [[European Investment Bank]] for twenty-five million [[European Currency Unit|ECUs]], and through budgetary allocations from the government. The total cost of the project amounted to $128 million.\n\nAfter almost a decade, the new terminal was finally inaugurated on December 2, 2003.

At the time it began operation, the airport merely consisted of a 1,200-meter unpaved grass runway and [[quonset hut]]s serving as terminal buildings. At the time, and throughout much of the 1940s and 1950s, both [[Philippine Airlines]] and the [[Philippine Air Force]] provided air service to the city.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\">{{cite news|author=Ajero, Antonio M. |title=Nonoy Garcia, Elias Lopez and other airport tales|url= http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |publisher=[[Sun.Star]] Davao |date=2003-12-01 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031221002204/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |archivedate=2003-12-21 |accessdate=2008-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the complex consisted of a small [[control tower]] and several low-rise buildings. Right of way and access to the terminal buildings and the airport was improved through further donation of land by Paciano Bangoy during the latter stages of his gubernatorial term. A new terminal designed by Filipino architect [[Leandro Locsin]], with a capacity of one million passengers, was constructed in 1980 and the runway was progressively extended from its original length of 1,200 meters to its current 3,000 meters. Both projects were funded during the term of then-Congressman Manuel Garcia, whose congressional district covers the airport perimeter.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" />\n\nRapid growth at the airport precipitated the construction of a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]15 million interim international terminal beside the airport's then-existing terminal,<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> and then eventually a new, larger terminal building which would consolidate the two existing terminals. In planning since 1992, construction began in 2000 and subsequently inaugurated on December 2, 2003, with a capacity double that of the old airport terminal. The construction of the new P2.7 billion building was funded by both the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> The biggest aircraft to land in Francisco Bangoy International Airport is the [[Antonov An-124]] Ruslan (registration number UR-82027).

Garcia National Highway. To avoid widening a road, which would displace houses and creep onto the airport's site, the road splits into two for 600 meters then merges back. It has a length of 1.7 kilometers, and is able to accommodate 1,000 vehicles per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pia.gov.ph/news/articles/1009703|title=New bypass road opens in Davao City|last=June 29|first=Rudolph Ian Alama Published on|last2=2018|website=pia.gov.ph|language=en|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe planned [[Davao City Expressway]] will further connect the airport to the city via a diamond interchange.

The airport has a single 3,000-meter precision [[runway]].\n\nA new terminal replaces the previous airport terminals, which lie just across it, in handling both domestic and international flights operating to and from Davao. The modern facility is designed to handle approximately 2 million passengers annually and 84,600 metric tons of cargo annually. The added capacity is also complemented by the latest navigational, security, and baggage handling equipment.\n\nThe modernization and upgrading of the airport facilities aims to make Davao as a hub for tourism and foreign investment in the region. Development was funded by a forty million-dollar loan from the [[Asian Development Bank]], co-financed by the [[European Investment Bank]] for twenty-five million [[European Currency Unit|ECUs]], and through budgetary allocations from the government.

At the time it began operation, the airport merely consisted of a 1,200-meter unpaved grass runway and [[quonset hut]]s serving as terminal buildings. At the time, and throughout much of the 1940s and 1950s, both [[Philippine Airlines]] and the [[Philippine Air Force]] provided air service to the city.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\">{{cite news|author=Ajero, Antonio M. |title=Nonoy Garcia, Elias Lopez and other airport tales|url= http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |publisher=[[Sun.Star]] Davao |date=2003-12-01 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031221002204/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |archivedate=2003-12-21 |accessdate=2008-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the complex consisted of a small [[control tower]] and several low-rise buildings. Right of way and access to the terminal buildings and the airport was improved through further donation of land by Paciano Bangoy during the latter stages of his gubernatorial term. A new terminal designed by Filipino architect [[Leandro Locsin]], with a capacity of one million passengers, was constructed in 1980 and the runway was progressively extended from its original length of 1,200 meters to its current 3,000 meters. Both projects were funded during the term of then-Congressman Manuel Garcia, whose congressional district covers the airport perimeter.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" />\n\nRapid growth at the airport precipitated the construction of a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]15 million interim international terminal beside the airport's then-existing terminal,<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> and then eventually a new, larger terminal building which would consolidate the two existing terminals. In planning since 1992, construction began in 2000 and subsequently inaugurated on December 2, 2003, with a capacity double that of the old airport terminal. The construction of the new P2.7 billion building was funded by both the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> The biggest aircraft to land in Francisco Bangoy International Airport is the [[Antonov An-124]] Ruslan (registration number UR-82027).

Georgia Institute of Technology is the only major engineering institution ranked in the top 30 to not have students have the option to have optional pass/fail classes during the COVID-19 global crisis so students will have outstanding mental health after the crisis.\n\nThe school was founded in 1885 as the Georgia School of Technology as part of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] plans to build an industrial economy in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Southern United States]]. Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a [[Vocational school|trade school]] to a larger and more capable [[Institute of technology|technical institute]] and research university.\n\nToday, Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges and contains about 31&nbsp;departments/units, with emphasis on science and technology. It is well recognized for its degree programs in engineering, computing, business administration, the sciences and design. Georgia Tech is ranked tied for 5th among all public [[national universities]] in the United States, tied for 4th in the Best Undergraduate Engineering Schools ranking, tied for 29th among all collegiate institutions in the \"National Universities\" category by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' as of the 2020 rankings, and 34th among global universities in the world by [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|''Times Higher Education'']] as of the 2019 rankings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/georgia-institute-of-technology-1569/overall-rankings |title=Georgia Institute of Technology Overall Rankings |website=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities |title=Best Colleges 2020: National University Rankings |website=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2019/world-ranking|title=World University Rankings|date=September 26, 2018|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=February 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStudent athletics, both organized and intramural, are a part of student and alumni life. The school's [[college athletics|intercollegiate competitive sports]] teams, the four-time football national champion [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|Yellow Jackets]], and the nationally recognized fight song \"[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]\", have helped keep Georgia Tech in the national spotlight.

Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters \"TECH\" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.\n\nOne of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a steam whistle blew five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55 a.m. to 5:55 p.m.[162] However, starting in the fall semester of 2017, due to a new classroom scheduling template, the whistle no longer adheres to this convention and follows a modified schedule.[163] The whistle also blows every spring during the \"When the Whistle Blows\" remembrance ceremony.[164] The faculty newspaper is named The Whistle.[63]\n\n===School colors===\nGeorgia Tech students hold a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be \"old gold, black, and crimson\". Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it \"symbolized cowardice\".<ref name=\"ugacolors\">{{cite web | title = College football tradition \u2013 Official school colors | url = http://www.1122productions.com/tradition/colors/ | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref> After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.<ref name=\"ugacolors\"/> Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.<ref name=\"rw\">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Georgia Tech traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226113349/http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|archive-date=2007-12-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.\n\nIn April 2018 Georgia Tech went through a comprehensive brand redefinement solidifying the school colors into Tech Gold and White as the primary school colors while Navy Blue serves as the contrasting secondary color. The decision to move forward with gold, white and blue is rooted in history, as the first mention of official Georgia Tech class colors came in the Atlanta Constitution in 1891 (white, blue and gold) and the first GT class ring in 1894 also featured gold, white and blue.<ref>https://www.news.gatech.edu/2018/04/23/georgia-tech-athletics-unveils-comprehensive-brand-refinement</ref>\n\n===Mascots===\n{{Main|Buzz (mascot)|Ramblin' Wreck}}\n[[File:Georgia Tech mascot Buzz.jpg|thumb|right|Buzz, the mascot]] Costumed in [[plush]] to look like a [[yellow jacket]], the official [[mascot]] of Georgia Tech is '''[[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]]'''. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for [[crowd surfing]] and general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.\n\nThe '''[[Rambling Wreck|Ramblin' Wreck]]''' was the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]] Sports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words \"To Hell With Georgia\" and \"Give 'Em Hell Tech\", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the '''Ramblin' Reck Club''', a selective student leadership organization on campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://traditions.gatech.edu/ramblinreck.html|title=Georgia Tech Traditions: The Ramblin' Reck|work=gatech.edu|publisher=Georgia Tech|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit organizations===\n[[File:GT Football Score.jpg|thumb|right|Tech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown.]]\nThe Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features [[body painting]], organized [[chants]], and general [[fanaticism]].\n\nThe marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.\n\n===Fight songs and chants===\nThe band plays the fight songs ''[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]'' and ''[[Georgia Tech traditions#Up With the White and Gold|Up With the White and Gold]]'' after every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer \"Go Jackets\" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of \"bust their ass\"), then a different drum beat and the cheer \"Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!\" The official cheer only includes \"Fight, Win\" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.\n\nIt is also tradition for the band to play the [[Here Comes the King|\"When You Say Budweiser\"]] after the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game.

Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a [[Vocational school|trade school]] to a larger and more capable [[Institute of technology|technical institute]] and research university.\n\nToday, Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges and contains about 31&nbsp;departments/units, with emphasis on science and technology. It is well recognized for its degree programs in engineering, computing, business administration, the sciences and design. Georgia Tech is ranked tied for 5th among all public [[national universities]] in the United States, tied for 4th in the Best Undergraduate Engineering Schools ranking, tied for 29th among all collegiate institutions in the \"National Universities\" category by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' as of the 2020 rankings, and 34th among global universities in the world by [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|''Times Higher Education'']] as of the 2019 rankings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/georgia-institute-of-technology-1569/overall-rankings |title=Georgia Institute of Technology Overall Rankings |website=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities |title=Best Colleges 2020: National University Rankings |website=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2019/world-ranking|title=World University Rankings|date=September 26, 2018|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=February 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStudent athletics, both organized and intramural, are a part of student and alumni life. The school's [[college athletics|intercollegiate competitive sports]] teams, the four-time football national champion [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|Yellow Jackets]], and the nationally recognized fight song \"[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]\", have helped keep Georgia Tech in the national spotlight. Georgia Tech fields eight men's and seven women's teams that compete in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics and the [[Division I-A#Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]].

The building was razed in 2009.\n\nSimilarly, there was little student reaction at Georgia Tech to the [[Vietnam War]] and United States involvement in the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. The student council defeated a resolution supporting the [[Vietnam Moratorium]], and the extent of the Tech community's response to the [[Kent State shooting]] was limited to a student-organized memorial service, though the Institute was ordered closed for two days, along with all other [[University System of Georgia]] schools.<ref name=\"ens\"/>\n\nIn 1988, President [[John Patrick Crecine]] pushed through a restructuring of the university. The Institute at that point had three colleges: the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], the [[Scheller College of Business|College of Management]], and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal Arts.

Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters \"TECH\" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.\n\nOne of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a steam whistle blew five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55 a.m. to 5:55 p.m.[162] However, starting in the fall semester of 2017, due to a new classroom scheduling template, the whistle no longer adheres to this convention and follows a modified schedule.[163] The whistle also blows every spring during the \"When the Whistle Blows\" remembrance ceremony.[164] The faculty newspaper is named The Whistle.[63]\n\n===School colors===\nGeorgia Tech students hold a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be \"old gold, black, and crimson\". Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it \"symbolized cowardice\".<ref name=\"ugacolors\">{{cite web | title = College football tradition \u2013 Official school colors | url = http://www.1122productions.com/tradition/colors/ | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref> After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.<ref name=\"ugacolors\"/> Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.<ref name=\"rw\">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Georgia Tech traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226113349/http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|archive-date=2007-12-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.\n\nIn April 2018 Georgia Tech went through a comprehensive brand redefinement solidifying the school colors into Tech Gold and White as the primary school colors while Navy Blue serves as the contrasting secondary color. The decision to move forward with gold, white and blue is rooted in history, as the first mention of official Georgia Tech class colors came in the Atlanta Constitution in 1891 (white, blue and gold) and the first GT class ring in 1894 also featured gold, white and blue.<ref>https://www.news.gatech.edu/2018/04/23/georgia-tech-athletics-unveils-comprehensive-brand-refinement</ref>\n\n===Mascots===\n{{Main|Buzz (mascot)|Ramblin' Wreck}}\n[[File:Georgia Tech mascot Buzz.jpg|thumb|right|Buzz, the mascot]] Costumed in [[plush]] to look like a [[yellow jacket]], the official [[mascot]] of Georgia Tech is '''[[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]]'''. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for [[crowd surfing]] and general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.\n\nThe '''[[Rambling Wreck|Ramblin' Wreck]]''' was the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]] Sports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words \"To Hell With Georgia\" and \"Give 'Em Hell Tech\", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the '''Ramblin' Reck Club''', a selective student leadership organization on campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://traditions.gatech.edu/ramblinreck.html|title=Georgia Tech Traditions: The Ramblin' Reck|work=gatech.edu|publisher=Georgia Tech|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit organizations===\n[[File:GT Football Score.jpg|thumb|right|Tech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown.]]\nThe Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features [[body painting]], organized [[chants]], and general [[fanaticism]].\n\nThe marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.\n\n===Fight songs and chants===\nThe band plays the fight songs ''[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]'' and ''[[Georgia Tech traditions#Up With the White and Gold|Up With the White and Gold]]'' after every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer \"Go Jackets\" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of \"bust their ass\"), then a different drum beat and the cheer \"Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!\" The official cheer only includes \"Fight, Win\" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.\n\nIt is also tradition for the band to play the [[Here Comes the King|\"When You Say Budweiser\"]] after the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game.

The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or \"red clown\" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nModern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Variet\u00e9'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.\n\nMany circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as \"Joey\", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.\n\nThe [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary\u2014and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe \"fear of clowns\", particularly circus clowns, has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].<ref>{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe \"''clown''\" character developed out of the [[zanni]] \"''rustic fool''\" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the \"''rustic fool''\" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].\nRustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' skl\u00earo-paikt\u00eas'' (from ''paizein'' \"to play (like a child)\") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for \"rustic\" or \"peasant\". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally \"digger; labourer\".\n\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne, cloyne'') in the generic meaning \"rustic, boor, peasant\". The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.<ref>Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' \"clumsy, boorish person\"; c.f. North Frisian ''kl\u00f6nne'' and \"kluns\", also meaning \"clumsy person\". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' \"colonist, farmer\". The verb ''to clown'' \"to play the clown onstage\" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php? allowed_in_frame=0&search=clown&searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}</ref> It is in this sense that \"Clown\" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''. The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] \"rustic fool\" characters such as Shakespeare's.\n\nThe [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that \"Clown\" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.\n\nThe now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.<ref name=Neville6>Neville, pp. 6\u20137</ref><ref name=Wilkins>McConnell Stott, pp. 95\u2013100</ref>\n\n==={{main|Circus clown}}{{anchor|Auguste}}{{anchor|Red}}Modern circus clown ===\n\n\nThe [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.\n[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843\u20131900) developed the \"red clown\" or \"Auguste\" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated \"white clown\". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or \"hobo\" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (\"Clowns\").\nBelling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nThe English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, by many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) \u043a\u043b\u043e\u0301\u0443\u043d, Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03cc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.\n\nItalian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,<ref>From ''paglia'', the word for \"straw\" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' \"mocker, scoffer\".</ref> and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palha\u00e7o'', Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, Turkish ''palya\u00e7o'', German ''Pajass'' (via French)<ref>Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''</ref> Yiddish \u05e4\u05bc\u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05e5 (''payats''), Russian \u043f\u0430\u044f\u0301\u0446, Romanian ''paia\u021b\u0103''.\n\n=== History in 20th-century North America ===\nIn the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, \"a funny man with a drinking problem\".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959\u20131962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.\n\nBased on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to \"[[Clown Care]]\" or \"hospital clowning\" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.\n\nThe shift of the ''Auguste'' or \"red clown\" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.<ref>A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded \"that clowns are universally disliked by children.

The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\n==={{anchor|White}}{{anchor|Sad}}White clown and Auguste ===\n\n[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|right|Les Rossyann, ''white clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France]]\n\nThe ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' in French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy Auguste.<ref>Schechter, Joel [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&pg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p. 139</ref> The two types are also distinguished as the \"sad clown\" (blanc) and \"happy clown\" (Auguste).<ref>{{citation |first1=Dani\u00e8le |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Cr\u00e9ation th\u00e9\u00e2trale: Adaptation, sch\u00e8mes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&pg=PA330 p. 330]</ref>\n\nThe Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the Auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or a costume that does not fit \u2013 oversize or too small, either is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.\n\nThe Auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the Auguste character to perform his bidding. The Auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the Auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the Auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.\n\nThe ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the Auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the Auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the Auguste when he is doing something wrong.\n\n==={{anchor|Whiteface}}Whiteface makeup ===\n\nThere are two major types of clowns with \"whiteface\" makeup:\nThe classic \"white clown\" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn \"Frosty\" Little]] are examples of this type. The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as \"Comedy\" or \"Grotesque Whiteface\". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. \nIn the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.<ref>Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the whiteface clown uses \"clown white\" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.<ref name=MCS117-118 /> In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.\n\nWhiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.<ref name=MCS117-118>McConnell Stott, pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nAmerica's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George \"G.L.\" Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ \"G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty\"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013</ref>\n\n=== Character clown ===\nThe character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.\n\nThe character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.\n\n==== North American ====\nThe most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]],{{where?|date=January 2020}} they are:\n* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].\n* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.\n* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.\n\n=== Notable clowns ===\n<!-- DO NOT PUT FICTIONAL CHARACTERS IN THIS SECTION -->\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Barry Lubin]]\n* [[Bello Nock]]\n* [[Bill Irwin]]\n* [[Bobo Barnett]]\n* [[Charlie Cairoli]]\n* [[Charlie Rivel]]\n* [[Clarabell the Clown|Clarabell]]\n* [[Terry Teene|Clownzo]]\n* [[Nicolai Poliakoff|Coco the Clown]]\n* [[David Larible]]\n* [[David Shiner (clown)|David Shiner]]\n* [[Doink the Clown]]\n* [[Emmett Kelly]]\n* [[Eric Davis (clown)|Eric Davis]]\n* [[Gamzee Makara]]\n* [[Geoff Hoyle]]\n* [[Jef Johnson]]\n* [[Joseph Grimaldi]]\n* [[John Wayne Gacy]]\n* [[John Gilkey]]\n* [[Lou Jacobs]]\n* [[George Foottit]]\n* [[Chocolat (clown)]]\n* [[The Marx Brothers]]\n* [[Sesame Street|Mister Noodles]]\n* [[Oleg Popov]]\n* [[Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]\n* [[Peter Shub]]\n* [[Poodles Hanneford]]\n* [[Puddles Pity Party]]\n* [[Red Skelton]]\n* [[Roly Bain]]\n* [[Sol (comedian)|Sol]]\n* [[The Three Stooges]]\n* [[Vance Colvig|Vance Colvig, Jr.]]\n* [[Violent J]] and [[Shaggy 2 Dope]]\n* [[Wavy Gravy]]\n* [[Yuri Nikulin]]\n* [[Zig and Zag (Australian performers)|Zig and Zag]] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Clown organizations ==\n\n=== World Clown Association ===\n{{main|World Clown Association}}\n\nThe World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.\n\n=== Clowns of America International ===\n{{main|Clowns of America International}}\n\nClowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims \"to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns\".\n\n== Clowning terminology ==\n\n=== Other roles and skills ===\nIn the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also \"sit in\" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.\n\n=== Frameworks ===\n'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.<ref name=\"simplycircus.com\">{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}</ref> Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.\n\n'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entr\u00e9es, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.\n\n=== Gags, bits and business ===\n* '''Business''' \u2013 the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.\n* '''Gag''' \u2013 very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a \"bit\" or \"routine\", may become a ''[[running gag]]''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2013 or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.\n* '''Bit''' \u2013 the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more \"gags\" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material\n\n=== Menu ===\n* '''Entr\u00e9e''' \u2014 clowning acts lasting 5\u201310 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entr\u00e9es almost always end with a \"blow-off\" \u2014 the comedic ending of a show segment, \"bit,\" \"gag,\" \"stunt,\" or \"routine.\"\n* '''Side dish''' \u2014 shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the \"entr\u00e9e,\" typically lasting 1\u20133 minutes. Typically made up of various \"gags\" and \"bits,\" side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a \"blow-off.\"\n\n=== Interludes ===\n\"Clown Stops\" or \"interludes\" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called \"reprises\" or \"run-ins\" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of \"business\" usually parodying the preceding act. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.\n\n=== Prop stunts ===\nAmong the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the \"[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]\" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or \"[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]\". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.\n\n== \"Clowns\" in the world's cultures ==\n{{main|Clown society}}\n{{further|Ritual clown|Heyoka|Trickster|Bouffon|Jester}}\n<!-- \nArabic: \u0645\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u062c m (muharrij)\nArmenian: \u056e\u0561\u0572\u0580\u0561\u056e\u0578\u0582 (ca\u0142racu)\nAzeri: oyunbaz\nChinese: \u5c0f\u4e11 (xi\u01ceoch\u01d2u)\nFaroese: \u00edspegil m\nFinnish: pelle\nHebrew: \u05dc\u05d9\u05e6\u05df m (ley\u1e63an)\nHungarian: boh\u00f3c\nIndonesian: badut\nJapanese: \u30d4\u30a8\u30ed (piero), \u9053\u5316\u5e2b (\u3069\u3046\u3051\u3057, d\u014dkeshi)\nKorean: \uc5b4\ub9bf\uad11\ub300 (ko) (eoritgwangdae), \uad11\ub300 (ko) (gwangdae), \ud53c\uc5d0\ub85c (piero)\nMalay: badut\nMalayalam: \u0d15\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d3f (k\u014dm\u0101\u1e37i)\nPersian: \u062f\u0644\u0642\u06a9 (dalqak)\nRussian: \u0448\u0443\u0442 m (\u0161ut)\nSwahili: mcheshi\n -->\n\nIn anthropology, the term \"clown\" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures.

A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles. The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse. The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].\n\nMany native tribes have a history of clowning.\nThe [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.\n\nIn this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]].

The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or \"red clown\" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nModern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Variet\u00e9'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.\n\nMany circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as \"Joey\", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.\n\nThe [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary\u2014and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe \"fear of clowns\", particularly circus clowns, has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].<ref>{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe \"''clown''\" character developed out of the [[zanni]] \"''rustic fool''\" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the \"''rustic fool''\" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].\nRustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' skl\u00earo-paikt\u00eas'' (from ''paizein'' \"to play (like a child)\") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for \"rustic\" or \"peasant\". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally \"digger; labourer\".\n\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne, cloyne'') in the generic meaning \"rustic, boor, peasant\". The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.<ref>Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' \"clumsy, boorish person\"; c.f. North Frisian ''kl\u00f6nne'' and \"kluns\", also meaning \"clumsy person\". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' \"colonist, farmer\". The verb ''to clown'' \"to play the clown onstage\" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php? allowed_in_frame=0&search=clown&searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}</ref> It is in this sense that \"Clown\" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''. The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] \"rustic fool\" characters such as Shakespeare's.\n\nThe [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that \"Clown\" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.\n\nThe now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.<ref name=Neville6>Neville, pp. 6\u20137</ref><ref name=Wilkins>McConnell Stott, pp. 95\u2013100</ref>\n\n==={{main|Circus clown}}{{anchor|Auguste}}{{anchor|Red}}Modern circus clown ===\n\n\nThe [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.\n[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843\u20131900) developed the \"red clown\" or \"Auguste\" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated \"white clown\". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or \"hobo\" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (\"Clowns\").\nBelling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nThe English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, by many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) \u043a\u043b\u043e\u0301\u0443\u043d, Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03cc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.\n\nItalian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,<ref>From ''paglia'', the word for \"straw\" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' \"mocker, scoffer\".</ref> and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palha\u00e7o'', Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, Turkish ''palya\u00e7o'', German ''Pajass'' (via French)<ref>Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''</ref> Yiddish \u05e4\u05bc\u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05e5 (''payats''), Russian \u043f\u0430\u044f\u0301\u0446, Romanian ''paia\u021b\u0103''.\n\n=== History in 20th-century North America ===\nIn the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, \"a funny man with a drinking problem\".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959\u20131962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.\n\nBased on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to \"[[Clown Care]]\" or \"hospital clowning\" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.\n\nThe shift of the ''Auguste'' or \"red clown\" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.<ref>A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded \"that clowns are universally disliked by children.

The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\n==={{anchor|White}}{{anchor|Sad}}White clown and Auguste ===\n\n[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|right|Les Rossyann, ''white clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France]]\n\nThe ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' in French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy Auguste.<ref>Schechter, Joel [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&pg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p. 139</ref> The two types are also distinguished as the \"sad clown\" (blanc) and \"happy clown\" (Auguste).<ref>{{citation |first1=Dani\u00e8le |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Cr\u00e9ation th\u00e9\u00e2trale: Adaptation, sch\u00e8mes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&pg=PA330 p. 330]</ref>\n\nThe Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the Auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or a costume that does not fit \u2013 oversize or too small, either is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.\n\nThe Auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the Auguste character to perform his bidding. The Auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the Auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the Auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.\n\nThe ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the Auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the Auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the Auguste when he is doing something wrong.\n\n==={{anchor|Whiteface}}Whiteface makeup ===\n\nThere are two major types of clowns with \"whiteface\" makeup:\nThe classic \"white clown\" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn \"Frosty\" Little]] are examples of this type. The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as \"Comedy\" or \"Grotesque Whiteface\". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. \nIn the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.<ref>Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the whiteface clown uses \"clown white\" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.<ref name=MCS117-118 /> In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.\n\nWhiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.<ref name=MCS117-118>McConnell Stott, pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nAmerica's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George \"G.L.\" Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ \"G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty\"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013</ref>\n\n=== Character clown ===\nThe character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.\n\nThe character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.\n\n==== North American ====\nThe most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]],{{where?|date=January 2020}} they are:\n* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].\n* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.\n* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.\n\n=== Notable clowns ===\n<!-- DO NOT PUT FICTIONAL CHARACTERS IN THIS SECTION -->\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Barry Lubin]]\n* [[Bello Nock]]\n* [[Bill Irwin]]\n* [[Bobo Barnett]]\n* [[Charlie Cairoli]]\n* [[Charlie Rivel]]\n* [[Clarabell the Clown|Clarabell]]\n* [[Terry Teene|Clownzo]]\n* [[Nicolai Poliakoff|Coco the Clown]]\n* [[David Larible]]\n* [[David Shiner (clown)|David Shiner]]\n* [[Doink the Clown]]\n* [[Emmett Kelly]]\n* [[Eric Davis (clown)|Eric Davis]]\n* [[Gamzee Makara]]\n* [[Geoff Hoyle]]\n* [[Jef Johnson]]\n* [[Joseph Grimaldi]]\n* [[John Wayne Gacy]]\n* [[John Gilkey]]\n* [[Lou Jacobs]]\n* [[George Foottit]]\n* [[Chocolat (clown)]]\n* [[The Marx Brothers]]\n* [[Sesame Street|Mister Noodles]]\n* [[Oleg Popov]]\n* [[Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]\n* [[Peter Shub]]\n* [[Poodles Hanneford]]\n* [[Puddles Pity Party]]\n* [[Red Skelton]]\n* [[Roly Bain]]\n* [[Sol (comedian)|Sol]]\n* [[The Three Stooges]]\n* [[Vance Colvig|Vance Colvig, Jr.]]\n* [[Violent J]] and [[Shaggy 2 Dope]]\n* [[Wavy Gravy]]\n* [[Yuri Nikulin]]\n* [[Zig and Zag (Australian performers)|Zig and Zag]] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Clown organizations ==\n\n=== World Clown Association ===\n{{main|World Clown Association}}\n\nThe World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.\n\n=== Clowns of America International ===\n{{main|Clowns of America International}}\n\nClowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims \"to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns\".\n\n== Clowning terminology ==\n\n=== Other roles and skills ===\nIn the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also \"sit in\" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.\n\n=== Frameworks ===\n'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.<ref name=\"simplycircus.com\">{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}</ref> Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.\n\n'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entr\u00e9es, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.\n\n=== Gags, bits and business ===\n* '''Business''' \u2013 the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.\n* '''Gag''' \u2013 very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a \"bit\" or \"routine\", may become a ''[[running gag]]''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2013 or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.\n* '''Bit''' \u2013 the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more \"gags\" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material\n\n=== Menu ===\n* '''Entr\u00e9e''' \u2014 clowning acts lasting 5\u201310 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entr\u00e9es almost always end with a \"blow-off\" \u2014 the comedic ending of a show segment, \"bit,\" \"gag,\" \"stunt,\" or \"routine.\"\n* '''Side dish''' \u2014 shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the \"entr\u00e9e,\" typically lasting 1\u20133 minutes. Typically made up of various \"gags\" and \"bits,\" side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a \"blow-off.\"\n\n=== Interludes ===\n\"Clown Stops\" or \"interludes\" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called \"reprises\" or \"run-ins\" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of \"business\" usually parodying the preceding act. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.\n\n=== Prop stunts ===\nAmong the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the \"[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]\" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or \"[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]\". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.\n\n== \"Clowns\" in the world's cultures ==\n{{main|Clown society}}\n{{further|Ritual clown|Heyoka|Trickster|Bouffon|Jester}}\n<!-- \nArabic: \u0645\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u062c m (muharrij)\nArmenian: \u056e\u0561\u0572\u0580\u0561\u056e\u0578\u0582 (ca\u0142racu)\nAzeri: oyunbaz\nChinese: \u5c0f\u4e11 (xi\u01ceoch\u01d2u)\nFaroese: \u00edspegil m\nFinnish: pelle\nHebrew: \u05dc\u05d9\u05e6\u05df m (ley\u1e63an)\nHungarian: boh\u00f3c\nIndonesian: badut\nJapanese: \u30d4\u30a8\u30ed (piero), \u9053\u5316\u5e2b (\u3069\u3046\u3051\u3057, d\u014dkeshi)\nKorean: \uc5b4\ub9bf\uad11\ub300 (ko) (eoritgwangdae), \uad11\ub300 (ko) (gwangdae), \ud53c\uc5d0\ub85c (piero)\nMalay: badut\nMalayalam: \u0d15\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d3f (k\u014dm\u0101\u1e37i)\nPersian: \u062f\u0644\u0642\u06a9 (dalqak)\nRussian: \u0448\u0443\u0442 m (\u0161ut)\nSwahili: mcheshi\n -->\n\nIn anthropology, the term \"clown\" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures.
