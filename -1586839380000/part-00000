Starring [[Bae Yong-joon]] and [[Choi Ji-woo]], it is the second part of the season-themed ''[[Endless Love (2000 TV series)|Endless Love series]]'' directed by [[Yoon Seok-ho]]. Filming primarily took place on the resort island of [[Namiseom]] and [[Seoul]].\n\nThe series is widely considered to be the [[Korean drama]] that launched the [[Korean Wave]] throughout Asia and worldwide.<ref name=\"remembering\"/> It has also been adapted into an [[anime]] series and a stage musical.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story begins when Joon-sang, the son of an eminent musician, moves to [[Chuncheon]], a rural city in South Korea. As an extraordinarily talented student, Joon-sang is welcomed by his fellow students as well as his teachers, but remains a quiet, introverted teenager. As a result of the belief that his biological father is dead, and serious disagreements with his mother, Joon-sang believes that no one truly loves him.\n\nOn his way to school one day, Joon-sang's classmate Yoo-jin, while sitting next to him on the bus, falls asleep on his shoulder. Joon-sang soon falls in love with Yoo-jin, who opens her innocent heart to him. Their love, however, is cut short after Joon-sang is badly injured in a car accident and, due to brain damage, suffers from [[amnesia]], unable to remember anything prior to his accident.\n\nJoon-sang's mother, yearning for Joon-sang's love and respect, has Joon-sang brainwashed by a psychologist, so that Joon-sang will not remember his painful childhood as an illegitimate child. As a result, Joon-sang's memories prior to the accident are erased. Joon-sang's mother decides to move to the [[United States]] with Joon-sang, where he can start a new life under the identity of Lee Min-hyung. His friends and teachers are told that Joon-sang is dead.\n\nTen years later, Min-hyung is an award-winning architect in the United States. He does not remember anything about his life in Korea. He is completely different, now an open-minded person who cares about other people. He returns to Korea and Yoo-jin sees him on the street, prompting her to put off her engagement to her childhood friend Sang-hyuk. Little does she know that Min-hyung is dating her friend and past rival Chae-rin. The story's plot thickens when Yoo-jin's interior design firm is awarded a project by Min-hyung's architectural firm, and has to work with Min-hyung. Yoo-jin sometimes wonders if he is her supposedly dead first love Joon-sang.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bae Yong-joon]] as Kang Joon-sang / Lee Min-hyung\n*[[Choi Ji-woo]] as Jeong Yoo-jin\n*[[Park Yong-ha]] as Kim Sang-hyuk\n*[[Park Sol-mi]] as Oh Chae-rin\n*Lee Hye-eun as Kong Jin-sook\n*[[Ryu Seung-soo]] as Kwon Yong-gook\n*[[Kwon Hae-hyo]] as Kim [[Korean honorifics#Seonbae.2FHubae|seonbae]]\n*[[Song Ok-sook]] as Kang Mi-hee, Joon-sang's mother\n*[[Jung Dong-hwan]] as Kim Jin-woo, Sang-hyuk's father\n*[[Kim Hae-sook]] as Lee Yeong-hee, Yoo-jin's mother\n*Ha Ji-hye as Jeong Hee-jin, Yoo-jin's younger sister\n*Jung Won-joong as Park Jong-ho, \"Gargamel\"\n*[[Jang Hang-sun]] as Supervisor Min\n*Lee Hyo-chun as Park Ji-young, Sang-hyuk's mother\n*Park Hyun-sook as Lee Jeong-ah, Yoo-jin's colleague at Polaris\n*Son Jong-bum as Yoo-jin's colleague at Polaris\n*Yoo Yul as Radio broadcaster\n*Maeng Ho-rim as Dr. Ahn\n*Ha Jae-young as Jeong Hyeon-soo, Yoo-jin's father\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Winter Sonata at Nami Island.jpg|thumb|250px|''Winter Sonata'' park at [[Namiseom]]]]\n''Winter Sonata'' is credited with causing the second wave of the [[Korean Wave]] and extending it to Japan and the Philippines.<ref name=\"winter sonata\"/> It improved the image of South Korea among the Japanese and set fashion trends throughout East Asia.<ref name=\"winter sonata\"/> The series was a commercial success; 330,000 DVDs and 1,200,000 copies of ''Winter Sonata'' [[novelization]]s were sold.<ref name=\"remembering\"/> The series yielded more than {{USD|27 billion}} when taking into account the profit it contributed to tourism.<ref name=\"winter sonata\">{{cite web|url=http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/wsdramafever.htm|title=Winter Sonata Fever|work=UNIORB|last=Lee|first=Diana|accessdate=2012-01-13|date=31 January 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207142535/http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/wsdramafever.htm|archive-date=7 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The number of visitors to the island of [[Namiseom]] (where the series was shot) grew from 250,000 to over 650,000 after the series was aired.<ref name=\"winter sonata nami\">{{cite web|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120110000723|title=K-drama fever impacts other industries|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2012-01-19|date=10 January 2012|last=Park|first=Min-young}}</ref> A statue of the main characters can also be found on the island at the spot where they first kissed.<ref name=\"winter sonata nami\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.gg.go.kr/2356|title=Nami Island immersed in another ''Winter Sonata''|date=21 December 2011|accessdate=2012-01-19|work=[[Gyeonggi-do]] English Blog|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709195937/http://eng.gg.go.kr/2356|archivedate=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe series shot actor [[Bae Yong-joon]] into stardom in Asia, and he became especially popular among middle-aged Japanese women.<ref name=\"remembering\"/> When he first visited Japan in 2004, more than 3,000 women guarded by 350 policemen gathered at the airport to welcome him.<ref name=\"remembering\">{{cite web|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20111230000497|title=Remembering ''Winter Sonata'', the start of hallyu|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=2012-01-19|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|last=Lee|first=Claire}}</ref> [[Junichiro Koizumi]], the Japanese prime minister at the time, was quoted saying that Bae was more popular in Japan than himself.<ref name=\"remembering\"/>\n\nThe series was also aired in the Philippines in 2003 via [[GMA Network]]'s primetime block under the title ''Endless Love II: Winter Sonata'' and one of the highest rated shows at that time.

Starring [[Bae Yong-joon]] and [[Choi Ji-woo]], it is the second part of the season-themed ''[[Endless Love (2000 TV series)|Endless Love series]]'' directed by [[Yoon Seok-ho]]. Filming primarily took place on the resort island of [[Namiseom]] and [[Seoul]].\n\nThe series is widely considered to be the [[Korean drama]] that launched the [[Korean Wave]] throughout Asia and worldwide.<ref name=\"remembering\"/> It has also been adapted into an [[anime]] series and a stage musical.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story begins when Joon-sang, the son of an eminent musician, moves to [[Chuncheon]], a rural city in South Korea. As an extraordinarily talented student, Joon-sang is welcomed by his fellow students as well as his teachers, but remains a quiet, introverted teenager. As a result of the belief that his biological father is dead, and serious disagreements with his mother, Joon-sang believes that no one truly loves him.\n\nOn his way to school one day, Joon-sang's classmate Yoo-jin, while sitting next to him on the bus, falls asleep on his shoulder. Joon-sang soon falls in love with Yoo-jin, who opens her innocent heart to him. Their love, however, is cut short after Joon-sang is badly injured in a car accident and, due to brain damage, suffers from amnesia, unable to remember anything prior to his accident.\n\nJoon-sang's mother, yearning for Joon-sang's love and respect, has Joon-sang brainwashed by a psychologist, so that Joon-sang will not remember his painful childhood as an illegitimate child. As a result, Joon-sang's memories prior to the accident are erased. Joon-sang's mother decides to move to the United States with Joon-sang, where he can start a new life under the identity of Lee Min-hyung. His friends and teachers are told that Joon-sang is dead.\n\nTen years later, Min-hyung is an award-winning architect in the United States. He does not remember anything about his life in Korea. He is completely different, now an open-minded person who cares about other people. He returns to Korea and Yoo-jin sees him on the street, prompting her to put off her engagement to her childhood friend Sang-hyuk. Little does she know that Min-hyung is dating her friend and past rival Chae-rin. The story's plot thickens when Yoo-jin's interior design firm is awarded a project by Min-hyung's architectural firm, and has to work with Min-hyung. Yoo-jin sometimes wonders if he is her supposedly dead first love Joon-sang.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bae Yong-joon]] as Kang Joon-sang / Lee Min-hyung\n*[[Choi Ji-woo]] as Jeong Yoo-jin\n*[[Park Yong-ha]] as Kim Sang-hyuk\n*[[Park Sol-mi]] as Oh Chae-rin\n*Lee Hye-eun as Kong Jin-sook\n*[[Ryu Seung-soo]] as Kwon Yong-gook\n*[[Kwon Hae-hyo]] as Kim [[Korean honorifics#Seonbae.2FHubae|seonbae]]\n*[[Song Ok-sook]] as Kang Mi-hee, Joon-sang's mother\n*[[Jung Dong-hwan]] as Kim Jin-woo, Sang-hyuk's father\n*[[Kim Hae-sook]] as Lee Yeong-hee, Yoo-jin's mother\n*Ha Ji-hye as Jeong Hee-jin, Yoo-jin's younger sister\n*Jung Won-joong as Park Jong-ho, \"Gargamel\"\n*[[Jang Hang-sun]] as Supervisor Min\n*Lee Hyo-chun as Park Ji-young, Sang-hyuk's mother\n*Park Hyun-sook as Lee Jeong-ah, Yoo-jin's colleague at Polaris\n*Son Jong-bum as Yoo-jin's colleague at Polaris\n*Yoo Yul as Radio broadcaster\n*Maeng Ho-rim as Dr. Ahn\n*Ha Jae-young as Jeong Hyeon-soo, Yoo-jin's father\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Winter Sonata at Nami Island.jpg|thumb|250px|''Winter Sonata'' park at [[Namiseom]]]]\n''Winter Sonata'' is credited with causing the second wave of the [[Korean Wave]] and extending it to Japan and the Philippines.<ref name=\"winter sonata\"/> It improved the image of South Korea among the Japanese and set fashion trends throughout East Asia.<ref name=\"winter sonata\"/> The series was a commercial success; 330,000 DVDs and 1,200,000 copies of ''Winter Sonata'' [[novelization]]s were sold.<ref name=\"remembering\"/> The series yielded more than {{USD|27 billion}} when taking into account the profit it contributed to tourism.<ref name=\"winter sonata\">{{cite web|url=http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/wsdramafever.htm|title=Winter Sonata Fever|work=UNIORB|last=Lee|first=Diana|accessdate=2012-01-13|date=31 January 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207142535/http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/wsdramafever.htm|archive-date=7 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The number of visitors to the island of [[Namiseom]] (where the series was shot) grew from 250,000 to over 650,000 after the series was aired.<ref name=\"winter sonata nami\">{{cite web|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120110000723|title=K-drama fever impacts other industries|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2012-01-19|date=10 January 2012|last=Park|first=Min-young}}</ref> A statue of the main characters can also be found on the island at the spot where they first kissed.<ref name=\"winter sonata nami\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.gg.go.kr/2356|title=Nami Island immersed in another ''Winter Sonata''|date=21 December 2011|accessdate=2012-01-19|work=[[Gyeonggi-do]] English Blog|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709195937/http://eng.gg.go.kr/2356|archivedate=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe series shot actor [[Bae Yong-joon]] into stardom in Asia, and he became especially popular among middle-aged Japanese women.<ref name=\"remembering\"/> When he first visited Japan in 2004, more than 3,000 women guarded by 350 policemen gathered at the airport to welcome him.<ref name=\"remembering\">{{cite web|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20111230000497|title=Remembering ''Winter Sonata'', the start of hallyu|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=2012-01-19|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|last=Lee|first=Claire}}</ref> [[Junichiro Koizumi]], the Japanese prime minister at the time, was quoted saying that Bae was more popular in Japan than himself.<ref name=\"remembering\"/>\n\nThe series was also aired in the Philippines in 2003 via [[GMA Network]]'s primetime block under the title ''Endless Love II: Winter Sonata'' and one of the highest rated shows at that time.

Brooklyn, New York)[http://www.prattsenate.org/dta/docs/2006-jan_dta-overview.pdf]</ref>\n\nRolf  Fjelde published two volumes of poetry, in 1955 and 1962, and in 1965, published the first volume of his Ibsen translations. This began the  translating career that culminated in ''Ibsen: The Complete Major Prose Plays'' (1978) and ''Peer Gynt'' (1980). In 1991, the [[King of Norway]] honored Rolf  Fjelde for his translations by awarding him the [[St. Olav's Medal]]. Two years later, The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] presented Rolf  Fjelde with its Award in Literature.<ref>''Rolf Fjelde in Memoriam'' (The Ibsen Society of America.

By then, a Kedrovaya Pad nature reserve and several breeding grounds existed here, but only expansion of the protected area and integrated management of the existing natural territories could solve the problem of conserving the rare cat.\n\nThe Land of the Leopard National Park was founded on April 5, 2012, thanks to the efforts of ecologists and personal attention to the problem of [[Sergei Ivanov|Sergey Ivanov]], the former Director of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation. Its territory in the area of 262 th. ha has covered the most part of the rare predator\u2019s habitat including the land of Khasansky and Nadezhdinsky Districts of Primorye, the Ussuriysky Urban District, as well as a little part of Vladivostok city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leopard-land.ru/about/history|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f|website=leopard-land.ru|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Ecoregion and climate==\nLand of the Leopard is in the [[Manchurian mixed forests]] ecoregion.

As a result of poaching and fires, the vast habitat of the beast had shrunk to a narrow stripe in the southwest of Primorsky Krai. By then, a Kedrovaya Pad nature reserve and several breeding grounds existed here, but only expansion of the protected area and integrated management of the existing natural territories could solve the problem of conserving the rare cat.\n\nThe Land of the Leopard National Park was founded on April 5, 2012, thanks to the efforts of ecologists and personal attention to the problem of [[Sergei Ivanov|Sergey Ivanov]], the former Director of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation. Its territory in the area of 262 th. ha has covered the most part of the rare predator\u2019s habitat including the land of Khasansky and Nadezhdinsky Districts of Primorye, the Ussuriysky Urban District, as well as a little part of Vladivostok city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leopard-land.ru/about/history|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f|website=leopard-land.ru|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Ecoregion and climate==\nLand of the Leopard is in the [[Manchurian mixed forests]] ecoregion.

Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.<ref name=\":1\"/> Traditional gendered roles view the man as a \u201cpro-creator, a protector, and a provider,\u201d and the woman as \u201cpretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.\u201d <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=978-0-13-034177-8|location=New Jersey|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/marriagesfamilie0004beno}}</ref> Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views.

Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings.

Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.\n\nIt has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aubrey |first1=Jennifer Stevens |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |title=The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions. |journal=Media Psychology |date=May 2004 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013142 |doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1}}</ref> In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined. While studies between 1960 and 1990 show an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.</ref>\n\n====Changing gender roles in marriage====\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.<ref name=\":0\"/> \n\nAfter around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized.<ref name=\":03\">{{cite journal | last1 = Greenstein | first1 = Theodore N | year = 1995| title = Gender Ideology, Marital Disruption, and the Employment of Married Women | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 31\u201342 | doi = 10.2307/353814 | jstor = 353814 }}</ref> Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles,.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722\u201341 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles.

In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\".<ref name=\"Bag\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641\u201372 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}</ref> The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\n==Communication==\n{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}</ref> Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.<ref>DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough.

She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the \u201cGender Labeling Test\u201d, had more traditional family values.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]].

Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.\n\nThese implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).\n\nOne example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females.

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities.

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science.

In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].\n\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\n\nChristian traditions that officially recognize \"[[saint]]s\", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals.

The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.</ref>\n\n====Changing gender roles in marriage====\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.<ref name=\":0\"/> \n\nAfter around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized.<ref name=\":03\">{{cite journal | last1 = Greenstein | first1 = Theodore N | year = 1995| title = Gender Ideology, Marital Disruption, and the Employment of Married Women | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 31\u201342 | doi = 10.2307/353814 | jstor = 353814 }}</ref> Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles,. The attitude concerning the shift in gender roles can be classified into two perspectives: traditional and egalitarian.

Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the \u201cGender Labeling Test\u201d, had more traditional family values.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]]. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and [[rhetoric]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Diana B.|authorlink=Diana Carlin|date=Fall 2009|title=Have You Come a Long Way, Baby?

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities.

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary.

In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles or as having different \"rules\" they are expected to follow by society.\n\nThese modified \"rules\" for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive. Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for \"not being gay enough\"; not conforming sufficiently to standard (Western) conceptions of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.<ref>Morgan, D.
