Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of [[time]] and the [[laws of physics]].  Due to the apparent nature of [[reality]] and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently [[wikt: exist|exists]] and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of religion and ethics''].

Cambridge: University Press. p. 107.</ref>\n\nIn the [[philosophy of time]], [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]] is the [[belief]] that only the present [[existence|exists]] and the future and the past are [[reality|unreal]]. Religions consider the future when they address issues such as [[karma]], [[afterlife|life after death]], and [[eschatology|eschatologies]] that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. Religious figures such as [[prophet]]s and [[divination|diviners]] have claimed to see into the future. \nFuture studies, or [[futurology]], is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and [[probability]], versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.\n\nThe concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production, including [[art]] movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation, such as the 20th-century movement [[futurism]].\n\n==Physics==\n[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|A visualization of the future [[light cone]] (at the top), the present, and the past light cone in 2D space.]]\n{{See also|Time in physics}}\nIn physics, time is the fourth dimension. Physicists argue that [[spacetime]] can be understood as a sort of Your hart. Time flies. fabric that bends due to forces such as gravity. In [[classical physics]] the future is just a half of the timeline, which is the same for all observers. In [[special relativity]] the flow of time is relative to the observer's [[frame of reference]]. The faster an observer is traveling away from a reference object, the slower that object seems to move through time. Hence, the future is not an objective notion anymore. A more modern notion is [[absolute future]], or the future [[light cone]]. While a person can move backward or forwards in the three spatial dimensions, many physicists argue you are only able to move forward in time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/technology/070307_time_travel.html|title=You Can't Travel Back in Time, Scientists Say|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nOne of the outcomes of Special Relativity Theory is that a person can travel into the future (but never come back) by traveling at very high speeds. While this effect is negligible under ordinary conditions, space travel at very high speeds can change the flow of time considerably. As depicted in many [[science fiction]] stories and movies (e.g. ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2006 film)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]''), a person traveling for even a short time at near [[light speed]] will return to an Earth that is many years in the future.\n\nSome physicists claim that by using a [[wormhole]] to connect two regions of spacetime a person could theoretically travel in time. Physicist [[Michio Kaku]] points out that to power this hypothetical time machine and \"punch a hole into the fabric of space-time\", it would require the energy of a star. Another theory is that a person could travel in time with [[cosmic string]]s.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"The trouble with the future is that it's so much less knowable than the past.\" \n| source =&nbsp;[[John Lewis Gaddis]], ''The Landscape of History''.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past |last= Gaddis|first= John Lewis|year= 2002|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-19-517157-0|pages= 56}}\n&nbsp;</ref> \n| width  = 27%\n| align  = right\n| style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\nIn the [[philosophy of time]], presentism is the [[belief]] that only the present [[existence|exists]], and the future and [[past]] are [[reality|unreal]]. Past and future \"entities\" are construed as [[logic]]al constructions or [[fictionalism|fictions]]. The opposite of presentism is '[[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]', which is the belief that things in the past and things yet to come exist [[eternity|eternally]]. Another view (not held by many philosophers) is sometimes called the '[[Growing block universe|growing block]]' [[theory]] of time\u2014which postulates that the past and present exist, but the future does not.<ref>{{cite book| last=Broad| first= C.D.| title= Scientific Thought| location=New York| publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Co.| year=1923| url=http://www.ditext.com/broad/st/st-con.html}}</ref>\n\nPresentism is [[wikt: compatible|compatible]] with [[Galilean relativity]], in which time is independent of space, but is probably incompatible with [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]ian/[[Einstein]]ian relativity in conjunction with certain other philosophical [[thesis|theses]] that many find uncontroversial. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] [[Research proposal|proposed]] that the present is a knife edge between the past and the future and could not contain any extended period of time.\n\nContrary to Saint Augustine, some philosophers propose that conscious experience is extended in time.  For instance, [[William James]] said that time is \"...the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  Augustine proposed that God is outside of time and present for all times, in [[eternity]]. Other early philosophers who were presentists include the [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (in the tradition of [[Indian Buddhism]]). A leading scholar from the modern era on [[Buddhist philosophy]] is [[Theodor Ippolitovich Stcherbatsky|Stcherbatsky]], who has written extensively on Buddhist presentism: {{cquote|Everything past is unreal, everything future is unreal, everything imagined, absent, mental... is unreal... Ultimately real is only the present moment of physical [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] [i.e., [[Causality|causation]]].<ref>Vol.1 of ''Buddhist Logic'', 1962, Dover: New York. 70\u201371.</ref>}}\n\n==Psychology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[Human behavior]] is known to encompass anticipation of the future. Anticipatory behavior can be the result of a psychological outlook toward the future, for examples [[optimism]], [[pessimism]], and [[hope]].\n\nOptimism is an outlook on life such that one maintains a view of the world as a positive place. People would say that optimism is seeing the glass \"half full\" of water as opposed to half empty. It is the philosophical opposite of pessimism. Optimists generally believe that people and events are inherently good, so that most situations work out in the end for the best. Hope is a belief in a positive outcome related to events and circumstances in one's life. Hope implies a certain amount of despair, wanting, wishing, suffering or perseverance\u2014i.e., believing that a better or positive outcome is possible even when there is some evidence to the contrary. \"Hopefulness\" is somewhat different from optimism in that hope is an emotional state, whereas optimism is a conclusion reached through a deliberate thought pattern that leads to a positive attitude.\n\n[[Pessimism]] as stated before is the opposite of optimism. It is the tendency to see, anticipate, or emphasize only bad or undesirable outcomes, results, or problems. The word originates in Latin from Pessimus meaning worst and Malus meaning bad.\n\n==Religion==\nReligions consider the future when they address issues such as [[karma]], [[afterlife|life after death]], and [[eschatology|eschatologies]] that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. In religion, major prophets are said to have the power to change the future.  Common religious figures have claimed to see into the future, such as minor [[prophet]]s and [[divination|diviners]].\nThe term \"afterlife\" refers to the continuation of [[existence]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[spirit]] or [[mind]] of a human (or animal) after physical [[death]], typically in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] or [[ghost]]like afterworld. Deceased persons are usually believed to go to a specific region or [[planes of existence|plane of existence]] in this afterworld, often depending on the rightness of their actions during life.\n\nSome believe the afterlife includes some form of preparation for the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to transfer to another body ([[reincarnation]]).\nThe major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]]. There are those who are skeptical of the existence of the afterlife, or believe that it is absolutely impossible, such as the [[materialism|materialist]]-reductionists, who believe that the topic is [[supernatural]], therefore does not really exist or is unknowable. In metaphysical models, [[theists]] generally, believe some sort of afterlife awaits people when they die. [[Atheism|Atheists]] generally do not believe in a life after death. Members of some generally non-theistic religions such as [[Buddhism]], tend to believe in an afterlife like [[reincarnation]] but without reference to [[God]].\n\n[[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] generally hold the position that like the existence of God, the existence of supernatural phenomena, such as souls or life after death, is unverifiable and therefore unknowable.<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic | title=agnositic | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life, with the exception of [[Calvinistic]] variants of [[Protestant]] Christianity, which believes one's status in the afterlife is a gift from God and cannot be earned during life.\n\n[[Eschatology]] is a part of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] concerned with the final events in the [[history of the world]], or the ultimate [[destiny]] of [[All humanity|humanity]], commonly referred to as the end of the world. While in [[mysticism]] the phrase refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine, in many traditional [[religion]]s it is taught as an actual future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or [[folklore]]. More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the [[Messiah]] or [[Messianic Age]], the [[end time]], and the [[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]].\n\n== Grammar ==\nIn [[grammar]], actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past ([[past]], [[Uses of English verb forms#Past progressive|past continuous]], [[past perfect]], or [[past perfect continuous]]), present ([[present]], [[present continuous]], [[present perfect]], or [[present perfect continuous]]), or future (future, [[future continuous]], [[future perfect]], or [[future perfect continuous]]).<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> The future tense refers to actions that have not yet happened, but which are due, expected, or likely to occur in the future.<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> For example, in the sentence, \"She will walk home,\" the verb \"will walk\" is in the future tense because it refers to an action that is going to, or is likely to, happen at a point in time beyond the present.\n\nVerbs in the future continuous tense indicate actions that will happen beyond the present and will continue for a period of time.<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> In the sentence, \"She will be walking home,\" the [[verb phrase]] \"will be walking\" is in the future continuous tense because the action described is not happening now, but will happen sometime afterwards and is expected to continue happening for some time. Verbs in the future perfect tense indicate actions that will be completed at a particular point in the future.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Merriam-Webster |title=Present Perfect |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/present%20perfect |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}</ref> For example, the [[verb phrase]], \"will have walked,\" in the sentence, \"She will have walked home,\" is in the future perfect tense because it refers to an action that is completed as of a specific time in the future. Finally, verbs in the future perfect continuous tense combine the features of the perfect and continuous tenses, describing the future status of actions that have been happening continually from now or the past through to a particular time in the future.<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> In the sentence, \"She will have been walking home,\" the verb phrase \"will have been walking\" is in the future perfect continuous tense because it refers to an action that the speaker anticipates will be finished in the future.\n\nAnother way to think of the various future tenses is that actions described by the future tense will be completed at an unspecified time in the future, actions described by the future continuous tense will keep happening in the future, actions described by the future perfect tense will be completed at a specific time in the future, and actions described by the future perfect continuous tense are expected to be continuing as of a specific time in the future.\n\n== Linear and cyclic culture ==\nThe linear view of time (common in [[Western thought]]) draws a stronger distinction between past and future than does the more common [[cyclic time]] of cultures such as India, where past and future can coalesce much more readily.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Ridderbos\n| first1                = Katinka\n| title                 = Time\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=muoM9H8Z8o8C\n| series                = Darwin College Lectures\n| issue                 = 14\n| publisher             = Cambridge University Press\n| publication-date      = 2002\n| page                  = 2\n| isbn                  = 978-0521782937\n| accessdate            = 2015-09-03\n| quote                 = In a cyclic universe, each event that lies in the past of the present moment, also lies in its future. \n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Futures studies==\n[[Image: Stanford Torus interior.jpg|thumb|right|Project of an orbital colony [[Stanford torus]], painted by Donald E. Davis]]\n[[Futures studies]] or futurology is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible, probable, and preferable futures and the worldviews and myths that underlie them. Futures studies seek to understand what is likely to continue, what is likely to change, and what is novel. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to determine the likelihood of future events and trends.  A key part of this process is understanding the potential future impact of decisions made by individuals, organizations, and governments.  Leaders use the results of such work to assist in decision-making.\n\n{{cquote|Take hold of the future or the future will take hold of you.<br>{{mdash}}[[Patrick Dixon]], author of ''[[Futurewise (book)|Futurewise]]''}}\nFutures is an interdisciplinary field, studying yesterday's and today's changes, and aggregating and analyzing both lay and professional strategies, and opinions with respect to tomorrow. It includes analyzing the sources, patterns, and causes of change and stability in the attempt to develop foresight and to map possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.\n\nThree factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines (although all disciplines overlap, to differing degrees). First, futures studies often examines not only possible but also probable, preferable, and \"wild card\" futures. Second, futures studies typically attempts to gain a holistic or systemic view based on insights from a range of different disciplines. Third, futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future. The future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions.\n\nFutures studies do not generally include the work of economists who forecast movements of interest rates over the next business cycle, or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons. Most strategic planning, which develops operational plans for preferred futures with time horizons of one to three years, is also not considered futures. But plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate and be robust to possible future events, are part of a major subdiscipline of futures studies called strategic foresight.\n\nThe futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed supernatural means. At the same time, it does seek to understand the model's such groups use and the interpretations they give to these models.\n\n===Forecasting===\n{{Main|Forecasting}}\nForecasting is the process of [[Estimation|estimating]] outcomes in uncontrolled situations. Forecasting is applied in many areas, such as [[weather forecasting]], [[earthquake prediction]], [[transport planning]], and [[labour market]] planning. Due to the element of the unknown, [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] are central to forecasting.\n\nStatistically based forecasting employs [[time series]] with [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] or [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] data. [[Econometric]] forecasting methods use the assumption that it is possible to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast. If the causes are understood, projections of the influencing variables can be made and used in the forecast. Judgmental forecasting methods incorporate intuitive judgments, opinions, and probability estimates, as in the case of the [[Delphi method]], [[scenario building]], and [[simulation]]s.\n\nPrediction is similar to forecasting but is used more generally, for instance, to also include baseless claims on the future. Organized efforts to [[prediction|predict]] the future began with practices like [[astrology]], [[haruspicy]], and [[augury]]. These are all considered to be [[pseudoscience]] today, evolving from the human desire to know the future in advance.\n\nModern efforts such as [[futures studies]] attempt to predict technological and societal trends, while more ancient practices, such as weather forecasting, have benefited from [[Scientific modeling|scientific]] and [[causal model]]ling. Despite the development of [[cognition|cognitive]] instruments for the comprehension of future, the [[stochastic process|stochastic]] and [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of many natural and social processes has made precise forecasting of the future elusive.\n\n==In art and culture==\n===Futurism===\n<!--\"Wat Phra Dhammakaya#Layout of building complex\" links here -->\n[[Futurism]] as an [[art movement]] originated in [[Italy]] at the beginning of the 20th century. It developed largely in [[Italy]] and in [[Russia]], although it also had adherents in other countries\u2014in England and Portugal for example. The Futurists explored every medium of art, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[architecture]], and even [[gastronomy]]. Futurists had passionate loathing of ideas from the past, especially political and artistic traditions. They also espoused a love of [[speed]], [[technology]], and [[violence]]. Futurists dubbed the love of the past ''[[pass\u00e9isme]]''. The car, the plane, and the industrial town were all legendary for the Futurists because they represented the technological triumph of people over [[nature]].  The ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' of 1909 declared: \"We will glorify war\u2014the world's only hygiene\u2014militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.\"<ref name=\"futurmanifest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/|title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism|publisher=italianfuturism.org (Originally published on [[Le Figaro]], [[Paris]], February 20, 1909)}}</ref>  Though it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to [[political radicalism|radical political movements]], it had little involvement in politics until the autumn of 1913.<ref>Martin, Marianne W., p .186</ref>\n\nFuturism in Classical Music arose during this same time period. Closely identified with the central Italian Futurist movement were brother composers [[Luigi Russolo]] (1885\u20131947) and [[Antonio Russolo]] (1877\u20131942), who used instruments known as ''[[intonarumori]]''\u2014essentially [[sound box]]es used to create music out of noise. Luigi Russolo's futurist manifesto, \"[[The Art of Noises]]\", is considered one of the most important and influential texts in 20th-century musical aesthetics.<ref>{{Harv|Warner|Cox|2004|p=10}}</ref> Other examples of futurist music include [[Arthur Honegger]]'s \"[[Pacific 231]]\" (1923), which imitates the sound of a steam locomotive, [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s \"[[Le pas d'acier (Prokofiev)|The Steel Step]]\" (1926), [[Alexander Mosolov]]'s \"[[Iron Foundry]]\" (1927), and the experiments of [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]].\n\n[[Futurism (literature)|Literary futurism]] made its debut with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|F.T. Marinetti]]'s ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909). Futurist poetry used unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem). Futurist theater works have scenes a few sentences long, use nonsensical humor, and try to discredit the deep-rooted dramatic traditions with parody. Longer literature forms, such as novels, had no place in the Futurist aesthetic, which had an obsession with speed and compression.\n\nFuturism expanded to encompass other artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, [[graphic design]], industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture. In architecture, it featured a distinctive thrust towards [[rationalism]] and [[modernism]] through the use of [[advanced building materials]]. The ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial [[film|cinema]] and [[commercial culture]]. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the 1980s-era literary genre of [[cyberpunk]]\u2014which often treated technology with a critical eye.\n\n===Science fiction===\n[[File:Sortie de l'op\u00e9ra en l'an 2000-2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Print (c. 1902) by [[Albert Robida]] showing a futuristic view of air travel over Paris in the year 2000 as people leave the opera.<ref>{{cite book |title= Science Fiction: Its Nature, Faults and Virtues |booktitle= The Science Fiction Novel: Imagination and Social Criticism |publisher= Advent Publishers |last= Heinlein |first= Robert A. |first2=Cyril |last2=Kornbluth |first3=Alfred |last3=Bester |first4=Robert |last4=Bloch |year= 1959 |location= University of Chicago}}</ref>]]\nMore generally, one can regard [[science fiction]] as a broad genre of [[fiction]] that often involves speculations based on current or future [[science]] or [[technology]]. Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theater, and other media. Science fiction differs from [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though ''some'' elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Settings may include the future, or alternative time-lines, and stories may depict new or speculative scientific principles (such as [[time travel]] or [[psionics]]), or new technology (such as [[nanotechnology]], [[faster-than-light]] travel or [[robot]]s). Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a \"literature of ideas\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n | author = Marg Gilks, Paula Fleming and Moira Allen\n | title = Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas\n | work =\n | publisher =WritingWorld.com\n | year =2003\n | url = http://www.writing-world.com/sf/sf.shtml\n | accessdate = \n}}\n</ref>\n\nSome [[science fiction]] authors construct a postulated [[history]] of the future called a \"[[future history]]\" that provides a common background for their fiction. Sometimes authors publish a [[Chronology|timeline]] of events in their history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information in the books. Some published works constitute \"future history\" in a more literal sense\u2014i.e., stories or whole books written in the style of a history book but describing events in the future. Examples include [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933)\u2014written in the form of a history book published in the year 2106 and in the manner of a real history book with numerous footnotes and references to the works of (mostly fictitious) prominent historians of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [[Alternative future]]\n* [[Divination]]\n* [[List of emerging technologies]]\n* [[Neo-futurism]]\n* [[Prophecy]]\n\n===Future events===\n* [[Future of an expanding universe]]\n* [[Future of the Earth]]\n* [[Future of the Solar System]]\n* [[Timeline of the near future]]\n* [[Timeline of the far future]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Time Topics}}\n{{Science fiction}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Future}}\n[[Category:Future| ]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of time]]\n[[Category:Time]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Near future|near future events|Timeline of the near future}}\n{{Other uses|Future (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Time which has yet to occur}}\n[[File:The Last of the Spirits-John Leech, 1843.jpg|right|175px|thumb|The [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] shows [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] his future in [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.]]\n{{Human history}}\n\nThe '''future''' is the [[time]] after the [[present]]. Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of [[time]] and the [[laws of physics]].  Due to the apparent nature of [[reality]] and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently [[wikt: exist|exists]] and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of religion and ethics''].

Religions consider the future when they address issues such as [[karma]], [[afterlife|life after death]], and [[eschatology|eschatologies]] that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. Religious figures such as [[prophet]]s and [[divination|diviners]] have claimed to see into the future. \nFuture studies, or [[futurology]], is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and [[probability]], versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.\n\nThe concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production, including [[art]] movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation, such as the 20th-century movement [[futurism]].\n\n==Physics==\n[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|A visualization of the future [[light cone]] (at the top), the present, and the past light cone in 2D space.]]\n{{See also|Time in physics}}\nIn physics, time is the fourth dimension. Physicists argue that [[spacetime]] can be understood as a sort of stretchy fabric that bends due to forces such as gravity. In [[classical physics]] the future is just a half of the timeline, which is the same for all observers. In [[special relativity]] the flow of time is relative to the observer's [[frame of reference]]. The faster an observer is traveling away from a reference object, the slower that object seems to move through time. Hence, the future is not an objective notion anymore. A more modern notion is [[absolute future]], or the future [[light cone]]. While a person can move backward or forwards in the three spatial dimensions, many physicists argue you are only able to move forward in time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/technology/070307_time_travel.html|title=You Can't Travel Back in Time, Scientists Say|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nOne of the outcomes of Special Relativity Theory is that a person can travel into the future (but never come back) by traveling at very high speeds. While this effect is negligible under ordinary conditions, space travel at very high speeds can change the flow of time considerably. As depicted in many [[science fiction]] stories and movies (e.g. ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2006 film)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]''), a person traveling for even a short time at near [[light speed]] will return to an Earth that is many years in the future.\n\nSome physicists claim that by using a [[wormhole]] to connect two regions of spacetime a person could theoretically travel in time. Physicist [[Michio Kaku]] points out that to power this hypothetical time machine and \"punch a hole into the fabric of space-time\", it would require the energy of a star. Another theory is that a person could travel in time with [[cosmic string]]s.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"The trouble with the future is that it's so much less knowable than the past.\" \n| source =&nbsp;[[John Lewis Gaddis]], ''The Landscape of History''.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past |last= Gaddis|first= John Lewis|year= 2002|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-19-517157-0|pages= 56}}\n&nbsp;</ref> \n| width  = 27%\n| align  = right\n| style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\nIn the [[philosophy of time]], presentism is the [[belief]] that only the present [[existence|exists]], and the future and [[past]] are [[reality|unreal]]. Past and future \"entities\" are construed as [[logic]]al constructions or [[fictionalism|fictions]]. The opposite of presentism is '[[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]', which is the belief that things in the past and things yet to come exist [[eternity|eternally]]. Another view (not held by many philosophers) is sometimes called the '[[Growing block universe|growing block]]' [[theory]] of time\u2014which postulates that the past and present exist, but the future does not.<ref>{{cite book| last=Broad| first= C.D.| title= Scientific Thought| location=New York| publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Co.| year=1923| url=http://www.ditext.com/broad/st/st-con.html}}</ref>\n\nPresentism is [[wikt: compatible|compatible]] with [[Galilean relativity]], in which time is independent of space, but is probably incompatible with [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]ian/[[Einstein]]ian relativity in conjunction with certain other philosophical [[thesis|theses]] that many find uncontroversial. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] [[Research proposal|proposed]] that the present is a knife edge between the past and the future and could not contain any extended period of time.\n\nContrary to Saint Augustine, some philosophers propose that conscious experience is extended in time.  For instance, [[William James]] said that time is \"...the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  Augustine proposed that God is outside of time and present for all times, in [[eternity]]. Other early philosophers who were presentists include the [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (in the tradition of [[Indian Buddhism]]). A leading scholar from the modern era on [[Buddhist philosophy]] is [[Theodor Ippolitovich Stcherbatsky|Stcherbatsky]], who has written extensively on Buddhist presentism: {{cquote|Everything past is unreal, everything future is unreal, everything imagined, absent, mental... is unreal... Ultimately real is only the present moment of physical [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] [i.e., [[Causality|causation]]].<ref>Vol.1 of ''Buddhist Logic'', 1962, Dover: New York. 70\u201371.</ref>}}\n\n==Psychology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[Human behavior]] is known to encompass anticipation of the future. Anticipatory behavior can be the result of a psychological outlook toward the future, for examples [[optimism]], [[pessimism]], and [[hope]].\n\nOptimism is an outlook on life such that one maintains a view of the world as a positive place. People would say that optimism is seeing the glass \"half full\" of water as opposed to half empty. It is the philosophical opposite of pessimism. Optimists generally believe that people and events are inherently good, so that most situations work out in the end for the best. Hope is a belief in a positive outcome related to events and circumstances in one's life. Hope implies a certain amount of despair, wanting, wishing, suffering or perseverance\u2014i.e., believing that a better or positive outcome is possible even when there is some evidence to the contrary. \"Hopefulness\" is somewhat different from optimism in that hope is an emotional state, whereas optimism is a conclusion reached through a deliberate thought pattern that leads to a positive attitude.\n\n[[Pessimism]] as stated before is the opposite of optimism. It is the tendency to see, anticipate, or emphasize only bad or undesirable outcomes, results, or problems. The word originates in Latin from Pessimus meaning worst and Malus meaning bad.\n\n==Religion==\nReligions consider the future when they address issues such as [[karma]], [[afterlife|life after death]], and [[eschatology|eschatologies]] that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. In religion, major prophets are said to have the power to change the future.  Common religious figures have claimed to see into the future, such as minor [[prophet]]s and [[divination|diviners]].\nThe term \"afterlife\" refers to the continuation of [[existence]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[spirit]] or [[mind]] of a human (or animal) after physical [[death]], typically in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] or [[ghost]]like afterworld. Deceased persons are usually believed to go to a specific region or [[planes of existence|plane of existence]] in this afterworld, often depending on the rightness of their actions during life.\n\nSome believe the afterlife includes some form of preparation for the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to transfer to another body ([[reincarnation]]).\nThe major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]]. There are those who are skeptical of the existence of the afterlife, or believe that it is absolutely impossible, such as the [[materialism|materialist]]-reductionists, who believe that the topic is [[supernatural]], therefore does not really exist or is unknowable. In metaphysical models, [[theists]] generally, believe some sort of afterlife awaits people when they die. [[Atheism|Atheists]] generally do not believe in a life after death. Members of some generally non-theistic religions such as [[Buddhism]], tend to believe in an afterlife like [[reincarnation]] but without reference to [[God]].\n\n[[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] generally hold the position that like the existence of God, the existence of supernatural phenomena, such as souls or life after death, is unverifiable and therefore unknowable.<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic | title=agnositic | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life, with the exception of [[Calvinistic]] variants of [[Protestant]] Christianity, which believes one's status in the afterlife is a gift from God and cannot be earned during life.\n\n[[Eschatology]] is a part of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] concerned with the final events in the [[history of the world]], or the ultimate [[destiny]] of [[All humanity|humanity]], commonly referred to as the end of the world. While in [[mysticism]] the phrase refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine, in many traditional [[religion]]s it is taught as an actual future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or [[folklore]]. More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the [[Messiah]] or [[Messianic Age]], the [[end time]], and the [[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]].\n\n== Grammar ==\nIn [[grammar]], actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past ([[past]], [[Uses of English verb forms#Past progressive|past continuous]], [[past perfect]], or [[past perfect continuous]]), present ([[present]], [[present continuous]], [[present perfect]], or [[present perfect continuous]]), or future (future, [[future continuous]], [[future perfect]], or [[future perfect continuous]]).<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> The future tense refers to actions that have not yet happened, but which are due, expected, or likely to occur in the future.<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> For example, in the sentence, \"She will walk home,\" the verb \"will walk\" is in the future tense because it refers to an action that is going to, or is likely to, happen at a point in time beyond the present.\n\nVerbs in the future continuous tense indicate actions that will happen beyond the present and will continue for a period of time.<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> In the sentence, \"She will be walking home,\" the [[verb phrase]] \"will be walking\" is in the future continuous tense because the action described is not happening now, but will happen sometime afterwards and is expected to continue happening for some time. Verbs in the future perfect tense indicate actions that will be completed at a particular point in the future.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Merriam-Webster |title=Present Perfect |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/present%20perfect |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}</ref> For example, the [[verb phrase]], \"will have walked,\" in the sentence, \"She will have walked home,\" is in the future perfect tense because it refers to an action that is completed as of a specific time in the future. Finally, verbs in the future perfect continuous tense combine the features of the perfect and continuous tenses, describing the future status of actions that have been happening continually from now or the past through to a particular time in the future.<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> In the sentence, \"She will have been walking home,\" the verb phrase \"will have been walking\" is in the future perfect continuous tense because it refers to an action that the speaker anticipates will be finished in the future.\n\nAnother way to think of the various future tenses is that actions described by the future tense will be completed at an unspecified time in the future, actions described by the future continuous tense will keep happening in the future, actions described by the future perfect tense will be completed at a specific time in the future, and actions described by the future perfect continuous tense are expected to be continuing as of a specific time in the future.\n\n== Linear and cyclic culture ==\nThe linear view of time (common in [[Western thought]]) draws a stronger distinction between past and future than does the more common [[cyclic time]] of cultures such as India, where past and future can coalesce much more readily.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Ridderbos\n| first1                = Katinka\n| title                 = Time\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=muoM9H8Z8o8C\n| series                = Darwin College Lectures\n| issue                 = 14\n| publisher             = Cambridge University Press\n| publication-date      = 2002\n| page                  = 2\n| isbn                  = 978-0521782937\n| accessdate            = 2015-09-03\n| quote                 = In a cyclic universe, each event that lies in the past of the present moment, also lies in its future. \n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Futures studies==\n[[Image: Stanford Torus interior.jpg|thumb|right|Project of an orbital colony [[Stanford torus]], painted by Donald E. Davis]]\n[[Futures studies]] or futurology is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible, probable, and preferable futures and the worldviews and myths that underlie them. Futures studies seek to understand what is likely to continue, what is likely to change, and what is novel. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to determine the likelihood of future events and trends.  A key part of this process is understanding the potential future impact of decisions made by individuals, organizations, and governments.  Leaders use the results of such work to assist in decision-making.\n\n{{cquote|Take hold of the future or the future will take hold of you.<br>{{mdash}}[[Patrick Dixon]], author of ''[[Futurewise (book)|Futurewise]]''}}\nFutures is an interdisciplinary field, studying yesterday's and today's changes, and aggregating and analyzing both lay and professional strategies, and opinions with respect to tomorrow. It includes analyzing the sources, patterns, and causes of change and stability in the attempt to develop foresight and to map possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.\n\nThree factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines (although all disciplines overlap, to differing degrees). First, futures studies often examines not only possible but also probable, preferable, and \"wild card\" futures. Second, futures studies typically attempts to gain a holistic or systemic view based on insights from a range of different disciplines. Third, futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future. The future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions.\n\nFutures studies do not generally include the work of economists who forecast movements of interest rates over the next business cycle, or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons. Most strategic planning, which develops operational plans for preferred futures with time horizons of one to three years, is also not considered futures. But plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate and be robust to possible future events, are part of a major subdiscipline of futures studies called strategic foresight.\n\nThe futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed supernatural means. At the same time, it does seek to understand the model's such groups use and the interpretations they give to these models.\n\n===Forecasting===\n{{Main|Forecasting}}\nForecasting is the process of [[Estimation|estimating]] outcomes in uncontrolled situations. Forecasting is applied in many areas, such as [[weather forecasting]], [[earthquake prediction]], [[transport planning]], and [[labour market]] planning. Due to the element of the unknown, [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] are central to forecasting.\n\nStatistically based forecasting employs [[time series]] with [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] or [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] data. [[Econometric]] forecasting methods use the assumption that it is possible to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast. If the causes are understood, projections of the influencing variables can be made and used in the forecast. Judgmental forecasting methods incorporate intuitive judgments, opinions, and probability estimates, as in the case of the [[Delphi method]], [[scenario building]], and [[simulation]]s.\n\nPrediction is similar to forecasting but is used more generally, for instance, to also include baseless claims on the future. Organized efforts to [[prediction|predict]] the future began with practices like [[astrology]], [[haruspicy]], and [[augury]]. These are all considered to be [[pseudoscience]] today, evolving from the human desire to know the future in advance.\n\nModern efforts such as [[futures studies]] attempt to predict technological and societal trends, while more ancient practices, such as weather forecasting, have benefited from [[Scientific modeling|scientific]] and [[causal model]]ling. Despite the development of [[cognition|cognitive]] instruments for the comprehension of future, the [[stochastic process|stochastic]] and [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of many natural and social processes has made precise forecasting of the future elusive.\n\n==In art and culture==\n===Futurism===\n<!--\"Wat Phra Dhammakaya#Layout of building complex\" links here -->\n[[Futurism]] as an [[art movement]] originated in [[Italy]] at the beginning of the 20th century. It developed largely in [[Italy]] and in [[Russia]], although it also had adherents in other countries\u2014in England and Portugal for example. The Futurists explored every medium of art, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[architecture]], and even [[gastronomy]]. Futurists had passionate loathing of ideas from the past, especially political and artistic traditions. They also espoused a love of [[speed]], [[technology]], and [[violence]]. Futurists dubbed the love of the past ''[[pass\u00e9isme]]''. The car, the plane, and the industrial town were all legendary for the Futurists because they represented the technological triumph of people over [[nature]].  The ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' of 1909 declared: \"We will glorify war\u2014the world's only hygiene\u2014militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.\"<ref name=\"futurmanifest\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/|title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism|publisher=italianfuturism.org (Originally published on [[Le Figaro]], [[Paris]], February 20, 1909)}}</ref>  Though it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to [[political radicalism|radical political movements]], it had little involvement in politics until the autumn of 1913.<ref>Martin, Marianne W., p .186</ref>\n\nFuturism in Classical Music arose during this same time period. Closely identified with the central Italian Futurist movement were brother composers [[Luigi Russolo]] (1885\u20131947) and [[Antonio Russolo]] (1877\u20131942), who used instruments known as ''[[intonarumori]]''\u2014essentially [[sound box]]es used to create music out of noise. Luigi Russolo's futurist manifesto, \"[[The Art of Noises]]\", is considered one of the most important and influential texts in 20th-century musical aesthetics.<ref>{{Harv|Warner|Cox|2004|p=10}}</ref> Other examples of futurist music include [[Arthur Honegger]]'s \"[[Pacific 231]]\" (1923), which imitates the sound of a steam locomotive, [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s \"[[Le pas d'acier (Prokofiev)|The Steel Step]]\" (1926), [[Alexander Mosolov]]'s \"[[Iron Foundry]]\" (1927), and the experiments of [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]].\n\n[[Futurism (literature)|Literary futurism]] made its debut with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|F.T. Marinetti]]'s ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909). Futurist poetry used unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem). Futurist theater works have scenes a few sentences long, use nonsensical humor, and try to discredit the deep-rooted dramatic traditions with parody. Longer literature forms, such as novels, had no place in the Futurist aesthetic, which had an obsession with speed and compression.\n\nFuturism expanded to encompass other artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, [[graphic design]], industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture. In architecture, it featured a distinctive thrust towards [[rationalism]] and [[modernism]] through the use of [[advanced building materials]]. The ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial [[film|cinema]] and [[commercial culture]]. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the 1980s-era literary genre of [[cyberpunk]]\u2014which often treated technology with a critical eye.\n\n===Science fiction===\n[[File:Sortie de l'op\u00e9ra en l'an 2000-2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Print (c. 1902) by [[Albert Robida]] showing a futuristic view of air travel over Paris in the year 2000 as people leave the opera.<ref>{{cite book |title= Science Fiction: Its Nature, Faults and Virtues |booktitle= The Science Fiction Novel: Imagination and Social Criticism |publisher= Advent Publishers |last= Heinlein |first= Robert A. |first2=Cyril |last2=Kornbluth |first3=Alfred |last3=Bester |first4=Robert |last4=Bloch |year= 1959 |location= University of Chicago}}</ref>]]\nMore generally, one can regard [[science fiction]] as a broad genre of [[fiction]] that often involves speculations based on current or future [[science]] or [[technology]]. Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theater, and other media. Science fiction differs from [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though ''some'' elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Settings may include the future, or alternative time-lines, and stories may depict new or speculative scientific principles (such as [[time travel]] or [[psionics]]), or new technology (such as [[nanotechnology]], [[faster-than-light]] travel or [[robot]]s). Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a \"literature of ideas\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n | author = Marg Gilks, Paula Fleming and Moira Allen\n | title = Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas\n | work =\n | publisher =WritingWorld.com\n | year =2003\n | url = http://www.writing-world.com/sf/sf.shtml\n | accessdate = \n}}\n</ref>\n\nSome [[science fiction]] authors construct a postulated [[history]] of the future called a \"[[future history]]\" that provides a common background for their fiction. Sometimes authors publish a [[Chronology|timeline]] of events in their history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information in the books. Some published works constitute \"future history\" in a more literal sense\u2014i.e., stories or whole books written in the style of a history book but describing events in the future. Examples include [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933)\u2014written in the form of a history book published in the year 2106 and in the manner of a real history book with numerous footnotes and references to the works of (mostly fictitious) prominent historians of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [[Alternative future]]\n* [[Divination]]\n* [[List of emerging technologies]]\n* [[Neo-futurism]]\n* [[Prophecy]]\n\n===Future events===\n* [[Future of an expanding universe]]\n* [[Future of the Earth]]\n* [[Future of the Solar System]]\n* [[Timeline of the near future]]\n* [[Timeline of the far future]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Time Topics}}\n{{Science fiction}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Future}}\n[[Category:Future| ]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of time]]\n[[Category:Time]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:6f40:4bf0:f8c8:44f5:b3bf:9471", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePhysics)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future"}

This was British Columbia's third referendum on electoral reform since 2005.\n\nVoters were asked two questions: first, what electoral system should be used to determine election results\u2014the existing [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP) system or a [[proportional representation]] (PR) system; and second, what type of proportional voting system should be used if PR is chosen. In the second question, voters were asked to rank three proportional representation voting systems: [[dual-member proportional representation]], [[mixed-member proportional representation]], and [[rural\u2013urban proportional representation]].\n\nThe referendum fulfilled an election commitment by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] (NDP) during the 2017 election. Their platform promised a referendum and that the government would actively campaign for electoral reform.\n\nResults were released by [[Elections BC]] on December 20, 2018. British Columbians voted in favour of maintaining the first-past-the-post voting system rather than switching to a proportional representation voting system.\n\n==Background==\nBC has a long history of changing its electoral system. For BC's first election in 1871, the majority of ridings were elected using an \"at large\" system.

This was British Columbia's third referendum on electoral reform since 2005.\n\nVoters were asked two questions: first, what electoral system should be used to determine election results\u2014the existing [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP) system or a [[proportional representation]] (PR) system; and second, what type of proportional voting system should be used if PR is chosen. In the second question, voters were asked to rank three proportional representation voting systems: [[dual-member proportional representation]], [[mixed-member proportional representation]], and [[rural\u2013urban proportional representation]].\n\nThe referendum fulfilled an election commitment by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] (NDP) during the 2017 election. Their platform promised a referendum and that the government would actively campaign for electoral reform.\n\nResults were released by [[Elections BC]] on December 20, 2018. British Columbians voted in favour of maintaining the first-past-the-post voting system rather than switching to a proportional representation voting system.\n\n==Background==\nBC has a long history of changing its electoral system. For BC's first election in 1871, the majority of ridings were elected using an \"at large\" system. This is the way city councillors are elected in BC to this day: a voter gets as many votes as there were people to be elected in the riding.<ref name=1871-1986>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC|Elections British Columbia]] |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871\u20131986 |date=1988 |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613200446/http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf# |archive-date=13 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOver its history, BC modified its electoral system at least 15 times without a referendum.<ref name=1871-1986 /> It previously used an [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative voting system]] in the [[1952 British Columbia general election|1952 provincial election]] before abolishing it and reestablishing the previous mix of \"at large\" and first-past-the-post.<ref name=\"pdennis\">{{Cite book |title=The politics of voting : reforming Canada's electoral system |last=Pilon |first=Dennis |date=2007 |publisher=Emond Montgomery Publications |isbn=9781552392362 |location=Toronto |oclc=150223313}}</ref>{{rp|81\u201382}}<ref>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC|Elections British Columbia]] |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871\u20131986 |date=1988 |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf |access-date=21 June 2018 |pages=231\u2013232 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613200446/http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf# |archive-date=13 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first BC election done entirely under first-past-the-post came in 1991, after the last \"at-large\" voting districts had been abolished.<ref name=\"pdennis\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC]] |title=Electoral History of B.C. |date=2018 |url=http://elections.bc.ca/resources/learning-about-elections/electoral-history-of-bc/ |access-date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626030841/http://elections.bc.ca/resources/learning-about-elections/electoral-history-of-bc/# |archive-date=26 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The multi-member at-large ridings were abolished after the 1986 election due to a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that found them unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC]] |title=Electoral History of B.C. |date=2018 |url=http://elections.bc.ca/resources/learning-about-elections/electoral-history-of-bc/}}</ref>\n\n\n===Previous referendums===\nBefore the [[2001 British Columbia general election|2001 provincial election]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal Party]] committed to appoint a [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|Citizens' Assembly]] to investigate electoral reform, hold consultations, and prepare a report recommending whether a different [[electoral system]] should be adopted.<ref name=CAReport>{{cite web |title=Making Every Vote Count: The Case for Electoral Reform in British Columbia |url=http://www.citizensassembly.bc.ca:80/resources/final_report.pdf |date=December 2004 |access-date=15 June 2018 |author=[[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|British Columbia Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform]] |publisher=Government of British Columbia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513192722/http://www.citizensassembly.bc.ca/resources/final_report.pdf# |archive-date=13 May 2005}}</ref> The commitment was driven in part by the anomalous provincial election result in [[1996 British Columbia general election|1996]], in which the BC New Democratic Party won reelection as a majority government with 39.5% of the vote and 39 seats, despite gaining a 3% smaller share of the popular vote than the Liberals at 41.8%, which translated into 33 Liberal seats.<ref name=\"pdennis\"/>{{rp|90\u201391}} In December 2004, the Assembly released its report recommending that the province adopt [[BC-STV]], a BC-specific variant of the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system.<ref name=CAReport /> On May 17, 2005, a [[2005 British Columbia electoral reform referendum|referendum]] was held in conjunction with the [[2005 British Columbia general election|2005 general election]], in which voters were asked whether the province should adopt the recommendation of the Assembly to replace the first-past-the-post electoral system with BC-STV, or maintain the current system.

This structure remained in place until the partitioning in 1791 of the Province of Quebec into [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], which then each had an office of lieutenant governor, though both posts were occupied by the incumbent [[Governor General of the Province of Canada]].\n\nIn 1867, confederation created a new entity of four provinces, each with their respective viceregal posts; as per the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' passed that year, the stations of [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick]] continued essentially as before,<ref>{{Harvnb|Victoria|1867|loc=V.64}}</ref> while those of [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec]] were created to replace the viceregal offices of [[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]].<ref name=\"VictoriaV63\" /> Thereafter, when other colonies joined this grouping of provinces, their governors became lieutenant governors,{{#tag:ref|The [[List of Governors of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|Governor of the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia]] became in 1871, through an [[Order in Council]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]];<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| date=16 May 1871| title=British Columbia Terms of Union| series=10| location=Westminster| publisher=[[Queen's Printer]]| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/bctu.html| accessdate=16 June 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> the [[List of lieutenant governors of Prince Edward Island#Governors|Governors of Prince Edward Island]] became in 1873, by Order in Council of the Queen, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island]];<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| date=26 June 1873| title=Prince Edward Island Terms of Union| series=Schedule| location=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/peitu.html| accessdate=16 June 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> and the [[List of lieutenant governors of Newfoundland and Labrador#Commission Governors|Commission Governor of Newfoundland]] became in 1949, through the ''[[Newfoundland Act]]'', the [[Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador|Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last=George VI| author-link=George VI of the United Kingdom| date=23 March 1949| title=Newfoundland Act| series=8.1| location=Ottawa| publisher=King's Printer for Canada| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/nfa.html| accessdate=16 June 2009| ref=harv}}</ref>|group=n|name=LGs1}} while the creation of new provinces out of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Northwest Territories]]\u2014which each had [[List of lieutenant governors of the Northwest Territories|their own lieutenant governors]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/lt-gov/nwt.htm|title=Public Information > Lieutenant Governors > The Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories|last=Legislative Assembly of Alberta|publisher=Queen's Printer for Alberta|accessdate=23 June 2009}}</ref>\u2014led to the establishment of new viceregal posts.{{#tag:ref|The office of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba]] was created in 1870 by the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'',<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| date=12 May 1870| title=Manitoba Act, 1870| series=6| location=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ma_1870.html| accessdate=16 June 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> the office of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]] was created in 1905 by the ''[[Alberta Act]]'',<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Edward VII| author-link=Edward VII of the United Kingdom| date=20 July 1905| title=Alberta Act| series=10| location=Westminster| publisher=King's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html| accessdate=16 June 2009| ref=harv}}</ref> and the office of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan]] was created in 1905 by the ''[[Saskatchewan Act]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Edward VII| author-link=Edward VII of the United Kingdom| date=20 July 1905| title=Saskatchewan Act| series=10| location=Westminster| publisher=King's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/sa_1905.html| accessdate=16 June 2009| ref=harv}}</ref>|group=n|name=LGs2}}\n\nBeginning immediately after confederation, the [[Dominion]] government and the [[Colonial Office]] in [[London]] considered the lieutenant governors as representatives of, and subordinate to, the governor general in [[Ottawa]], reflecting the view of [[John A.
