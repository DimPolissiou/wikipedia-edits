By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now.

According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=December 11, 2018}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.tamilrockerskannada.com/2020/04/extraction-movie-extraction-netflix-Extraction-Movie-Review-.html}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the media service}}\n{{short description|Internet video streaming and DVD-by-mail service with original and licensed content}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox dot-com company\n| name = Netflix, Inc.\n| logo = [[File:Netflix 2015 logo.svg|frameless|upright]]\n| screenshot =Netflix -

The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\n\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=December 11, 2018}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:50a6:de51:38ea:43d3:4128:c78", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFurther reading)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}

It is a historical [[house]] of [[Brahmanpara Upazila]] in [[Comilla District]] of [[Bangladesh]]. The southern Tetabhumi of his descendants is known as \"Nazar Mahmud Bhuiyan's descendants\". He came from the then Lohagarh-Pargana, now Kalpash Brammanpara Bhuiyan Bari, and bought land from the owner of Zamindar Tareq Chowdhury's '''North Tetabhumi Zamindar Bari''' and settled there which belongs to Shashidal Union.\n\n\n\n==History==\nThis historic house was established by Nazar Mahmud Bhuiyan. Which is located in Brahmanpara Upazila of Comilla. Nazar Mahmud Bhuiyan, There were 4 brothers, Sugar Mahmud Bhuiyan, Sunny Mahmud Bhuiyan, Kabir Mahmud Bhuiyan. Nazar Mahmud Bhuiyan was a descendant of the Bara Bhuiyans of Bengal but no Bhuiyan could confirm this. He is probably a descendant of [[Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah]] and, according to many, a descendant of [[Isa Khan]]. Many people have this idea because of the marriage of the daughter of [[Isa Khan]], [[Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah]]. At present Kalpash is still known as Bhuiyan Bari in Brahmanpara. This Bhuiyan dynasty is still spread in [[Comilla]], [[Brahmanbaria]], [[Kishoreganj]] areas. However, the principle of hereditary customs is now extinct.\n\n==A series of descriptions of the descendants of Nazar Mahmud Bhuiyan==\n\n- [x] Nazar Mahmud Bhuiyan\n Nazar Mahmud Bhuiyan's five sons\n** Sony Uddin * ** Jony Uddin * ** Sadar Uddin * ** Kadar Uddin * ** Aftab Uddin *\n1.

Contributors included Scott Angus, Mark Rakocy, Dennis Carleton, Jamie Barbour, Ray Portler, the rap act Dark Side, and [[Christopher Robichaud]].  Douglas coined the term ''cine-fusion'' to describe the album. ''Cine-fusion'' is described in the album's liner notes as\n:\"a blending of [[film score|movie soundtrack music]] and [[pop music]]&nbsp;... a compilation of soundtracks to movies that do not exist.  The goal of the music is to stimulate the imaginations of listeners so that they are able to transport themselves to worlds or movies of their own creation.\"\nMusically, the album contained an eclectic blend of styles including everything from dark instrumental music (of which three tracks appeared on future releases), [[Rock music|rock]],<ref name=\"music extreme\">[http://www.musicextreme.com/midnight.htm Interview with Gavin Goszka], Federico Marongiu, \"Midnight Syndicate\", ''Music Extreme'' (Argentina), 2001.</ref> [[Rock-a-Billy|rock-a-billy]], [[techno music|techno]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[New-age music|new-age]], [[Black comedy#Musicians|humor-pop]], [[jazz]], and [[Space music|space]].

Douglas coined the term ''cine-fusion'' to describe the album. ''Cine-fusion'' is described in the album's liner notes as\n:\"a blending of [[film score|movie soundtrack music]] and [[pop music]]&nbsp;... a compilation of soundtracks to movies that do not exist.  The goal of the music is to stimulate the imaginations of listeners so that they are able to transport themselves to worlds or movies of their own creation.\"\nMusically, the album contained an eclectic blend of styles including everything from dark instrumental music (of which three tracks appeared on future releases), [[Rock music|rock]],<ref name=\"music extreme\">[http://www.musicextreme.com/midnight.htm Interview with Gavin Goszka], Federico Marongiu, \"Midnight Syndicate\", ''Music Extreme'' (Argentina), 2001.</ref> [[Rock-a-Billy|rock-a-billy]], [[techno music|techno]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[New-age music|new-age]], [[Black comedy#Musicians|humor-pop]], [[jazz]], and [[Space music|space]].

Douglas and Goszka wrote and performed the music on the album while Vargo served as [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] and [[creative director]] of the project, as well as writing and performing the vocals and narrations, and designing the cover art and packaging. The album and songs were also titled after several of Vargo's most popular paintings. ''[[Born of the Night]]'' was independently released in September 1998 through Vargo's Monolith Graphics and Douglas' Entity Productions, hitting the horror market just in time for the Halloween season. It was Midnight Syndicate's first critically acclaimed gothic-horror soundtrack and proved to be an instant success,<ref>John Soeder, \"Gothic Horror Rock Featured This Weekend\", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (Cleveland, OH), March 2, 2000.</ref> establishing Midnight Syndicate's trademark sound.\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Realm of Shadows]]'' followed suit with the same flavor of dark instrumental music and another gothic setting. Douglas and Goszka wrote all of the music for this album while Vargo wrote and performed the opening narration and theme story. Again, the songs were titled after Vargo's artworks.

Logan]]<br>[[Joseph Hooker]]\n|anniversaries=\n}}\nThe '''Army of the Tennessee''' was a [[Union Army|Union]] army in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] of the [[American Civil War]], named for the [[Tennessee River]].\n\nIt appears that the term \"Army of the Tennessee\" was first used within the Union Army in March 1862, to describe Union forces perhaps more properly described as the \"Army of West Tennessee\"; these were the troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the Union's District of West Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', pp. 856\u201357; McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512.</ref> In April 1862, Grant's troops survived a severe test in the bloody [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Then, during six months marked by discouragement and anxiety for Grant, his army first joined with two other Union armies to prosecute the relatively bloodless [[Siege of Corinth]] and then strained to hold Union positions in Tennessee and Mississippi. In October 1862, Grant's command was reconfigured and elevated to departmental status, as the Department of the Tennessee; the title of his command was thus officially aligned with that of his army.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> Grant commanded these forces until after his critically important victory at [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] on July 4, 1863. Under other generals, starting with [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], the army marched and fought from the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], through the [[Siege of Knoxville|Relief of Knoxville]], the [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian Campaign]], the [[Atlanta Campaign]], the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]], the [[Carolinas Campaign]], and to the end of the war and disbandment. This article also discusses Grant's 1861\u20131862 commands \u2013 the District of Southeast Missouri and the District of Cairo \u2013 because the troops Grant led in the [[Battle of Belmont]] and the [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]]-[[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] campaign during that period became the nucleus of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref>\n\nA 2005 study of the army states that it \"was present at most of the great battles that became turning points of the war\u2014Fort Donelson, Vicksburg, and Atlanta\" and \"won the decisive battles in the decisive theater of the war.\"<ref name=\"Woodworth, Victory, p. ix\">Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix.</ref> More poetically, in 1867, apparently speaking of the Atlanta campaign, General Sherman said that the Army of the Tennessee was \"never checked\u2014always victorious; so rapid in motion\u2014so eager to strike; it deserved its name of the 'Whip-lash,' swung from one flank to the other, as danger called, night or day, sunshine or storm.\"<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/11/17/80252662.pdf NYT: General Sherman's November 13, 1867 Address to the Society of the Army of the Tennessee]; see Lewis, ''Sherman'', p. 381.</ref>\n\n==History==\nHistory remembers the Army of the Tennessee as one of the most important Union armies during the Civil War, an army intimately associated with the Union's two most celebrated generals, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix; Flood, ''Friendship'', pp. 4\u20136.</ref> It is thus rather ironic that frequent military reorganizations and looseness of usage during the war itself make it difficult to pinpoint the exact date at which this army formally came into existence. It should suffice to note that the \"nucleus [of troops] around which was to gather the... Army of the Tennessee\" first took shape in 1861\u20131862, while Grant was headquartered at [[Cairo, Illinois]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 27\u201328.</ref> Those troops continued under Grant in his next command, the distinct District of West Tennessee; they were then sometimes, and perhaps most appropriately, called the \"Army of West Tennessee.\"<ref>That usage appears, for example, in reports filed by various Union officers after the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh (''Official Records'' (''OR'') I, v. 10/1, pp. 165, 203, 240, 277, 280, 282, 284, 286\u201387) and can be found as late as October 1862 (Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Davies, October 18, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 17/1, p. 251). During the period September 28 \u2013 December 9, 1862, there was also a Confederate Army of West Tennessee, organized from the Confederate [[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]] and commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]]. Confederate authorities ruled that \"the name and function of this army [were] improper,\" and Van Dorn's forces were merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]]. See Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 892.</ref> However, army correspondence began using the term \"Army of the Tennessee\" in March 1862; that term soon became commonplace and naturally lived on when Grant's command was elevated to departmental status in October 1862, as the Department of the Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 857; see Halleck to Pope, March 21, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 8, p. 629 (\"I am preparing additional re-enforcements for the Army of the Tennessee\"); Phisterer, ''Statistical Record'', p. 54 (Grant's forces fought at Shiloh (April 1862) as \"the Army of the District of Western Tennessee\" and \"became the Army of the Tennessee upon the [post-Shiloh] concentration of troops at Pittsburg Landing\"); McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> During the course of the war, elements of the Army of the Tennessee performed many tasks, and the army evolved with the addition and subtraction of many units. It is not feasible to chronicle every such development here, even at the [[corps]] level. Rather, this article traces the main thrust of the army's development and its most memorable activities. At any given time, substantial numbers of troops were engaged in activities not discussed here. For example, in April 1863, less than half of Grant's departmental strength was directly engaged in the Vicksburg Campaign.<ref name=\"OR I, v. 24/3, p. 249\">See Departmental returns for April 30, 1863, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0038%2F&tif=00251.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0038 ''OR'' I, v. 24/3, p. 249].</ref>\n\n===Cairo and the Battle of Belmont===\n{{See also|Belmont Union order of battle}}\n[[File:U.S. Grant and staff.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Brigadier General Grant and staff, Cairo, October 1861]]\nIn September 1861, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] Ulysses S. Grant, then subordinate to Maj. Gen. [[John Fremont]] in the Union's [[Western Department]], assumed command of the District of Southeast Missouri; Grant established his headquarters at [[Cairo, Illinois]].<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 264; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 174.</ref> One of Grant's wartime aides, [[John A. Rawlins]], later stated that \"[f]rom this time... commenced the growth and organization of the Army of the Tennessee.\"<ref>John A. Rawlins, Address, Proceedings of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee.</ref> Just days later, prompted by Confederate occupation of [[Columbus, Kentucky]], on the [[Mississippi River]], Grant led a small force to seize [[Paducah, Kentucky]], where the [[Tennessee River]] joins the [[Ohio River]]; Grant thus forestalled a Confederate effort to occupy the strategically important town. Paducah promptly became a separate Union command under Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]], who soon occupied [[Smithland, Kentucky]], at the junction of the [[Cumberland River]] and the Ohio.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 118\u201321.</ref>\n\nAccording to Rawlins, the \"first affair dignified by the name of a battle\" for any of Grant's forces occurred at [[Battle of Fredericktown|Fredericktown, Missouri]], where some of Grant's troops helped defeat Confederate forces under [[M. Jeff Thompson]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, p. 27; Conger, ''U.S. Grant'', pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Grant's own first engagement came on November 7 at Belmont, Missouri, a Mississippi River landing opposite Columbus, Kentucky. Grant, accompanied by Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], moved a force of approximately 3,000 to Belmont by water, cut his way into the Confederate camps there, and then had to fight his way back out to regain his transports. Grant's casualties in this first battle totaled about 500; Confederate casualties were similar. While Grant had suffered a repulse, he won favorable press coverage.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 124\u201332.</ref> This battle, reports Rawlins, \"confirmed General Grant in his views\" that he should \"give battle\" whenever \"he had what he thought a sufficient number of men.\"<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> Also in November, John Fremont lost his command at St. Louis, to be replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], whose command was designated the [[Department of the Missouri]].<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 134; Ballard, ''Grant'', pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n===Henry-Donelson Campaign===\n{{See also|Fort Donelson Union order of battle}}\nOn December 20, Grant's command was reconfigured to include C.F. Smith's and renamed the District of Cairo.<ref>See Special Orders, No. 78, HQ, Dept. of the Missouri, December 20, 1861, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0109%2F&tif=00209.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0109 ''OR'' I, v. 52/1, p. 201]; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 189. It appears that Grant formally assumed this new command as of December 23, 1861. See Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 264; General Orders No. 22, HQ, Dist. of Cairo, December 23, 1861, ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 3:330.</ref> From that perch, in February 1862, Grant led the Union campaign against Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]], on the Cumberland River.<ref>For detailed discussion of the Henry-Donelson campaign, see Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 65\u2013120.</ref> His troops for this campaign eventually numbered approximately 27,000 men, divided into three divisions commanded, respectively, by John McClernand (1st Division), C.F. Smith (2nd), and Brig. Gen.

Grant'', 4:230.</ref> Over the next several months, Grant twice was in danger of losing his command, a development that doubtless would have changed the future course and character of the army and perhaps deprived it at this early stage of one source of its future success\u2014continuity of leadership.<ref>The leadership of the Army of the Tennessee was notably more stable than that of the Union's [[Army of the Potomac]]. The latter suffered the relief of several failed commanders: [[Irwin McDowell|McDowell]] (predecessor force), [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], [[Ambrose E. Burnside|Burnside]], and [[Joseph Hooker|Hooker]]. There was no equally destabilizing event in the life of the Army of the Tennessee, although Grant could have fallen by the wayside in 1862 and some dislocation followed the death of [[James B. McPherson]] in 1864. Further, as Grant and Sherman in turn ascended to broader responsibilities, the Army of the Tennessee enjoyed virtually seamless transitions from Grant to Sherman (1863) and from Sherman to McPherson (1864). See Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 216, 420, 460, 490, 569\u201371; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 232\u201333.</ref>\n\nIn early March, Grant's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], then in command of the Department of the Missouri, assigned Grant to lead an expedition up the Tennessee River from the recently captured Fort Henry. On March 4, however, Halleck ordered Grant to give field command of the expedition to C.F. Smith; this order has been variously attributed to professional jealousy and to Halleck's lacking confidence in Grant due to certain administrative difficulties.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 219\u201320; Ballard, ''Grant'', pp. 40\u201343; Engle, ''Heartland'', pp. 105\u201306; Marszalek, ''Halleck'', pp. 116\u201320; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 128\u201332.</ref> Smith initially established the expedition at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], a town on the east side of the river approximately 100 river miles (160&nbsp;km) south of Fort Henry. He soon began staging troops at a point\u2014[[Pittsburg Landing]]\u2014nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further south and across the river.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref> Meanwhile, Halleck's command was enlarged and renamed the [[Department of the Mississippi]], and Halleck restored Grant to field command, perhaps because of personal intervention by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Many authors see presidential pressure behind Grant's reinstatement to field command. See, e.g., Simpson, ''Triumph'', pp. 124\u201325; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 141\u201342. But there is room to question that conclusion. Halleck relieved Grant of field command of the expedition, but not his overall command, on March 4 (''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 3). On March 9 and 10, Halleck advised Grant to prepare himself to take the field. On March 10, the President and Secretary of War inquired about Grant's status, and on March 13, Halleck directed Grant to take the field. See Halleck to Grant, March 9, 10, 13, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, pp. 22, 27, 32; Thomas to Halleck, March 10, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 7, p. 683. This sequence suggests that Halleck may have decided to restore Grant to field command before receiving Lincoln's inquiry. See Smith, ''Grant'', p. 176: Halleck's \"reinstatement of Grant preceded by one day the bombshell that landed on his desk from the adjutant general [on behalf of the President and Secretary of War] in Washington.\"</ref> Grant joined his army in the field on March 17.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 179.</ref> By early April, Grant's army had grown to a total of roughly 50,000 men, organized into six divisions.<ref>Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322.</ref> The three new divisions were commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]] (4th Division), Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman (5th), and Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin M. Prentiss]] (6th). In addition, Brig. Gen. [[W.H.L. Wallace]] took command of Smith's 2nd Division due to the latter's having suffered a debilitating leg injury.<ref>See Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322; Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 226\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Shiloh - History of Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|300px|Shiloh: Crucible of the Army of the Tennessee]]\nOn April 6\u20137, Grant's forces fought the bloodiest battle of the Civil War to that time, the [[Battle of Shiloh]], when Confederate forces advanced largely undetected from [[Corinth, Mississippi]], and attacked the five Union divisions staged at Pittsburg Landing. On the first day of the battle, the surprised and unentrenched army fought desperately and suffered many casualties. However, long-expected elements of the [[Army of the Ohio]], under Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]], arrived to reinforce Grant late that day, with many more troops arriving overnight and the following day. Grant was also bolstered by the evening arrival of his own 3rd Division; Lew Wallace and his troops had been slow arriving at Pittsburg Landing from their separate position at Crump's Landing. Substantially reinforced by Buell and Wallace, Grant counterattacked the Confederate forces on April 7 and drove them from the field and back toward Corinth.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 187\u2013204.</ref>  \"Grant's victory at Shiloh,\" one historian has written, \"bloody and bitter though it was, doomed the Confederate cause in the Mississippi valley.\"<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 204.</ref> In the near term, however, the battle resulted in much criticism against Grant for lack of preparedness, swift promotion to major general of volunteers for Sherman, capture for Prentiss, a fatal wound for W.H.L. Wallace, and Grant's loss of confidence in Lew Wallace. In addition, C.F. Smith died later in April from complications due to his non-combat leg injury.<ref>For the varying impact of Shiloh on these officers, see Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 183\u201384, 198\u201399, 201; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 182; Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 493.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Shiloh came the second threat to Grant's leadership, as well as a preview of the multi-army operations that would feature prominently in the future of the Army of the Tennessee. Pursuant to previous plans, Grant's departmental superior, General Halleck, arrived at Pittsburg Landing to take command in the field. Intending to move against the Confederate forces concentrating at the rail hub at Corinth, Halleck proceeded to gather and organize what was in effect an army group of over 100,000 men.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 205\u201306; Ambrose, ''Halleck'', pp. 43\u201349.</ref> His force included Grant's Army of the Tennessee, Buell's Army of the Ohio, and Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of the Mississippi]]. On April 30, Halleck divided this force into three corps (or \"wings\") and a reserve. The left wing was commanded by Pope, the center by Buell, the right wing by Maj. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]], and the reserve by John McClernand. Grant's 1st and 3rd Divisions constituted the reserve; the right wing contained Grant's 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions and Thomas's division from the Army of the Ohio. In other words, Halleck had drawn Thomas from division command in the Army of the Ohio and assigned to him, as commander of the right wing, most of Grant's troops.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 248; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 206.</ref>\n\nHalleck assigned Grant to be second-in-command of the entire 100,000-man force, but also expressly confirmed Grant in command of the \"Army Corps of the Tennessee\" (the right wing and the reserve).<ref>See Special Field Orders, No. 35, HQ, Dept. of the Mississippi, April 30, 1862, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0011%2F&tif=00146.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0011 ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 144].</ref> It is unclear exactly why Halleck took these actions affecting Grant.<ref>See Nicolay, ''Lincoln'', 5:338.</ref> However, Grant was under severe public criticism about Shiloh at the time and soon complained that his second-in-command position constituted a \"sensure\" and was akin to an arrest; among his complaints was the fact that Halleck gave orders directly to Thomas and division commanders nominally subordinate to Grant.<ref>On May 11, Grant wrote Halleck privately that he considered his second-in-command assignment to be \"anomylous,\" to constitute a \"sensure,\" and to put him in a position that \"differs but little from that of one in arrest.\" ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 5:114; see Smith, ''Grant'', p. 209.</ref> With this awkward command structure, embarrassing to Grant, Halleck's forces took the entire month of May, with constant entrenchments, to advance the twenty miles [32&nbsp;km] to Corinth. This Siege of Corinth culminated with the Confederate forces abandoning the town on the night of May 29\u201330.<ref>Marszalek, ''Halleck'', pp. 123\u201326.</ref> Grant later suggested that Halleck failed to accomplish all that he should have in this campaign and its aftermath.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 255\u201357.</ref> However, William Tecumseh Sherman, commanding a division in Thomas's right wing, considered the campaign to be an important period of training for Halleck's forces, including the Army of the Tennessee: \"[I]t served for the instruction of our men in guard and picket duty, and in habituating them to out-door life; and by the time we had reached Corinth I believe that army was the best then on this continent.\"<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 274.</ref>\n\nAfter Corinth was taken, Grant might have left his command in frustration, but Sherman intervened and encouraged him to remain.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 207\u201312; Schenker, \"Ulysses in His Tent,\" passim; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 258; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 275\u201376.</ref> Grant's experiences during this period have been cited as one reason for his subsequent warm relations with Sherman and his cooler relations with George Thomas.<ref>Daniel, ''Shiloh'', pp. 309\u201310; Einolf, ''Thomas'', pp. 126\u201327.</ref> In turn, the trust between Grant and Sherman contributed importantly to the future effectiveness of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 420.</ref> More immediately, however, Halleck soon rescinded the multi-corps organization adopted for the Corinth campaign and began to disperse his large force. On June 10, Halleck restored Grant to straightforward command of the \"Army of the Tennessee\"; Buell was dispatched toward [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]; and, by incremental stages, George Thomas and his division were detached from the Army of the Tennessee and returned to service with Buell's army.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 213\u201314; Einolf, ''Thomas'', pp. 128\u201329; Special Field Orders, No. 90, HQ, Dept. of the Mississippi, June 10, 1862, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0011&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0011%2F&tif=00146.TIF&pagenum=288 ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 288]; Halleck to Buell, June 22, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 16/2, pp. 48\u201349 (\"General Thomas has orders to report to you, but at present his division should not be moved beyond Tuscumbia [Alabama]\"); Halleck to Buell, July 15, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 16/2, p. 151 (\"Thomas ...

Hence, McClernand's briefly independent force was reincorporated into the Army of the Tennessee, and McClernand's further participation in the Vicksburg campaign was as XIII Corps commander under Grant.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 227\u201328.</ref>\n\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignAprilJuly63.png|thumb|400px|Grant's Operations against Vicksburg]]\nIn the early months of 1863, Grant pursued various futile operations seeking to capture Vicksburg from the north, causing one newspaper to complain that the \"army was being ruined in mud-turtle expeditions, under the leadership of a drunkard [Grant], whose confidential adviser [Sherman] was a lunatic.\"<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 228\u201334; Reid, ''Ohio'', 1:385.</ref> However, in April Grant proceeded to establish his troops well south of Vicksburg by marching them down the west side of the Mississippi and crossing it with the aid of the Navy. Working well with the [[Western Flotilla]] under Acting Rear Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|David D.

After capturing and briefly occupying [[Jackson, Mississippi]], on May 14, and winning the [[Battle of Champion Hill]] on May 16, Grant failed in initial assaults against the Confederate entrenchments at Vicksburg on May 19 and 22 and then settled in for siege operations rather than incur additional casualties.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 626\u201333; Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 234\u201353.</ref>\n\nDuring the siege, the army received significant reinforcements, from within and without the Department of the Tennessee, bringing Grant's total strength at Vicksburg above 70,000 soldiers out of a reported July 1863 total strength for the department of approximately 175,000.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 367; Departmental returns for July 1863, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0038%2F&tif=00569.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0038&coll=moa&frames=1&view=50 ''OR'' I, v. 24/3, pp. 567\u201368].

After Vicksburg fell, Sherman commanded a sizable Expeditionary Army (IX, XIII, and XV Corps) to drive Johnston beyond Jackson and then fell back toward Vicksburg. Maj. Gen.

However, in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]] on November 25, Sherman's attack gained no traction, and it fell to Thomas's Army of the Cumberland to break the Confederate line by assaulting directly up the middle of Missionary Ridge. On this occasion, then, the Army of the Tennessee ended up playing second fiddle to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 677\u201381; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 462\u201378; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 389\u201390.</ref>\n\nImmediately after Chattanooga, Grant ordered Sherman to take command of a mixed force, including part of the XV Corps, and proceed to break the siege that other Confederate forces had mounted against [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s command at [[Knoxville Campaign|Knoxville, Tennessee]].

This force, led by Sherman himself, consisted of two divisions from McPherson's corps and two from Hurlbut's corps. In February, after concentrating at Vicksburg, the force made a largely unopposed round-trip march of approximately {{convert|330|mi|km}} from Vicksburg to Meridian, Missisissippi, and back, in two columns.

In the West, Sherman succeeded Grant in command of the Military Division of the Mississippi. Command of the Army of the Tennessee now passed to the XVII Corps commander, Maj. Gen. James B.

As Sherman began his move southward, Johnston was entrenched at [[Dalton, Georgia]]. Hoping to threaten Johnston's rear from [[Resaca, Georgia|Resaca]], Sherman sent McPherson, on the Union right, to the west of Rocky Face Ridge and through the \"unoccupied, unguarded, unobstructed, and unobserved\" Snake Creek Gap to Resaca.

McPherson himself was killed, and command temporarily passed to Maj. Gen. Logan, his senior corps commander.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 152\u201355.</ref> The July 22 battle, writes one historian, was \"the climax of the Army of the Tennessee's wartime career,\" as 27,000 men \"defeated the attacks of nearly 40,000 Confederates who had the advantages of surprise and position.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 568.</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding Logan's battlefield success that day, Sherman chose West Pointer Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O.

This led to the [[Battle of Ezra Church]] on July 28, where Howard repulsed Hood's third attack in nine days \"with ease.\"<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 155\u201357.</ref> However, Sherman also suffered setbacks in cavalry operations at this juncture, and for a month his campaign became more static. He finally broke the impasse in late August, essentially abandoning his positions north and east of Atlanta, and wheeling the Army of the Tennessee well south of Atlanta to attack Hood's last rail communications. On August 31, Howard's army repulsed a final Confederate attack in the first day of the [[Battle of Jonesborough]] (August 31 and September 1).

The Army of the Tennessee and the Army of Georgia thereby allowed Sherman to present Savannah to Lincoln as a \"Christmas-gift ... with one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, also about twenty-five thousand bales of cotton.\"<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 307\u201309; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 711.</ref> Despite Sherman's deprecation of the operational significance of the March to the Sea, it \"was one of the major events of the Civil War\"; Sherman's virtually unopposed movement through Georgia showed that the Confederacy's \"days were numbered\" and demoralized the Confederate army in Virginia under [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 315.</ref>\n\n===Carolinas Campaign===\n{{See also|Bentonville Union order of battle}}\n[[File:Carolinas Campaign.png|thumb|250px|Sherman's Carolinas Campaign]]\nOn February 1, 1865, after a month in Savannah, Sherman resumed in force his destructive march, now northward into the Carolinas, with the ultimate objective of concentrating with Grant's forces in Virginia.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 607\u201309; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 749.</ref> Howard's Army of the Tennessee again constituted the right wing of a two-column advance, with John Logan now resuming command of the XV Corps and the XVII Corps continuing under Blair. The other column was again composed of Slocum's Army of Georgia.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 749\u201350; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 318.</ref> Resistance was scarce in South Carolina, and Sherman's troops worked much destruction on the cradle of secession.  (As Sherman exited the state in early March, one soldier observed that South Carolina \"has her 'rights' now.\")<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 317\u201327; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 627.</ref> Confederate opposition intensified in North Carolina, led by Sherman's erstwhile foe, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston. At Sherman's final significant battle, [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]] in mid March, most of the fighting fell to Slocum's forces. Thereafter, Johnston slipped away to the northwest, and Sherman rendezvoused near [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]] with forces Grant had ordered east from Tennessee under John Schofield.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 327\u201331; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 785\u201388; Report of Lt.

Lee]] surrendered to Grant at the village of [[Appomattox Court House, Virginia]], Sherman resumed his advance, headed toward [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], now with almost 90,000 soldiers\u2014Howard's Army of the Tennessee on the right, Schofield's Army of the Ohio in the center, and Slocum's Army of Georgia on the left.<ref>Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 302\u201303; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 819\u201332; for an order of battle for Sherman's forces at this stage, see pp. 820\u201328.</ref> Only learning of Lee's surrender on the night of April 11\u201312, Sherman had as his immediate target the separate Confederate force under General Johnston, then near Raleigh, but there was little need for further fighting. Sherman entered Raleigh on April 13, and Johnston promptly opened what became prolonged and politically sensitive surrender discussions. On April 26, at Durham Station, Johnston finally surrendered to Sherman all of the Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 831\u201352; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 339\u201349; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 303\u201308; Eicher, ''Commands'', pp. 323, 875, 881\u201382; Johnston, ''Narrative'', pp. 412\u201317.</ref> The Army of the Tennessee and the Army of Georgia then marched some {{convert|250|mi|km}} to [[Washington, D.C.]] and on May 24 participated there with Sherman in the [[Grand Review]].<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 856, 864\u201369, 872; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 312\u201320.</ref>\n\nTo salve the injury he had inflicted in bypassing John A. Logan for Oliver Howard after McPherson's death, Sherman arranged in May for Logan to become the final commander of the Army of the Tennessee. Thus, while Howard rode with Sherman, Logan led the army in the Grand Review.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 351; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 317\u201318; Howard, ''Autobiography'', 2:210\u201312.</ref> On July 13, Logan issued a farewell address to the Army of the Tennessee: \"Four years have you struggled in the bloodiest and most destructive war that ever drenched the earth with human gore; step by step you have borne our standard, until to-day, over every fortress and arsenal that rebellion wrenched from us, and over city, town, and hamlet, from the Lakes to the Gulf, and from ocean to ocean, proudly floats the 'Starry emblem' of our national unity and strength.\"<ref>Dawson, ''Logan'', p. 100.</ref>  Taps sounded for the Army of the Tennessee on August 1, 1865.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 856.</ref>\n\n===Society===\nThe preliminary meeting for the formation of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee was held in the senate chamber at the state capitol in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], on April 14, 1865. Membership in the Society was restricted to officers who had served with the Army of the Tennessee. The Society erected in [[Washington, D.C.]], at a cost of $50,000, a bronze statue of Major General John A. Rawlins, and also placed a memorial, costing $23,000, over the grave of Major General James B. McPherson, at [[Clyde, Ohio]]. Also erected in Washington by the Society were an equestrian statue of General McPherson, and a monument in memory of General John A.

Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the Union's District of West Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', pp. 856\u201357; McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512.</ref> In April 1862, Grant's troops survived a severe test in the bloody [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Then, during six months marked by discouragement and anxiety for Grant, his army first joined with two other Union armies to prosecute the relatively bloodless [[Siege of Corinth]] and then strained to hold Union positions in Tennessee and Mississippi. In October 1862, Grant's command was reconfigured and elevated to departmental status, as the Department of the Tennessee; the title of his command was thus officially aligned with that of his army.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> Grant commanded these forces until after his critically important victory at [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] on July 4, 1863. Under other generals, starting with [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], the army marched and fought from the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], through the [[Siege of Knoxville|Relief of Knoxville]], the [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian Campaign]], the [[Atlanta Campaign]], the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]], the [[Carolinas Campaign]], and to the end of the war and disbandment. This article also discusses Grant's 1861\u20131862 commands \u2013 the District of Southeast Missouri and the District of Cairo \u2013 because the troops Grant led in the [[Battle of Belmont]] and the [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]]-[[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] campaign during that period became the nucleus of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref>\n\nA 2005 study of the army states that it \"was present at most of the great battles that became turning points of the war\u2014Fort Donelson, Vicksburg, and Atlanta\" and \"won the decisive battles in the decisive theater of the war.\"<ref name=\"Woodworth, Victory, p. ix\">Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix.</ref> More poetically, in 1867, apparently speaking of the Atlanta campaign, General Sherman said that the Army of the Tennessee was \"never checked\u2014always victorious; so rapid in motion\u2014so eager to strike; it deserved its name of the 'Whip-lash,' swung from one flank to the other, as danger called, night or day, sunshine or storm.\"<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/11/17/80252662.pdf NYT: General Sherman's November 13, 1867 Address to the Society of the Army of the Tennessee]; see Lewis, ''Sherman'', p. 381.</ref>\n\n==History==\nHistory remembers the Army of the Tennessee as one of the most important Union armies during the Civil War, an army intimately associated with the Union's two most celebrated generals, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix; Flood, ''Friendship'', pp. 4\u20136.</ref> It is thus rather ironic that frequent military reorganizations and looseness of usage during the war itself make it difficult to pinpoint the exact date at which this army formally came into existence. It should suffice to note that the \"nucleus [of troops] around which was to gather the... Army of the Tennessee\" first took shape in 1861\u20131862, while Grant was headquartered at [[Cairo, Illinois]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 27\u201328.</ref> Those troops continued under Grant in his next command, the distinct District of West Tennessee; they were then sometimes, and perhaps most appropriately, called the \"Army of West Tennessee.\"<ref>That usage appears, for example, in reports filed by various Union officers after the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh (''Official Records'' (''OR'') I, v. 10/1, pp. 165, 203, 240, 277, 280, 282, 284, 286\u201387) and can be found as late as October 1862 (Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Davies, October 18, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 17/1, p. 251). During the period September 28 \u2013 December 9, 1862, there was also a Confederate Army of West Tennessee, organized from the Confederate [[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]] and commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]]. Confederate authorities ruled that \"the name and function of this army [were] improper,\" and Van Dorn's forces were merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]]. See Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 892.</ref> However, army correspondence began using the term \"Army of the Tennessee\" in March 1862; that term soon became commonplace and naturally lived on when Grant's command was elevated to departmental status in October 1862, as the Department of the Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 857; see Halleck to Pope, March 21, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 8, p. 629 (\"I am preparing additional re-enforcements for the Army of the Tennessee\"); Phisterer, ''Statistical Record'', p. 54 (Grant's forces fought at Shiloh (April 1862) as \"the Army of the District of Western Tennessee\" and \"became the Army of the Tennessee upon the [post-Shiloh] concentration of troops at Pittsburg Landing\"); McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> During the course of the war, elements of the Army of the Tennessee performed many tasks, and the army evolved with the addition and subtraction of many units. It is not feasible to chronicle every such development here, even at the [[corps]] level. Rather, this article traces the main thrust of the army's development and its most memorable activities. At any given time, substantial numbers of troops were engaged in activities not discussed here. For example, in April 1863, less than half of Grant's departmental strength was directly engaged in the Vicksburg Campaign.<ref name=\"OR I, v. 24/3, p. 249\">See Departmental returns for April 30, 1863, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0038%2F&tif=00251.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0038 ''OR'' I, v. 24/3, p. 249].</ref>\n\n===Cairo and the Battle of Belmont===\n{{See also|Belmont Union order of battle}}\n[[File:U.S. Grant and staff.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Brigadier General Grant and staff, Cairo, October 1861]]\nIn September 1861, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] Ulysses S. Grant, then subordinate to Maj. Gen. [[John Fremont]] in the Union's [[Western Department]], assumed command of the District of Southeast Missouri; Grant established his headquarters at [[Cairo, Illinois]].<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 264; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 174.</ref> One of Grant's wartime aides, [[John A. Rawlins]], later stated that \"[f]rom this time... commenced the growth and organization of the Army of the Tennessee.\"<ref>John A. Rawlins, Address, Proceedings of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee.</ref> Just days later, prompted by Confederate occupation of [[Columbus, Kentucky]], on the [[Mississippi River]], Grant led a small force to seize [[Paducah, Kentucky]], where the [[Tennessee River]] joins the [[Ohio River]]; Grant thus forestalled a Confederate effort to occupy the strategically important town. Paducah promptly became a separate Union command under Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]], who soon occupied [[Smithland, Kentucky]], at the junction of the [[Cumberland River]] and the Ohio.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 118\u201321.</ref>\n\nAccording to Rawlins, the \"first affair dignified by the name of a battle\" for any of Grant's forces occurred at [[Battle of Fredericktown|Fredericktown, Missouri]], where some of Grant's troops helped defeat Confederate forces under [[M. Jeff Thompson]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, p. 27; Conger, ''U.S. Grant'', pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Grant's own first engagement came on November 7 at Belmont, Missouri, a Mississippi River landing opposite Columbus, Kentucky. Grant, accompanied by Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], moved a force of approximately 3,000 to Belmont by water, cut his way into the Confederate camps there, and then had to fight his way back out to regain his transports. Grant's casualties in this first battle totaled about 500; Confederate casualties were similar. While Grant had suffered a repulse, he won favorable press coverage.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 124\u201332.</ref> This battle, reports Rawlins, \"confirmed General Grant in his views\" that he should \"give battle\" whenever \"he had what he thought a sufficient number of men.\"<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> Also in November, John Fremont lost his command at St. Louis, to be replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], whose command was designated the [[Department of the Missouri]].<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 134; Ballard, ''Grant'', pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n===Henry-Donelson Campaign===\n{{See also|Fort Donelson Union order of battle}}\nOn December 20, Grant's command was reconfigured to include C.F.

Grant'', 3:330.</ref> From that perch, in February 1862, Grant led the Union campaign against Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]], on the Cumberland River.<ref>For detailed discussion of the Henry-Donelson campaign, see Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 65\u2013120.</ref> His troops for this campaign eventually numbered approximately 27,000 men, divided into three divisions commanded, respectively, by John McClernand (1st Division), C.F.

At this time, the geographical limits of his district were \"not defined.\"  See General Orders No. 1, HQ, Dist. of West Tennessee, February 17, 1862, ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 4:230.</ref> Over the next several months, Grant twice was in danger of losing his command, a development that doubtless would have changed the future course and character of the army and perhaps deprived it at this early stage of one source of its future success\u2014continuity of leadership.<ref>The leadership of the Army of the Tennessee was notably more stable than that of the Union's [[Army of the Potomac]]. The latter suffered the relief of several failed commanders: [[Irwin McDowell|McDowell]] (predecessor force), [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], [[Ambrose E. Burnside|Burnside]], and [[Joseph Hooker|Hooker]]. There was no equally destabilizing event in the life of the Army of the Tennessee, although Grant could have fallen by the wayside in 1862 and some dislocation followed the death of [[James B. McPherson]] in 1864. Further, as Grant and Sherman in turn ascended to broader responsibilities, the Army of the Tennessee enjoyed virtually seamless transitions from Grant to Sherman (1863) and from Sherman to McPherson (1864). See Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 216, 420, 460, 490, 569\u201371; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 232\u201333.</ref>\n\nIn early March, Grant's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], then in command of the Department of the Missouri, assigned Grant to lead an expedition up the Tennessee River from the recently captured Fort Henry. On March 4, however, Halleck ordered Grant to give field command of the expedition to C.F. Smith; this order has been variously attributed to professional jealousy and to Halleck's lacking confidence in Grant due to certain administrative difficulties.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 219\u201320; Ballard, ''Grant'', pp. 40\u201343; Engle, ''Heartland'', pp. 105\u201306; Marszalek, ''Halleck'', pp. 116\u201320; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 128\u201332.</ref> Smith initially established the expedition at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], a town on the east side of the river approximately 100 river miles (160&nbsp;km) south of Fort Henry. He soon began staging troops at a point\u2014[[Pittsburg Landing]]\u2014nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further south and across the river.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref> Meanwhile, Halleck's command was enlarged and renamed the [[Department of the Mississippi]], and Halleck restored Grant to field command, perhaps because of personal intervention by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Many authors see presidential pressure behind Grant's reinstatement to field command. See, e.g., Simpson, ''Triumph'', pp. 124\u201325; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 141\u201342. But there is room to question that conclusion. Halleck relieved Grant of field command of the expedition, but not his overall command, on March 4 (''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 3). On March 9 and 10, Halleck advised Grant to prepare himself to take the field. On March 10, the President and Secretary of War inquired about Grant's status, and on March 13, Halleck directed Grant to take the field. See Halleck to Grant, March 9, 10, 13, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, pp. 22, 27, 32; Thomas to Halleck, March 10, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 7, p. 683. This sequence suggests that Halleck may have decided to restore Grant to field command before receiving Lincoln's inquiry. See Smith, ''Grant'', p. 176: Halleck's \"reinstatement of Grant preceded by one day the bombshell that landed on his desk from the adjutant general [on behalf of the President and Secretary of War] in Washington.\"</ref> Grant joined his army in the field on March 17.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 179.</ref> By early April, Grant's army had grown to a total of roughly 50,000 men, organized into six divisions.<ref>Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322.</ref> The three new divisions were commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]] (4th Division), Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman (5th), and Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin M. Prentiss]] (6th). In addition, Brig. Gen. [[W.H.L. Wallace]] took command of Smith's 2nd Division due to the latter's having suffered a debilitating leg injury.<ref>See Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322; Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 226\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Shiloh - History of Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|300px|Shiloh: Crucible of the Army of the Tennessee]]\nOn April 6\u20137, Grant's forces fought the bloodiest battle of the Civil War to that time, the [[Battle of Shiloh]], when Confederate forces advanced largely undetected from [[Corinth, Mississippi]], and attacked the five Union divisions staged at Pittsburg Landing. On the first day of the battle, the surprised and unentrenched army fought desperately and suffered many casualties. However, long-expected elements of the [[Army of the Ohio]], under Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]], arrived to reinforce Grant late that day, with many more troops arriving overnight and the following day. Grant was also bolstered by the evening arrival of his own 3rd Division; Lew Wallace and his troops had been slow arriving at Pittsburg Landing from their separate position at Crump's Landing. Substantially reinforced by Buell and Wallace, Grant counterattacked the Confederate forces on April 7 and drove them from the field and back toward Corinth.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 187\u2013204.</ref>  \"Grant's victory at Shiloh,\" one historian has written, \"bloody and bitter though it was, doomed the Confederate cause in the Mississippi valley.\"<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 204.</ref> In the near term, however, the battle resulted in much criticism against Grant for lack of preparedness, swift promotion to major general of volunteers for Sherman, capture for Prentiss, a fatal wound for W.H.L. Wallace, and Grant's loss of confidence in Lew Wallace. In addition, C.F. Smith died later in April from complications due to his non-combat leg injury.<ref>For the varying impact of Shiloh on these officers, see Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 183\u201384, 198\u201399, 201; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 182; Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 493.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Shiloh came the second threat to Grant's leadership, as well as a preview of the multi-army operations that would feature prominently in the future of the Army of the Tennessee. Pursuant to previous plans, Grant's departmental superior, General Halleck, arrived at Pittsburg Landing to take command in the field. Intending to move against the Confederate forces concentrating at the rail hub at Corinth, Halleck proceeded to gather and organize what was in effect an army group of over 100,000 men.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 205\u201306; Ambrose, ''Halleck'', pp. 43\u201349.</ref> His force included Grant's Army of the Tennessee, Buell's Army of the Ohio, and Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of the Mississippi]]. On April 30, Halleck divided this force into three corps (or \"wings\") and a reserve. The left wing was commanded by Pope, the center by Buell, the right wing by Maj. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]], and the reserve by John McClernand. Grant's 1st and 3rd Divisions constituted the reserve; the right wing contained Grant's 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions and Thomas's division from the Army of the Ohio.

Ibid., p. 376.</ref>\n\n===Meridian Campaign===\n{{See also |Battle of Meridian}}\n\nOnly about a third of Sherman's Army of the Tennessee (mostly [[XV Corps (ACW)|XV Corps]] troops) had participated in the Chattanooga and Knoxville campaigns. Most of the [[XVII Corps (ACW)|XVII Corps]] had remained on other duties, under McPherson at Vicksburg, and most of the [[XVI Corps (ACW)|XVI Corps]], under Hurlbut at Memphis.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 414; see Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 248.</ref> In early 1864, Sherman organized from the latter two corps an expedition of 20,000 men to move into central Mississippi to break up Confederate rail communications and other infrastructure and thereby to solidify Union control of the Mississippi River. This force, led by Sherman himself, consisted of two divisions from McPherson's corps and two from Hurlbut's corps. In February, after concentrating at Vicksburg, the force made a largely unopposed round-trip march of approximately {{convert|330|mi|km}} from Vicksburg to Meridian, Missisissippi, and back, in two columns. Hurlbut led the left column, and McPherson, the right.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 417\u201323, 872; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 252\u201355.</ref> This force destroyed the transportation center at Meridian in mid-February.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 253\u201354. A related cavalry expedition under [[William Sooy Smith]] was frustrated by Confederate cavalry under the command of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. See Foster, ''Mississippi'', pp. 125\u201349.</ref> One recent study of the Meridian campaign describes it as a \"dress rehearsal\" for the style of war against infrastructure that Sherman, as well as some of these very troops, would later practice in Georgia during the March to the Sea.<ref>Foster, ''Mississippi'', p. ix.</ref> Another historian has stated that the Meridian campaign taught Sherman that he \"could march an army through Confederate territory with impunity and feed it at the expense of the inhabitants. He could wage successful war without having to slaughter thousand of soldiers in the process.\"<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 255.</ref> The Meridian campaign essentially marked the end of Hurlbut's role in the Army of the Tennessee; subsequently he became commander of the Department of the Gulf.<ref>Sifakis, ''Civil War'', p. 329.</ref>\n\n===Atlanta Campaign===\n{{See also|Atlanta Campaign Union order of battle|Dallas Union order of battle|Atlanta Union order of battle|Jonesborough Union order of battle}}\n\n[[File:Brady-GeneralMcPherson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Major General McPherson, third commander of the Army of the Tennessee]]\nNow that Chattanooga was secure, an avenue of invasion lay open into the heart of the [[Deep South]]. It fell to Sherman to lead this invasion in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign, with the Army of the Tennessee serving as his \"whiplash.\"<ref>See Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 528, 579.</ref> To set the stage: In March 1864, Lincoln promoted Ulysses S. Grant to the new rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant general]] and gave him command of all Union armies; to fulfill that role, Grant relocated to the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] and maintained his headquarters thereafter in the field with the Army of the Potomac. In the West, Sherman succeeded Grant in command of the Military Division of the Mississippi. Command of the Army of the Tennessee now passed to the XVII Corps commander, Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson; he had begun his association with his new army as a lieutenant colonel and the chief engineer in Grant's Henry-Donelson force.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 718; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 70, 490.</ref> On the Confederate side, after Chattanooga, Braxton Bragg lost command of the Confederate Army of Tennessee, replaced initially by General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and later by Lt. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 6\u20139, 138\u201340.</ref>\n\nSherman later described the Atlanta campaign, launched in early May, as \"a continuous battle of 120 days,\" fought for \"over a hundred miles [160 km]\" along the route of the Western & Atlantic Railroad, during \"which, day and night, were heard the continuous boom of cannon and the sharp crack of the rifle.\"<ref>Secrist, ''Sherman's Trail'', p. xi.</ref> For this campaign, the Army of the Tennessee initially numbered about 25,000, consisting of the XV Corps under Maj. Gen. [[John A. Logan]] and the Left Wing of the XVI Corps under Brig. Gen. [[Grenville M. Dodge]]. Eventually, McPherson also had two divisions of his old XVII Corps, now under Maj. Gen. Frank Blair's command.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 487; McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 33\u201334, 100. The Right Wing of the XVI was detached for other duty; this was supposedly a temporary arrangement, but these troops never served with the main Army of the Tennessee again.

As Sherman began his move southward, Johnston was entrenched at [[Dalton, Georgia]]. Hoping to threaten Johnston's rear from [[Resaca, Georgia|Resaca]], Sherman sent McPherson, on the Union right, to the west of Rocky Face Ridge and through the \"unoccupied, unguarded, unobstructed, and unobserved\" Snake Creek Gap to Resaca. McPherson did reach Johnston's rear, but assumed a defensive position there, rather than carrying through Sherman's plan to cut Johnston's railroad link to the south.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 54\u201366; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 505.</ref> After the rest of Sherman's forces moved up, the first significant battle of the campaign occurred at Resaca (May 13\u201315). While a much more decisive outcome might have been achieved, Sherman had to be satisfied with Johnston's falling back toward Adairsville.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 67\u201377.</ref>\n\nResaca set the tone for the first phase of the campaign, as Sherman's armies attempted to maneuver around Johnston, and Johnston continually fell back toward Atlanta.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 506\u201328; McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 72\u2013140.</ref> On June 27, Sherman departed from character and attempted a direct assault on Johnston's position at [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]]. When that failed, Sherman swung McPherson from the left around to the right in order to resume his southward progress.<ref>Castel, ''Decision'', pp. 303\u201322; see McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 107\u201310; Hattaway, ''North'', pp. 596\u201399.</ref> On July 18, as the Army of the Tennessee completed a giant wheeling maneuver from Sherman's right to his left and cut the Georgia Railroad east of Decatur, John Bell Hood replaced Johnston as the Confederate commander.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 120, 139\u201341; Lewis, ''Fighting Prophet'', p. 381; Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 890.</ref> The aggressive Hood soon initiated the [[Battle of Peachtree Creek]] (July 20); his attack was intended to exploit a gap in the Union lines (between Thomas on the right and Schofield in the center) but ended unsuccessfully.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 146\u201352; Hattaway, ''North'', pp. 604\u201309.</ref> Then, in the [[Battle of Atlanta]] on July 22, Hood launched a strong assault against McPherson's army, on Sherman's left. McPherson himself was killed, and command temporarily passed to Maj. Gen. Logan, his senior corps commander.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 152\u201355.</ref> The July 22 battle, writes one historian, was \"the climax of the Army of the Tennessee's wartime career,\" as 27,000 men \"defeated the attacks of nearly 40,000 Confederates who had the advantages of surprise and position.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 568.</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding Logan's battlefield success that day, Sherman chose West Pointer Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]], imported from a corps command in Thomas's army, to become the new commander of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 570.</ref> Thereafter, Sherman refocused his efforts west of Atlanta, now swinging the Army of the Tennessee around to his right flank. This led to the [[Battle of Ezra Church]] on July 28, where Howard repulsed Hood's third attack in nine days \"with ease.\"<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 155\u201357.</ref> However, Sherman also suffered setbacks in cavalry operations at this juncture, and for a month his campaign became more static. He finally broke the impasse in late August, essentially abandoning his positions north and east of Atlanta, and wheeling the Army of the Tennessee well south of Atlanta to attack Hood's last rail communications. On August 31, Howard's army repulsed a final Confederate attack in the first day of the [[Battle of Jonesborough]] (August 31 and September 1). With all his rail communications finally severed, Hood evacuated Atlanta during the night of September 1\u20132.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 158\u201376.</ref> Sherman's capture of Atlanta, facilitated by the prowess of the Army of the Tennessee, \"was one of the great epochs of the war, on a level with the seizure of Vicksburg\" and contributed importantly to the November reelection of Abraham Lincoln.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 583.</ref> Sherman later estimated that the XV Corps had \"traversed in maneuvering\" approximately {{convert|178|mi|km}} during this campaign.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 872. Sherman's estimate for the late-joining XVII Corps was {{convert|89|mi|km}}.</ref>\n\n===March to the Sea===\n[[File:Savannah Campaign.png|thumb|left|250px|Sherman's March to the Sea]]\nThe Army of the Tennessee, under Oliver O. Howard, was now fated to function as Sherman's right arm in the March to the Sea and the Carolinas Campaign, but not immediately. After losing Atlanta in early September, Confederate General Hood regrouped and then sought with some success to lure Sherman back northward by attacking his communications and threatening Tennessee; Sherman estimated that his own regression toward Chattanooga and subsequent return to Atlanta involved {{convert|270|mi|km}} of marching by the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Bailey, ''Chessboard'', pp. 26\u201347; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 288\u201393; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 872.</ref> During this period (September\u2013October), Sherman made many adjustments to his forces. One involved dividing Grenville Dodge's XVI Corps troops between the XV and XVII Corps; this ended the role of the XVI Corps with the main Army of the Tennessee.<ref>See Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 620; [http://www.civilwararchive.com/CORPS/16thcorp.htm Civil War Archives, XVI Corps History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184614/http://www.civilwararchive.com/CORPS/16thcorp.htm|date=2013-10-29}}. Dodge himself had been wounded in August and was replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Thomas E.G. Ransom]]. See Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 578.</ref>\n\nUltimately, Sherman received approval from his superiors to detach other forces under George Thomas and John Schofield to defend Tennessee, cut loose from his lines of communication back to Chattanooga, and march southeast to the sea with approximately 60,000 men.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 293\u201397; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 649\u201350.</ref> In November and December, then, the Army of the Tennessee constituted the right wing during the march of {{convert|280|mi|km}} to the sea; Howard's command at this stage consisted of the XV Corps (now under Maj. Gen. [[Peter J. Osterhaus]] in place of Logan) and the XVII Corps (Blair). Sherman's other column, designated the [[Army of Georgia]], was drawn from the Army of the Cumberland; its commander was Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Slocum]].<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 646, 872; Marszalek, ''Sherman's March'', pp. 37, 134\u201344 (detailed order of battle).</ref>\n\nSherman himself characterized his march to the sea as a largely unopposed \"'shift of base,' as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea-coast, from which it could achieve other important results.\"<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 697.</ref> As is well known, during the march, his troops lived off the land and demoralized the South by extensive destruction of property.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 297\u2013316.</ref> (On the eve of the march, one soldier wrote that \"[w]e understand... that Sherman intends to use us to Christianize this country.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 587.</ref>) In the final stage of the march, Sherman called upon his old Shiloh division, now in the Army of the Tennessee's XV Corps and under the command of Brig. Gen. [[William B. Hazen]], to subdue [[Second Battle of Fort McAllister|Fort McAllister]], outside [[Savannah, Georgia]].<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 306\u201307; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 603.</ref> On December 21, the march culminated with the capture of Savannah. The Army of the Tennessee and the Army of Georgia thereby allowed Sherman to present Savannah to Lincoln as a \"Christmas-gift ... with one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, also about twenty-five thousand bales of cotton.\"<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 307\u201309; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 711.</ref> Despite Sherman's deprecation of the operational significance of the March to the Sea, it \"was one of the major events of the Civil War\"; Sherman's virtually unopposed movement through Georgia showed that the Confederacy's \"days were numbered\" and demoralized the Confederate army in Virginia under [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 315.</ref>\n\n===Carolinas Campaign===\n{{See also|Bentonville Union order of battle}}\n[[File:Carolinas Campaign.png|thumb|250px|Sherman's Carolinas Campaign]]\nOn February 1, 1865, after a month in Savannah, Sherman resumed in force his destructive march, now northward into the Carolinas, with the ultimate objective of concentrating with Grant's forces in Virginia.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 607\u201309; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 749.</ref> Howard's Army of the Tennessee again constituted the right wing of a two-column advance, with John Logan now resuming command of the XV Corps and the XVII Corps continuing under Blair.
