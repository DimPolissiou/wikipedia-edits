He died there four years later. The Peller's family lived in the house until 1828. \n\nThe Pellerhaus was composed of a front building, courtyard and a rear building, a style typical of classic Nuremberg. However, the front building facade was an exceptionally complex form for Nuremberg. Instead of a reserved, [[eaves]]-like facade, as was customary in Nuremberg, it was more reminiscent of the trading houses of the [[Northern Germany|North German]] or [[Hanseatic]] area.\n\nTwo stories and three [[Attic|attics]] rose above the base floor of [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] pillow blocks. The seven window axes were flanked by [[Pilaster|pilasters]] that ended above the triangular gable in richly decorated [[Obelisk|obelisks]]. Up to the height of the eaves, the pilasters took over the rustic structure of the basement, above which they were covered with fittings. In the top of the gable, two hermen [[Pilaster|pilasters]] carried a shell with the [[chronogram]] \"CVM Deo\", which referred to the year 1605. The facade was completed with a [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] statue. Further accents on the central axis were a choir above the entrance portal, as well as a relief of St. Martin of Tourson the third floor, which alluded to the name of the owner Martin Peller.\n[[File:Karl Emil Otto Fritsch-Denkmaeler Deutscher Renaissance-1891-Nuernberg-Pellerhaus zu Nuernberg Aegidienplatz 1605 Facade.jpg|thumb|North view of the original Pellerhaus from Aegidienplatz, Nuremberg in 1891.]]\nThe courtyard had [[Arcade|arcades]] that rose on octagonal [[Column|pillars]], with two gallery corridors above them. The rear building did not have a gallery on its facade. Instead, it had a striking bay window, which was supposed to take away the tube-like character of the narrow courtyard. The parapets were designed with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style tracery, with no repetitive [[ornamentation]].\n\nThe interior of the Pellerhaus was also very elaborately decorated. The entrance hall is divided into nine roughly square yokes with Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|ribbed vaults]]. In the so-called \"beautiful room\" the walls were lined with lavishly carved panelling, while the ceiling was decorated with ceiling paintings. The subject of the painting was [[Phaethon]] on the [[Solar deity|sun chariot]] surrounded by ancient figures of gods and allegorical figures. Another state hall also had a magnificent wall covering and a coffered ceiling.<ref>Edgard Heiger: Verlorene Pracht, Geschichten von zerst\u00f6rten Bauten, Hildesheim 2006, S. 18\u201321, hier S. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe Pellerhaus was spared extensive conversions over the years and by the time of its [[Area bombardment|destruction]], was largely in its original state. In 1929, the city of Nuremberg bought the Pellerhaus from private ownership in order to use it as a city archive.<ref>Edgard Heiger: Verlorene Pracht, Geschichten von zerst\u00f6rten Bauten, Hildesheim 2006, S. 18\u201321, hier S. 21.</ref> In 1934, the Pellerhaus was completely restored by order of the city of Nuremberg.\n\n== Destruction and Reconstruction ==\n[[File:PellerhausN\u00fcrnbergL1120833 (2).jpg|thumb|The ruins of the Pellerhaus in 1945]]\nDuring an [[air raid]] on Nuremberg on October 3, 1944, the Pellerhaus was severely damaged by [[Explosive device|explosive devices]] and burned out completely when the [[Royal Air Force]] attacked on January 2, 1945.

The 'Old Town Friends of Nuremberg' joined the project and founded the ''Pellerhaus working group''. The monument protection authority was initially opposed to a reconstruction, since in their opinion the existing historical substance would be endangered.\n\nIn May 2006, the city council fundamentally spoke in favour of a reconstruction, contrary to the monument protection office; but excluding financial participation in the reconstruction. The initiative then developed a concept in which everyone can make a donation to cover the cost of a special cuboid of the facade.\n\nIn October 2008, the first stone for the reconstruction of the courtyard facade was laid during a ceremony. In mid-2013, the surrounding walls were completely rebuilt up to the second floor, and the reconstruction of the eastern arcades began.<ref>[http://www.nordbayern.de/region/nuernberg/pellerhof-fortschritt-wird-sichtbar-1.2821406?searched=true ''Pellerhof: Fortschritt wird sichtbar'' (N\u00fcrnberger Zeitung vom 11.

Martin Peller had the house built from 1602 to 1605.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Swetje Bolduan, Herbert May, Nikolaus Bencker, Harald Pollmann|editor-surname1= Matthias B\u00f6ckel|title=Pellerhaus N\u00fcrnberg|publisher=Edition Hertel|publication-place=N\u00fcrnberg|at=p.&nbsp;16|isbn=978-3-9812921-0-7|date=2009|language=German\n}}</ref> Peller and his family moved into the house in 1625. He died there four years later. The Peller's family lived in the house until 1828. \n\nThe Pellerhaus was composed of a front building, courtyard and a rear building, a style typical of classic Nuremberg. However, the front building facade was an exceptionally complex form for Nuremberg. Instead of a reserved, [[eaves]]-like facade, as was customary in Nuremberg, it was more reminiscent of the trading houses of the [[Northern Germany|North German]] or [[Hanseatic]] area.\n\nTwo stories and three attics rose above the base floor of rusticated pillow blocks. The seven window axes were flanked by pilasters that ended above the gable triangle in richly decorated obelisks. Up to the height of the eaves, the pilasters took over the rustic structure of the basement, above which they were covered with fittings. In the top of the gable, two hermen [[Pilaster|pilasters]] carried a shell with the [[chronogram]] \"CVM Deo\", which referred to the year 1605. The facade was completed with a [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] statue. Further accents on the central axis were a choir above the entrance portal, as well as a relief of St. Martin of Tourson the third floor, which alluded to the name of the owner Martin Peller.\n[[File:Karl Emil Otto Fritsch-Denkmaeler Deutscher Renaissance-1891-Nuernberg-Pellerhaus zu Nuernberg Aegidienplatz 1605 Facade.jpg|thumb|North view of the original Pellerhaus from Aegidienplatz, Nuremberg in 1891.]]\nThe courtyard had [[Arcade|arcades]] that rose on octagonal [[Column|pillars]], with two gallery corridors above them. The rear building did not have a gallery on its facade. Instead, it had a striking bay window, which was supposed to take away the tube-like character of the narrow courtyard. The parapets were designed with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style tracery, with no repetitive [[ornamentation]].\n\nThe interior of the Pellerhaus was also very elaborately decorated. The entrance hall is divided into nine roughly square yokes with Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|ribbed vaults]]. In the so-called \"beautiful room\" the walls were lined with lavishly carved panelling, while the ceiling was decorated with ceiling paintings. The subject of the painting was [[Phaethon]] on the [[Solar deity|sun chariot]] surrounded by ancient figures of gods and allegorical figures. Another state hall also had a magnificent wall covering and a coffered ceiling.<ref>Edgard Heiger: Verlorene Pracht, Geschichten von zerst\u00f6rten Bauten, Hildesheim 2006, S. 18\u201321, hier S. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe Pellerhaus was spared extensive conversions over the years and by the time of its destruction, was largely in its original state. In 1929, the city of Nuremberg bought the Pellerhaus from private ownership in order to use it as a city archive.<ref>Edgard Heiger: Verlorene Pracht, Geschichten von zerst\u00f6rten Bauten, Hildesheim 2006, S. 18\u201321, hier S. 21.</ref> In 1934, the Pellerhaus was completely restored by order of the city of Nuremberg.\n\n== Destruction and Reconstruction ==\n[[File:PellerhausN\u00fcrnbergL1120833 (2).jpg|thumb|The ruins of the Pellerhaus in 1945]]\nDuring an [[air raid]] on Nuremberg on October 3, 1944, the Pellerhaus was severely damaged by explosive devices and burned out completely when the [[Royal Air Force]] attacked on January 2, 1945.

The 'Old Town Friends of Nuremberg' joined the project and founded the ''Pellerhaus working group''. The monument protection authority was initially opposed to a reconstruction, since in their opinion the existing historical substance would be endangered.\n\nIn May 2006, the city council fundamentally spoke in favour of a reconstruction, contrary to the monument protection office; but excluding financial participation in the reconstruction. The initiative then developed a concept in which everyone can make a donation to cover the cost of a special cuboid of the facade.\n\nIn October 2008, the first stone for the reconstruction of the courtyard facade was laid during a ceremony. In mid-2013, the surrounding walls were completely rebuilt up to the second floor, and the reconstruction of the eastern arcades began.<ref>[http://www.nordbayern.de/region/nuernberg/pellerhof-fortschritt-wird-sichtbar-1.2821406?searched=true ''Pellerhof: Fortschritt wird sichtbar'' (N\u00fcrnberger Zeitung vom 11.

Following their television work, they began making films, including ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979) and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of [[cult following|cult]] performers from the early editions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' through to more recent [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] trends in television comedy. \"[[wikt:Pythonesque|Pythonesque]]\" has entered the English lexicon as a result.\n\nAt the [[41st British Academy Film Awards]] in 1988, Monty Python received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 1998 they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]]. Many sketches from their TV show and films are well-known and widely quoted. Both ''Holy Grail'' and ''Life of Brian'' are frequently ranked in lists of greatest comedy films. In a 2005 poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors throughout the [[English-speaking world]] to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", three of the six Pythons members were voted to be among the top 50 greatest comedians ever: Cleese at No. 2, Idle at No. 21, and Palin at No. 30.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|work=The Guardian|date=2 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4141019.stm|title=Cook voted 'comedians' comedian'|work=BBC News|date=2 January 2005|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Before ''Flying Circus''==\nJones and Palin met at [[Oxford University]], where they performed together with [[the Oxford Revue]].

Chapman, Cleese, and Idle were members of the Footlights, which at that time also included the future ''[[The Goodies|Goodies]]'' ([[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], [[Bill Oddie]], and [[Graeme Garden]]), and [[Jonathan Lynn]] (co-writer of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'').<ref>Hewison, Robert (1983).

At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the [[BBC]], which had been impressed by their work on ''The Frost Report'' and ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on ''How to Irritate People'' and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle\u2014who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name=\"auto\">''The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons''.

Thomas Dunne Books; Orion, 2003</ref>\n\nBy contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography, the origins of ''Monty Python'' lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on ''Do Not Adjust Your Set''; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.<ref>''So, Anyway ...'' by John Cleese; Crown Archetype, London, 2014</ref> According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead on 11 May 1969, following a taping of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' which Cleese and Chapman attended.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCall |first1=Douglas.

They were admirers of the work of [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]] on ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]''\u2014seminal to the British \"[[satire boom]]\"\u2014and had worked on ''Frost'', which was similar in style.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1377417/index.html \"The Roots of Monty Python\"]. BFI Screenonline. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to \"cap\" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the ''Flying Circus'' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in\"\u2014they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).<ref>[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/silliest.php \"The Silliest Interview We've Ever Had / The Silliest Sketch We've Ever Done\"]. MontyPython.net. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, [[Spike Milligan]], whom they had admired on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' (a show the Pythons regard as their biggest influence, which also featured [[Peter Sellers]], whom Cleese called \u201cthe greatest voice man of all time\u201d) recording his groundbreaking BBC series ''[[Q...

Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled \"Christmas Cards\", and agreed that it represented \"a way of doing things differently\". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the ''Flying Circus'' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single [[stream-of-consciousness]] (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/> The BBC states, \u201cGilliam's unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.\u201d<ref name=\"Circus profile\">{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |accessdate=24 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWriting started at 9&nbsp;am and finished at 5&nbsp;pm. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a \"writer\", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\n[[file:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_12_46_43_(14415411808).jpg|thumb|left|Gilliam, Palin and Jones performing \u201c[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]\u201d sketch during the 2014 Python reunion. As a sketch writer and creator of the animations, although Gilliam did considerably less acting, he did have some notable sketch roles such as this (Cardinal Fang).]]\nWhile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many \"confrontation\" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as \"The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s\"). Cleese confirmed that \"most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's\".<ref>Wilmut (1980), p. 211</ref> Gilliam's animations ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\nSeveral names for the show were considered before ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was settled upon. Some were ''Owl Stretching Time'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket'', ''Vaseline Review'', and ''Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot''. ''Flying Circus'' stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). ''Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus'' was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' was considered as an affectionate tribute to [[Barry Took]], the man who had brought them together.<ref>{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}</ref> ''Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus'' was suggested, then discarded. The name ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' had the form of ''[[Baron Manfred von Richthofen]]'s [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]'' of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the [[Royal Guardsmen]]'s 1966 song \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as [[flying circus|barnstorming]], where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus \u2013 Four Yorkshiremen |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/02/monty-pythons-flying-circus-four-yorkshiremen.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref>\n\nDiffering, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only \"significance\" was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary ''Live at Aspen'' during the [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]], where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]], the group implied that \"Monty\" was selected (Eric Idle's idea) as a gently mocking tribute to [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery]], a British general of [[World War II]]; requiring a \"slippery-sounding\" surname, they settled on \"Python\". On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name \"Monty\" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, \"Has Monty been in yet?\", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being \"envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Comedy \u2013 Monty Python}}</ref>\n\n===Style of the show===\n''Flying Circus'' popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the [[cold open]], in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements.<ref name=MBC_piece>{{cite web|last=Museum of Broadcast Communications|title=Monty Python's Flying Circus|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/montypython/montypython.htm}}</ref> An example of this is the \"It's\" man: Palin, outfitted in [[Robinson Crusoe]] garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, \"It's&nbsp;...\", only to be then cut off by the [[title sequence]] and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: a golden age of British comedy |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/monty-python-a-golden-age-of-british-comedy-1.371481 |accessdate=20 August 2019 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref> On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's \"anti-silliness\" character of \"[[The Colonel (Monty Python)|the Colonel]]\", who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming \"far too silly\".<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Langley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10948113/Monty-Python-Will-the-wrinkly-revolutionaries-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Monty Python : Will the wrinkly revolutionaries have the last laugh?|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=5 July 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monty python foot.png|thumb|right|[[The Foot of Cupid|Cupid's foot]], as used by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.

Garrison produced the NBC series ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]'', which ran during the summer of 1974.  The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches \"Bicycle Repairman\" and \"The Dull Life of a Stockbroker\". Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences.\n\nIn 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast two 90-minute ''Monty Python'' specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience.  As the judge observed in ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.]]'', where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, \"According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public.\"  Monty Python won the case.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/integrity/Links/Cases/gilliam.html|title=Terry Gilliam et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants-Appellees, v.

''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' was based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. ''Holy Grail'' was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only \u00a3229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as UK music industry entrepreneur [[Tony Stratton-Smith]] (founder and owner of the [[Charisma Records]] label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-06/entertainment/0905050391_1_holy-grail-monty-python-john-goldstone|title=Cue the coconuts: 'Holy Grail' gallops on|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=6 May 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe backers of the film wanted to cut the famous [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] scene (a [[Sam Peckinpah]] send-up in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie.<ref>Interview with John Cleese on Q-The Podcast with host John Ghomeshi, on 16 July 2009</ref> \"Tis but a scratch\" and \"It's just a flesh wound\u2026\" are often quoted.<ref name=\"Python quotes\">{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=18 August 2019 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. and viewers in a [[Channel 4]] poll placed it sixth.<ref name=\"Channel4 comedies\"/>\n\n====''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' (1979)====\n{{Main|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}\nFollowing the success of ''Holy Grail'', reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one.

Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python|Parrot Sketch Not Included]],'' where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds.

Several shows were to be linked with Q&A meetings in various cities. Although all had said yes, Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour. This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening. In 2002, four of the surviving members, bar Cleese, performed \"The Lumberjack Song\" and \"[[Sit on My Face]]\" for [[Concert for George|George Harrison's memorial concert]].

Cleese's feeling was that ''The Meaning of Life'' had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the ''Grail'' and ''Brian'' films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance).

The memoir ''A Liar's Autobiography'' was published in 1980 and details Chapman's journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: \"Nothing&nbsp;... it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie.\" The film uses Chapman's own voice\u2014from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer\u2014and entertainment channel [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] announced the film's release in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats. Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Ben Timlett, and Jeff Simpson, the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length, each in a different style. John Cleese recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman's voice. Michael Palin voiced Chapman's father and Terry Jones voiced his mother. Terry Gilliam voiced Graham's psychiatrist.

He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. Idle wrote the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Spamalot]]'', based on ''Holy Grail''.

''The Life of Python''. p. 40. Pavilion</ref> Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members\u2014in particular Cleese\u2014with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often under-rated. However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian's mother Mandy in ''Life of Brian'', \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\", a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2131880,00.html|title=The last laugh: your favourite 50|work=The Observer|location=UK|first1=Philip|last1=French|first2=Mark|last2=Kermode|first3=Jason|last3=Solomons|first4=Akin|last4=Ojumu|first5=Killian|last5=Fox|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385293/Life-of-Brian-wins-the-vote-for-film's-best-laughter-line.html|title=Life of Brian wins the vote for film's best laughter line|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=19 February 2002|accessdate=21 September 2008|location=London}}</ref> Jones died on 21 January 2020 from complications of dementia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python star Terry Jones dies aged 77 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51209197 |accessdate=22 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Palin|Sir Michael Palin]] attended [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series ''Ripping Yarns'' together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After ''Flying Circus'', Palin hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled ''Michael Palin Diaries 1969\u20131979'', published in 2007.

Occasionally such people have been referred to as the 'seventh Python', in a style reminiscent of [[George Martin]] (or other associates of the Beatles) being dubbed \"the [[Fifth Beatle]]\".  The two collaborators with the most meaningful and plentiful contributions have been [[Neil Innes]] and [[Carol Cleveland]]. Both were present and presented as Associate Pythons at the official Monty Python 25th-anniversary celebrations held in Los Angeles in July 1994.<ref>{{citation |title=Python Comeback |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?/sotcaa/pythonpages/python_press_1990_99.html |accessdate=2007-09-09 |date=3 March 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201010035/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?%2Fsotcaa%2Fpythonpages%2Fpython_press_1990_99.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n[[File:10.18.09CarolClevelandByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carol Cleveland]] (in 2009), commonly called \u201cPython girl\u201d, or \u201cSeventh Python\u201d.<ref name=\"25 sketches\"/>]]\n[[Neil Innes]] is the only non-Python besides [[Douglas Adams]] to be credited with writing material for ''Flying Circus''. He appeared in sketches and the Python films, as well as performing some of his songs in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]''.

He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat [[Bonzo Dog Band]]. He would later portray Ron Nasty of [[the Rutles]] and write all of the Rutles' compositions for ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978), a [[mockumentary]] film co-directed by Idle. By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles \"reunion\" album ''The Rutles: Archaeology'' and Idle's straight-to-DVD ''The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch'', each undertaken without the other's participation. According to an interview with Idle in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back \"too far.

She was originally hired by producer/director [[John Howard Davies]] for just the first five episodes of the ''Flying Circus''.

Her most significant role was the \"best girl\" of the eponymous Lumberjack in \"The Lumberjack Song\", though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland. Booth appeared in a total of six sketches and also played one-off characters in Python feature films ''And Now for Something Completely Different'' and ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Comedy: Connie Booth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/connie_booth_person_page.shtml |accessdate=20 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n[[Douglas Adams]] was \"discovered\" by Chapman when a version of ''Footlights Revue'' (a 1974 BBC2 television show featuring some of Adams' early work) was performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. In Cleese's absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called \"[[Patient Abuse]]\". In the sketch\u2014a satire on mind-boggling bureaucracy\u2014a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill in numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus, Series 4, Episode 6 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031d26j |accessdate=29 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref> He also had two cameo appearances in this season. Firstly, in the episode \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a \"pepperpot\" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (\"Any old iron&nbsp;...\"). Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6150254.stm|title='Lost' gems from the TV archives|agency=BBC News \u2013 Entertainment|access-date=19 August 2019}}</ref> He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.\n\nOther than Carol Cleveland, the only other non-Python to make a significant number of appearances in the ''Flying Circus'' was [[Ian Davidson (scriptwriter)|Ian Davidson]]. He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python. Despite this, Davidson did not appear in any Python-related media subsequent to series 2, though footage of him was shown on the documentary ''[[Python Night \u2013 30 Years of Monty Python]]''.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cce5b11885f24b708cc195c106f497fa \u201cPython Night\u201c].

When the BBC held a \"Python Night\" in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle, who had declined to partake in person (he taped a solo contribution from the US). Izzard hosted ''The Life of Python'' (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in 1998 (released on DVD as ''Live at Aspen''). Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on his style of comedy and Cleese has referred to him as \"the lost Python\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/living-the-dream-eddie-izzard-26586127.html|title=Living the dream: Eddie Izzard|first=Eamon|last=Sweeney|date=27 November 2009|website=The Irish Independent|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeries director of ''Flying Circus'', Ian MacNaughton, is also regularly associated with the group and made a few on-screen appearances in the show and in the film ''And Now for Something Completely Different''.

Following their television work, they began making films, including ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979) and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of [[cult following|cult]] performers from the early editions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' through to more recent [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] trends in television comedy. \"[[wikt:Pythonesque|Pythonesque]]\" has entered the English lexicon as a result.\n\nAt the [[41st British Academy Film Awards]] in 1988, Monty Python received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 1998 they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]]. Many sketches from their TV show and films are well-known and widely quoted. Both ''Holy Grail'' and ''Life of Brian'' are frequently ranked in lists of greatest comedy films. In a 2005 poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors throughout the [[English-speaking world]] to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", three of the six Pythons members were voted to be among the top 50 greatest comedians ever: Cleese at No. 2, Idle at No. 21, and Palin at No. 30.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|work=The Guardian|date=2 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4141019.stm|title=Cook voted 'comedians' comedian'|work=BBC News|date=2 January 2005|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Before ''Flying Circus''==\nJones and Palin met at [[Oxford University]], where they performed together with [[the Oxford Revue]].

Chapman, Cleese, and Idle were members of the Footlights, which at that time also included the future ''[[The Goodies|Goodies]]'' ([[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], [[Bill Oddie]], and [[Graeme Garden]]), and [[Jonathan Lynn]] (co-writer of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'').<ref>Hewison, Robert (1983).

It parodies nostalgic conversations about humble beginnings or difficult childhoods.]]\nFollowing the success of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from December 1967 to May 1969, [[Thames Television]] offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together. At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the [[BBC]], which had been impressed by their work on ''The Frost Report'' and ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on ''How to Irritate People'' and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle\u2014who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name=\"auto\">''The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons''.

Thomas Dunne Books; Orion, 2003</ref>\n\nBy contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography, the origins of ''Monty Python'' lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on ''Do Not Adjust Your Set''; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.<ref>''So, Anyway ...'' by John Cleese; Crown Archetype, London, 2014</ref> According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead on 11 May 1969, following a taping of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' which Cleese and Chapman attended.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCall |first1=Douglas.

They were admirers of the work of [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]] on ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]''\u2014seminal to the British \"[[satire boom]]\"\u2014and had worked on ''Frost'', which was similar in style.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1377417/index.html \"The Roots of Monty Python\"]. BFI Screenonline. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to \"cap\" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the ''Flying Circus'' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in\"\u2014they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).<ref>[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/silliest.php \"The Silliest Interview We've Ever Had / The Silliest Sketch We've Ever Done\"]. MontyPython.net. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, [[Spike Milligan]], whom they had admired on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' (a show the Pythons regard as their biggest influence, which also featured [[Peter Sellers]], whom Cleese called \u201cthe greatest voice man of all time\u201d) recording his groundbreaking BBC series ''[[Q...

Featuring Cleese as a [[bowler hat|bowler-hatted]] [[civil servant]] in a fictitious British government ministry responsible for developing silly walks through [[Grant (money)|grants]], it appears in season 2, episode 1 of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.]]\nAfter much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' called \"Beware of the Elephants\", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style. Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled \"Christmas Cards\", and agreed that it represented \"a way of doing things differently\". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the ''Flying Circus'' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single [[stream-of-consciousness]] (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/> The BBC states, \u201cGilliam's unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.\u201d<ref name=\"Circus profile\">{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |accessdate=24 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWriting started at 9&nbsp;am and finished at 5&nbsp;pm. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a \"writer\", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\n[[file:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_12_46_43_(14415411808).jpg|thumb|left|Gilliam, Palin and Jones performing \u201c[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]\u201d sketch during the 2014 Python reunion. As a sketch writer and creator of the animations, although Gilliam did considerably less acting, he did have some notable sketch roles such as this (Cardinal Fang).]]\nWhile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many \"confrontation\" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as \"The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s\"). Cleese confirmed that \"most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's\".<ref>Wilmut (1980), p. 211</ref> Gilliam's animations ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\nSeveral names for the show were considered before ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was settled upon. Some were ''Owl Stretching Time'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket'', ''Vaseline Review'', and ''Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot''. ''Flying Circus'' stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). ''Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus'' was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' was considered as an affectionate tribute to [[Barry Took]], the man who had brought them together.<ref>{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}</ref> ''Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus'' was suggested, then discarded. The name ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' had the form of ''[[Baron Manfred von Richthofen]]'s [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]'' of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the [[Royal Guardsmen]]'s 1966 song \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as [[flying circus|barnstorming]], where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus \u2013 Four Yorkshiremen |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/02/monty-pythons-flying-circus-four-yorkshiremen.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref>\n\nDiffering, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only \"significance\" was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary ''Live at Aspen'' during the [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]], where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]], the group implied that \"Monty\" was selected (Eric Idle's idea) as a gently mocking tribute to [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery]], a British general of [[World War II]]; requiring a \"slippery-sounding\" surname, they settled on \"Python\". On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name \"Monty\" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, \"Has Monty been in yet?\", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being \"envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Comedy \u2013 Monty Python}}</ref>\n\n===Style of the show===\n''Flying Circus'' popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the [[cold open]], in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements.<ref name=MBC_piece>{{cite web|last=Museum of Broadcast Communications|title=Monty Python's Flying Circus|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/montypython/montypython.htm}}</ref> An example of this is the \"It's\" man: Palin, outfitted in [[Robinson Crusoe]] garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, \"It's&nbsp;...\", only to be then cut off by the [[title sequence]] and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: a golden age of British comedy |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/monty-python-a-golden-age-of-british-comedy-1.371481 |accessdate=20 August 2019 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref> On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's \"anti-silliness\" character of \"[[The Colonel (Monty Python)|the Colonel]]\", who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming \"far too silly\".<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Langley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10948113/Monty-Python-Will-the-wrinkly-revolutionaries-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Monty Python : Will the wrinkly revolutionaries have the last laugh?|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=5 July 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monty python foot.png|thumb|right|[[The Foot of Cupid|Cupid's foot]], as used by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.

Garrison produced the NBC series ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]'', which ran during the summer of 1974.  The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches \"Bicycle Repairman\" and \"The Dull Life of a Stockbroker\". Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences.\n\nIn 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast two 90-minute ''Monty Python'' specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience.  As the judge observed in ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.]]'', where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, \"According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public.\"  Monty Python won the case.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/integrity/Links/Cases/gilliam.html|title=Terry Gilliam et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants-Appellees, v.

''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' was based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. ''Holy Grail'' was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only \u00a3229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as UK music industry entrepreneur [[Tony Stratton-Smith]] (founder and owner of the [[Charisma Records]] label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-06/entertainment/0905050391_1_holy-grail-monty-python-john-goldstone|title=Cue the coconuts: 'Holy Grail' gallops on|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=6 May 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe backers of the film wanted to cut the famous [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] scene (a [[Sam Peckinpah]] send-up in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie.<ref>Interview with John Cleese on Q-The Podcast with host John Ghomeshi, on 16 July 2009</ref> \"Tis but a scratch\" and \"It's just a flesh wound\u2026\" are often quoted.<ref name=\"Python quotes\">{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=18 August 2019 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. and viewers in a [[Channel 4]] poll placed it sixth.<ref name=\"Channel4 comedies\"/>\n\n====''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' (1979)====\n{{Main|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}\nFollowing the success of ''Holy Grail'', reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one.

When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby in the stable, and then later on [[Mount of Olives|the Mount]], speaking the [[Beatitudes]]), he is played straight (by actor [[Kenneth Colley]]) and portrayed with respect.

Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python|Parrot Sketch Not Included]],'' where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds.

Several shows were to be linked with Q&A meetings in various cities. Although all had said yes, Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour. This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening.

Cleese's feeling was that ''The Meaning of Life'' had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the ''Grail'' and ''Brian'' films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance).

The memoir ''A Liar's Autobiography'' was published in 1980 and details Chapman's journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: \"Nothing&nbsp;... it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie.\" The film uses Chapman's own voice\u2014from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer\u2014and entertainment channel [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] announced the film's release in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats. Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Ben Timlett, and Jeff Simpson, the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length, each in a different style. John Cleese recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman's voice. Michael Palin voiced Chapman's father and Terry Jones voiced his mother. Terry Gilliam voiced Graham's psychiatrist.  They all play various other roles.

After ''Flying Circus'', he hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' four times in the first five seasons.

He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. Idle wrote the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Spamalot]]'', based on ''Holy Grail''.

''The Life of Python''. p. 40. Pavilion</ref> Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members\u2014in particular Cleese\u2014with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often under-rated.

Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After ''Flying Circus'', Palin hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled ''Michael Palin Diaries 1969\u20131979'', published in 2007. Palin was awarded a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George|knighthood]] in the [[2019 New Year Honours]], which was announced by [[Buckingham Palace]] in December 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/monty-python-s-michael-palin-gets-knighthood-in-new-year-honours-1-9512598|title=Monty Python's Michael Palin gets knighthood in New Year Honours|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=29 December 2018|accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Associate Pythons===\nSeveral people have been accorded unofficial \"associate Python\" status over the years. Occasionally such people have been referred to as the 'seventh Python', in a style reminiscent of [[George Martin]] (or other associates of the Beatles) being dubbed \"the [[Fifth Beatle]]\".  The two collaborators with the most meaningful and plentiful contributions have been [[Neil Innes]] and [[Carol Cleveland]]. Both were present and presented as Associate Pythons at the official Monty Python 25th-anniversary celebrations held in Los Angeles in July 1994.<ref>{{citation |title=Python Comeback |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?/sotcaa/pythonpages/python_press_1990_99.html |accessdate=2007-09-09 |date=3 March 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201010035/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?%2Fsotcaa%2Fpythonpages%2Fpython_press_1990_99.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n[[File:10.18.09CarolClevelandByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carol Cleveland]] (in 2009), commonly called \u201cPython girl\u201d, or \u201cSeventh Python\u201d.<ref name=\"25 sketches\"/>]]\n[[Neil Innes]] is the only non-Python besides [[Douglas Adams]] to be credited with writing material for ''Flying Circus''.

He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat [[Bonzo Dog Band]]. He would later portray Ron Nasty of [[the Rutles]] and write all of the Rutles' compositions for ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978), a [[mockumentary]] film co-directed by Idle. By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles \"reunion\" album ''The Rutles: Archaeology'' and Idle's straight-to-DVD ''The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch'', each undertaken without the other's participation. According to an interview with Idle in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back \"too far.

Her most significant role was the \"best girl\" of the eponymous Lumberjack in \"The Lumberjack Song\", though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland.

In Cleese's absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called \"[[Patient Abuse]]\".

Firstly, in the episode \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a \"pepperpot\" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (\"Any old iron&nbsp;...\"). Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6150254.stm|title='Lost' gems from the TV archives|agency=BBC News \u2013 Entertainment|access-date=19 August 2019}}</ref> He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.\n\nOther than Carol Cleveland, the only other non-Python to make a significant number of appearances in the ''Flying Circus'' was [[Ian Davidson (scriptwriter)|Ian Davidson]]. He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python. Despite this, Davidson did not appear in any Python-related media subsequent to series 2, though footage of him was shown on the documentary ''[[Python Night \u2013 30 Years of Monty Python]]''.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cce5b11885f24b708cc195c106f497fa \u201cPython Night\u201c].

When the BBC held a \"Python Night\" in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle, who had declined to partake in person (he taped a solo contribution from the US). Izzard hosted ''The Life of Python'' (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in 1998 (released on DVD as ''Live at Aspen''). Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on his style of comedy and Cleese has referred to him as \"the lost Python\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/living-the-dream-eddie-izzard-26586127.html|title=Living the dream: Eddie Izzard|first=Eamon|last=Sweeney|date=27 November 2009|website=The Irish Independent|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeries director of ''Flying Circus'', Ian MacNaughton, is also regularly associated with the group and made a few on-screen appearances in the show and in the film ''And Now for Something Completely Different''.

The stripped-down ''[[New Attitude EP]]'' followed in 2006 and featured inklings of the band's later vocal interplay and guitar work.\n\nIn 2007, the band released ''[[Rise Above (Dirty Projectors album)|Rise Above]]'', an album of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] songs as re-imagined from memory. The album introduced the band's distinctive contrast between Longstreth's vocals and the [[hocket]]ed harmonies of [[Amber Coffman]] and Susanna Waiche, who was later replaced by [[Angel Deradoorian]]. In support of the album, the band performed songs for a Take Away Show acoustic video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].\n\n=== Domino Records, ''Bitte Orca'', and ''Mount Wittenberg Orca'' (2008\u201311) ===\nIn April 2008, Dirty Projectors signed with [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]], and the label announced the release of their fifth full-length album, ''[[Bitte Orca]]'', for June 9, 2009.

That year, the band also collaborated with [[David Byrne]] on the song \"Knotty Pine\" for the compilation album ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

The CAB strictly controlled all U.S. certificated airlines (\"scheduled carriers\") -- deciding which routes would be serviced by which airlines, and setting minimum limits on passenger fares (comparable to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]) -- effectively managing competition between airlines, and ensuring certain levels of service to communities throughout the United States.<ref name=\"non_skeds_winter_2019_aahs_journal /><ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\">Brown, John Howard (assoc. prof., Dept of Finance & Economics, [[Georgia Southern University]]) (with credit to [[Alfred Kahn]], last CAB Chairman) [https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_19_01_06_brown.pdf \"Jimmy Carter, Alfred Kahn, and Airline Deregulation: Anatomy of a Policy Success,\"] Summer 2014, ''[[The Independent Review]],'' vol. 19, no. 1, ISSN 1086\u20131653, pp. 85\u201399</ref>\n\nWhile the CAB regulation suppressed free competition, it provided security for the existing airlines, avoided gluts and shortages of passengers on certain routes, and (partly by allowing airlines to carry air mail) secured airline service for communities that would have otherwise been served less, or not have been served at all (due to low passenger traffic or other reasons).<ref name=\"non_skeds_winter_2019_aahs_journal /><ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\" />\n\nTo achieve its goals, the CAB was empowered to provide and administer subsidies to airlines. Further, the CAB regulated airline industry mergers and intercompany contracting -- but shielded the airlines from [[antitrust]] regulation. Additionally, within the airline industry, the CAB was assigned to prevent deceptive trade practices and unfair competition methods (similar to the role of the [[Federal Trade Commission]]).<ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\" />\n\n==History==\nThe Civil Aeronautics Authority Act of 1938 formed the Civil Aeronautics Authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/75/publaw-706.pdf |title=Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 ~ P.L. 75-706 |date=June 23, 1938 |series=52 Stat. 973 ~ Senate Bill 3845 |publisher= Legis\u2605Works}}</ref> The agency was renamed in 1940,<ref name=USGManual>''The United States Government Manual 2009-2010''.
