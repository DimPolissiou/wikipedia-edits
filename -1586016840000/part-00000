The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the rhyme scheme, ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five feet in each line, and two syllables in each foot, accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are regular iambic pentameter, including the 5th line:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n  \u00d7    /      \u00d7    /     \u00d7    /   \u00d7   /   \u00d7   / \nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing (78.5)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n \n==Analysis==\nAccording to Helen Vendler, \"Shakespeare excels in a form of verbal emphasis pointing up the conceptual oppositions of his verse.\" In this first poem of the [[Rival Poet]] sequence, \"a firm antithesis is drawn between the putatively rude speaker and the other poets clustered round the young man.\" They are all \"learned\" and practicing both art and style, while \"the poor speaker's ignorance is twice insisted on, as is his muteness (he was dumb) before he saw the young man.\"<ref name=Vendler>Vendler, Helen Hennessy. \"78.\" The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1998. 351. Print.</ref>\n \nThe poem gives us directions as to how we should read it and which words we should emphasize: \"The words of the couplet tie \u2014 ''art'', ''high'', ''learning'' [''learn\u00e8d''], ''ignorance'' \u2014 repeat in little the topics that are under dispute.\"<ref name=Vendler />\n\nMichael Schoenfeldt notes, \"the more whimsical complimentary sonnets, such as 78\u2026 such sonnets may be fanciful, but they are not frivolous\u2026 Read from the right angle, so to speak, they can be very beautiful, or at least delightful; and in them, as elsewhere Shakespeare is inventing some game or other and playing it out to its conclusion in deft and surprising ways.<ref name=Schoenfeldt>\"Strategies of Unfolding.\" Compassion to Shakespeare Sonnets. Ed. Michael Schoenfeldt. Malden: Blackwell Pub, 2007. 38. Print.</ref>\n \nThe words \"pen\", \"feather\", and \"style\" \u2014 used in stanza 1, 2, and 3 respectively \u2014 seem to be related. The word \"pen\" derives from the Latin word ''penna'' meaning feather, and in the Renaissance referred to a quill pen, and also was occasionally used to indicate a \"feather\". The word \"style\" in line 11 means a writer's literary style, though it also could be used as a synonym for \"pen\"; it derives from the Latin ''stilus'' meaning a writing instrument.<ref name=Booth>Booth, Stephen. \"Sonnet 78.\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Edited with Anaylitic Commentary. Westford: Murray, 1977. Print</ref>\n \n\"Dumb\", \"ignorance\", \"learned\u2018s\", and \"grace\" are nouns that occur in the second stanza. The words \"dumb\" and \"ignorance\" could indicate the poet. \"Learned\" and \"grace\" could indicate a particular rival.<ref name=Booth/>\n \nIn line 7, the poet uses a \"metaphor from falconry and refers to the practice of imping, engrafting extra feathers in the wing of a bird\"<ref name=Booth/> in order to improve the health and flight of the bird. There are Italian allusions in Sonnet 78. For example, the phrase ''\"penna d'ingegno\"'' in Petrarch's sonnet 307, which means \u201cpen of genius\u201d, is analogous to Shakespeare's phrase \u201clearned's wing\u201d. The reference to falconry is often noted, but not the reference to Petrarch's sonnet.<ref name=Eriksen>Eriksen, Roy T. \"Extant And In Choice Italian: Possible Italian Echoes In Julius Caesar And Sonnet 78.\" English Studies 69.3 (1988): 224.

The figure here occurs as a demonstration of what is stated in line 8.<ref name=Booth/>\n \nIn line 13's phrase \"thou art all my art\" Shakespeare uses a rhetorical device known as antanaclasis, in which a word is used twice in different senses. The effect of the antanaclasis works as a metaphor for the basic meaning of the clause: \"the beloved's being and the speaker's art are one and the same thing\".<ref name=Booth/> Joel Fineman suggests an alternative interpretation: \"Instead of 'thou art all my art', writing itself stands \u2014 not subtly, but explictiy \u2014between the poet's first and second persons. Writing itself (the same writing written by \"I\" the poet and by the \"thou\" of the young man) gives the poet an ontological and poetic art of interference whose transference both is and is not what it is supposed to be\"<ref>Fineman, Joel.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986</ref>\n\n==Context==\n\nSonnet 78 we find out about a rival who's male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86.<ref name=Pequigney>Pequigney, Joseph. \"Jealous Thoughts.\" Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare Sonnets. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1985. 103+. Print.</ref> The rivalry between the poets may appear to be literary, but, according to the critic Joseph Pequigney, it is in reality a sexual rivalry. This is disturbing because the subject in the sonnet is one that the persona has found erotically profitable, in part because the other poet may be superior in learning and style. Shakespeare is not concerned with poetic triumph he is vying only for the prize of a fair friend. The combat between the two rivals is indirect and the speaker never addresses his literary adversary and only mentions his beloved. It is the body language of Sonnet 78 (the first in the series) [[Sonnet 79|79]], [[Sonnet 80|80]] and [[Sonnet 84|84]] that serves to convert the topic of letters into that of eroticism. Shakespeare is known for his usage of puns and double meaning on words. So it isn't surprising that he uses wordplay in the first quatrain on \"pen\" for the male appendage, or, as a Stein-cum-Joyce might say, \"a pen is a penis a pen,\" is fully utilized. The poet remarks at 78.4, \"every alien pen hath got my use,\" where \"alien\" = 'of a stranger' and \"use,\" besides 'literary practice,' can = 'carnal enjoyment.'<ref name=Pequigney/> These sexual allusions are made in passing; they are overtones, restricted to a line or two.\n \n===Debate in Sonnet 78===\n\nIn Sonnet 78, Shakespeare has a mock debate between the young man and himself: \"The mock-debate of the sonnet is: should the young man be prouder of Shakespeare's poem compiled out of rude ignorance, or of those of his more learned admirers?\" This question is followed by a mock answer: \"The mock answer is that the young man should be prouder of having taught a hitherto dumb admirer to sing, and of having advanced ignorance as high as learning, because these achievements on his part testify more impressively to his originally power than his (slighter) accomplishments with respect to his learned poets \u2014 he but mends their style and graces their arts.\" The debate that Shakespeare presents is \"in a Petrarchan logical structure, with a clearly demarcated octave and sestet.\" Shakespeare exhibits his present art as at least equal to that of his rivals. He accomplishes this \"by first resorting to a country-bumpkin, fairy-tale idiot-son role, presenting himself as a Cinderella, so to speak, raised from the cinders to the skies.\"<ref name=Vendler />\n \nAccording to Helen Vendler,\n<blockquote>The most interesting grammatical move in the poem is the use in Q2 of aspectual description: not \"thou hast\" as we would expect \u2014 to parallel the later \"thou dost\" and \"thou art\" \u2014 but ''thine eyes...have''. The eyes govern the only four-line syntactic span (the rest of the poem is written in two-line units). We are made to pause for a two-line relative clause between ''thine eyes'' and its verb, ''have''; in between subject and predicate we find ... the poet twice arising, once to sing, once to fly:\n:Thine eyes, ''that taught the dumb on high to sing'', \n:''And heavy ignorance aloft to fly'',\n:Have added...<ref name=Vendler /></blockquote>\n\nVendler compares the speaker's praise of the young man (sonnet 78) to his praise of the mistress's eyes (sonnet 132): \"The speaker's yearning aspectual praise of the young man's eyes is comparable to his praise of the mistress' eyes in 132 (Thine eyes i love) the difference between direct second-person pronominal address to the beloved and third-person aspectual description of one of the beloved's attributes is exploited here and in 132.\"<ref name=Vendler /> \n \nTowards the end of the second quatrain, Vendler begins to question some of the metaphors and figurative language that Shakespeare has used: \"Does the learned's wing need added feathers? Coming after the first soaring of the speak, the heavy added feathers and given grace seem phonetically leaden, while later the line arts with thy sweet graces graced by suggest that the learned verse has become surfeited with elaboration.\"<ref name=Vendler /> Another author, R.J.C. Wait, has a contrasting view of the learned wings. \"The learneds wings represents another poet to whom Southampton has given inspiration.\"<ref name=Wait>Wait, J. C. The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken, 1972. 78-80. Print.</ref> \n \nThe last two lines of the sonnet, the couplet, begins \"but thou art my art.\" According to Vendler, \"the phonetically and grammatically tautological pun \u2014 'Thou ''art'' all my ''art'' ' \u2014 which conflates the copula and its predicate noun, enacts that plain mutual render, only me for thee (125) aspired to by the Sonnets and enacts as well the poet's simplicity contrasted with the affectations of the learned.\"<ref name=Vendler />\n\n==Rival Poet==\n{{main article|Rival Poet}}\n\n\"Shakespeare's sonnets 78-86 concern the Speaker's rivalry with other poets and especially with one 'better spirit' who is 'learned' and 'polished'\".<ref name=Jackson>Jackson, Mac.D P. \"Francis Meres and the Cultural Contexts of Shakespeare's Rival Poet Sonnets.\" Review of English Studies 56.224 (APR 2005): 224-46.

It follows the rhyme scheme, ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five feet in each line, and two syllables in each foot, accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are regular iambic pentameter, including the 5th line:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n  \u00d7    /      \u00d7    /     \u00d7    /   \u00d7   /   \u00d7   / \nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing (78.5)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n \n==Analysis==\nAccording to Helen Vendler, \"Shakespeare excels in a form of verbal emphasis pointing up the conceptual oppositions of his verse.\" In this first poem of the [[Rival Poet]] sequence, \"a firm antithesis is drawn between the putatively rude speaker and the other poets clustered round the young man.\" They are all \"learned\" and practicing both art and style, while \"the poor speaker's ignorance is twice insisted on, as is his muteness (he was dumb) before he saw the young man.\"<ref name=Vendler>Vendler, Helen Hennessy. \"78.\" The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1998. 351. Print.</ref>\n \nThe poem gives us directions as to how we should read it and which words we should emphasize: \"The words of the couplet tie \u2014 ''art'', ''high'', ''learning'' [''learn\u00e8d''], ''ignorance'' \u2014 repeat in little the topics that are under dispute.\"<ref name=Vendler />\n\nMichael Schoenfeldt notes, \"the more whimsical complimentary sonnets, such as 78\u2026 such sonnets may be fanciful, but they are not frivolous\u2026 Read from the right angle, so to speak, they can be very beautiful, or at least delightful; and in them, as elsewhere Shakespeare is inventing some game or other and playing it out to its conclusion in deft and surprising ways.<ref name=Schoenfeldt>\"Strategies of Unfolding.\" Compassion to Shakespeare Sonnets. Ed. Michael Schoenfeldt. Malden: Blackwell Pub, 2007. 38. Print.</ref>\n \nThe words \"pen\", \"feather\", and \"style\" \u2014 used in stanza 1, 2, and 3 respectively \u2014 seem to be related. The word \"pen\" derives from the Latin word ''penna'' meaning feather, and in the Renaissance referred to a quill pen, and also was occasionally used to indicate a \"feather\". The word \"style\" in line 11 means a writer\u2018s literary style, though it also could be used as a synonym for \"pen\"; it derives from the Latin ''stilus'' meaning a writing instrument.<ref name=Booth>Booth, Stephen. \"Sonnet 78.\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Edited with Anaylitic Commentary. Westford: Murray, 1977. Print</ref>\n \n\"Dumb\", \"ignorance\", \"learned\u2018s\", and \"grace\" are nouns that occur in the second stanza. The words \"dumb\" and \"ignorance\" could indicate the poet. \"Learned\" and \"grace\" could indicate a particular rival.<ref name=Booth/>\n \nIn line 7, the poet uses a \"metaphor from falconry and refers to the practice of imping, engrafting extra feathers in the wing of a bird\"<ref name=Booth/> in order to improve the health and flight of the bird. There are Italian allusions in Sonnet 78. For example, the phrase ''\"penna d'ingegno\"'' in Petrarch's sonnet 307, which means \u201cpen of genius\u201d, is analogous to Shakespeare's phrase \u201clearned's wing\u201d. The reference to falconry is often noted, but not the reference to Petrarch's sonnet.<ref name=Eriksen>Eriksen, Roy T. \"Extant And In Choice Italian: Possible Italian Echoes In Julius Caesar And Sonnet 78.\" English Studies 69.3 (1988): 224.

The figure here occurs as a demonstration of what is stated in line 8.<ref name=Booth/>\n \nIn line 13's phrase \"thou art all my art\" Shakespeare uses a rhetorical device known as antanaclasis, in which a word is used twice in different senses. The effect of the antanaclasis works as a metaphor for the basic meaning of the clause: \"the beloved's being and the speaker's art are one and the same thing\".<ref name=Booth/> Joel Fineman suggests an alternative interpretation: \"Instead of 'thou art all my art', writing itself stands \u2014 not subtly, but explictiy \u2014between the poet's first and second persons. Writing itself (the same writing written by \"I\" the poet and by the \"thou\" of the young man) gives the poet an ontological and poetic art of interference whose transference both is and is not what it is supposed to be\"<ref>Fineman, Joel.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986</ref>\n\n==Context==\n\nSonnet 78 we find out about a rival who's male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86.<ref name=Pequigney>Pequigney, Joseph. \"Jealous Thoughts.\" Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare Sonnets. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1985. 103+. Print.</ref> The rivalry between the poets may appear to be literary, but, according to the critic Joseph Pequigney, it is in reality a sexual rivalry. This is disturbing because the subject in the sonnet is one that the persona has found erotically profitable, in part because the other poet may be superior in learning and style. Shakespeare is not concerned with poetic triumph he is vying only for the prize of a fair friend. The combat between the two rivals is indirect and the speaker never addresses his literary adversary and only mentions his beloved. It is the body language of Sonnet 78 (the first in the series) [[Sonnet 79|79]], [[Sonnet 80|80]] and [[Sonnet 84|84]] that serves to convert the topic of letters into that of eroticism. Shakespeare is known for his usage of puns and double meaning on words. So it isn't surprising that he uses wordplay in the first quatrain on \"pen\" for the male appendage, or, as a Stein-cum-Joyce might say, \"a pen is a penis a pen,\" is fully utilized. The poet remarks at 78.4, \"every alien pen hath got my use,\" where \"alien\" = 'of a stranger' and \"use,\" besides 'literary practice,' can = 'carnal enjoyment.'<ref name=Pequigney/> These sexual allusions are made in passing; they are overtones, restricted to a line or two.\n \n===Debate in Sonnet 78===\n\nIn Sonnet 78, Shakespeare has a mock debate between the young man and himself: \"The mock-debate of the sonnet is: should the young man be prouder of Shakespeare's poem compiled out of rude ignorance, or of those of his more learned admirers?\" This question is followed by a mock answer: \"The mock answer is that the young man should be prouder of having taught a hitherto dumb admirer to sing, and of having advanced ignorance as high as learning, because these achievements on his part testify more impressively to his originally power than his (slighter) accomplishments with respect to his learned poets \u2014 he but mends their style and graces their arts.\" The debate that Shakespeare presents is \"in a Petrarchan logical structure, with a clearly demarcated octave and sestet.\" Shakespeare exhibits his present art as at least equal to that of his rivals. He accomplishes this \"by first resorting to a country-bumpkin, fairy-tale idiot-son role, presenting himself as a Cinderella, so to speak, raised from the cinders to the skies.\"<ref name=Vendler />\n \nAccording to Helen Vendler,\n<blockquote>The most interesting grammatical move in the poem is the use in Q2 of aspectual description: not \"thou hast\" as we would expect \u2014 to parallel the later \"thou dost\" and \"thou art\" \u2014 but ''thine eyes...have''. The eyes govern the only four-line syntactic span (the rest of the poem is written in two-line units). We are made to pause for a two-line relative clause between ''thine eyes'' and its verb, ''have''; in between subject and predicate we find ... the poet twice arising, once to sing, once to fly:\n:Thine eyes, ''that taught the dumb on high to sing'', \n:''And heavy ignorance aloft to fly'',\n:Have added...<ref name=Vendler /></blockquote>\n\nVendler compares the speaker's praise of the young man (sonnet 78) to his praise of the mistress's eyes (sonnet 132): \"The speaker's yearning aspectual praise of the young man's eyes is comparable to his praise of the mistress' eyes in 132 (Thine eyes i love) the difference between direct second-person pronominal address to the beloved and third-person aspectual description of one of the beloved's attributes is exploited here and in 132.\"<ref name=Vendler /> \n \nTowards the end of the second quatrain, Vendler begins to question some of the metaphors and figurative language that Shakespeare has used: \"Does the learned's wing need added feathers? Coming after the first soaring of the speak, the heavy added feathers and given grace seem phonetically leaden, while later the line arts with thy sweet graces graced by suggest that the learned verse has become surfeited with elaboration.\"<ref name=Vendler /> Another author, R.J.C. Wait, has a contrasting view of the learned wings. \"The learneds wings represents another poet to whom Southampton has given inspiration.\"<ref name=Wait>Wait, J. C. The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken, 1972. 78-80. Print.</ref> \n \nThe last two lines of the sonnet, the couplet, begins \"but thou art my art.\" According to Vendler, \"the phonetically and grammatically tautological pun \u2014 'Thou ''art'' all my ''art'' ' \u2014 which conflates the copula and its predicate noun, enacts that plain mutual render, only me for thee (125) aspired to by the Sonnets and enacts as well the poet's simplicity contrasted with the affectations of the learned.\"<ref name=Vendler />\n\n==Rival Poet==\n{{main article|Rival Poet}}\n\n\"Shakespeare's sonnets 78-86 concern the Speaker's rivalry with other poets and especially with one 'better spirit' who is 'learned' and 'polished'\".<ref name=Jackson>Jackson, Mac.D P. \"Francis Meres and the Cultural Contexts of Shakespeare's Rival Poet Sonnets.\" Review of English Studies 56.224 (APR 2005): 224-46.

At the U.S. federal level, an organization becomes a PAC when it receives or spends more than $1,000 for the purpose of influencing a federal election, and registers with the [[Federal Election Commission]], according to the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] as amended by the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002 (also known as the McCain-Feingold Act).<ref>{{USC|52|30101}}{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section30101&num=0&edition=prelim |accessdate=2017-06-03|title=&#91;USC02&#93; 52 USC 30101: Definitions}}</ref> At the state level, an organization becomes a PAC according to the state's [[election law]]s.\n\nContributions from corporate or labor union treasuries are illegal, though they may sponsor a PAC and provide financial support for its administration and fundraising.

These PACs receive and raise money from a \"restricted class\", generally consisting of managers and shareholders in the case of a corporation or members in the case of a non-profit organization, labor union or other interest group.

FEC Chairman [[Steven T. Walther]] dissented on both opinions and issued a statement giving his thoughts. In the statement, Walther stated \"There are provisions of the Act and Commission regulations ''not addressed by the court in SpeechNow'' that continue to prohibit Commonsense Ten from soliciting or accepting contributions from political committees in excess of $5,000 annually or any contributions from corporations or labor organizations\" (emphasis in original).<ref>[http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1144645.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe term \"Super PAC\" was coined by reporter Eliza Newlin Carney.<ref>[http://mattcorley.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/morris-fiorina-super-pac-2002/ \"Component Parts\"], Matt Corley, March 14, 2012</ref> According to ''Politico'', Carney, a staff writer covering lobbying and influence for ''[[CQ Roll Call]]'', \"made the first identifiable, published reference to 'super PAC' as it's known today while working at ''[[National Journal]]'', writing on June 26, 2010, of a group called Workers' Voices, that it was a kind of {{\"'}}super PAC' that could become increasingly popular in the post-Citizens United world.\"<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71285.html \"How Super PACs got their name\"], Dave Levinthal, Politico, January 10, 2012</ref>\n\nAccording to FEC [[Advisory opinion|advisories]], Super PACs are not allowed to coordinate directly with candidates or political parties.

Their advisory opinions gave a sample wording letter which all Super PACs must submit to qualify for the deregulated status, and such letters continue to be used by Super PACs up to the present date. FEC Chairman [[Steven T. Walther]] dissented on both opinions and issued a statement giving his thoughts. In the statement, Walther stated \"There are provisions of the Act and Commission regulations ''not addressed by the court in SpeechNow'' that continue to prohibit Commonsense Ten from soliciting or accepting contributions from political committees in excess of $5,000 annually or any contributions from corporations or labor organizations\" (emphasis in original).<ref>[http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1144645.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe term \"Super PAC\" was coined by reporter Eliza Newlin Carney.<ref>[http://mattcorley.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/morris-fiorina-super-pac-2002/ \"Component Parts\"], Matt Corley, March 14, 2012</ref> According to ''Politico'', Carney, a staff writer covering lobbying and influence for ''[[CQ Roll Call]]'', \"made the first identifiable, published reference to 'super PAC' as it's known today while working at ''[[National Journal]]'', writing on June 26, 2010, of a group called Workers' Voices, that it was a kind of {{\"'}}super PAC' that could become increasingly popular in the post-Citizens United world.\"<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71285.html \"How Super PACs got their name\"], Dave Levinthal, Politico, January 10, 2012</ref>\n\nAccording to FEC [[Advisory opinion|advisories]], Super PACs are not allowed to coordinate directly with candidates or political parties. This restriction is intended to prevent them from operating campaigns that complement or parallel those of the candidates they support or engaging in negotiations that could result in ''[[quid pro quo]]'' bargaining between donors to the PAC and the candidate or officeholder.

He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor.

He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A.

They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the [[News Review]] from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A.

They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>'Crystal Hale' obituary, in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]].

Duncan-Jones, Katherine. ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets''. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 257 {{ISBN|9781408017975}}.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Sonnet 73''', one of the most famous of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Shakespeare's sonnets|154 sonnets]], focuses on the theme of old age. The sonnet addresses the [[Shakespeare's_sonnets#Fair_Youth|Fair Youth]]. Each of the three [[quatrain]]s contains a [[metaphor]]: Autumn, the passing of a day, and the dying out of a fire. Each metaphor proposes a way the young man may see the poet.{{sfn|Hovey|1962}}\n\n== Analysis and synopsis ==\n\nBarbara Estermann discusses William Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 in relation to the beginning of the Renaissance. She argues that the speaker of Sonnet 73 is comparing himself to the universe through his transition from \"the physical act of aging to his final act of dying, and then to his death\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}} Esterman clarifies that throughout the three quatrains of Shakespeare's Sonnet 73; the speaker \"demonstrates man's relationship to the cosmos and the parallel properties which ultimately reveal his humanity and his link to the universe. Shakespeare thus compares the fading of his youth through the three elements of the universe: the fading of life, the fading of the light, and the dying of the fire\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}}\n\nThe first quatrain is described by Seymour-Smith: \"a highly compressed metaphor in which Shakespeare visualizes the ruined arches of churches, the memory of singing voices still echoing in them, and compares this with the naked boughs of early winter with which he identifies himself\".{{sfn|Atkins|2007|p=197}}\n\nIn the second quatrain, Shakespeare focuses on the \"twilight of such day\" as death approaches throughout the nighttime. Barbara Estermann states that, \"he is concerned with the change of light, from twilight to sunset to black night, revealing the last hours of life\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}}\n\nOf the third quatrain, Carl D. Atkins remarks, \"As the fire goes out when the wood which has been feeding it is consumed, so is life extinguished when the strength of youth is past\".{{sfn|Atkins|2007|p=198}} Barbara Estermann says it is concerned with, \"the fading out of life's energy\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}}\n\n==Structure==\nSonnet 73 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the [[rhyme scheme]] of the English sonnet form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] that has five feet per line, and each foot has two syllables accented weak then strong. Almost all of the lines follow this without variation, including the second line:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n  \u00d7   /  \u00d7   /      \u00d7   /    \u00d7   /    \u00d7  / \nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang (73.2)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n\n===Structure and metaphors===\nThe organization of the poem serves many roles in the overall effectiveness of the poem. Yet, one of the major roles implied by this scheme revolves around ending each quatrain with a complete phrase.

Further, many of the metaphors utilized in this sonnet were personified and overwhelmed by this connection between the speaker's youth and death bed.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=260}}\n\n== Interpretation and criticism ==\nJohn Prince says that the speaker is telling his listener about his own life and the certainty of death in his near future. The reader perceives this imminent death and, because he does, he loves the author even more. However, an alternative understanding of the sonnet presented by Prince asserts that the author does not intend to address death, but rather the passage of youth. With this, the topic of the sonnet moves from the speaker's life to the listener's life.{{sfn|Prince|1997|p=197}}\n\nRegarding the last line, \"this thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong, to love that well which thou must leave ere long\", Prince asks:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhy, if the speaker is referring to his own life, does he state that the listener must \"leave\" the speaker's life?  If the \"that\" in the final line does refer to the speaker's life, then why doesn't the last line read \"To love that well which thou must lose ere long?\"  Or why doesn't the action of leaving have as its subject the \"I\", the poet, who in death would leave behind his auditor?{{sfn|Prince|1997|p=197}}\n</blockquote>\n\nFrank Bernhard criticizes the metaphors Shakespeare uses to describe the passage of time, be it the coming of death or simply the loss of youth. Though lyrical, they are logically off and quite clich\u00e9, being the overused themes of seasonal change, sunset, and burn.  In fact, the only notably original line is the one concerning leaves, stating that \"when yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang, upon those boughs\".{{sfn|Frank|2003|p=3}} Logic would require that few should proceed none; in fact, if the boughs were bare, no leaves would hang.  Bernhard argues that Shakespeare did this on purpose, evoking sympathy from the reader as they \"wish to nurse and cherish what little is left\", taking him through the logic of pathos \u2013 ruefulness, to resignation, to sympathy.{{sfn|Frank|2003|p=4}} This logic, Bernhard asserts, dictates the entire sonnet.  Instead of moving from hour, to day, to year with fire, then sunset, then seasons, Shakespeare moves backwards.  By making time shorter and shorter, the reader's fleeting mortality comes into focus, while sympathy for the speaker grows.  This logic of pathos can be seen in the images in the  sonnet's three quatrains. Bernhard explains:\n\n<blockquote>\nThink now of the sonnet's three quatrains as a rectangular grid with one row for each of the governing images, and with four vertical columns:\n{|\n|spring || summer{{pad|2em}} || fall || winter\n|-\n|morning{{pad|2em}} || noon || evening{{pad|2em}} || night\n|-\n|tree || log || ember || ashes\n|}\nThese divisions of the images seem perfectly congruous, but they are not. In the year the cold of winter takes up one quarter of the row; in the day, night takes up one half of the row; in the final row, however, death begins the moment the tree is chopped down into logs.{{sfn|Frank|2003|p=4}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThis is a gradual progression to hopelessness.  The sun goes away in the winter, but returns in the spring; it sets in the evening, but will rise in the morning; but the tree that has been chopped into logs and burned into ashes will never grow again.  Bernhard concludes by arguing that the end couplet, compared to the beautifully crafted logic of pathos created prior, is anti-climactic and redundant.  The poem's first three quatrains mean more to the reader than the seemingly important summation of the final couplet.{{sfn|Frank|2003|p=4}}\n\nThough he agrees with Bernhard in that the poem seems to create two themes, one which argues for devotion from a younger lover to one who will not be around much longer, and another which urges the young lover to enjoy his fleeting youth, James Schiffer asserts that the final couplet, instead of being unneeded and unimportant, brings the two interpretations together.  In order to understand this, he explains that the reader must look at the preceding sonnets, 71 and 72, and the subsequent sonnet, 74.  He explains:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe older poet may desire to \"love more strong\" from the younger man but feels, as 72 discloses, that he does not deserve it.  This psychological conflict explains why the couplet hovers equivocally between the conclusions \"to love me\", which the persona cannot bring himself to ask for outright, and \"to love your youth\", the impersonal alternative exacted by his self-contempt.{{sfn|Pequigney|2013|p=294}}\n</blockquote>\n\nBy reading the final couplet in this manner, the reader will realize that the two discordant meanings of the final statement do in fact merge to provide a more complex impression of the author's state of mind.  Furthermore, this successfully puts the focus of the reader on the psyche of the \"I\", which is the subject of the following sonnet 74.\n\n==Possible sources for the third quatrain's metaphor==\n\nA few possible sources have been suggested for both of two passages in Shakespeare's works: a scene in the play ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', and the third quatrain in Sonnet 73.

Act II, scene 2, line 32 - 33.</ref>  In the quatrain of Sonnet 73 the image is of a fire being choked by ashes, which is a bit different from an upside down torch, however the quatrain contains in English the same idea that is expressed in Latin on the impressa in ''Pericles'': \"Consum'd with that which it was nourished by.\" \"Consumed\" may not be the obvious word choice for being extinguished by ashes, but it allows for the irony of a consuming fire being consumed.<ref>Young, Alan R. \"A Note on\u00a0the Tournament Impresa in ''Pericles''\u201d.

The sonnet addresses the [[Shakespeare's_sonnets#Fair_Youth|Fair Youth]]. Each of the three [[quatrain]]s contains a [[metaphor]]: Autumn, the passing of a day, and the dying out of a fire. Each metaphor proposes a way the young man may see the poet.{{sfn|Hovey|1962}}\n\n== Analysis and synopsis ==\n\nBarbara Estermann discusses William Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 in relation to the beginning of the Renaissance. She argues that the speaker of Sonnet 73 is comparing himself to the universe through his transition from \"the physical act of aging to his final act of dying, and then to his death\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}} Esterman clarifies that throughout the three quatrains of Shakespeare's Sonnet 73; the speaker \"demonstrates man's relationship to the cosmos and the parallel properties which ultimately reveal his humanity and his link to the universe. Shakespeare thus compares the fading of his youth through the three elements of the universe: the fading of life, the fading of the light, and the dying of the fire\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}}\n\nThe first quatrain is described by Seymour-Smith: \"a highly compressed metaphor in which Shakespeare visualizes the ruined arches of churches, the memory of singing voices still echoing in them, and compares this with the naked boughs of early winter with which he identifies himself\".{{sfn|Atkins|2007|p=197}}\n\nIn the second quatrain, Shakespeare focuses on the \"twilight of such day\" as death approaches throughout the nighttime. Barbara Estermann states that, \"he is concerned with the change of light, from twilight to sunset to black night, revealing the last hours of life\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}}\n\nOf the third quatrain, Carl D. Atkins remarks, \"As the fire goes out when the wood which has been feeding it is consumed, so is life extinguished when the strength of youth is past\".{{sfn|Atkins|2007|p=198}} Barbara Estermann says it is concerned with, \"the fading out of life's energy\".{{sfn|Estermann|1980}}\n\n==Structure==\nSonnet 73 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the [[rhyme scheme]] of the English sonnet form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] that has five feet per line, and each foot has two syllables accented weak then strong. Almost all of the lines follow this without variation, including the second line:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n  \u00d7   /  \u00d7   /      \u00d7   /    \u00d7   /    \u00d7  / \nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang (73.2)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n\n===Structure and metaphors===\nThe organization of the poem serves many roles in the overall effectiveness of the poem. Yet, one of the major roles implied by this scheme revolves around ending each quatrain with a complete phrase. Given the rhyme scheme of every other line within the quatrain, as an audience we are to infer a statement is being made by the end of every four lines. Further, when shifted toward the next four lines, a shift in the overall thought process is being made by the author.\n\nIf Shakespeare's use of a complete phrase within the rhyme scheme implies a statement then the use of a consistent metaphor at the end of each quatrain shows both the author's acknowledgement of his own mortality and a cynical view on aging. This view on aging is interconnected with the inverse introduction of each symbol within the poem. By dropping from a year, to a day, to the brief duration of a fire, Shakespeare is establishing empathy for our speaker through the lapse in time.{{sfn|Frank|2003|p=3}} Additionally, the three metaphors utilized pointed to the universal natural phenomenon linked with existence. This phenomenon involved the realization of transience, decay, and death.{{sfn|Schroeter|1962}}\n\nOverall, the structure and use of metaphors are two connected entities toward the overall progression within the sonnet. Seen as a harsh critic on age, Shakespeare sets up the negative effects of aging in the three quatrains of this poem. These aspects not only take on a universal aspect from the symbols, but represent the inevitability of a gradual lapse in the element of time in general from their placement in the poem.

Appended to this work is \"A discourse of Impreses\", the first English collection of emblems, in which Daniel describes an ''impresa'' that contains the image of a down-turned torch:\n\n:\"An amorous gentleman of Milan bare in his Standard a Torch figured burning, and turning downeward, whereby the melting wax falling in great aboundance, quencheth the flame.  With this Posie thereunto. ''Quod me alit me extinguit.'' Alluding to a Lady whose beautie did foster his love, and whose disdayne did endamage his life.\"{{sfn|Kau|1975}}\n\nKau's suggestion, however, has been confuted, because Kau made it crucial to his argument that Shakespeare and Daniel both used the Latin word ''quod'' rather than ''qui'', however Shakespeare in fact nowhere uses the word ''quod''.<ref>Young, Alan R. \"A Note on\u00a0the Tournament Impresa in ''Pericles''\u201d.

Four companies from the [[26th Missouri Volunteer Infantry]] tried to fill the gap but were driven back by the 3rd Louisiana. When Hebert sent the 40th Mississippi to attack the Federal right flank, the 5th Iowa retreated, having suffered 217 casualties in 75 minutes of battle. The four companies of the 26th Missouri sustained 97 casualties.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|pp=92\u201395}} Later, when a Federal attack threatened to overrun the regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Gilmore led a charge that drove them back. Earlier, Gilmore had taken five flesh wounds, but he finally took a bullet in the shoulder. Meanwhile, Major Russell rode to the rear to stop [[friendly fire]] from hitting the Louisianans in the back.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=106}} Out of 264 men taken into battle, the 3rd Louisiana lost about 40% casualties.{{sfn|National Park Service|2017}}     \n\nAt the [[Second Battle of Corinth]] on 3-4 October 1862, the 3rd Louisiana Infantry was in W.

The brigade had the same units as at Iuka.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=327}} On 3 October, Colbert's brigade started the day in reserve behind Hebert's three frontline brigades{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=167}} and apparently ended the day in reserve.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=203}} On 4 October, Van Dorn ordered Hebert's division to attack at dawn. At 7:00 am, Hebert reported himself ill at headquarters and was replaced by [[Martin E.

The 3rd Louisiana fought against the same Federal units that it fought at Iuka (5th Iowa). After 45 minutes of fighting, Colbert's soldiers were repulsed with severe losses. The 3rd Louisiana suffered 32 casualties, or about one-third of the soldiers who went into battle.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|pp=250\u2013251}}\n\n===1863\u20131865===\nIn the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], 18 May \u2013 4 July 1863, the 3rd Louisiana Infantry commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell and seconded by Major David Pierson was in Hebert's brigade of [[John Horace Forney]]'s division. During the siege, the brigade suffered losses of 219 killed, 455 wounded, and 21 missing.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987b|p=549}} On 25 June, the Union forces exploded a mine under the 3rd Louisiana Redan and killed six men and wounded 21 more.{{sfn|Cormier|2018}} The Federals occupied the crater left by the explosion, but the Confederates were able to throw [[grenades]] into the seized position, inflicting about 30 casualties.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987b|p=528}} On 1 July, a second mine was detonated under the 3rd Louisiana's defenses, killing one and wounding 21.{{sfn|Cormier|2018}} This time Union troops made no attempt to occupy the position.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987b|p=528}} The Confederates surrendered at Vicksburg and the soldiers were paroled until they could be exchanged.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987b|p=533}}\n\nThe 3rd Louisiana Infantry's soldiers were officially exchanged on 12 September 1863 and ordered to report to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. However, very few of the men showed up.{{sfn|Cormier|2018}} By December 1863, there were only 38 fit men in camp.{{sfn|National Park Service|2017}} The regiment was not mustered until July 1864 at [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]].

During this period, the 3rd Louisiana was assigned to [[Allen Thomas]]'s brigade in [[Camille Armand Jules Marie, Prince de Polignac|Camille de Polignac's]] division. The regiment disbanded on 20 May 1865. A few men from the regiment were absorbed into the 22nd Louisiana Consolidated Regiment as Company H at [[Enterprise, Mississippi]] in January 1864.

It's a member of the [[The Sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. It focuses on the speaker's aging and impending death in relation to his young lover.<ref>Wait, R. J. C. \"Introduction.\" The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken, 1972. 7-17. Print.</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nShakespeare's sonnet cycle has overarching themes of great love and the passage of time. In this sonnet, the speaker is now concentrating on his own death and how the youth is to mourn him after he is deceased. The speaker tells the youth not to mourn for him when he is dead, and that the youth should only think about him for as long as it takes to tell the world of his death. The speaker then tells his beloved youth that if even reading this sonnet will cause him to suffer, he should forget the hand that wrote the poem. Joseph Pequigney writes that the sonnet is a \"persuasive appeal to be recalled, loved and lamented\u2026a covert counterthesis\".<ref>Schiffer, James.

Web. 29 October 2012</ref> While many critics agree with Peguiney and Booth, and have said that this sonnet is a veiled attempt on the part of the speaker to actually invoke the youth to mourn him, some critics believe differently. Helen Vendler writes that \"There are also, I believe, sonnets of hapless love--intended as such by the author, expressed as such by the speaker.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen, and Helen Vendler.

It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The first line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /  \u00d7   /     \u00d7   /   \u00d7  / \u00d7   / \nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead (71.1)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n\n==Context==\nSonnet 71 is one of the first 126 sonnets which address the putative young man.<ref>Cheney, Patrick, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's Poetry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. Print. pg 126.</ref> It is more specifically a part of four sonnets (71-74), which are \"humble bids for affection, cast in tones of deepest gloom.\"<ref>Wait, R. J. C. The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken Books, 1972. Print. pg. 73-74.</ref> Sonnets 71 and 72 are linked: a double sonnet.<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 327.</ref> Krieger explains the poet's pleas to the beloved friend to cooperate with time and the world in two ways. He pleads for him to not allow love to outlast the poet's life and to not bestow more values on the poet and his work than is warranted.<ref>Krieger, Murray. A Window to Criticism: Shakespeare's Sonnets and the Modern Poetics. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1964. Print. pg. 120.</ref> Essentially the poet in Sonnet 71 develops the idea that he is one of the causes as to why the youth \"is suspect of the wise world.\"<ref>Baldwin, T. W. On the Literary Genetics of Shakespeare's Poems and Sonnets. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1950. Print. pg. 248.</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n===Quatrain 1===\n<blockquote><poem>\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\nFrom this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Guyer, the first line says that once the speaker of the sonnets is dead there should be no mourning, but it is phrased in such a way that says the mourning is happening now, at a point in life and living. Guyer's interpretation focuses heavily on time and the importance of that time used for mourning. In the line there is a limit of time being set aside for mourning, only in life, but after life has ended the mourning must stop. The line ends in dead, finality, giving the false sense that the sentence is over and yet it continues through to the second line. The second line gives the brief time between life and the sound of the bell to mourn and it seems to contradict the first line. The sonnet seems to be firmly against mourning after death, but really it is for mourning the dead but only in a timely manner. \"The sonnet's first-person subject demands that mourning\u2014even if it lasts only for one minute or one day\u2014coincides with, rather than succeed, the death knell that will \"Give warning to the world that I am fled.\"<ref>Guyer, Sara. \"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122561>.</ref>\n\nGuyer continues on to say that the \"Giving warning\", describes the bell's message and follows the imperative tense of the first line, [You] give warning mirrors [you] no longer mourn. \"The bell that marks the death also marks the duration of the addressee's mourning, and thus sounds a second obligation.\" The word fled insinuates a presence not no longer existing but being off and gone somewhere else or displaced, an absence. The use of the word dead implies there is no return, while the use of fled opens possibilities of returning.<ref>Guyer, Sara. \"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122561>.</ref> The last line of the first quatrain follows the fled term, \"fled\", or fleeing from a \"vile\" world and insinuates that the next world is even worse as it is where the vilest worms dwell. This creates the question of if it is any better after death than it was in life.<ref>Guyer, Sara. \"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122561>.</ref>\n\nBooth takes a different approach to the sonnets. He suggests that the entire sonnet is an \"emblem of the poets self-mocking tactics. He argues that though the sonnet works to remind the reader to forget the speaker, it is also contradicts as it constantly reminds the reader of the speaker. His comment on the reading of the first quatrain is that, the experience of reading the poem \"an experience of being unable to get on to something new.\" Booth sees the \"Give warning\" not only as a literal warning of death but a comment of mortality, \"an idea that undercuts the advice the speaker purports to offer by inviting a wider view of all particular deaths that his mundane premises allow for.\" This reading takes a particular view of the speaker and highlights the theme of aging in the sonnets.<ref>Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New Haven: Yale UP, 1977. Print.</ref>\n\n===Quatrain 2===\n<blockquote><poem>\nNay, if you read this line, remember not\nThe hand that writ it; for I love you so\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn quatrain two, the speaker implores the young man to forget the hand that wrote the sonnet if the mere thought of the speaker would cause him to mourn. This is particularly ironic considering that there are lines in other sonnets (e.g., Sonnet 18, Sonnet 55, Sonnet 65 and Sonnet 81) that speak of immortality through poetic verse, thus negating the possibility that one can be forgotten.\n\nThese examples give credence to Peguiney's argument of a calculated attempt to invoke the youth's mourning, as he writes in his essay Sonnets 71\u201374, \"The 'if' clauses at lines 5 and 9 are cunning invitations to future readings of the verse, and how impossible it would be for 'you [to] read this [handwritten] line' and 'remember not / The hand that writ it'\" (p 287). In this same vein, Stephen Booth writes that the \"narcissistic smugness of the speaker's gesture of selflessness is made ridiculously apparent by the logic of the situation he evokes: a survivor rereading a poem about forgetting the deceased speaker must necessarily be reminded of him.\"<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Stephen Booth. Shakespeare's Sonnets / Edited With Analytic Commentary By Stephen Booth. n.p.: New Haven : Yale University Press, 1977., 1977. SLU Libraries Catalog. Web. 29 Oct. 2012</ref>\n\nConversely, Helen Vendler, in her book The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, writes that this sonnet can indeed be read honestly, that is, as a real-life love predicament wherein two lovers are having a candid discussion of their love for one another. Here, she writes a suicidal dialogue from which she infers the sonnet could have been written:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n''Poet'': I am going to flee this vile world, preferring a dwelling with vilest worms to any further existence here. What will you do after my death?\n''Beloved'': I will mourn you forever.\n''Poet'': No, mourn for me no longer than it takes to toll my passing bell.\n''Beloved'': Well, then I will read your lines, and grieve while reading them.\n''Poet'': Nay, if you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it, if that memory would cause you grief.\n''Beloved'': Then I will, from love, mention your name to others.\n''Poet'': No, do not rehearse my name, but let your love for me cease when me life does.\n''Beloved'': Why do you forbid me to remember you, grieve for you, read you, name you?\n''Poet'': Because the world, which has so mocked me, will then associate you with me, and you will find yourself by association.<ref>Vendler, Helen, and Helen Vendler.

Web. 29 Oct. 2012</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis reading is also possible, as the speaker in other sonnets did speak of his name having a stigma attached to it (Sonnet 111), of being despised and disgraced by men (Sonnet 29), and also of being battered and oppressed by the world (Sonnet 27 and Sonnet 28).\n\n===Quatrain 3===\n<blockquote><poem>\nO, if, I say, you look upon this verse\nWhen I perhaps compounded am with clay,\nDo not so much as my poor name rehearse.\nBut let your love even with my life decay,\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThroughout the entire sonnet there seems to be a movement of mourning from very real and apparent to basically vanished. By quatrain 3 the subject \"narrows from the hand to the mere name [of the speaker]\u2014as if to render the mourning ever more tenuous, while having the beloved still enact the putatively wished-for behavior.\" Vendler points out the increasingly distanced view of the speaker and his expression. By this quatrain \"the speaker is wholly compounded\u2026 with clay, dissolved into dust.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 329.</ref>\n\nThe sonnet as a whole leads the reader's mind and emotion to the climax, line 12.<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 49.</ref> It is in this line that there is an affirmation of the return of love.<ref>Pequigney, Joseph. \"Sonnets 71-74: Texts and Contexts\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. Ed.

Ed. James Schiffer. New York: Garland Publishing, 199. Print. pg. 286.</ref>\n\nAs par the structure of this particular quatrain, it seems to tie the sonnet all together. As Ingram illustrates, \"line 10 look[s] back to lines 1-4\" and \"line 11 and 12 to the gentler, un-self-regarding tone of lines 5-8.\" Additionally, these lines within quatrain three contrast because of line 10's \"harsh alliterating c's and echoic 'compounded'\" and line 12's \"soft alliterating l's\".<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 61-62.</ref> Atkins adds \"as Ingram and Redpath note, [there is] a great variety of stress , supplying a fluidity that, surprisingly perhaps, allows the author to keep the third quatrain's interloped feet ('I say' [line 9], 'perhaps' [line 10]) and reversed word order ('compounded am' [line 10]) from appearing clumsy.\"<ref>Atkins, Carl D., ed.

Print. pg. 193.</ref>\n\n===Couplet===\n<blockquote><poem>\nLest the wise world should look into your moan\nAnd mock you with me after I am gone.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe couplet tie at the end of the sonnet \"sums up the poem: look, mourn (moan), world\".<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 328.</ref> By the couplet \"[the speaker] is gone, no longer corporeal at all.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 329.</ref> While the quatrains lead up to a climax in quatrain 3, the couplet suggests a point, a succinct conclusion.<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 53.</ref> According to Atkins, in the couplet \"The primary notion is that the world will judge the poet's shortcoming only too well,\" as clarified by Tucker [1924]. After the speaker's urge for the beloved not to mourn him, one might expect several different orthodox explanations at the conclusion. Instead of what is expected \"we get: 'Forget me when I am dead \u2013 after all, someone might make fun of you.'\"<ref>Atkins, Carl D., ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Press, 2007. Print. pg. 192-193.</ref>\n\nAlternately, Pequigney believes \"the answer [as to what the couplet means] depends on our mood as we read it.\" He maintains that \"we learn more about ourselves when we interpret this poem than we do about its author.\"<ref>Pequigney, Joseph. \"Sonnets 71-74: Texts and Contexts\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. Ed. James Schiffer. New York: Garland Publishing, 199. Print.</ref>\n\nOverall, \"the couplet is superbly organized, both in the management of its rhythms and in its backward verbal reflection to the patterning of the whole poem.\"<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 62.</ref>\n\n==Irony==\nThere seems to be a couple different types of irony in the sonnets in general that which is \"openly voiced by the speaker and authorial irony suggested at the expense of the (deceived) speaker.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 327.</ref> There seems to a sense of irony when the speaker tells the beloved to forget him. Schoenfeldt reasons that \"we cannot quite take these lines literally\" because \"to tell someone to forget something is to make it harder for them to forget.\" This demonstrates a certain \"reverse-psychology appeal\" as a sense of irony.<ref>Schoenfeldt, Michael, ed. A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Print. pg. 356.</ref> Furthermore \"the shift from the 'vile world' (line 4) to the 'wise world' (line 13) is the final evidence of Shakespeare's irony\" in this particular sonnet. Krieger goes on to explain: \"For this world is wise\u2014that is, shrewd, prudential\u2014only as it is vile, only as it exercises those characteristics which ape the destructive perfection, the absolute cooperation with time, of the 'vilest worms.'\" He questions, \"How single-mindedly, then, is his friend to take this selfless, seemingly anti-sentimental injunction to obey the dictates of the world's cold wisdom lest he be mocked by it?\"<ref>Krieger, Murray.

It's a member of the [[The Sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. It focuses on the speaker's aging and impending death in relation to his young lover.<ref>Wait, R. J. C. \"Introduction.\" The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken, 1972. 7-17. Print.</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nShakespeare's sonnet cycle has overarching themes of great love and the passage of time. In this sonnet, the speaker is now concentrating on his own death and how the youth is to mourn him after he is deceased. The speaker tells the youth not to mourn for him when he is dead, and that the youth should only think about him for as long as it takes to tell the world of his death. The speaker then tells his beloved youth that if even reading this sonnet will cause him to suffer, he should forget the hand that wrote the poem. Joseph Pequigney writes that the sonnet is a \"persuasive appeal to be recalled, loved and lamented\u2026a covert counterthesis\".<ref>Schiffer, James.

Web. 29 October 2012</ref> While many critics agree with Peguiney and Booth, and have said that this sonnet is a veiled attempt on the part of the speaker to actually invoke the youth to mourn him, some critics believe differently. Helen Vendler writes that \"There are also, I believe, sonnets of hapless love--intended as such by the author, expressed as such by the speaker.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen, and Helen Vendler.

It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The first line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /  \u00d7   /     \u00d7   /   \u00d7  / \u00d7   / \nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead (71.1)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n\n==Context==\nSonnet 71 is one of the first 126 sonnets which address the putative young man.<ref>Cheney, Patrick, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's Poetry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. Print. pg 126.</ref> It is more specifically a part of four sonnets (71-74), which are \"humble bids for affection, cast in tones of deepest gloom.\"<ref>Wait, R. J. C. The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken Books, 1972. Print. pg. 73-74.</ref> Sonnets 71 and 72 are linked: a double sonnet.<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 327.</ref> Krieger explains the poet's pleas to the beloved friend to cooperate with time and the world in two ways. He pleads for him to not allow love to outlast the poet's life and to not bestow more values on the poet and his work than is warranted.<ref>Krieger, Murray. A Window to Criticism: Shakespeare's Sonnets and the Modern Poetics. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1964. Print. pg. 120.</ref> Essentially the poet in Sonnet 71 develops the idea that he is one of the causes as to why the youth \"is suspect of the wise world.\"<ref>Baldwin, T. W. On the Literary Genetics of Shakespeare's Poems and Sonnets. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1950. Print. pg. 248.</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n===Quatrain 1===\n<blockquote><poem>\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\nFrom this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Guyer, the first line says that once the speaker of the sonnets is dead there should be no mourning, but it is phrased in such a way that says the mourning is happening now, at a point in life and living. Guyer's interpretation focuses heavily on time and the importance of that time used for mourning. In the line there is a limit of time being set aside for mourning, only in life, but after life has ended the mourning must stop. The line ends in dead, finality, giving the false sense that the sentence is over and yet it continues through to the second line. The second line gives the brief time between life and the sound of the bell to mourn and it seems to contradict the first line. The sonnet seems to be firmly against mourning after death, but really it is for mourning the dead but only in a timely manner. \"The sonnet's first-person subject demands that mourning\u2014even if it lasts only for one minute or one day\u2014coincides with, rather than succeed, the death knell that will \"Give warning to the world that I am fled.\"<ref>Guyer, Sara. \"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122561>.</ref>\n\nGuyer continues on to say that the \"Giving warning\", describes the bell's message and follows the imperative tense of the first line, [You] give warning mirrors [you] no longer mourn. \"The bell that marks the death also marks the duration of the addressee's mourning, and thus sounds a second obligation.\" The word fled insinuates a presence not no longer existing but being off and gone somewhere else or displaced, an absence. The use of the word dead implies there is no return, while the use of fled opens possibilities of returning.<ref>Guyer, Sara. \"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122561>.</ref> The last line of the first quatrain follows the fled term, \"fled\", or fleeing from a \"vile\" world and insinuates that the next world is even worse as it is where the vilest worms dwell. This creates the question of if it is any better after death than it was in life.<ref>Guyer, Sara. \"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122561>.</ref>\n\nBooth takes a different approach to the sonnets. He suggests that the entire sonnet is an \"emblem of the poets self-mocking tactics. He argues that though the sonnet works to remind the reader to forget the speaker, it is also contradicts as it constantly reminds the reader of the speaker. His comment on the reading of the first quatrain is that, the experience of reading the poem \"an experience of being unable to get on to something new.\" Booth sees the \"Give warning\" not only as a literal warning of death but a comment of mortality, \"an idea that undercuts the advice the speaker purports to offer by inviting a wider view of all particular deaths that his mundane premises allow for.\" This reading takes a particular view of the speaker and highlights the theme of aging in the sonnets.<ref>Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New Haven: Yale UP, 1977. Print.</ref>\n\n===Quatrain 2===\n<blockquote><poem>\nNay, if you read this line, remember not\nThe hand that writ it; for I love you so\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn quatrain two, the speaker implores the young man to forget the hand that wrote the sonnet if the mere thought of the speaker would cause him to mourn. This is particularly ironic considering that there are lines in other sonnets (e.g., Sonnet 18, Sonnet 55, Sonnet 65 and Sonnet 81) that speak of immortality through poetic verse, thus negating the possibility that one can be forgotten.\n\nThese examples give credence to Peguiney's argument of a calculated attempt to invoke the youth's mourning, as he writes in his essay Sonnets 71-74, \"The 'if' clauses at lines 5 and 9 are cunning invitations to future readings of the verse, and how impossible it would be for 'you [to] read this [handwritten] line' and 'remember not / The hand that writ it'\" (p 287). In this same vein, Stephen Booth writes that the \"narcissistic smugness of the speaker's gesture of selflessness is made ridiculously apparent by the logic of the situation he evokes: a survivor rereading a poem about forgetting the deceased speaker must necessarily be reminded of him.\"<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Stephen Booth. Shakespeare's Sonnets / Edited With Analytic Commentary By Stephen Booth. n.p.: New Haven : Yale University Press, 1977., 1977. SLU Libraries Catalog. Web. 29 Oct. 2012</ref>\n\nConversely, Helen Vendler, in her book The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, writes that this sonnet can indeed be read honestly, that is, as a real-life love predicament wherein two lovers are having a candid discussion of their love for one another. Here, she writes a suicidal dialogue from which she infers the sonnet could have been written:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n''Poet'': I am going to flee this vile world, preferring a dwelling with vilest worms to any further existence here. What will you do after my death?\n''Beloved'': I will mourn you forever.\n''Poet'': No, mourn for me no longer than it takes to toll my passing bell.\n''Beloved'': Well, then I will read your lines, and grieve while reading them.\n''Poet'': Nay, if you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it, if that memory would cause you grief.\n''Beloved'': Then I will, from love, mention your name to others.\n''Poet'': No, do not rehearse my name, but let your love for me cease when me life does.\n''Beloved'': Why do you forbid me to remember you, grieve for you, read you, name you?\n''Poet'': Because the world, which has so mocked me, will then associate you with me, and you will find yourself by association.<ref>Vendler, Helen, and Helen Vendler. The Art Of Shakespeare's Sonnets / Helen Vendler. n.p.: Cambridge, Massachusetts : Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1997., 1997. SLU Libraries Catalog. Web. 29 Oct. 2012</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis reading is also possible, as the speaker in other sonnets did speak of his name having a stigma attached to it (Sonnet 111), of being despised and disgraced by men (Sonnet 29), and also of being battered and oppressed by the world (Sonnet 27 and Sonnet 28).\n\n===Quatrain 3===\n<blockquote><poem>\nO, if, I say, you look upon this verse\nWhen I perhaps compounded am with clay,\nDo not so much as my poor name rehearse.\nBut let your love even with my life decay,\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThroughout the entire sonnet there seems to be a movement of mourning from very real and apparent to basically vanished. By quatrain 3 the subject \"narrows from the hand to the mere name [of the speaker]\u2014as if to render the mourning ever more tenuous, while having the beloved still enact the putatively wished-for behavior.\" Vendler points out the increasingly distanced view of the speaker and his expression. By this quatrain \"the speaker is wholly compounded\u2026 with clay, dissolved into dust.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 329.</ref>\n\nThe sonnet as a whole leads the reader's mind and emotion to the climax, line 12.<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 49.</ref> It is in this line that there is an affirmation of the return of love.<ref>Pequigney, Joseph. \"Sonnets 71-74: Texts and Contexts\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. Ed. James Schiffer. New York: Garland Publishing, 199. Print. pg. 286.</ref> The line reads \"let your love even with my life decay.\"<ref>Shakespeare, William. \"Sonnets\".

Ed. James Schiffer. New York: Garland Publishing, 199. Print. pg. 286.</ref>\n\nAs par the structure of this particular quatrain, it seems to tie the sonnet all together. As Ingram illustrates, \"line 10 look[s] back to lines 1-4\" and \"line 11 and 12 to the gentler, un-self-regarding tone of lines 5-8.\" Additionally, these lines within quatrain three contrast because of line 10's \"harsh alliterating c's and echoic 'compounded'\" and line 12's \"soft alliterating l's\".<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 61-62.</ref> Atkins adds \"as Ingram and Redpath note, [there is] a great variety of stress , supplying a fluidity that, surprisingly perhaps, allows the author to keep the third quatrain's interloped feet ('I say' [line 9], 'perhaps' [line 10]) and reversed word order ('compounded am' [line 10]) from appearing clumsy.\"<ref>Atkins, Carl D., ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Press, 2007. Print. pg. 193.</ref>\n\n===Couplet===\n<blockquote><poem>\nLest the wise world should look into your moan\nAnd mock you with me after I am gone.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe couplet tie at the end of the sonnet \"sums up the poem: look, mourn (moan), world\".<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 328.</ref> By the couplet \"[the speaker] is gone, no longer corporeal at all.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 329.</ref> While the quatrains lead up to a climax in quatrain 3, the couplet suggests a point, a succinct conclusion.<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 53.</ref> According to Atkins, in the couplet \"The primary notion is that the world will judge the poet's shortcoming only too well,\" as clarified by Tucker [1924]. After the speaker's urge for the beloved not to mourn him, one might expect several different orthodox explanations at the conclusion. Instead of what is expected \"we get: 'Forget me when I am dead \u2013 after all, someone might make fun of you.'\"<ref>Atkins, Carl D., ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Press, 2007. Print. pg. 192-193.</ref>\n\nAlternately, Pequigney believes \"the answer [as to what the couplet means] depends on our mood as we read it.\" He maintains that \"we learn more about ourselves when we interpret this poem than we do about its author.\"<ref>Pequigney, Joseph. \"Sonnets 71-74: Texts and Contexts\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. Ed. James Schiffer. New York: Garland Publishing, 199. Print.</ref>\n\nOverall, \"the couplet is superbly organized, both in the management of its rhythms and in its backward verbal reflection to the patterning of the whole poem.\"<ref>Ingram, W. G. \"The Shakespearean Quality\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 62.</ref>\n\n==Irony==\nThere seems to be a couple different types of irony in the sonnets in general that which is \"openly voiced by the speaker and authorial irony suggested at the expense of the (deceived) speaker.\"<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 327.</ref> There seems to a sense of irony when the speaker tells the beloved to forget him. Schoenfeldt reasons that \"we cannot quite take these lines literally\" because \"to tell someone to forget something is to make it harder for them to forget.\" This demonstrates a certain \"reverse-psychology appeal\" as a sense of irony.<ref>Schoenfeldt, Michael, ed. A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Print. pg. 356.</ref> Furthermore \"the shift from the 'vile world' (line 4) to the 'wise world' (line 13) is the final evidence of Shakespeare's irony\" in this particular sonnet. Krieger goes on to explain: \"For this world is wise\u2014that is, shrewd, prudential\u2014only as it is vile, only as it exercises those characteristics which ape the destructive perfection, the absolute cooperation with time, of the 'vilest worms.'\" He questions, \"How single-mindedly, then, is his friend to take this selfless, seemingly anti-sentimental injunction to obey the dictates of the world's cold wisdom lest he be mocked by it?\"<ref>Krieger, Murray.

Short barrel variants of the AK-12 and AK-15 have been announced, respectively the '''AK-12K''' and '''AK-15K'''.\n\nThe AK-12 project began in 2011 by the IZHMASH factory which became part of the Kalashnikov Concern as a private venture, in an attempt to participate in the \"[[Ratnik (program)|Ratnik]]\" trials which were held by the Russian Army.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was further developed by Kalashnikov Concern, and throughout its development and evaluation stage it has received multiple modifications to meet the Russian military's standard and to address the Russian Army's concerns regarding the cost and issues in fully automatic fire of the earlier prototype models. It went through several revisions in order to improve upon the \"range of defects\" that were discovered on the earlier prototype models that were derived from the '''AK-200'''. These were later abandoned in favour for the proven and improved '''AK-400''', which became the finalised model of the AK-12.\n\n==History==\nOn 25 May 2010, the [[Media of Russia|Russian media]] published a [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Defence]] statement that the AK-12 rifle was to be tested in 2011. The early prototype model (AK-200), was presented to the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] during his official visit to inspect the products of the [[Izhmash]] arms manufacturing plant in [[Izhevsk]], it was apparently a basic [[AK-74]] (thus chambered in 5.45\u00d739mm cartridge). The Izhmash's prototype was fitted with a large-capacity 60-round [[casket magazine]]. On the early prototype model, the traditional locations of the cocking handle, safety lever, and fire selector remained unchanged, but the AK-12's production model featured revisions to all of these features.\n\nIn January 2012, the Russian Deputy Defense Minister announced that the Russian Army would not be buying the AK-12, as they had millions of surplus AK-74 assault rifles and over concerns of the financial state of Izhmash. Despite this, the Russian Ministry of Defence began trials of the rifle on 2 November 2012. It was tested for its effectiveness when exposed to freezing cold, desert heat, humidity, dust and impacts.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/military_news/20121102/177146369.html Russia Starts New Kalashnikov Trials] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203112648/http://en.rian.ru/military_news/20121102/177146369.html |date=2012-12-03 }} - Rian.ru, November 2, 2012</ref> By 23 November 2012, trials were about 80 percent complete.

The light version has the ability to change calibres by swapping the barrels. It is chambered in 5.45\u00d739mm cartridge as for the standard configuration and can be either changed to the 7.62\u00d739mm or 5.56\u00d745mm NATO cartridge. Other intermediate calibers are also expected. The heavy version will chamber the larger 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. It is fed through the standard AK-74M 30-round magazines and can also accept the 45-round magazines from the RPK-74. The 7.62\u00d739mm Soviet-chambered version is compatible with the AKM/RPK 30-round and 40-round magazines and 75-round drum magazines. The magazines specifically for the cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 includes a 30-round magazine with a bolt-catch actuator, a 60-round quad-stack magazine and a 95-round drum.<ref name=\"sadj\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1841 AK-12: An All-New (Yet Old) Kalashnikov Rifle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013855/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1841 |date=2013-12-03 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 8 April 2013</ref>\n\nThe cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 is very different from its predecessors ergonomically. It features a telescoping buttstock that is in-line with the barrel for better recoil control and a stock latch, allowing for it to be folded to either side of the rifle. It has a rubber height-adjustable cheek piece and butt plate. The cocking handle is moved forward and can be attached to both sides for ambidextrous use. The receiver is hinged and more rigid with a [[Picatinny rail]] for mounting optics. There are several other accessory rails on the weapon, including on both sides, on the bottom and on the top of the handguard (in-line with the receiver for a longer monolithic rail), and on top of the gas block. There is also a lug under the gas chamber that can mount a [[GP-34]] [[grenade launcher]] and another one under the front sight holder mounts a bayonet. The rear iron sight is further back on the receiver and can be set for aiming when the stock is extended or folded. The magazine release is in the same position but can be used by the trigger finger to detach magazines. In a departure from previous AK-type rifles, the dust cover safety selector has been replaced with an ambidextrous fire selector; it has four positions safe, semi-automatic, three-round burst fire and fully automatic fire. Other improvements include a smaller ejection port, more ergonomic pistol grip, improved rifling and a [[muzzle brake]] with a 22&nbsp;mm threading that can fire NATO-standard rifle grenades.<ref name=\"sadj\"/><ref>[http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/01/26/kalashnikov-ak-12-unveiled/ Kalashnikov AK-12 Unveiled] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212013452/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/01/26/kalashnikov-ak-12-unveiled/ |date=2012-02-12 }} - Thefirearmblog.com, 26 January 2012</ref>\n\nThe fully automatic rate of fire of the cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 is around 600\u2013650 rounds per minute (RPM) but on the three-round burst feature, it fires at 1,000 rounds per minute (RPM).\n\n==== AK-200 rifle family ====\n{{main|AK-100 (rifle family)#AK-100M/200 Series}}\n\nThe development of the AK-200 rifle family was stopped around 2011 but resumed around 2016. The AK-200 series are somewhat heavier and less advanced compared to the AK-12 series, but also cheaper. As of 2018, 200-series Kalashnikov assault rifles, which include a complete family, are offered for export sales and for domestic law enforcement users. The AK-200 series of rifles are based on the [[AK-100 (Rifle family)|AK-100]] rifle series and the AK-12. They can be chambered in [[5.45\u00d739mm]], [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] and [[7.62\u00d739mm]], and use a barrel and gas system assembly similar to that of the [[AK-74M]].

Short-barreled versions of the AK-12 and AK-15 are also being worked on, designated as the AK-12K and AK-15K.\n\nWith the final production model, it addresses the Russian Army's concerns regarding the issues in fully automatic fire and the cost of the earlier prototype models and is also expected to be much cheaper to build. It also incorporates many of the same improvements developed for the earlier prototype models of the AK-12 but also improves the strength and resilience of some of the components of the rifle.<ref name=\":1\" />\nThe distinctive quick detachable muzzle brake features a large expansion chamber, two symmetrical vertical cuts at the forward end of the brake and three non symmetrical positioned vent holes to counteract [[muzzle climb|muzzle rise and climb]] as well as lateral shift to the right and features a crown-shaped glass breaker at the end.

Short barrel variants of the AK-12 and AK-15 have been announced, respectively the '''AK-12K''' and '''AK-15K'''.\n\nThe AK-12 project began in 2011 by the IZHMASH factory which became part of the Kalashnikov Concern as a private venture, in an attempt to participate in the \"[[Ratnik (program)|Ratnik]]\" trials which were held by the Russian Army.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was further developed by Kalashnikov Concern, and throughout its development and evaluation stage it has received multiple modifications to meet the Russian military's standard and to address the Russian Army's concerns regarding the cost and issues in fully automatic fire of the earlier prototype models. It went through several revisions in order to improve upon the \"range of defects\" that were discovered on the earlier prototype models that were derived from the '''AK-200'''. These were later abandoned in favour for the proven and improved '''AK-400''', which became the finalised model of the AK-12.\n\n==History==\nOn 25 May 2010, the [[Media of Russia|Russian media]] published a [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Defence]] statement that the AK-12 rifle was to be tested in 2011. The early prototype model (AK-200), was presented to the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] during his official visit to inspect the products of the [[Izhmash]] arms manufacturing plant in [[Izhevsk]], it was apparently a basic [[AK-74]] (thus chambered in 5.45\u00d739mm cartridge). The Izhmash's prototype was fitted with a large-capacity 60-round [[casket magazine]]. On the early prototype model, the traditional locations of the cocking handle, safety lever, and fire selector remained unchanged, but the AK-12's production model featured revisions to all of these features.\n\nIn January 2012, the Russian Deputy Defense Minister announced that the Russian Army would not be buying the AK-12, as they had millions of surplus AK-74 assault rifles and over concerns of the financial state of Izhmash. Despite this, the Russian Ministry of Defence began trials of the rifle on 2 November 2012. It was tested for its effectiveness when exposed to freezing cold, desert heat, humidity, dust and impacts.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/military_news/20121102/177146369.html Russia Starts New Kalashnikov Trials] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203112648/http://en.rian.ru/military_news/20121102/177146369.html |date=2012-12-03 }} - Rian.ru, November 2, 2012</ref> By 23 November 2012, trials were about 80 percent complete.

The light version has the ability to change calibres by swapping the barrels. It is chambered in 5.45\u00d739mm cartridge as for the standard configuration and can be either changed to the 7.62\u00d739mm or 5.56\u00d745mm NATO cartridge. Other intermediate calibers are also expected. The heavy version will chamber the larger 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. It is fed through the standard AK-74M 30-round magazines and can also accept the 45-round magazines from the RPK-74. The 7.62\u00d739mm Soviet-chambered version is compatible with the AKM/RPK 30-round and 40-round magazines and 75-round drum magazines. The magazines specifically for the cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 includes a 30-round magazine with a bolt-catch actuator, a 60-round quad-stack magazine and a 95-round drum.<ref name=\"sadj\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1841 AK-12: An All-New (Yet Old) Kalashnikov Rifle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013855/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1841 |date=2013-12-03 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 8 April 2013</ref>\n\nThe cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 is very different from its predecessors ergonomically. It features a telescoping buttstock that is in-line with the barrel for better recoil control and a stock latch, allowing for it to be folded to either side of the rifle. It has a rubber height-adjustable cheek piece and butt plate. The cocking handle is moved forward and can be attached to both sides for ambidextrous use. The receiver is hinged and more rigid with a [[Picatinny rail]] for mounting optics. There are several other accessory rails on the weapon, including on both sides, on the bottom and on the top of the handguard (in-line with the receiver for a longer monolithic rail), and on top of the gas block. There is also a lug under the gas chamber that can mount a [[GP-34]] [[grenade launcher]] and another one under the front sight holder mounts a bayonet. The rear iron sight is further back on the receiver and can be set for aiming when the stock is extended or folded. The magazine release is in the same position but can be used by the trigger finger to detach magazines. In a departure from previous AK-type rifles, the dust cover safety selector has been replaced with an ambidextrous fire selector; it has four positions safe, semi-automatic, three-round burst fire and fully automatic fire. Other improvements include a smaller ejection port, more ergonomic pistol grip, improved rifling and a [[muzzle brake]] with a 22&nbsp;mm threading that can fire NATO-standard rifle grenades.<ref name=\"sadj\"/><ref>[http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/01/26/kalashnikov-ak-12-unveiled/ Kalashnikov AK-12 Unveiled] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212013452/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/01/26/kalashnikov-ak-12-unveiled/ |date=2012-02-12 }} - Thefirearmblog.com, 26 January 2012</ref>\n\nThe fully automatic rate of fire of the cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 is around 600\u2013650 rounds per minute (RPM) but on the three-round burst feature, it fires at 1,000 rounds per minute (RPM).\n\n==== AK-200 rifle family ====\n{{main|AK-100 (rifle family)#AK-100M/200 Series}}\n\nThe development of the AK-200 rifle family was stopped around 2011 but resumed around 2016. The AK-200 series are somewhat heavier and less advanced compared to the AK-12 series, but also cheaper. As of 2018, 200-series Kalashnikov assault rifles, which include a complete family, are offered for export sales and for domestic law enforcement users. The AK-200 series of rifles are based on the [[AK-100 (Rifle family)|AK-100]] rifle series and the AK-12. They can be chambered in [[5.45\u00d739mm]], [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] and [[7.62\u00d739mm]], and use a barrel and gas system assembly similar to that of the [[AK-74M]].

Short-barreled versions of the AK-12 and AK-15 are also being worked on, designated as the AK-12K and AK-15K.\n\nWith the final production model, it addresses the Russian Army's concerns regarding the issues in fully automatic fire and the cost of the earlier prototype models and is also expected to be much cheaper to build. It also incorporates many of the same improvements developed for the earlier prototype models of the AK-12 but also improves the strength and resilience of some of the components of the rifle.<ref name=\":1\" />\nThe distinctive quick detachable muzzle brake features a large expansion chamber, two symmetrical vertical cuts at the forward end of the brake and three non symmetrical positioned vent holes to counteract [[muzzle climb|muzzle rise and climb]] as well as lateral shift to the right and features a crown-shaped glass breaker at the end.
