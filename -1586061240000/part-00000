Ben removed the Omnitrix for unknown reasons but regained it as a teenager while searching for his grandfather Max, who was abducted by a [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] alien species called the Highbreeds, who, along with the DNAliens at their command, are determined to [[Human extinction|cleanse the Earth of human beings]]. Ben's age causes the Omnitrix to reboot, granting him access to new alien forms, along with a few of his previous forms. Ben is joined by Gwen and former enemy Kevin Levin, as they fight the Highbreed's universal extermination plan.\n\n===''Ben 10: Ultimate Alien''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Ultimate Alien}}\nAfter Ben's last battle with Vilgax, which destroyed the Omnitrix, Ben replaces it with the new Ultimatrix that allows him to evolve his alien forms into their ultimate forms. With the recent disclosure of his identity, Ben has become a worldwide celebrity. Meanwhile, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin must stop an Osmosian villain named Aggregor, who hunts aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy and intends to use their powers to achieve the \"ultimate prize\". Later, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin have to prevent an extradimensional entity called Diagon from taking over the universe.\n\n===''Ben 10: Omniverse''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Omniverse}}\nBen acquires the new powerful and perfect Omnitrix that allows him to gain access to a new set of alien forms along with all the forms he has assumed prior. After Gwen goes away to college with Kevin accompanying her, Ben pairs up with Rook Blonko, a plumber from the planet Revonnah. He is targeted by an intergalactic huntsman named Khyber, who made a copy of the Omnitrix, the Nemetrix, with the help of mad scientist Dr Psychobos. Both of them are working with an enemy from Ben's past, a Galvanic Mechamorph named Malware. Ben later contends with the Incurseans, Albedo, Zs'Skayr, Dr Psychobos, Charmcaster, the Plumber's Black-Ops Unit (called the \"Rooters\"), his alternate dimension self Mad Ben, and the Chronosapien Maltruant.\n\n===''Ben 10'' (2016 TV series)===\n{{Main|Ben 10 (2016 TV series)}}\nThe official Twitter feed of Cartoon Network PR<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CartoonNetPR/status/607903706730905601|title=CartoonNetworkPR on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> confirmed a rebooted series that would return to following the adventures of Ben, Gwen, and Max Tennyson and feature new alien forms.

They are all [[wristwatch]]-styled devices developed by the [[Galvan]] inventor [[Azmuth]] that transforms the user into [[List of Ben 10 aliens|any one of many alien beings]] (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.\n\nThe Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]'' series. In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix{{spaced ndash}}the original version has been a prototype.\n\nIn ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]'', the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The Nemetrix|Nemetrix]], a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In ''Omniverse'', Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.\n\n===Plumbers===\nThe '''Plumbers''' is an organization composed of both human and alien members, each of whom possesses a special badge. All badges bear the intergalactic peace symbol, a green [[hourglass]] shape, which is on the faceplate of the Omnitrix. Later, in ''Omniverse'', the Plumbers' symbol becomes a red dot.\n\nIn the original series, the Earth's Plumbers were a secret government organization that protected the universe from any threat. Their main base is located inside [[Mount Rushmore]] (where the Null Void projector and Sub-Energy were stored), with additional bases located inside [[Fort Knox]], the [[Space Needle]], [[Devils Tower]], the [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo Monument]], and major cities such as [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Orlando]], and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. Their main adversary was Vilgax. [[Max Tennyson]] was a Plumber in his youth. Most of the Plumbers on Earth have disbanded; however, a few members remain in a semi-active capacity.\n\n===Forever Knights===\nThe '''Forever Knights''' are a secret British society first formed during the [[Middle Ages]] that are dedicated to collecting and studying alien technology, usually by illegal means. Any aliens they capture along the way are dissected and studied, and any humans caught with them are deemed worthless and disposed of. They also have a robotic dragon that protects one of their castles. It is revealed in ''Ultimate Alien'' that the reason for their actions is to combat Diagon, an entity from another dimension that nearly conquered the Earth in the Middle Ages were it not for the Forever Knights' immortal Founder George. When George left them, the Forever Knights began to splinter under various self-titled Forever Kings who transformed their knights' duty into a [[Speciesism#In the media|genocidal policy toward anything alien]].\n\n===Transports===\nEach series has featured some kind of main transportation. The wheeled motor vehicles, appearing like normal cars, are equipped with several pieces of Plumber technology such as a turbo engine, laser guns, and [[autopilot]]. They are often destroyed during the series.\n\nThe '''Rustbucket''' and the '''Rustbucket II''', is an old [[recreational vehicle|RV]] resembling a 1973 [[GMC motorhome]] owned by Max Tennyson. Despite being old, and even having been destroyed a few times, Max has great affection for it.\n\nThe '''Resolute''' is Tetrax Shard's spaceship\n\nThe '''Chimearan Hammer''' is Vilgax's spaceship\n\n'''[[List of Ben 10 characters#Ship|Ship]]''' is a Galvanic Mechamorph (Upgrade's species) that can transform himself into fully operational technology he's once touched. He merged with the Forever Knights spaceship and became the space transportation for Ben's team during the third season of ''Alien Force''. \n\nThe '''Rustbucket III''', a Plumbers' [[jet aircraft|jet]] that Kevin has upgraded with alien tech, later replaced him.\n\n'''Kevin's car''' is a [[Muscle car]] resembling a [[Dodge Challenger]] armed with Plumber technology as well as other various alien techs, including guns and off-road capabilities. It is the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force|Alien Force]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]''. It is damaged or destroyed often, mainly during fights or chase scenes, and Kevin is constantly busy repairing it. In Omniverse, after Ben destroyed it while aiming at Upgrade, Kevin gave it a new look. He painted it blue and placed a white circle with the number 11 on it, with only one stripe.\n\nThe '''Proto-TRUK''' is Rook's spaceship and the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse|Omniverse]]''. It can transform into a small truck to camouflage itself among Earth vehicles. It was later destroyed and its parts were used by Ben 10,000 to build the Time Cycles.\n\n==Accolades==\n\n===Original series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

Franklin was flying his kite when he was struck by a lightning bolt, gaining the Omnitrix. He used Swampfire to sign the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. He also used Humongousaur to defeat the [[British people|British]] and smash down a junior high school bully's house in revenge. He used other aliens from ''Alien Force'' and ''Ultimate Alien'', where they have his hair and glasses.\n* Also in ''MAD'', a reference to ''Alien Force'' was made with a parody of the movie ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'', with many titles: \"Cowboys & Alien Force\", \"Cowboys & Equestrians\", and \"Cowboys & [[Silly Bandz|Silly Bands]]\". The reference was made at the beginning when Jake awakes with Ben on his side, but with Jake wearing Ben's Omnitrix, pants, and hat. He also used the Omnitrix to become an alien with the mix of Diamondhead, Chromastone, and Way Big to smash a cowboy.\n* In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[You're Getting Old]]\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s Mother mentions that Cartman gets upset when he does not get a present every time someone else gets a present at a party. One of the presents Cartman gets is a \"Ben 10 Wrist Rocket\".\n* The ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Hurtled from a Helicopter into a Speeding Train\" shows Ben on his 14th birthday party, where he complains about his gifts given by Azmuth.\n* ''Ben 10'' villains, such as the Enoch, Hex and Animo, make a brief cameo in ''[[The Secret Saturdays]]'' episode \"Van Rook's Apprentice\".

Both references were made by the Secret Scientist Dr Arthur Beeman, the UFOlogist for the series.\t\n* In the ''[[Peep Show (British TV series)|Peep Show]]'' episode, \"Man Jam\", Jeremy jokingly refers to Ben, the boyfriend of a woman he admires, as \"Ben 10\" during a phone call to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show/on-demand/47548-002|title=Peep Show - On-Demand - All 4|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Cartoon Network promotion===\n\n====''Titanic Kungfubot Offensive''====\nThe game features famous and notable Cartoon Network characters in robot-type form. Big Chill, Swampfire, a DNAlien, Kevin, Vilgax, Rath, Armodrillo, Ultimate Humongousaur, Ultimate Echo Echo, and Ultimate Big Chill appear as playable characters.\n\nTo promote the ''[[Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United]]'' special, Cartoon Network updated ''Titanic Kungfubot Offensive'', adding new bots, such as \"Shocksquatch\" and \"Clockwork\"; both of which are aliens accessible to Ben.\n\n====''Cartoon Network Universe: Fusion Fall''====\n{{main|Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall}}\nThe character design for Ben Tennyson was changed when the original Ben 10 series ended and was replaced by Alien Force.

The exosuits' purpose is protecting the player and giving them unique abilities and powers. The planet Kylmyys (the home of one of Ben's aliens, Big Chill) and the Perplexhedron are featured as battle arenas. Ultimate Kevin and Alien X are currently the new exosuits for Project Exonaut representing Ben 10. The new exosuits feature Gold versions of Manus, Marceline, Mojo Jojo, and Rath.\n\n====''Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion''====\n{{main|Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion}}\nBen appears in the game as a playable character.

series)===\n{{main|Ben 10 (2005 TV series)}}\nThe series centres on [[Ben Tennyson]], a 10-year-old boy on a summer vacation road trip with his loathsome [[twin]] [[cousin]] [[Gwen Tennyson|Gwen]] and their [[grandfather]] [[Max Tennyson|Max]]. On their first night camping in their grandfather's RV, Ben finds a mysterious watch-style device named the Omnitrix that attaches itself to his wrist, giving him the ability to transform into various alien life-forms. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various enemies, ranging from aliens such as [[cephalopod]]ic [[warlord]] [[Vilgax]], [[bounty hunter]] duo [[Sixsix]] and [[Kraab]], ghostly [[high king]] [[Zs'skayr]], to criminals such as 11-year-old [[juvenile delinquent|delinquent]] [[Kevin Levin]], [[mad scientist]] [[Doctor Animo]], mysterious [[paramilitary]] organization the [[Forever Knights]], and supernatural entities such as inter-dimensional [[Sorcerer (paranormal)|sorcerer]] [[Hex (Ben 10)|Hex]] and his niece [[Charmcaster]], and [[clown]] [[mastermind]] [[Zombozo]] and his Circus Freak Trio.\n\n===''Ben 10: Alien Force''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Alien Force}}\nThe series begins five years after the summer vacation when Ben discovered the Omnitrix. Ben removed the Omnitrix for unknown reasons but regained it as a teenager while searching for his grandfather Max, who was abducted by a [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] alien species called the Highbreeds, who, along with the DNAliens at their command, are determined to [[Human extinction|cleanse the Earth of human beings]]. Ben's age causes the Omnitrix to reboot, granting him access to new alien forms, along with a few of his previous forms. Ben is joined by Gwen and former enemy Kevin Levin, as they fight the Highbreed's universal extermination plan.\n\n===''Ben 10: Ultimate Alien''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Ultimate Alien}}\nAfter Ben's last battle with Vilgax, which destroyed the Omnitrix, Ben replaces it with the new Ultimatrix that allows him to evolve his alien forms into their ultimate forms. With the recent disclosure of his identity, Ben has become a worldwide celebrity. Meanwhile, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin must stop an Osmosian villain named Aggregor, who hunts aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy and intends to use their powers to achieve the \"ultimate prize\". Later, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin have to prevent an extradimensional entity called Diagon from taking over the universe.\n\n===''Ben 10: Omniverse''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Omniverse}}\nBen acquires the new powerful and perfect Omnitrix that allows him to gain access to a new set of alien forms along with all the forms he has assumed prior. After Gwen goes away to college with Kevin accompanying her, Ben pairs up with Rook Blonko, a plumber from the planet Revonnah. He is targeted by an intergalactic huntsman named Khyber, who made a copy of the Omnitrix, the Nemetrix, with the help of mad scientist Dr Psychobos. Both of them are working with an enemy from Ben's past, a Galvanic Mechamorph named Malware. Ben later contends with the Incurseans, Albedo, Zs'Skayr, Dr Psychobos, Charmcaster, the Plumber's Black-Ops Unit (called the \"Rooters\"), his alternate dimension self Mad Ben, and the Chronosapien Maltruant.\n\n===''Ben 10'' (2016 TV series)===\n{{Main|Ben 10 (2016 TV series)}}\nThe official Twitter feed of Cartoon Network PR<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CartoonNetPR/status/607903706730905601|title=CartoonNetworkPR on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> confirmed a rebooted series that would return to following the adventures of Ben, Gwen, and Max Tennyson and feature new alien forms.

They are all [[wristwatch]]-styled devices developed by the [[Galvan]] inventor [[Azmuth]] that transforms the user into [[List of Ben 10 aliens|any one of many alien beings]] (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.\n\nThe Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]'' series. In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix{{spaced ndash}}the original version has been a prototype.\n\nIn ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]'', the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The Nemetrix|Nemetrix]], a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In ''Omniverse'', Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.\n\n===Plumbers===\nThe '''Plumbers''' is an organization composed of both human and alien members, each of whom possesses a special badge. All badges bear the intergalactic peace symbol, a green [[hourglass]] shape, which is on the faceplate of the Omnitrix. Later, in ''Omniverse'', the Plumbers' symbol becomes a red dot.\n\nIn the original series, the Earth's Plumbers were a secret government organization that protected the universe from any threat. Their main base is located inside [[Mount Rushmore]] (where the Null Void projector and Sub-Energy were stored), with additional bases located inside [[Fort Knox]], the [[Space Needle]], [[Devils Tower]], the [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo Monument]], and major cities such as [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Orlando]], and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. Their main adversary was Vilgax. [[Max Tennyson]] was a Plumber in his youth. Most of the Plumbers on Earth have disbanded; however, a few members remain in a semi-active capacity.\n\n===Forever Knights===\nThe '''Forever Knights''' are a secret British society first formed during the [[Middle Ages]] that are dedicated to collecting and studying alien technology, usually by illegal means. Any aliens they capture along the way are dissected and studied, and any humans caught with them are deemed worthless and disposed of. They also have a robotic dragon that protects one of their castles. It is revealed in ''Ultimate Alien'' that the reason for their actions is to combat Diagon, an entity from another dimension that nearly conquered the Earth in the Middle Ages were it not for the Forever Knights' immortal Founder George. When George left them, the Forever Knights began to splinter under various self-titled Forever Kings who transformed their knights' duty into a [[Speciesism#In the media|genocidal policy toward anything alien]].\n\n===Transports===\nEach series has featured some kind of main transportation. The wheeled motor vehicles, appearing like normal cars, are equipped with several pieces of Plumber technology such as a turbo engine, laser guns, and [[autopilot]]. They are often destroyed during the series.\n\nThe '''Rustbucket''' and the '''Rustbucket II''', is an old [[recreational vehicle|RV]] resembling a 1973 [[GMC motorhome]] owned by Max Tennyson. Despite being old, and even having been destroyed a few times, Max has great affection for it.\n\nThe '''Resolute''' is Tetrax Shard's spaceship\n\nThe '''Chimearan Hammer''' is Vilgax's spaceship\n\n'''[[List of Ben 10 characters#Ship|Ship]]''' is a Galvanic Mechamorph (Upgrade's species) that can transform himself into fully operational technology he's once touched. He merged with the Forever Knights spaceship and became the space transportation for Ben's team during the third season of ''Alien Force''. \n\nThe '''Rustbucket III''', a Plumbers' [[jet aircraft|jet]] that Kevin has upgraded with alien tech, later replaced him.\n\n'''Kevin's car''' is a [[Muscle car]] resembling a [[Dodge Challenger]] armed with Plumber technology as well as other various alien techs, including guns and off-road capabilities. It is the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force|Alien Force]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]''. It is damaged or destroyed often, mainly during fights or chase scenes, and Kevin is constantly busy repairing it. In Omniverse, after Ben destroyed it while aiming at Upgrade, Kevin gave it a new look. He painted it blue and placed a white circle with the number 11 on it, with only one stripe.\n\nThe '''Proto-TRUK''' is Rook's spaceship and the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse|Omniverse]]''. It can transform into a small truck to camouflage itself among Earth vehicles. It was later destroyed and its parts were used by Ben 10,000 to build the Time Cycles.\n\n==Accolades==\n\n===Original series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==Baptism of Fire==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right.

This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.\n\nAnother student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|accessdate=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of Greek Chapters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Inter-fraternity Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |title=Interfraternity Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200621/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Panhellenic Association<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |title=Panhellenic Association |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606204432/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Multicultural Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |title=Multicultural Greek Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606194623/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Alternative Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |title=Alternative Greek Organizations |publisher=George Washington University Alternative Greek Council |access-date=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522155504/http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Beta Theta Pi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Phi]]<br />[[Delta Tau Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Order]]<br />[[Kappa Sigma]]<br />[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Delta Theta]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Kappa]]<br />[[Pi Kappa Alpha]]<br />[[Sigma Chi]]<br />[[Sigma Nu]]<br />[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]<br />[[Zeta Beta Tau]]||[[Alpha Delta Pi]]<br />[[Alpha Phi]]<br />[[Chi Omega]]\n[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]<br />[[Kappa Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Beta Phi]]<br />[[Sigma Delta Tau]]<br />[[Sigma Kappa]]\n\n| [[Alpha Phi Alpha]]<br />[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n[[Delta Lambda Phi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Theta]]<br />[[Iota Nu Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Phi Lambda]]<br />[[Lambda Pi Chi]]<br />[[Phi Beta Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Delta Psi]]<br />[[Sigma Lambda Upsilon]]<br />[[Sigma Psi Zeta]]<br />[[Zeta Phi Beta]]\n|[[Alpha Kappa Psi]]<br />[[Alpha Chi Sigma]]<br />[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]]<br />[[Alpha Phi Omega]]<br />[[Delta Epsilon Mu]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Alpha Delta]]<br />[[Phi Beta Kappa]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Sigma Iota Rho]]<br />[[Tau Beta Pi]]<br />[[Theta Tau]]\n|}\n[[File:Townhouse Row GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Townhouse Row, home of many fraternities and sororities.]]\nGW has a large Greek community with over 3,000 students consisting of just under 27 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=\"Greek community\">{{cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |title=Greek Life Office |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606190055/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greek organizations are divided up between and governed by the Inter-Fraternity Council with 14 chapters, the Panhellenic Association with 11 chapters, and the Multicultural Greek Council with 13 chapters.<ref name=\"Greek community\"/> Other Greek-life, known as \"Alternative Greek Life\" or simply \"Alt-Greek\", exists on campus in the form of professional, community-serviced based and honor groups although not under the university's traditional Greek life governing structure but instead are considered separate student organizations\n\n===Scholarly societies===\n[[File:Old Main Career Center GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Rice Hall, 1922 F Street, houses various administrative offices.]]\n\nThere are chapters of many varied academic groups at the university.

This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.\n\nAnother student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|accessdate=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of Greek Chapters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Inter-fraternity Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |title=Interfraternity Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200621/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Panhellenic Association<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |title=Panhellenic Association |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606204432/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Multicultural Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |title=Multicultural Greek Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606194623/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Alternative Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |title=Alternative Greek Organizations |publisher=George Washington University Alternative Greek Council |access-date=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522155504/http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Beta Theta Pi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Phi]]<br />[[Delta Tau Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Order]]<br />[[Kappa Sigma]]<br />[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Delta Theta]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Kappa]]<br />[[Pi Kappa Alpha]]<br />[[Sigma Chi]]<br />[[Sigma Nu]]<br />[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]<br />[[Zeta Beta Tau]]||[[Alpha Delta Pi]]<br />[[Alpha Phi]]<br />[[Chi Omega]]\n[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]<br />[[Kappa Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Beta Phi]]<br />[[Sigma Delta Tau]]<br />[[Sigma Kappa]]\n\n| [[Alpha Phi Alpha]]<br />[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n[[Delta Lambda Phi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Theta]]<br />[[Iota Nu Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Phi Lambda]]<br />[[Lambda Pi Chi]]<br />[[Phi Beta Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Delta Psi]]<br />[[Sigma Lambda Upsilon]]<br />[[Sigma Psi Zeta]]<br />[[Zeta Phi Beta]]\n|[[Alpha Kappa Psi]]<br />[[Alpha Chi Sigma]]<br />[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]]<br />[[Alpha Phi Omega]]<br />[[Delta Epsilon Mu]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Alpha Delta]]<br />[[Phi Beta Kappa]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Sigma Iota Rho]]<br />[[Tau Beta Pi]]<br />[[Theta Tau]]\n|}\n[[File:Townhouse Row GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Townhouse Row, home of many fraternities and sororities.]]\nGW has a large Greek community with over 3,000 students consisting of just under 27 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=\"Greek community\">{{cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |title=Greek Life Office |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606190055/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greek organizations are divided up between and governed by the Inter-Fraternity Council with 14 chapters, the Panhellenic Association with 11 chapters, and the Multicultural Greek Council with 13 chapters.<ref name=\"Greek community\"/> Other Greek-life, known as \"Alternative Greek Life\" or simply \"Alt-Greek\", exists on campus in the form of professional, community-serviced based and honor groups although not under the university's traditional Greek life governing structure but instead are considered separate student organizations\n\n===Scholarly societies===\n[[File:Old Main Career Center GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Rice Hall, 1922 F Street, houses various administrative offices.]]\n\nThere are chapters of many varied academic groups at the university.
