3\u20131.\n\nThe win was the first in a trend (which continued throughout much of the twentieth century) of Tottenham [[When the Year Ends in One|winning major trophies in years ending in \"1\"]].

[[Sandy Brown (Scottish footballer born 1879)|Sandy Brown]] headed an equalising goal shortly afterwards and half time arrived with the score 1\u20131.

The deposits are mostly clastic, interbedded with banks of [[limestone]] and layers of [[anhydrite]], which were defined continental and shallow marine facies associated with semiarid conditions.<ref name=Armas2015_p101>Armas & S\u00e1nchez, 2015, p.101</ref>\n\nThe interpreted sedimentary paleoenvironments range from purely continental such as ephemeral [[lacustrine]], [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] and [[fluvial]] systems to coastal marine paleoenvironments with development of [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[tidal flat]]s, followed by a lagoon sedimentary stage from marsh to sea with carbonate precipitation in an area protected from waves, ending with a retraction leading to the accumulation of [[evaporite]]s.<ref name=Armas2015_p101/>\n\nA detailed facies analysis of the formation was performed by Armas and S\u00e1nchez in 2015, where the authors concluded the formation represents a hybrid coastal system\nof tidal flats, dominated by Atlantic ingressions, with a large storm influence in some areas linked to aeolian systems.<ref name=Armas2015_p110>Armas & S\u00e1nchez, 2015, p.110</ref>\n\n== Fossil content ==\n=== Dinosaurs ===\nDinosaur eggs are known from the formation.<ref name=\"allen\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | '''[[Dinosaur]]s reported from the Allen Formation'''\n|-\n!

The deposits are mostly clastic, interbedded with banks of [[limestone]] and layers of [[anhydrite]], which were defined continental and shallow marine facies associated with semiarid conditions.<ref name=Armas2015_p101>Armas & S\u00e1nchez, 2015, p.101</ref>\n\nThe interpreted sedimentary paleoenvironments range from purely continental such as ephemeral [[lacustrine]], [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] and [[fluvial]] systems to coastal marine paleoenvironments with development of [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[tidal flat]]s, followed by a lagoon sedimentary stage from marsh to sea with carbonate precipitation in an area protected from waves, ending with a retraction leading to the accumulation of [[evaporite]]s.<ref name=Armas2015_p101/>\n\nA detailed facies analysis of the formation was performed by Armas and S\u00e1nchez in 2015, where the authors concluded the formation represents a hybrid coastal system\nof tidal flats, dominated by Atlantic ingressions, with a large storm influence in some areas linked to aeolian systems.<ref name=Armas2015_p110>Armas & S\u00e1nchez, 2015, p.110</ref>\n\n== Fossil content ==\n=== Dinosaurs ===\nDinosaur eggs are known from the formation.<ref name=\"allen\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | '''[[Dinosaur]]s reported from the Allen Formation'''\n|-\n!

FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

This allows mixing in 2.1, [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]], or [[7.1 surround sound|7.1]] [[surround sound]], as long as the output hardware interface has an equivalent number of outputs. The mixer also supports audio-in, enabling FL Studio to [[multitrack recording|record multitrack audio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.image-line.com/support/flstudio_online_manual/html/mixer.htm|title=Mixer Explained|website=www.image-line.com|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nFL Studio supports [[audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching/pitch shifting]], [[beat slicing]], [[chopping (sampling technique)|chopping]], and editing of audio, and as of version 12.9 it can record up to 125 simultaneous audio tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forum.image-line.com/viewtopic.php?f=100&t=178258|title=FL Studio 12.9 BETA 1 [Expires 15th Jan 2018] - Image-Line|website=forum.image-line.com|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}} Other key features include a digital [https://www.image-line.com/support/flstudio_online_manual/html/pianoroll.htm piano roll].

is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed by the Belgian company [[Image-Line]]. FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

This allows mixing in 2.1, [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]], or [[7.1 surround sound|7.1]] [[surround sound]], as long as the output hardware interface has an equivalent number of outputs. The mixer also supports audio-in, enabling FL Studio to [[multitrack recording|record multitrack audio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.image-line.com/support/flstudio_online_manual/html/mixer.htm|title=Mixer Explained|website=www.image-line.com|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}}\n\nFL Studio supports [[audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching/pitch shifting]], [[beat slicing]], [[chopping (sampling technique)|chopping]], and editing of audio, and as of version 12.9 it can record up to 125 simultaneous audio tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forum.image-line.com/viewtopic.php?f=100&t=178258|title=FL Studio 12.9 BETA 1 [Expires 15th Jan 2018] - Image-Line|website=forum.image-line.com|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=April 2020}} Other key features include a digital [https://www.image-line.com/support/flstudio_online_manual/html/pianoroll.htm piano roll].
