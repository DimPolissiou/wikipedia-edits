It is the sequel to 2012's reboot of the series ''[[XCOM: Enemy Unknown]]''; it takes place 20 years after the events of ''Enemy Unknown''. XCOM, a military organization trying to fight off an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] invasion, has lost the war and is now a resistance force against the occupation of Earth and the established [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime and [[military dictatorship]]. Gameplay is split between [[turn-based]] combat in which players command a squad of soldiers to fight enemies and strategy elements. Players manage and control the operations of the Avenger, a derelict alien ship that is a mobile base for XCOM, commanding the engineering and research department of the base between missions.\n\nDuring the game's development, Firaxis inspected players' feedback of ''Enemy Unknown'' and added [[procedural generation]] of maps and [[modding|mod]] support to the game. The developers set the game after the bad ending of the 2012 reboot because it allowed them to change gameplay, introduce various new features and redesign some enemies. To encourage players to play more offensively, the developers introduced time-based objectives to boost the game's pacing. Compared with its predecessor, ''XCOM 2'' has more emphasis on narrative. The game engine is [[Unreal Engine 3.5]] and artists drew inspiration from sci-fi movies including ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]'' and ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' when creating the game's aesthetic.\n\n''XCOM 2'' was released in February 2016 for [[personal computer]]s while [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] versions were released in September 2016. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim. Critics praised the new concealment system, which they said adds a new layer of depth, and the procedural generation of maps. The game was also praised for its difficulty and the addition of modding tools; criticism was mainly directed at its poor performance on many computers at launch. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades by several [[gaming publications]]. Firaxis supported the game with downloadable content and released ''[[XCOM 2: War of the Chosen]]'', the game's standalone expansion, in 2018. A [[Nintendo Switch]] version is set to be released in May 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Turn-based combat===\n[[File:XCOM 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A member of the player's squad is hiding behind low [[Cover (military)|cover]] as indicated by the blue half shield icon.]]\n\nIn ''XCOM 2'', the player-character is the commander of the eponymous military organization that is now reduced to a resistance force opposing the ongoing alien occupation of Earth. The game is played from a [[top-down perspective]] and is a [[turn-based tactics]] title in which players issue commands to a squad of human soldiers to eliminate the aliens in a map and dependent on missions, complete secondary objectives.<ref name=\"manual\"/> Many of the missions are timed, requiring players to complete it within several turns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/12/xcom2-guide-tips/2/|title=XCOM 2 Tips: How To Survive And Thrive|first=Alec|last=Meer|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114173625/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/12/xcom2-guide-tips/2/|archive-date=November 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Maps are [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] to create a wide variety of levels.

Humanity was defeated by aliens, XCOM proved incapable of resisting the alien threat and was betrayed by the council nations, who surrendered to the aliens shortly after the invasion began. XCOM became a resistance force and went underground to avoid persecution at the hands of the aliens. Most of its members either submitted to alien rule and left behind their past but some, like Central Officer Bradford, refused the alien administration and went into hiding. Earth is now controlled by the aliens through the puppet ADVENT Administration and XCOM has been forgotten, members silenced and records erased. ADVENT has done much to improve public opinion of the aliens, especially by the propagation of the belief the aliens came in peace and that the forces of Earth retaliated aggressively and with prejudice. This is presumed to have happened after the player researches MECs, as stated by the autopsy of an ADVENT MEC.\n\nThe player assumes the role of the Commander, who had up until recently been placed in alien stasis so they could  make use of his strategic thinking via a brain implant. After the Commander is rescued by Central Officer Bradford, XCOM launches an attack on an alien convoy and steals an elerium core used to power the Avenger, an alien supply barge that has been converted into XCOM's mobile base.<ref name=\"PCGamer_XCOM2-ANN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/xcom-2-announced-is-pc-exclusive/|title=XCOM 2 announced, is PC exclusive|last=Savage|first=Phil|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 2, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072030/http://www.pcgamer.com/xcom-2-announced-is-pc-exclusive/|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> On the Avenger, the Commander has the support of rogue ADVENT scientist Dr. Richard Tygan, replacing the now-missing Dr. Vahlen, and Chief Engineer Lily Shen, daughter of and successor to the now-deceased Dr. Raymond Shen, with whom the Commander was familiar in the prior game.\n\n===Story===\nThe game begins with Bradford leading a raid on an ADVENT gene bank and rescuing the Commander, who had been captured and put into stasis. The Commander is then brought to XCOM's mobile headquarters on the Avenger, where they meet support staff Dr. Richard Tygan and Lily Shen. Tygan tells the Commander while they were in stasis, ADVENT connected their brains directly to their global psionic communication network to act as a battle simulation computer. The Commander is then contacted by the Spokesman, the last-remaining loyal member of the Council. The Spokesman orders the Commander to unite the resistance groups scattered around the world and to discover the true nature of ADVENT's top-secret Avatar Project.\n\nAs the Commander leads XCOM in the fight against ADVENT, they raid secret ADVENT research facilities and slowly begin to realize the nature of the Avatar Project. Through their research, Tygan and Shen discover ADVENT's leaders the Elders have been dying from an irreversible physical degeneration of their bodies. To escape their imminent demise, the Elders started the Avatar Project, which involves processing kidnapped humans and turning them into raw material to build new bodies called avatars for themselves. They also track the Elders' headquarters to an underwater base that is accessible by a special psionic portal. With their hand forced, ADVENT decides to accelerate the project and process all \"non-essential\" humans into the Avatar project under the guise of curing all disease at their gene clinics. The Spokesman is presumed killed when he sacrifices himself to warn XCOM about the plan, ordering them to hijack ADVENT's global communication network before they can make the announcement. XCOM hacks the network and transmits proof of ADVENT's crimes to the world, causing a mass global revolution against the Alien occupation.\n\nWith ADVENT busy trying to maintain order, the Commander takes psionic control of an uninhabited avatar stolen from one of ADVENT's facilities and XCOM raids the Elders' headquarters. The Elders plead with the Commander to stop the fighting and rejoin them, claiming they are only trying to strengthen themselves and humanity against a greater threat. The Commander ignores the Elders' pleas and destroys all of their Avatars, triggering the destruction of the base. The Commander's Avatar stays behind to battle the enraged spirits of the Elders as the rest of the squad escape.\n\nAfterwards, the Commander wakes up in their own body and learns that without the direction of the Elders, ADVENT's grip on humanity crumbles. The ranks of the Resistance swell as people abandon the ADVENT-controlled cities and the Resistance begins to overwhelm the remnants of the ADVENT forces. In the ocean underneath the ruins of the Elder headquarters, however, a strange energy begins to glow. In the ''War of the Chosen'' expansion, the Templars, one of the factions that helped in XCOM's victory, notice the glow and their leader confirms it is the sign a new war is about to begin.\n\n==Development==\n[[Firaxis Games]], the developer of ''[[XCOM: Enemy Unknown]]'', and its creative director Jake Solomon, returned to work on ''XCOM 2'', which had a shorter development time that  ''Enemy Unknown'', The developers inspected players' feedback from the 2012 reboot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xcom-2-how-firaxis-crafted-a-superior-sequel/1100-6434134/|title=XCOM 2: How Firaxis Crafted a Superior Sequel|first=Mike|last=Mahardy|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051138/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xcom-2-how-firaxis-crafted-a-superior-sequel/1100-6434134/|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Solomon described the game's development as a more liberating experience than making the 2012 reboot because the team had amassed an audience and no longer need to be held up against the original games.

The Avenger is named after a ship in ''[[UFO: Enemy Unknown]]''. According to Jake Solomon, the game's creative process is \"gameplay driven\". As a result, the setting was introduced after Firaxis changed the character classes and added [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements to the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/02/xcom-2-welcoming-our-new-alien-overlords|title=XCOM 2: Welcoming Our New Alien Overlords|first=Dan|last=Stapleton|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711171232/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/02/xcom-2-welcoming-our-new-alien-overlords|archivedate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> The developers found fewer than 30% of players finished the first game.

Because the game is set in the future, more backstory was written to ensure players felt attached to the game's narrative.<ref name=\"RPS Making\"/> Environment storytelling is an important part of the game; for instance, in the [[megacity]] there are signs indicating ADVENT has taken over the world whereas other maps and areas show players the remnants of human civilizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8978247/xcom-2-art-interview-greg-foertsch|title=The art behind XCOM 2, a sci-fi game where humanity has already lost|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[The Verge]]|date=July 17, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051135/https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8978247/xcom-2-art-interview-greg-foertsch|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was initially designed to be forgiving but after receiving feedback from play-testers, who noted the game was too simple and that a lot of systems failed to engage players, the idea was scrapped during the late stage of development. The team attempted to maintain the game's difficulty so players who played ''Enemy Unknown'' would still face a challenge.<ref name=\"RPS Making\"/> According to DeAngelis, the developers wanted the game to be \"brutally challenging\" so when the player overcame these challenges, \"the sense of triumph [will be] truly powerful\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/going-deeper-into-xcom-2-resistance-isnt-futile/2/|title=Going deeper into XCOM 2: resistance isn't futile|first=Phil|last=Savage|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=January 14, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051136/https://www.pcgamer.com/going-deeper-into-xcom-2-resistance-isnt-futile/2/|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> To ensure the game is challenging and replayable, the team valued the idea of unpredictability and randomness. For instance, when players attempt to shoot an enemy, the game's [[user interface]] tells players the chance of launching a successful hit. At a high percentage of chance, they can still miss their shots while at a low percentage, players may be able to land some hits. According to Solomon, the team realized players may become emotionally invested in the experience, thus the real statistic calculation will \"match the player\u2019s psychological feeling about that number\", meaning the possibility of successful hits may be slightly higher or lower than the UI statistic.<ref name=\"randomness\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/266891/Jake_Solomon_explains_the_careful_use_of_randomness_in_XCOM_2.php|title=Jake Solomon explains the careful use of randomness in XCOM 2|first=Roy|last=Graham|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051137/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/266891/Jake_Solomon_explains_the_careful_use_of_randomness_in_XCOM_2.php|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDespite the game's difficulty, the team wanted to encourage players to play more offensively so they added valuable loot drops, time-sensitive objectives and the idea of \"concealment\", in which recruits can ambush the aliens, forcing players to take more risks during gameplay.<ref name=\"Escapist int\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2016/01/07/xcom-2-jake-solomon-interview/|title=How 'XCOM 2' makes you feel like an ace battlefield commander|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|work=[[Mashable]]|date=January 7, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051136/https://mashable.com/2016/01/07/xcom-2-jake-solomon-interview/|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Players can also achieve variability through the strategic gameplay of the Avengers, in which players need to determine when and where to move the mobile headquarters, what to research and what areas to liberate first.<ref name=\"RB Int\"/> Players need to consider the consequences of performing actions. Completing a side-mission that nets players new resources may mean the aliens may have made further progress with their Avatar Program.<ref name=\"Escapist int\"/>\n\nThe concept of procedurally-generated levels in ''Enemy Unknown'' was scrapped because Firaxis believed it would prove disadvantageous and buggy, and that procedurally-generated objects did not fit in with the game's atmosphere. ''Enemy Unknown'' has hand-crafted maps that were all designed by Firaxis. Reception of these maps was generally positive but players complained they became repetitive so Firaxis decided to introduce a system called \"the plot and parcel system\" to alleviate the developers' workload. The game's producer, Garth DeAngelis, described the game's maps as \"quilts\". Each map has randomly generated holes of different sizes. Each hole will fit in an object or a destructible building. Side-missions, enemy placements, reinforcements and multiplayer maps are also randomly generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/04/xcom-2s-procedurally-generated-maps-ign-first|title=XCOM 2's Procedurally-Generated Maps - IGN First|first=Brandin|last=Tyrrel|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 4, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710021239/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/04/xcom-2s-procedurally-generated-maps-ign-first|archivedate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> The implementation of procedural generation created a lot of difficulties and took the team a lot of time to fix.<ref name=\"randomness\"/>\n\nWhen developing the game's art, the developers were inspired by movies ''[[They Live]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxv9k/welcome-back-commander-in-conversation-with-firaxis-about-xcom-2-554|title=Welcome Back, Commander: A Conversation with Firaxis About \u2018XCOM 2\u2019|first=Andrew|last=Edney|work=[[The Vice]]|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051134/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxv9k/welcome-back-commander-in-conversation-with-firaxis-about-xcom-2-554|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Elysium (movie)|Elysium]]'', ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]''.

He also liked the new enemies, which force players to rethink their tactics before they plan their attacks.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Maxwell McGee from ''[[GamesRadar]]'' agreed, singling out the new soldier classes that enable players to use new strategies to defeat enemies.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Rich Stanton from ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the gameplay as \"rewarding\" because every turn may bring ramifications players need to consider.<ref name=\"GuardianRev\"/> Charlie Hall from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' enjoyed the concealment system, which he felt that successfully adds new variations to the ''XCOM'' formula.<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> This was agreed by Chris Bratt from ''[[Eurogamer]]'', who called the new system \"satisfying\".<ref name=\"EGRev\"/> Ben Reeves from ''[[Game Informer]]'' called the gameplay \"nerve-wrecking\" because of the game's intense difficulty; he  lauded the balanced gameplay classes, which offer players gameplay options to outsmart the enemies. Reeves and Mike Mahardy from ''[[GameSpot]]'' said the procedural generation system has boosted the game's replay value, extended the game's longevity and made each map believable.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Dan Stapleton from ''[[IGN]]'' admired the procedural generation technology and enjoyed the game's diverse missions.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/>\n\nHall liked the management aspect of the game, which he thought has \"[lent] a great sense of urgency and tension to every decision\".<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> Rich Stanton from ''[[The Guardian]]'' liked the component, as players only have limited resources and time and they have to sort out different priorities, thus making every decision players made an important one.<ref name=\"GuardianRev\"/> Tom Senior from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' called the experience \"gripping\" and added that \"the game cleverly uses scarcity of opportunity to force you into difficult dilemmas\".<ref name=\"PCGUSRev\"/> McGee was disappointed with the Dark Events as he felt that they were \"passive and indirect\". McGee liked the strategic aspect but felt that the alien menace was rarely felt.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Dan Ryckert from [[Giant Bomb]] found the Avatar Project, which served as the game's [[doomsday clock]], to be a stressful experience, as it made him \"question every decision\" he has made when he was managing and sorting out the priorities of different tasks.<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> Reeves agreed, saying that \"Firaxis' masterclass in strategy design has you second-guessing all your choices and analyzing your smallest decisions\".<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Bratt also liked the Project, which propelled players to react and respond instead of constantly [[grind]]ing for upgrades.<ref name=\"EGRev\"/> Character customization was also widely praised for allowing players to become attached to the soldiers, making each soldier's death impactful and memorable.<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/>\n\nThe game's difficulty received mixed responses. Rowen said the timed missions are not too difficult but that its \"merciless\" nature may turn some players away from the game. He also said some of the early missions are \"disproportionately difficult\" and frustrating to play.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> McGee enjoyed the challenge and said the timed challenges and other unpredictable elements \"keep tensions running high\", and that the experience would remain engrossing during subsequent playthroughs. Stanton and Stapleton praised the game's [[artificial intelligence]], which would take every tactical advantage it has to put pressure on players.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Stanton said this has made players more responsive and created a forward momentum that ''Enemy Unknown'' lacked.<ref name=\"GuardianRev\"/> Bratt praised the timed missions for encouraging players to take risks and be more offensive.<ref name=\"EGRev\"/> Mahardy noted the difficulty is \"fair\" and that ''XCOM 2'' is a brutal experience. He also said the game's difficulty is sometimes beyond challenging with enemies that sometimes ignoring the established gameplay rules.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/>\n\nThe game suffered from numerous technical difficulties at launch.

It is the sequel to 2012's reboot of the series ''[[XCOM: Enemy Unknown]]''; it takes place 20 years after the events of ''Enemy Unknown''. XCOM, a military organization trying to fight off an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] invasion, has lost the war and is now a resistance force against the occupation of Earth and the established [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime and [[military dictatorship]]. Gameplay is split between [[turn-based]] combat in which players command a squad of soldiers to fight enemies and strategy elements. Players manage and control the operations of the Avenger, a derelict alien ship that is a mobile base for XCOM, commanding the engineering and research department of the base between missions.\n\nDuring the game's development, Firaxis inspected players' feedback of ''Enemy Unknown'' and added [[procedural generation]] of maps and [[modding|mod]] support to the game. The developers set the game after the bad ending of the 2012 reboot because it allowed them to change gameplay, introduce various new features and redesign some enemies. To encourage players to play more offensively, the developers introduced time-based objectives to boost the game's pacing. Compared with its predecessor, ''XCOM 2'' has more emphasis on narrative. The game engine is [[Unreal Engine 3.5]] and artists drew inspiration from sci-fi movies including ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]'' and ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' when creating the game's aesthetic.\n\n''XCOM 2'' was released in February 2016 for [[personal computer]]s while [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] versions were released in September 2016. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim. Critics praised the new concealment system, which they said adds a new layer of depth, and the procedural generation of maps. The game was also praised for its difficulty and the addition of modding tools; criticism was mainly directed at its poor performance on many computers at launch. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades by several [[gaming publications]]. Firaxis supported the game with downloadable content and released ''[[XCOM 2: War of the Chosen]]'', the game's standalone expansion, in 2018. A [[Nintendo Switch]] version is set to be released in May 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Turn-based combat===\n[[File:XCOM 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A member of the player's squad is hiding behind low [[Cover (military)|cover]] as indicated by the blue half shield icon.]]\n\nIn ''XCOM 2'', the player-character is the commander of the eponymous military organization that is now reduced to a resistance force opposing the ongoing alien occupation of Earth. The game is played from a [[top-down perspective]] and is a [[turn-based tactics]] title in which players issue commands to a squad of human soldiers to eliminate the aliens in a map and dependent on missions, complete secondary objectives.<ref name=\"manual\"/> Many of the missions are timed, requiring players to complete it within several turns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/12/xcom2-guide-tips/2/|title=XCOM 2 Tips: How To Survive And Thrive|first=Alec|last=Meer|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114173625/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/12/xcom2-guide-tips/2/|archive-date=November 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Maps are [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] to create a wide variety of levels.

Humanity was defeated by aliens, XCOM proved incapable of resisting the alien threat and was betrayed by the council nations, who surrendered to the aliens shortly after the invasion began. XCOM became a resistance force and went underground to avoid persecution at the hands of the aliens. Most of its members either submitted to alien rule and left behind their past but some, like Central Officer Bradford, refused the alien administration and went into hiding. Earth is now controlled by the aliens through the puppet ADVENT Administration and XCOM has been forgotten, members silenced and records erased. ADVENT has done much to improve public opinion of the aliens, especially by the propagation of the belief the aliens came in peace and that the forces of Earth retaliated aggressively and with prejudice. This is presumed to have happened after the player researches MECs, as stated by the autopsy of an ADVENT MEC.\n\nThe player assumes the role of the Commander, who had up until recently been placed in alien stasis so they could  make use of his strategic thinking via a brain implant. After the Commander is rescued by Central Officer Bradford, XCOM launches an attack on an alien convoy and steals an elerium core used to power the Avenger, an alien supply barge that has been converted into XCOM's mobile base.<ref name=\"PCGamer_XCOM2-ANN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/xcom-2-announced-is-pc-exclusive/|title=XCOM 2 announced, is PC exclusive|last=Savage|first=Phil|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 2, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072030/http://www.pcgamer.com/xcom-2-announced-is-pc-exclusive/|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> On the Avenger, the Commander has the support of rogue ADVENT scientist Dr. Richard Tygan, replacing the now-missing Dr. Vahlen, and Chief Engineer Lily Shen, daughter of and successor to the now-deceased Dr. Raymond Shen, with whom the Commander was familiar in the prior game.\n\n===Story===\nThe game begins with Bradford leading a raid on an ADVENT gene bank and rescuing the Commander, who had been captured and put into stasis. The Commander is then brought to XCOM's mobile headquarters on the Avenger, where they meet support staff Dr. Richard Tygan and Lily Shen. Tygan tells the Commander while they were in stasis, ADVENT connected their brains directly to their global psionic communication network to act as a battle simulation computer. The Commander is then contacted by the Spokesman, the last-remaining loyal member of the Council. The Spokesman orders the Commander to unite the resistance groups scattered around the world and to discover the true nature of ADVENT's top-secret Avatar Project.\n\nAs the Commander leads XCOM in the fight against ADVENT, they raid secret ADVENT research facilities and slowly begin to realize the nature of the Avatar Project. Through their research, Tygan and Shen discover ADVENT's leaders the Elders have been dying from an irreversible physical degeneration of their bodies. To escape their imminent demise, the Elders started the Avatar Project, which involves processing kidnapped humans and turning them into raw material to build new bodies called avatars for themselves. They also track the Elders' headquarters to an underwater base that is accessible by a special psionic portal. With their hand forced, ADVENT decides to accelerate the project and process all \"non-essential\" humans into the Avatar project under the guise of curing all disease at their gene clinics. The Spokesman is presumed killed when he sacrifices himself to warn XCOM about the plan, ordering them to hijack ADVENT's global communication network before they can make the announcement. XCOM hacks the network and transmits proof of ADVENT's crimes to the world, causing a mass global revolution against the Alien occupation.\n\nWith ADVENT busy trying to maintain order, the Commander takes psionic control of an uninhabited avatar stolen from one of ADVENT's facilities and XCOM raids the Elders' headquarters. The Elders plead with the Commander to stop the fighting and rejoin them, claiming they are only trying to strengthen themselves and humanity against a greater threat. The Commander ignores the Elders' pleas and destroys all of their Avatars, triggering the destruction of the base. The Commander's Avatar stays behind to battle the enraged spirits of the Elders as the rest of the squad escape.\n\nAfterwards, the Commander wakes up in their own body and learns that without the direction of the Elders, ADVENT's grip on humanity crumbles. The ranks of the Resistance swell as people abandon the ADVENT-controlled cities and the Resistance begins to overwhelm the remnants of the ADVENT forces. In the ocean underneath the ruins of the Elder headquarters, however, a strange energy begins to glow. In the ''War of the Chosen'' expansion, the Templars, one of the factions that helped in XCOM's victory, notice the glow and their leader confirms it is the sign a new war is about to begin.\n\n==Development==\n[[Firaxis Games]], the developer of ''[[XCOM: Enemy Unknown]]'', and its creative director Jake Solomon, returned to work on ''XCOM 2'', which had a shorter development time that  ''Enemy Unknown'', The developers inspected players' feedback from the 2012 reboot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xcom-2-how-firaxis-crafted-a-superior-sequel/1100-6434134/|title=XCOM 2: How Firaxis Crafted a Superior Sequel|first=Mike|last=Mahardy|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051138/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xcom-2-how-firaxis-crafted-a-superior-sequel/1100-6434134/|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Solomon described the game's development as a more liberating experience than making the 2012 reboot because the team had amassed an audience and no longer need to be held up against the original games.

The Avenger is named after a ship in ''[[UFO: Enemy Unknown]]''. According to Jake Solomon, the game's creative process is \"gameplay driven\". As a result, the setting was introduced after Firaxis changed the character classes and added [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements to the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/02/xcom-2-welcoming-our-new-alien-overlords|title=XCOM 2: Welcoming Our New Alien Overlords|first=Dan|last=Stapleton|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711171232/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/02/xcom-2-welcoming-our-new-alien-overlords|archivedate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> The developers found fewer than 30% of players finished the first game.

Because the game is set in the future, more backstory was written to ensure players felt attached to the game's narrative.<ref name=\"RPS Making\"/> Environment storytelling is an important part of the game; for instance, in the [[megacity]] there are signs indicating ADVENT has taken over the world whereas other maps and areas show players the remnants of human civilizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8978247/xcom-2-art-interview-greg-foertsch|title=The art behind XCOM 2, a sci-fi game where humanity has already lost|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[The Verge]]|date=July 17, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051135/https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8978247/xcom-2-art-interview-greg-foertsch|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was initially designed to be forgiving but after receiving feedback from play-testers, who noted the game was too simple and that a lot of systems failed to engage players, the idea was scrapped during the late stage of development. The team attempted to maintain the game's difficulty so players who played ''Enemy Unknown'' would still face a challenge.<ref name=\"RPS Making\"/> According to DeAngelis, the developers wanted the game to be \"brutally challenging\" so when the player overcame these challenges, \"the sense of triumph [will be] truly powerful\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/going-deeper-into-xcom-2-resistance-isnt-futile/2/|title=Going deeper into XCOM 2: resistance isn't futile|first=Phil|last=Savage|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=January 14, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051136/https://www.pcgamer.com/going-deeper-into-xcom-2-resistance-isnt-futile/2/|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> To ensure the game is challenging and replayable, the team valued the idea of unpredictability and randomness. For instance, when players attempt to shoot an enemy, the game's [[user interface]] tells players the chance of launching a successful hit. At a high percentage of chance, they can still miss their shots while at a low percentage, players may be able to land some hits. According to Solomon, the team realized players may become emotionally invested in the experience, thus the real statistic calculation will \"match the player\u2019s psychological feeling about that number\", meaning the possibility of successful hits may be slightly higher or lower than the UI statistic.<ref name=\"randomness\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/266891/Jake_Solomon_explains_the_careful_use_of_randomness_in_XCOM_2.php|title=Jake Solomon explains the careful use of randomness in XCOM 2|first=Roy|last=Graham|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051137/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/266891/Jake_Solomon_explains_the_careful_use_of_randomness_in_XCOM_2.php|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDespite the game's difficulty, the team wanted to encourage players to play more offensively so they added valuable loot drops, time-sensitive objectives and the idea of \"concealment\", in which recruits can ambush the aliens, forcing players to take more risks during gameplay.<ref name=\"Escapist int\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2016/01/07/xcom-2-jake-solomon-interview/|title=How 'XCOM 2' makes you feel like an ace battlefield commander|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|work=[[Mashable]]|date=January 7, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051136/https://mashable.com/2016/01/07/xcom-2-jake-solomon-interview/|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Players can also achieve variability through the strategic gameplay of the Avengers, in which players need to determine when and where to move the mobile headquarters, what to research and what areas to liberate first.<ref name=\"RB Int\"/> Players need to consider the consequences of performing actions.

''Enemy Unknown'' has hand-crafted maps that were all designed by Firaxis. Reception of these maps was generally positive but players complained they became repetitive so Firaxis decided to introduce a system called \"the plot and parcel system\" to alleviate the developers' workload. The game's producer, Garth DeAngelis, described the game's maps as \"quilts\". Each map has randomly generated holes of different sizes. Each hole will fit in an object or a destructible building. Side-missions, enemy placements, reinforcements and multiplayer maps are also randomly generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/04/xcom-2s-procedurally-generated-maps-ign-first|title=XCOM 2's Procedurally-Generated Maps - IGN First|first=Brandin|last=Tyrrel|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 4, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710021239/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/04/xcom-2s-procedurally-generated-maps-ign-first|archivedate=July 10, 2015}}</ref> The implementation of procedural generation created a lot of difficulties and took the team a lot of time to fix.<ref name=\"randomness\"/>\n\nWhen developing the game's art, the developers were inspired by movies ''[[They Live]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxv9k/welcome-back-commander-in-conversation-with-firaxis-about-xcom-2-554|title=Welcome Back, Commander: A Conversation with Firaxis About \u2018XCOM 2\u2019|first=Andrew|last=Edney|work=[[The Vice]]|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201051134/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxv9k/welcome-back-commander-in-conversation-with-firaxis-about-xcom-2-554|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Elysium (movie)|Elysium]]'', ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]''.

He also liked the new enemies, which force players to rethink their tactics before they plan their attacks.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Maxwell McGee from ''[[GamesRadar]]'' agreed, singling out the new soldier classes that enable players to use new strategies to defeat enemies.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Rich Stanton from ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the gameplay as \"rewarding\" because every turn may bring ramifications players need to consider.<ref name=\"GuardianRev\"/> Charlie Hall from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' enjoyed the concealment system, which he felt that successfully adds new variations to the ''XCOM'' formula.<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> This was agreed by Chris Bratt from ''[[Eurogamer]]'', who called the new system \"satisfying\".<ref name=\"EGRev\"/> Ben Reeves from ''[[Game Informer]]'' called the gameplay \"nerve-wrecking\" because of the game's intense difficulty; he  lauded the balanced gameplay classes, which offer players gameplay options to outsmart the enemies. Reeves and Mike Mahardy from ''[[GameSpot]]'' said the procedural generation system has boosted the game's replay value, extended the game's longevity and made each map believable.<ref name=\"GIRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Dan Stapleton from ''[[IGN]]'' admired the procedural generation technology and enjoyed the game's diverse missions.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/>\n\nHall liked the management aspect of the game, which he thought has \"[lent] a great sense of urgency and tension to every decision\".<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/> Rich Stanton from ''[[The Guardian]]'' liked the component, as players only have limited resources and time and they have to sort out different priorities, thus making every decision players made an important one.<ref name=\"GuardianRev\"/> Tom Senior from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' called the experience \"gripping\" and added that \"the game cleverly uses scarcity of opportunity to force you into difficult dilemmas\".<ref name=\"PCGUSRev\"/> McGee was disappointed with the Dark Events as he felt that they were \"passive and indirect\". McGee liked the strategic aspect but felt that the alien menace was rarely felt.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Dan Ryckert from [[Giant Bomb]] found the Avatar Project, which served as the game's [[doomsday clock]], to be a stressful experience, as it made him \"question every decision\" he has made when he was managing and sorting out the priorities of different tasks.<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> Reeves agreed, saying that \"Firaxis' masterclass in strategy design has you second-guessing all your choices and analyzing your smallest decisions\".<ref name=\"GIRev\"/> Bratt also liked the Project, which propelled players to react and respond instead of constantly [[grind]]ing for upgrades.<ref name=\"EGRev\"/> Character customization was also widely praised for allowing players to become attached to the soldiers, making each soldier's death impactful and memorable.<ref name=\"PolyRev\"/>\n\nThe game's difficulty received mixed responses. Rowen said the timed missions are not too difficult but that its \"merciless\" nature may turn some players away from the game. He also said some of the early missions are \"disproportionately difficult\" and frustrating to play.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> McGee enjoyed the challenge and said the timed challenges and other unpredictable elements \"keep tensions running high\", and that the experience would remain engrossing during subsequent playthroughs. Stanton and Stapleton praised the game's [[artificial intelligence]], which would take every tactical advantage it has to put pressure on players.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Stanton said this has made players more responsive and created a forward momentum that ''Enemy Unknown'' lacked.<ref name=\"GuardianRev\"/> Bratt praised the timed missions for encouraging players to take risks and be more offensive.<ref name=\"EGRev\"/> Mahardy noted the difficulty is \"fair\" and that ''XCOM 2'' is a brutal experience. He also said the game's difficulty is sometimes beyond challenging with enemies that sometimes ignoring the established gameplay rules.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/>\n\nThe game suffered from numerous technical difficulties at launch. While many reviewers noted minor software bugs during their experiences,<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> some critics\u2014including Rowen and Ryckert\u2014<ref name=\"GBRev\"/><ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> said the bugs ruined the experience.

Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.\n\n==Derech Eretz==\nThe phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): \"Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''Derech Eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin\". The term ''Derech Eretz'', literally \"the way of the land\", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}.</ref>\n\n===Appropriate behaviour and good character===\n{{see|Proper behavior precedes the Torah}}\n[[Image:Virtue. La Vertu (NYPL b14140320-1638489).jpg|thumb|200px|Personification of virtue - one aspect of ''Derech Eretz.'']]\nIn the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], there are approximately 200 teachings concerning ''Derech Eretz'' as decent, polite, respectful, thoughtful, and civilized behavior.<ref>{{citation | first = Jeff | last = Forsythe | url = http://www.shemayisrael.com/rabbiforsythe/interpersonal/derecheretz.htm | title = Derech Eretz: Civil, Polite and Thoughtful Behavior | publisher = Shema Yisrael}}.</ref> One representative teaching is that ''\"Derech Eretz comes before Torah\"'' (\u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05e7\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u05dc\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 ''[[Midrash#Midrash Rabbah|Midrash Vayikra Rabbah]]'' 9:3) \u2013 one cannot personify Torah until he demonstrates ''Derech Eretz'' in everything that he does. \n\nThere are many more such teachings in the [[rishonim]] and [[acharonim]] (post-Talmudic authorities). The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]].

All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.\n\n==Derech Eretz==\nThe phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): \"Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''Derech Eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin\". The term ''Derech Eretz'', literally \"the way of the land\", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}.</ref>\n\n===Appropriate behaviour and good character===\n{{see|Proper behavior precedes the Torah}}\n[[Image:Virtue. La Vertu (NYPL b14140320-1638489).jpg|thumb|200px|Personification of virtue - one aspect of ''Derech Eretz.'']]\nIn the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], there are approximately 200 teachings concerning ''Derech Eretz'' as decent, polite, respectful, thoughtful, and civilized behavior.<ref>{{citation | first = Jeff | last = Forsythe | url = http://www.shemayisrael.com/rabbiforsythe/interpersonal/derecheretz.htm | title = Derech Eretz: Civil, Polite and Thoughtful Behavior | publisher = Shema Yisrael}}.</ref> One representative teaching is that ''\"Derech Eretz comes before Torah\"'' (\u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05e7\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u05dc\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 ''[[Midrash#Midrash Rabbah|Midrash Vayikra Rabbah]]'' 9:3) \u2013 one cannot personify Torah until he demonstrates ''Derech Eretz'' in everything that he does. \n\nThere are many more such teachings in the [[rishonim]] and [[acharonim]] (post-Talmudic authorities). The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]].

All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\".

It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.
