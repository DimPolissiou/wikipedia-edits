Mohan for [[Shogun Films|Goodknight Films]].\n\nThe core story line, plot twists and the climax was heavily inspired by the novel ''Repati Koduku (Little Rascal)'' by [[Malladi Venkata Krishna Murthy]].\n\n==Plot==\nBobby ([[Mohanlal]]), orphaned at a young age, is brought up as his own son by his uncle, Retd. I.G Matthews ([[Thilakan]]). He is loved by everyone, especially the pre-teen kids of his cousin Baby ([[Venu Nagavalli]]). He is betrothed to Chackochan's ([[K. P. Ummer]]) daughter, Tina ([[Anju (actress)|Anju]]). However, out of the blue, his old flame from college, Nina ([[Shobhana]]), shows up with a toddler allegedly fathered by Bobby. He denies her claims vehemently and goes to great lengths to prove her wrong. However, Nina uses her wits to make Matthews believe her tale, thereby pinning Bobby as a liar as well. \n\nUnable to make a swift decision, it becomes a heavy responsibility of Bobby's household to keep the new info a secret from Chackochan. Therefore, Nina is presented to others as the new home tutor for Baby's children. Tied up with a slew of hilarious events involving Unnunni ([[Jagathi Sreekumar]]), who goes paranoid about Bobby having an illicit affair with his wife Daisy ([[Subhashini]]), Bobby is unable to prove his claims that the child is not a result of his relationship with Nina in the past. Bobby tells Daisy, who is actually just his best friend since childhood, about how his relationship with Nina started, grew and broke. In the meantime, Nina becomes an adept tutor and slowly develops a strong bond among all the members in Bobby's family, except Bobby himself.\n\nEventually, having discovered the apparent truth that Nina has already been married to Bobby, Chackochan calls off the wedding, and publicly humiliates Matthews for the dishonesty. With nothing left to lose, Bobby demands Nina to be his wife for real, but Nina adamantly refuses. Unable to handle Bobby's intimidation, Nina breaks down and tells him the truth.\n\nNina divulges the truth about the child to Baby, and also tells that Bobby has been innocent all along. During the days of his straining marriage, Baby had an affair with Nina's sister, who later died during childbirth, thus leaving Nina in the dire situation to deliver the child in Baby's care. Initially, Baby refuses, for the fear of the sordid fact tearing apart his married life. But Matthews overhears the conversation and slaps Baby. He also feels sorry for Bobby, who has taken too much toll already.\n\nHowever, fate has reserved an excruciating twist in line, when Nina suffers a fainting episode, right after turning down Bobby's offer to marry her. Thereupon it is revealed to Bobby and his family by Nina's brother, Dr. Romy ([[Lalu Alex]]) that she is terminally ill with [[polycythaemia vera|polycythemia vera]], just like her deceased sister. He fears that she must have skipped a dose or two by accident, which has caused her to collapse. He recalls how adamantly Nina wanted to ensure that her niece would not be orphaned, and her promise that she would breathe her last only in her brother's arms. Bobby's family stand together for Nina's good health, backed by a team of medical experts, to fight against the odds. Nina is relieved when she realizes that her niece has been gladly accepted into her rightful family. But her emotional surge puts her into a critical condition, leaving the family in mental agony.\n\nAs per the pre-planned schedule, Bobby races against the clock to get the medicine [[Phosphorus-32|radioactive phosphorus]] to save his beloved from the acute relapse. However, despite his best efforts and everybody's prayers, he cannot make it in time to save her. Dr. Romy along with Bobby are left devastated. The film ends with the household now left in silence of sorrow, implying a lone Bobby as well.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Mohanlal]] as Bobby\n*[[Shobana]] as Neena (Voice dubbed by [[Bhagyalakshmi]])\n*[[Thilakan]] as Retd.

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest in pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, \"a sexton was just another name for a janitor''.\"''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, and excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father, for the order's focus on the Holy Family and towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C., to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941, Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]] as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started letters to Bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]] to [[Madrid, Spain]] across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan ''\"The family that prays together stays together.\"''\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer, was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title ''\"The Rosary Priest\".''\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer, the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

During January 1935, the two men cooperated to purchase another aircraft manufacturer, the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 A\u00e9rienne Bordelaise]] (SAB) which, as the [[SNCASO|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 A\u00e9ronautique du Sud-Ouest]] (SASO), was responsible for manufacturing both the [[Bloch MB.200|MB.200]] and [[Bloch MB.210|MB.210]] bombers.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Separately, Bloch and Potez also purchased the majority of the shares of the [[Lorraine-Dietrich|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Moteurs et Automobiles Lorraine]] (SMAL) company.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> \n\nThe 1930s was a time of considerable social upheaval in France; seeking positive relations with influential [[trade union]]s, Bloch engaged directly with their representatives, leading to numerous additional benefits being granted to the company's employees, such as a week\u2019s paid leave from 1935.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> One year later, France's [[Popular Front]]-led government issued a policy permitting two weeks\u2019 paid holidays per year; in response, Bloch employees were given three weeks paid holiday per year. On 17 July 1936, the French government issued a new law that [[nationalised]] the nation's armament industry; this development heavily impacted for private aircraft companies as many were forcibly acquired and merged together.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> That year saw the creation of seven nationalised aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft ([[SNCASE]], SNCASO, [[SNCAN]], [[SNCAO]], [[SNCAM]], [[SNCAC]]), and one for aircraft engines ([[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale de Construction de Moteurs|SNCM]] - [[Lorraine-Dietrich]]).<ref name = \"Hartmann1\">{{citation |last1=Hartmann |first1=G\u00e9rard |title=Les r\u00e9alisations de la SNCASE |url=http://www.hydroretro.net/etudegh/sncase.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 15 July 2009 |date= 15 January 2005 |language=French |quote=Alors qu\u2019on ne sait pas tr\u00e8s clairement si les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s nationales sont des \u00ab usines de production de guerre \u00bb sans ind\u00e9pendance et sans bureau d'\u00e9tudes, la SNCASE est officiellement form\u00e9e le 1er f\u00e9vrier 1937.}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 January 1937, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch was formally nationalised; its assets, including its factories at Courbevoie, Ch\u00e2teauroux-D\u00e9ols, Villacoublay, Bordeaux, formed a major portion of the newly-established [[SNCASO|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale de constructions a\u00e9ronautiques du Sud-Ouest]] (SNCASO).<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Marcel Bloch was requested by the Minister for Air, [[Pierre Cot]], to serve as the company's delegated administrator. While he had effectively lost ownership, and much of the control, of his company, Bloch was initially given a relatively free hand in the management of the development workshop.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> This independence was later curtailed via amendments to the original nationalisation act.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nDuring 1937, the French Government, recognising the looming threat of another [[World War II|World War]] with neighbouring [[Nazi Germany]], launched a rearmament programme.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Accordingly, the production of large numbers of capable combat aircraft to meet the challenge of the rapidly-expanding [[Luftwaffe]] was therefore a major national priority. The company's designs, such as the [[Bloch MB.150|MB.150]] single-engined fighter and the [[Bloch MB.170|MB.170]] twin-engined bomber, were amongst those aircraft produced to meet this demand.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> As well as entire aircraft, the production of propellers was a major undertaking of the firm, as they were procured by various other French manufacturers for their own aircraft. Both Bloch and Potez were active in efforts to expand manufacturing capacity, leading to purchasing of land in [[Saint-Cloud]] (the western suburbs of [[Paris]]) for the construction of a new factory in 1938.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] during early September 1939, France's aeronautics manufacturing efforts reached a frantic pace, trying to satisfy the rapid order of thousands of airplanes, many of which had been placed too late to be fulfilled prior to the start of serious fighting in Western Europe.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> During the early months of the conflict, commonly referred to as [[Phoney War]], Bloch accelerated production while endeavouring to achieve ever-greater performance from a series of rushed prototypes. On 15 February 1940, Marcel Bloch discontinued his involvement with SNCASO following a dispute with the French Air Ministry.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Following the [[Battle of France]] and the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] marking France's surrender, the French aviation industry, including all equipment, stocks and industrial establishments, were turned over intact to Germany. Accordingly, the French aviation industry was virtually disbanded in near-totality and aircraft manufacturing effectively ceased.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nDuring this period, Marcel Bloch was [[interned]] by [[Vichy France]] officials, while endeavours were made by the company to preserve its remaining interests, leading to the appointment of a board of directors, the issuing of [[articles of association]], and Marcel Bloch's installation of chairman on 31 December 1940.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Despite pressure to collaborate, Marcel repeated refused to cooperate with the Germans. In response, the Germans requisitioned the Saint-Cloud factory, placing its manufacturing activity under the control of the [[Junkers]] aviation company.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nFollowing the liberation of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] on 11 April 1945, Marcel Bloch was freed from German captivity.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> However, by the end of the Second World War, the majority of France's aeronautical industrial facilities had been reduced to ruins, while its design offices had been dispersed. Bloch, remaining confident in the demand for commercial aviation in the new [[postwar]] era, was keen to relaunch his company. Accordingly, it was rebranded as [[Dassault Aviation]].<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\n==Aircraft models (and first flight)==\n=== Military ===\n\n* [[Bloch MB.80|MB.80]] & [[Bloch MB.81|MB.81]] 1932\n* [[Bloch MB.200|MB.200]], 1933<ref name=\"Dassault\">[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-bloch-aircraft/mb-200.html?L=1 \"Military Bloch aircraft : MB 200\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119213727/http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-bloch-aircraft/mb-200.html?L=1 |date=2008-11-19 }}.

On 17 July 1936, the French government issued a new law that [[nationalised]] the nation's armament industry; this development heavily impacted for private aircraft companies as many were forcibly acquired and merged together.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> That year saw the creation of seven nationalised aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft ([[SNCASE]], SNCASO, [[SNCAN]], [[SNCAO]], [[SNCAM]], [[SNCAC]]), and one for aircraft engines ([[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale de Construction de Moteurs|SNCM]] - [[Lorraine-Dietrich]]).<ref name = \"Hartmann1\">{{citation |last1=Hartmann |first1=G\u00e9rard |title=Les r\u00e9alisations de la SNCASE |url=http://www.hydroretro.net/etudegh/sncase.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 15 July 2009 |date= 15 January 2005 |language=French |quote=Alors qu\u2019on ne sait pas tr\u00e8s clairement si les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s nationales sont des \u00ab usines de production de guerre \u00bb sans ind\u00e9pendance et sans bureau d'\u00e9tudes, la SNCASE est officiellement form\u00e9e le 1er f\u00e9vrier 1937.}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 January 1937, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch was formally nationalised; its assets, including its factories at Courbevoie, Ch\u00e2teauroux-D\u00e9ols, Villacoublay, Bordeaux, formed a major portion of the newly-established [[SNCASO|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale de constructions a\u00e9ronautiques du Sud-Ouest]] (SNCASO).<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Marcel Bloch was requested by the Minister for Air, [[Pierre Cot]], to serve as the company's delegated administrator. While he had effectively lost ownership, and much of the control, of his company, Bloch was initially given a relatively free hand in the management of the development workshop.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> This independence was later curtailed via amendments to the original nationalisation act.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nDuring 1937, the French Government, recognising the looming threat of another [[World War II|World War]] with neighbouring [[Nazi Germany]], launched a rearmament programme.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Accordingly, the production of large numbers of capable combat aircraft to meet the challenge of the rapidly-expanding [[Luftwaffe]] was therefore a major national priority. The company's designs, such as the [[Bloch MB.150|MB.150]] single-engined fighter and the [[Bloch MB.170|MB.170]] twin-engined bomber, were amongst those aircraft produced to meet this demand.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> As well as entire aircraft, the production of propellers was a major undertaking of the firm, as they were procured by various other French manufacturers for their own aircraft. Both Bloch and Potez were active in efforts to expand manufacturing capacity, leading to purchasing of land in [[Saint-Cloud]] (the western suburbs of [[Paris]]) for the construction of a new factory in 1938.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] during early September 1939, France's aeronautics manufacturing efforts reached a frantic pace, trying to satisfy the rapid order of thousands of airplanes, many of which had been placed too late to be fulfilled prior to the start of serious fighting in Western Europe.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> During the early months of the conflict, commonly referred to as [[Phoney War]], Bloch accelerated production while endeavouring to achieve ever-greater performance from a series of rushed prototypes. On 15 February 1940, Marcel Bloch discontinued his involvement with SNCASO following a dispute with the French Air Ministry.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Following the [[Battle of France]] and the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] marking France's surrender, the French aviation industry, including all equipment, stocks and industrial establishments, were turned over intact to Germany. Accordingly, the French aviation industry was virtually disbanded in near-totality and aircraft manufacturing effectively ceased.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nDuring this period, Marcel Bloch was [[interned]] by [[Vichy France]] officials, while endeavours were made by the company to preserve its remaining interests, leading to the appointment of a board of directors, the issuing of [[articles of association]], and Marcel Bloch's installation of chairman on 31 December 1940.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Despite pressure to collaborate, Marcel repeated refused to cooperate with the Germans. In response, the Germans requisitioned the Saint-Cloud factory, placing its manufacturing activity under the control of the [[Junkers]] aviation company.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nFollowing the liberation of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] on 11 April 1945, Marcel Bloch was freed from German captivity.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> However, by the end of the Second World War, the majority of France's aeronautical industrial facilities had been reduced to ruins, while its design offices had been dispersed. Bloch, remaining confident in the demand for commercial aviation in the new [[postwar]] era, was keen to relaunch his company. Accordingly, it was rebranded as [[Dassault Aviation]].<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\n==Aircraft models (and first flight)==\n=== Military ===\n\n* [[Bloch MB.80|MB.80]] & [[Bloch MB.81|MB.81]] 1932\n* [[Bloch MB.200|MB.200]], 1933<ref name=\"Dassault\">[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-bloch-aircraft/mb-200.html?L=1 \"Military Bloch aircraft : MB 200\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119213727/http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-bloch-aircraft/mb-200.html?L=1 |date=2008-11-19 }}.
