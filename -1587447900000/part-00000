The series focuses on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in fictional [[Point Place|Point Place, Wisconsin]], from May 17, 1976, to December 31, 1979.<!--Please don't change end date to anything else, including January 1, 1980--><ref>{{Cite episode|title=That '70s Finale|episodelink=That '70s Finale|series=That '70s Show|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]|airdate=May 18, 2006|season=8|number=22|minutes=21:20}}</ref>\n\nThe main teenage cast members were [[Topher Grace]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Danny Masterson]], [[Laura Prepon]] and [[Wilmer Valderrama]]. The main adult cast members were [[Debra Jo Rupp]], [[Kurtwood Smith]], [[Don Stark]], [[Tommy Chong]] and [[Tanya Roberts]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of That '70s Show characters}}\n\n===Teenagers===\n*[[Topher Grace]] as [[Eric Forman]] (seasons 1\u20137; uncredited special guest season 8): Eric is a nice guy, geeky, physically slight and somewhat clumsy. He is a smart-aleck with a fast wit and a deadpan sense of humor. His obsession with movies, particularly ''[[Star Wars]]'', is often referenced throughout the show. For seven seasons Eric is in a relationship with his longtime love and neighbor [[Donna Pinciotti]]. His father, Red, is always hard on him. He convinces his parents to let his best friend [[Steven Hyde]] move in with them, making Hyde like a brother. He decides to become a teacher after high school and he leaves the series at the end of the seventh season to teach in Africa. Although Eric is mentioned at least once in every episode, he does not appear during the final season until the end of the [[That '70s Finale|series finale]].\n*[[Mila Kunis]] as [[Jackie Burkhart]]: The youngest member of the group, Jackie starts the series as the pretty, spoiled rich, selfish, oftentimes annoying immature girl. She likes to give thoughtless and superficial advice, which occasionally turns out to be correct. As the series progresses she becomes more genuine, after her father, a crooked politician, goes to jail and her fortunes take a reversal. Partly as a result of these changes, Donna and she become better friends.<ref name=\"Barash\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3B1jhHEBuYC&pg=PA81|title=Tripping the Prom Queen: The Truth About Women and Rivalry|last=Barash|first=Susan Shapiro|date=2007-03-06|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312334321|language=en}}</ref> By the end of the series, Jackie had dated three of the four guys of the group: Kelso, Hyde and Fez.\n*[[Ashton Kutcher]] as [[Michael Kelso]] (seasons 1-7; special guest season 8): Kelso is the dumb pretty boy of the group, who hopes to coast through life on his good looks. Often referred to as \"The King\" in many episodes, he spends the first half of the series in a relationship with the equally vapid Jackie. Their relationship comes to an end when Laurie (Eric's older sister) reveals their affair to Jackie. Kelso fathers a daughter, named Betsy, from his relationship with a librarian named Brooke during the seventh season. He becomes a police officer, but is fired for utter incompetence. In the 4th episode of the eighth and final season, he becomes a [[security guard]] at a [[Chicago]] [[Playboy Club]] and leaves the show. Kelso, along with Eric, returns for the series finale. [[James Franco]] had auditioned for the role, but was immediately passed over.\n*[[Danny Masterson]] as [[Steven Hyde]]: Eric's best friend and the anti-establishment member of the group. By the end of season one, the Formans allow Hyde to move in after he was abandoned by his mother, making him a foster brother to Eric. Hyde has a witty, blunt and sarcastic sense of humor and a rebellious personality. He is also experienced and the other group members often ask for his advice. Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, in the final season he marries an exotic dancer named Samantha. Hyde later discovers Samantha was married to another man when she married him. As Donna points out in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep194|My Fairy King]]\", that means Hyde and Samantha are not legally married. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by [[Tim Reid]]), a wealthy black businessman (making Hyde, who was presumed white, biracial). Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first an office worker, then a manager and later the owner of the Point Place record store. He also previously worked for Leo in a Photo Hut earlier in the series. The original casting director, Debby Romano, resisted Masterson's audition because he was slightly older than the rest of the cast, but ultimately allowed him to audition. [[Robert Rodriguez]] cut out his part in the feature film ''[[The Faculty]]'' to allow Masterson to shoot the pilot.\n*[[Laura Prepon]] as [[Donna Pinciotti]]: Eric's longtime girlfriend (and briefly fianc\u00e9e) who is literally and figuratively \"[[girl next door|the girl next door]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywood.com/style/our-favorite-tomboys-of-tv-donna-pinciotti-from-that-70s-show-59087873/|title=Tomboy Chic: That 70s Show's Donna Pinciotti|last=Smith|first=Laura|date=2014-03-28|work=Hollywood.com|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}</ref> Donna is tall, intelligent, good-looking and athletic. Donna is embarrassed by her parents' escapades - especially sexual ones. Although she does not agree with what Jackie represents in the beginning of the series, they become friends.<ref name=\"Barash\" /> Donna is in a relationship with Eric for seven seasons (despite their break-up during season 4). She has brief romances with Casey, Michael's brother and Randy during the final season and quickly ends it. She rekindles her relationship with Eric at the end of the show's finale. When production ended on the sixth season, Prepon dyed her hair blond for her lead role in the feature film ''[[Karla (film)|Karla]]'', resulting in her character Donna becoming a blond in the final two seasons.\n*[[Wilmer Valderrama]] as [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]]: The horny [[foreign exchange student]] of the group whose hormones are usually out of control. He constantly flirts with Jackie and Donna and often makes romantic advances toward them. Initially, he has trouble getting attention from girls, but during the eighth season he becomes a [[wikt:lady's man|ladies' man]]. He is in love with Jackie throughout the series but his love is not reciprocated until the eighth season when they become a couple. His home country is often referenced throughout the course of the show, but is never named specifically. \n*[[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] as {{visible anchor|Randy Pearson}} (season 8): Hyde's employee at the record store. He is introduced in the final season. Randy appears laid back, gentle, polite and a ladies' man, although many of his flaws surface later, encompassing parts of the departed Kelso and Eric's personalities and other attributes. Tall (like Kelso), he tends to spout witty one-liners (like Eric), and makes silly voices. He forms a friendship with Red after showing Red how good he is at fixing things. While Hyde, Jackie, Donna and Kelso embrace him as a new member of their group, Fez initially does not, but soon warms up to him. Randy dates Donna for the majority of season eight, but she later breaks up with him. The two end on good terms and remain friends. He makes a brief appearance in the series finale. Meyers was originally slated to take on the role of Eric, but the producers feared that this recasting would offend Grace's fans, so the role of Randy was created instead. However, the character was met with mixed reviews, though Meyers' performance received high praise.\n\n===Adults===\n*[[Debra Jo Rupp]] as [[Kitty Forman]]: Red's wife and mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A  nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric's rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.\n*[[Kurtwood Smith]] as [[Red Forman]]: Kitty's husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's adoptive father. A conservative Navy combat veteran, he served in World War II and the Korean War. He is frequently hard on Eric and casually insults him, often calling him \u201cdumbass\u201d. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing. The producers sought [[Chuck Norris]] for the role, but the actor declined due to commitments with [[Walker, Texas Ranger]]. Smith (the only cast member born in [[Wisconsin]]) modeled his performance after his relationship with his stepdad, who died shortly before the pilot was filmed.\n*[[Lisa Robin Kelly]] (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and [[Christina Moore]] (recurring season 6) as {{visible anchor|Laurie Forman}}: Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often insult her for her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series again during season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, \"bottomless dancing is legal\".\n*[[Tanya Roberts]] as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1\u20133; special guest appearance seasons 6\u20137): Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend, Midge is the sexy mom whom Eric and his male friends fantasize when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after divorcing Bob and moving to California. She returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a limited recurring role. She is temporarily replaced in Bob's heart by the aggressive, assertive Joanne (played by [[Mo Gaffney]]), tall like Midge but not as pretty. \n*[[Don Stark]] as Bob Pinciotti: Midge's husband and Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|veteran of foreign wars]]. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood and is a ladies' man. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner. After Midge divorced Bob in the fourth season, he began dating Joanne (in seasons four and five) and Pam Burkhart (played by [[Brooke Shields]] replacing [[Eve Plumb]] from the first season), Jackie's mother (in seasons six and seven).\n*[[Tommy Chong]] as [[Leo (That '70s Show)|Leo]] (seasons 4 & 8; special guest seasons 2\u20133 & 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a [[Purple Heart]]. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four, but is later referenced in season five's \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep120|The Battle of Evermore]]\" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of That '70s Show episodes}}\n{{:List of That '70s Show episodes}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe creators had wanted the show to have a 1970s \"feel\" from the beginning, so opted to set the series later in the decade, when trends and political ideologies had become firmly established and disseminated. The idea that the duration of the series would carry sociopolitical undertones also necessitated a chain of social events which could influence the characters. Thus, 1976 was chosen, which allowed episodes set within a short time frame to address [[streaking]], the [[sexual revolution]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], the [[1973 oil crisis]], and the presidencies of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]], all of which were culturally influential events that occurred in the earlier years of the 1970s. The shift to 1977 during the last half of the first season also allowed the inclusion of the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie, which premiered in May 1977.\n\nThroughout the first two seasons, episodes opened with title cards showing the season/month and year (example: Late Spring, 1977 or June 1977). These were largely abandoned after season two, with few subsequent episodes using them. However, they were used again in the final episode, i.e. \"December 31, 1979 10:45 a.m.\" From the premiere onward, the episode's year could be determined by the [[license plates of Wisconsin|registration tag]]s on Eric's Vista Cruiser at the end of the opening and closing credits. Season 1 showed a \"76\" year tag, seasons 2-3 showed \"77\" tags, seasons 3-6 showed \"78\" tags, seasons 7-8 showed \"79\" tags, and the final episode of season 8's closing credits showed an \"80\" tag.\n\nThe show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, \"Grandma's Dead\", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach \"one\" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DuRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT96|title=Watching TV Religiously (Engaging Culture): Television and Theology in Dialogue|last=Callaway|first=Kutter|last2=Batali|first2=Dean|date=2016-11-15|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=9781493405855|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe show's unexpected longevity (it was the only series to debut on Fox in 1998 to survive cancellation) combined with the first season jump to 1977 necessitated a slow-down of the series' timeline. Over time, this proved problematic from a narrative standpoint, as nearly every year featured a Thanksgiving and/or Christmas episode, and the teen-aged actors playing high-school student characters all aged into their mid-20s by the time their characters graduated from high school after five seasons (except Mila Kunis, who was not quite 20). As the series timeline sped up and slowed down with more rapidity near the series' climax, the timeline necessitated that several major events depicted as having occurred months apart would have in fact happened within weeks or even days of one another.\n\nThe timeline issues experienced on the show were not unprecedented, as other period-specific TV series have had similar issues. Most notably, ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' aired for 11 seasons despite the [[Korean War]] only lasting three years. Additionally, many TV series over the years that take place in the present time have characters [[Soap opera rapid aging syndrome|age faster than normal while other characters age naturally]].\n\n===Eighth season and series finale===\nThe character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the [[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 7)|seventh season]], as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.<ref name=foxdeparture>{{Cite news|last=Bernhard|first=Lisa|title=Ashton, Topher Departing 'That '70s Show'|publisher=Fox News|date=May 18, 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,156846,00.html|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}</ref> Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.<ref name=foxdeparture/> However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) and later returned for the finale. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was originally supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by [[Bret Harrison]], as an \"innocent character\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series ''[[The Loop (U.S. TV series)|The Loop]]''.<ref>DVD commentary of episode 25 of season 7 by director Trainer.</ref> Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by [[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] (brother of Late Night host [[Seth Meyers]]), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.<ref name=topherreplacement>{{Cite news|last=Tribune Media Service|title=Celebrity Spotlight|newspaper=Observer-Reporter|location=Washington, PA|page=C6|publisher=Observer Publishing Company|date=November 30, 2005|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wZY1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=8igMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2099,36343722&dq=josh+meyers+randy+pearson&hl=en|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Another new character, Samantha, a [[stripper]] played by [[Jud Tylor]], was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle.

The original version of the song appeared on Big Star's 1972 debut album [[Number 1 Record|''#1 Record'']].

Instead, a cover version sung by [[Todd Griffin]] was used as the theme song for the show's first season. Beginning in the second season, the theme song was performed by the band [[Cheap Trick]].

[[Volcano Entertainment]].</ref><!-- NOTE: Please do not say who yells \"Hello, Wisconsin\" unless you can back the claim up with a RELIABLE SOURCE. --> Alternate holiday versions of the theme song were arranged for Halloween and Christmas specials, using organ music and bells, respectively.\n\n====Opening credits====\nOpening credits for seasons 1\u20137 showed members of the cast driving in Eric's car singing the theme song together. At the conclusion of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening).\n\nAfter Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, [[Mila Kunis]] \"Hanging Out...;\" [[Danny Masterson]] \"Down the Street\"). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were [[Kurtwood Smith]] and [[Tommy Chong]], with the exception of the first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last \"We're all alright\". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong looks around the room, confused as he hears \"Hello, Wisconsin!\" The [[That '70s Finale|final episode]] omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.\n\n===Elements of the show===\n====The 1970s====\n{{original research section|date=November 2015}}\nThe show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as [[human sexuality|sexual]] attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the [[1970s recession]], mistrust of the [[government of the United States|American government]] by [[blue-collar worker]]s, and [[underage drinking]]/teenage [[recreational drug use|drug use]]. The series also highlighted developments in the entertainment industry, including the television [[remote control|remote]] (\"the clicker\"), [[reruns]], [[VCR]], and [[cable television|cable TV]]; the [[video games]] ''[[Pong]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]''; the [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] and [[Disco]]; [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]]; and Eric's obsession with ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ifc.com/shows/that-70s-show/blog/2015/12/that-70s-show-history|title=13 Times That '70s Show Tackled History|work=IFC|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}</ref> The show has been compared to ''[[Happy Days]]'', which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/arts/television/12hoch.html?_r=0|title=Even Those 70's Kids Should Have Seen It Coming|quote=Like 'Happy Days', 'That 70's Show' blends smart comedy with light social commentary.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2006-02-12|last1=Hochman|first1=David}}</ref>\n\nBeginning with the second season, the show focused less on the sociopolitical aspects of the story. For example, the dynamic of the relationship between Eric and Donna was altered in later seasons to more closely resemble the relationships of other \"[[Supercouple|power couples]]\" on teen dramas. Likewise, the first season of the show featured a recurring, more dramatic storyline in which the Formans were in danger of losing their home due to Red's hours being cut back at the auto parts plant where he worked. Storylines in later seasons were generally presented more comically and less dramatically.\n\nThe show also featured guest-starring actors from 1970s TV shows, such as [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Valerie Harper]] and [[Betty White]] (''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''), [[Tom Poston]] and [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] (''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''), [[Pamela Sue Martin]] (''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]''), [[Tim Reid]] and [[Howard Hesseman]] (''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''), [[Eve Plumb]], [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] and [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]] (''[[The Brady Bunch]]''), [[Tom Bosley]] and [[Marion Ross]] (''[[Happy Days]]''), [[Monty Hall]] (''[[Let's Make A Deal]]''), [[Gavin MacLeod]] (''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''), [[Don Knotts]], [[Richard Kline]] and [[Jenilee Harrison]] (''[[Three's Company]]''), and [[Danny Bonaduce]] and [[Shirley Jones]] (''[[The Partridge Family]]''). Series recurring cast member [[Tanya Roberts]] also starred in a popular show in the 1970s (''[[Charlie's Angels]]'').\n\nBeginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: [[Led Zeppelin]] (season 5), [[The Who]] (Season 6), [[The Rolling Stones]] (season 7), and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (season 8, except for the finale, titled \"That '70s Finale\").<ref>{{cite book|last1=Egan|first1=James|title=3000 Facts about TV Shows|date=2016|publisher=Lulu|page=328}}</ref>\n\n====Split screens====\nOne device in the show is to present a split screen in which two pairs of characters speak. One character is usually seeking advice on a problem with a character in the second pairing and the other character advises them. Although the conversations appear to mirror each other, notable differences often occur. It is most often used by the couples of the show, with each member of the couple being advised on the relationship. For example, in the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 3)#ep62|Who Wants It More?]]\", Donna and Eric tell Jackie and Hyde that they have been holding out on each other sexually for three days and that maybe they should cave. Both Jackie and Hyde tell Donna and Eric not to cave or the \"caver\" will be owned by the other.\n\n====Dream sequences====\nThe show includes character daydream sequences, some of which refer to or parody fads and films of the time, such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Rocky]]'', and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.\n\nThe character picturing the dream sometimes also narrates it, but regardless, the other characters present see the same dream. In the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep183|Stone Cold Crazy]]\", Jackie mentioned she liked the song playing in Fez's dream sequence. The sequences are usually introduced by a wobbling screen transition. Sometimes, the transition is absent when the characters who imagine the scene believe they are real (for example, Eric's dream about Donna in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep2|Eric's Birthday]]\" or Jackie's dream about Hyde proposing in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 7)#ep168|It's All Over Now]]\").\n\nIn the 100th episode, \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep100|That '70s Musical]]\", all singing scenes were Fez's dream sequences.\n\n====The circle====\n[[File:70sFinaleCircle.png|200px|thumb|right|The circle illustrated the teens' marijuana use, usually in [[Eric Forman|Eric's]] basement. The picture is of the final scene of the series.]]\n\nIn the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as he or she speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme [[wide-angle lens]] added to the \"drug-induced\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word \"marijuana\" while in the circle (except in one episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 3)#ep52|Reefer Madness]]\"), often referring to it as \"stuff\" or a \"stash\". In the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep81|Bye-Bye Basement]]\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \"weed\"; in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep82|The Relapse]]\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\" in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep13|Ski Trip]]\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep5|Eric's Burger Job]]\", Kelso blames his \"roach clip\" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (\"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep15|That Wrestling Show]]\" and \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep24|Hyde Moves In]]\"), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \"Cannabis Sativa\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep17|The Pill]]\", Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \"That kid's on dope!\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.\n\nAs the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep96|Class Picture]]\", \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 6)#ep136|I'm A Boy]]\", \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 6)#ep147|Substitute]]\", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle sans smoke replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.\n\n====The stupid helmet====\nThe stupid helmet refers to a replica of a [[Green Bay Packers]] helmet that a character is forced to wear after having done or said something deemed stupid by the rest of the gang. Eric had to wear it when he said he wanted to propose to Donna and Fez wore it when he started banging his head on the table after trying to help Kelso keep Jackie. The helmet can be seen in the Forman basement on a shelf behind the cast. When the series concluded in 2006, the last one up the staircase had to call Red a \"dumbass\", something he always called the kids. Since Kelso was the last one up, he grabbed the helmet.\n\n====The water tower====\nIn many episodes, the teenaged characters often hang out on a local [[water tower]]. At the end of several water tower segments, at least one character falls off (usually Kelso). When Charlie Richardson (played by [[Bret Harrison]]) fell off and died in season 8, the water tower was renamed in his honor.\n\nAfter Charlie's death, Kelso fell off again, but survived, leading him to believe he was \"invincible\". In the \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep21|Water Tower episode]]\", the gang painted a [[marijuana leaf]] on the tower, but it looked more like a green hand giving [[the finger]]. In the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep127|The Immigrant Song (a.k.a. Fez Gets Busted)]]\" Kelso paints Jackie and his name on the tower to annoy Hyde just before falling and ending up in the hospital. During this episode, Fez paints his manhood on the tower but only gets as far as drawing a circle when the police arrive to arrest him. Kelso was known to fall off the water tower once in every grade since middle school. This is also where Eric proposes to Donna (\"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep110|Hot Dog]]\"), and where Jackie and Fez share their first official kiss  in the [[That '70s Finale|show's finale]].\n\n====Scene transitions====\nIn the first season, scene transitions (also known as [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]]) consisted of animated [[smiley]] buttons<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Ken|title=That '70s Show|url=https://www.ew.com/article/1998/09/18/70s-show|website=EW.com}}</ref> or still images of faces from the 1970s with only the mouth moving using [[Syncro-Vox]], usually yelling, in a rock form, \"Yeahhh!\" or something similar (ex. [[Farrah Fawcett]] saying \"Yeah!\" or [[Richard Nixon]] saying \"Are you ready to rock and roll?\") The smiley buttons were removed for re-runs and home video, replaced with flowers likewise exploding, replicating, deflating or bouncing around. Sometimes they would be visuals of [[lava lamps]] with the show's logo plummeting to the bottom of the screen in front of it.\n\nBeginning in season 2, transitions featured the characters doing something in front of a colorful, psychedelic, [[lava lamp]]-like background. These transitions featured the most prominent characters of the scene usually dancing, falling or making facial expressions. The music accompanying these colorful sequences would match the tone of the episode and characters.\n\nBy the show's final season, new transitions were created to accommodate cast changes (e.g. Donna's hair color, Leo continuing as a series regular and the insertion of Randy).\n\n\"Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)\" is the only episode where Laurie Forman is featured in a transition. Tanya Roberts is the only regular actor not to be featured in a transition.\n\n====The Vista Cruiser====\nMany of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \"Aztec Gold\" 1969 [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]], handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.\n\nThat particular [[station wagon]] was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for \"no more than\" [[US$]]500.<ref>{{youtube|id=0IPM_CMRQko|title=That 70s Show wrap party Access Hollywood official}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tate |first=James |url=http://editorial.autos.msn.com/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=1080100&icid=autos_0909004&GT1=22008#9 |title=MSN Autos list of 'Ten Greatest Cars On Television \u2013 Ever!' |publisher=Editorial.autos.msn.com |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717033659/http://editorial.autos.msn.com/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=1080100&icid=autos_0909004&GT1=22008#9 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Running gags and catchphrases====\n{{original research section|date=August 2017}}\nIn one of the show's major [[running gags]], Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of [[catchphrase]], \"kicking your ass\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/that-70s-show-took-tv-adolescence-down-into-the-baseme-1798270795|title=That \u201970s Show took TV adolescence down into the basement (where it belongs)|last=Adams|first=Erik|website=TV Club|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> For example, in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 2)#ep43|Kitty and Eric's Night Out]]\", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, \"I swear I'll kick his ass!\" In \"[[That '70s Show (season 4)#ep90|Eric's Hot Cousin]]\", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, \"And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass\", and, in \"[[That '70s Show (season 4)#ep97|Prank Day]]\", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone \"horribly, horribly wrong\" Red says, \"Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot ''doesn't'' plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!\" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.\n\nSome other notable running gags and catchphrases are:\n* Red's favorite insult is \"dumbass\", the origin of which is revealed in \"[[That '70s Show (season 2)#ep30|Halloween]]\". Ironically, Eric is the first character to say \"dumbass\" in \"[[That '70s Show (season 1)#ep5|Eric's Burger Job]]\". The insult is adopted by the whole gang and even occasionally by Kitty. Red regularly comes up with new choice insults such as \"kettlehead\" (which refers to Kelso).\n* Fez's country of origin is never revealed. Sometimes, Fez is about to disclose where he is from, or at least hint at it, but something happens to prevent him from doing so, like someone entering the room as seen in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep14|Stolen Car]]\", or Fez rambling in \"[[Love of My Life (That '70s Show)|Love of My Life]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gazettereview.com/2017/02/happened-wilmer-vader-news-updates/|title=What Happened to Wilmer Valderrama - 2017 Update - The Gazette Review|last=Carter|first=Brooke|date=2017-02-13|work=The Gazette Review|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Fez's real name was also never revealed.

Charlie is the only one to fell off and died from the tower in \"[[That '70s Show (season 8)#ep1|Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" due to him having weak endurance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://emgn.com/entertainment/10-running-gags-favorite-90s-tv-shows/|title=10 Running Gags From Your Favorite 90s TV Shows|work=EMGN|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* The word \"Burn!\", a term used by a character after something bad or offensive happens at another character's expense, although it is more often used by Kelso. According to Kelso in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 3)#ep64|Dine and Dash]]\", a good burn consists of two elements: \"You didn't see it coming; parts of it really hurt.\"\n* Hyde would usually give Kelso a punch in the arm for either his stupidity or bad behavior.\n* Kelso yells \"Ow, my eye!\" when Hyde rough-houses with him. For example, in the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep96|Class Picture]]\", a series of flashbacks feature Hyde beating up Kelso. While the two are out of the immediate sight of the audience, Kelso yells, \"Ow, my eye!\" and the scene cuts to the next flashback. This gag is repeated several times throughout the series, although the only time Kelso appears with an injured eye is in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep95|Jackie's Cheese Squeeze]]\" after he was punched by Todd, Jackie's manager. On that occasion, Kelso did not yell, \"Ow, my eye!\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/weird-running-jokes-tv-shows-friends/|title=15 Weirdest Running Jokes You Didn't Notice In Favorite TV Shows|date=2016-12-15|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Fez uses the phrase \"Good day\", followed by another cast member saying, \"But Fez...\" and Fez immediately interrupts with an exclamatory, \"I said good day!\" In some instances, the words vary, but the interaction is the same.\n* Eric has a never-ending streak of quoting ''[[Star Wars]]''. In several episodes, he relates things to ''Star Wars'', or quotes the film. In times of trouble, he brings a toy light saber and his going-away present from Donna was her dressing up as [[Princess Leia]].\n* Everyone who calls Eric's action figures \"dolls\" is always loudly corrected by Eric: \"They're action figures!\"\n* Kitty often uses alcohol or her use is mentioned, particularly after she starts menopause during the fifth season.\n* Fez's sex life or usually lack thereof.

The series focuses on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in fictional [[Point Place|Point Place, Wisconsin]], from May 17, 1976, to December 31, 1979.<!--Please don't change end date to anything else, including January 1, 1980--><ref>{{Cite episode|title=That '70s Finale|episodelink=That '70s Finale|series=That '70s Show|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]|airdate=May 18, 2006|season=8|number=22|minutes=21:20}}</ref>\n\nThe main teenage cast members were [[Topher Grace]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Danny Masterson]], [[Laura Prepon]] and [[Wilmer Valderrama]]. The main adult cast members were [[Debra Jo Rupp]], [[Kurtwood Smith]], [[Don Stark]], [[Tommy Chong]] and [[Tanya Roberts]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of That '70s Show characters}}\n\n===Teenagers===\n*[[Topher Grace]] as [[Eric Forman]] (seasons 1\u20137; uncredited special guest season 8): Eric is a nice guy, geeky, physically slight and somewhat clumsy. He is a smart-aleck with a fast wit and a deadpan sense of humor. His obsession with movies, particularly ''[[Star Wars]]'', is often referenced throughout the show. For seven seasons Eric is in a relationship with his longtime love and neighbor [[Donna Pinciotti]]. His father, Red, is always hard on him. He convinces his parents to let his best friend [[Steven Hyde]] move in with them, making Hyde like a brother. He decides to become a teacher after high school and he leaves the series at the end of the seventh season to teach in Africa. Although Eric is mentioned at least once in every episode, he does not appear during the final season until the end of the [[That '70s Finale|series finale]].\n*[[Mila Kunis]] as [[Jackie Burkhart]]: The youngest member of the group, Jackie starts the series as the pretty, spoiled rich, selfish, oftentimes annoying immature girl. She likes to give thoughtless and superficial advice, which occasionally turns out to be correct. As the series progresses she becomes more genuine, after her father, a crooked politician, goes to jail and her fortunes take a reversal. Partly as a result of these changes, Donna and she become better friends.<ref name=\"Barash\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3B1jhHEBuYC&pg=PA81|title=Tripping the Prom Queen: The Truth About Women and Rivalry|last=Barash|first=Susan Shapiro|date=2007-03-06|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312334321|language=en}}</ref> By the end of the series, Jackie had dated three of the four guys of the group: Kelso, Hyde and Fez.\n*[[Ashton Kutcher]] as [[Michael Kelso]] (seasons 1-7; special guest season 8): Kelso is the dumb pretty boy of the group, who hopes to coast through life on his good looks. Often referred to as \"The King\" in many episodes, he spends the first half of the series in a relationship with the equally vapid Jackie. Their relationship comes to an end when Laurie (Eric's older sister) reveals their affair to Jackie. Kelso fathers a daughter, named Betsy, from his relationship with a librarian named Brooke during the seventh season. He becomes a police officer, but is fired for utter incompetence. In the 4th episode of the eighth and final season, he becomes a [[security guard]] at a [[Chicago]] [[Playboy Club]] and leaves the show. Kelso, along with Eric, returns for the series finale. [[James Franco]] had auditioned for the role, but was immediately passed over.\n*[[Danny Masterson]] as [[Steven Hyde]]: Eric's best friend and the anti-establishment member of the group. By the end of season one, the Formans allow Hyde to move in after he was abandoned by his mother, making him a foster brother to Eric. Hyde has a witty, blunt and sarcastic sense of humor and a rebellious personality. He is also experienced and the other group members often ask for his advice. Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, in the final season he marries an exotic dancer named Samantha. Hyde later discovers Samantha was married to another man when she married him. As Donna points out in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep194|My Fairy King]]\", that means Hyde and Samantha are not legally married. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by [[Tim Reid]]), a wealthy black businessman (making Hyde, who was presumed white, biracial). Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first an office worker, then a manager and later the owner of the Point Place record store. He also previously worked for Leo in a Photo Hut earlier in the series. The original casting director, Debby Romano, resisted Masterson's audition because he was slightly older than the rest of the cast, but ultimately allowed him to audition. [[Robert Rodriguez]] cut out his part in the feature film ''[[The Faculty]]'' to allow Masterson to shoot the pilot.\n*[[Laura Prepon]] as [[Donna Pinciotti]]: Eric's longtime girlfriend (and briefly fianc\u00e9e) who is literally and figuratively \"[[girl next door|the girl next door]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywood.com/style/our-favorite-tomboys-of-tv-donna-pinciotti-from-that-70s-show-59087873/|title=Tomboy Chic: That 70s Show's Donna Pinciotti|last=Smith|first=Laura|date=2014-03-28|work=Hollywood.com|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}</ref> Donna is tall, intelligent, good-looking and athletic. Donna is embarrassed by her parents' escapades - especially sexual ones. Although she does not agree with what Jackie represents in the beginning of the series, they become friends.<ref name=\"Barash\" /> Donna is in a relationship with Eric for seven seasons (despite their break-up during season 4). She has brief romances with Casey, Michael's brother and Randy during the final season and quickly ends it. She rekindles her relationship with Eric at the end of the show's finale. When production ended on the sixth season, Prepon dyed her hair blond for her lead role in the feature film ''[[Karla (film)|Karla]]'', resulting in her character Donna becoming a blond in the final two seasons.\n*[[Wilmer Valderrama]] as [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]]: The horny [[foreign exchange student]] of the group whose hormones are usually out of control. He constantly flirts with Jackie and Donna and often makes romantic advances toward them. Initially, he has trouble getting attention from girls, but during the eighth season he becomes a [[wikt:lady's man|ladies' man]]. He is in love with Jackie throughout the series but his love is not reciprocated until the eighth season when they become a couple. His home country is often referenced throughout the course of the show, but is never named specifically. \n*[[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] as {{visible anchor|Randy Pearson}} (season 8): Hyde's employee at the record store. He is introduced in the final season. Randy appears laid back, gentle, polite and a ladies' man, although many of his flaws surface later, encompassing parts of the departed Kelso and Eric's personalities and other attributes. Tall (like Kelso), he tends to spout witty one-liners (like Eric), and makes silly voices. He forms a friendship with Red after showing Red how good he is at fixing things. While Hyde, Jackie, Donna and Kelso embrace him as a new member of their group, Fez initially does not, but soon warms up to him. Randy dates Donna for the majority of season eight, but she later breaks up with him. The two end on good terms and remain friends. He makes a brief appearance in the series finale. Meyers was originally slated to take on the role of Eric, but the producers feared that this recasting would offend Grace's fans, so the role of Randy was created instead. However, the character was met with mixed reviews, though Meyers' performance received high praise.\n\n===Adults===\n*[[Debra Jo Rupp]] as [[Kitty Forman]]: Red's wife and mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A  nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric's rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.\n*[[Kurtwood Smith]] as [[Red Forman]]: Kitty's husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's adoptive father. A conservative Navy combat veteran, he served in World War II and the Korean War. He is frequently hard on Eric and casually insults him, often calling him \u201cdumbass\u201d. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing. The producers sought [[Chuck Norris]] for the role, but the actor declined due to commitments with [[Walker, Texas Ranger]]. Smith (the only cast member born in [[Wisconsin]]) modeled his performance after his relationship with his stepdad, who died shortly before the pilot was filmed.\n*[[Lisa Robin Kelly]] (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and [[Christina Moore]] (recurring season 6) as {{visible anchor|Laurie Forman}}: Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often insult her for her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series again during season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, \"bottomless dancing is legal\".\n*[[Tanya Roberts]] as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1\u20133; special guest appearance seasons 6\u20137): Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend, Midge is the sexy mom whom Eric and his male friends fantasize when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after divorcing Bob and moving to California. She returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a limited recurring role. She is temporarily replaced in Bob's heart by the aggressive, assertive Joanne (played by [[Mo Gaffney]]), tall like Midge but not as pretty. \n*[[Don Stark]] as Bob Pinciotti: Midge's husband and Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|veteran of foreign wars]]. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood and is a ladies' man. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner. After Midge divorced Bob in the fourth season, he began dating Joanne (in seasons four and five) and Pam Burkhart (played by [[Brooke Shields]] replacing [[Eve Plumb]] from the first season), Jackie's mother (in seasons six and seven).\n*[[Tommy Chong]] as [[Leo (That '70s Show)|Leo]] (seasons 4 & 8; special guest seasons 2\u20133 & 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a [[Purple Heart]]. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four, but is later referenced in season five's \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep120|The Battle of Evermore]]\" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of That '70s Show episodes}}\n{{:List of That '70s Show episodes}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe creators had wanted the show to have a 1970s \"feel\" from the beginning, so opted to set the series later in the decade, when trends and political ideologies had become firmly established and disseminated. The idea that the duration of the series would carry sociopolitical undertones also necessitated a chain of social events which could influence the characters. Thus, 1976 was chosen, which allowed episodes set within a short time frame to address [[streaking]], the [[sexual revolution]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], the [[1973 oil crisis]], and the presidencies of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]], all of which were culturally influential events that occurred in the earlier years of the 1970s. The shift to 1977 during the last half of the first season also allowed the inclusion of the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie, which premiered in May 1977.\n\nThroughout the first two seasons, episodes opened with title cards showing the season/month and year (example: Late Spring, 1977 or June 1977). These were largely abandoned after season two, with few subsequent episodes using them. However, they were used again in the final episode, i.e. \"December 31, 1979 10:45 a.m.\" From the premiere onward, the episode's year could be determined by the [[license plates of Wisconsin|registration tag]]s on Eric's Vista Cruiser at the end of the opening and closing credits. Season 1 showed a \"76\" year tag, seasons 2-3 showed \"77\" tags, seasons 3-6 showed \"78\" tags, seasons 7-8 showed \"79\" tags, and the final episode of season 8's closing credits showed an \"80\" tag.\n\nThe show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, \"Grandma's Dead\", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach \"one\" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DuRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT96|title=Watching TV Religiously (Engaging Culture): Television and Theology in Dialogue|last=Callaway|first=Kutter|last2=Batali|first2=Dean|date=2016-11-15|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=9781493405855|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe show's unexpected longevity (it was the only series to debut on Fox in 1998 to survive cancellation) combined with the first season jump to 1977 necessitated a slow-down of the series' timeline. Over time, this proved problematic from a narrative standpoint, as nearly every year featured a Thanksgiving and/or Christmas episode, and the teen-aged actors playing high-school student characters all aged into their mid-20s by the time their characters graduated from high school after five seasons (except Mila Kunis, who was not quite 20). As the series timeline sped up and slowed down with more rapidity near the series' climax, the timeline necessitated that several major events depicted as having occurred months apart would have in fact happened within weeks or even days of one another.\n\nThe timeline issues experienced on the show were not unprecedented, as other period-specific TV series have had similar issues. Most notably, ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' aired for 11 seasons despite the [[Korean War]] only lasting three years. Additionally, many TV series over the years that take place in the present time have characters [[Soap opera rapid aging syndrome|age faster than normal while other characters age naturally]].\n\n===Eighth season and series finale===\nThe character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the [[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 7)|seventh season]], as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.<ref name=foxdeparture>{{Cite news|last=Bernhard|first=Lisa|title=Ashton, Topher Departing 'That '70s Show'|publisher=Fox News|date=May 18, 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,156846,00.html|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}</ref> Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.<ref name=foxdeparture/> However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) and later returned for the finale. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was originally supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by [[Bret Harrison]], as an \"innocent character\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series ''[[The Loop (U.S. TV series)|The Loop]]''.<ref>DVD commentary of episode 25 of season 7 by director Trainer.</ref> Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by [[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] (brother of Late Night host [[Seth Meyers]]), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.<ref name=topherreplacement>{{Cite news|last=Tribune Media Service|title=Celebrity Spotlight|newspaper=Observer-Reporter|location=Washington, PA|page=C6|publisher=Observer Publishing Company|date=November 30, 2005|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wZY1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=8igMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2099,36343722&dq=josh+meyers+randy+pearson&hl=en|accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Another new character, Samantha, a [[stripper]] played by [[Jud Tylor]], was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes.

The original version of the song appeared on Big Star's 1972 debut album [[Number 1 Record|''#1 Record'']]. In 2000, Chilton confirmed that he was paid $70 in royalties each time the show aired, an amount he thought ironic, given the show's title.<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite magazine|author=John D.

Instead, a cover version sung by [[Todd Griffin]] was used as the theme song for the show's first season. Beginning in the second season, the theme song was performed by the band [[Cheap Trick]]. Unlike previous versions of the song, Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase \"We're all alright!\" quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song \"[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]]\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-best-television-theme-songs-20110921/7-that-70s-show-in-the-street-0899057|title=Readers Poll: The Best Television Theme Songs \u2013 7.

At the conclusion of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening).\n\nAfter Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, [[Mila Kunis]] \"Hanging Out...;\" [[Danny Masterson]] \"Down the Street\"). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were [[Kurtwood Smith]] and [[Tommy Chong]], with the exception of the first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last \"We're all alright\". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong looks around the room, confused as he hears \"Hello, Wisconsin!\" The [[That '70s Finale|final episode]] omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.\n\n===Elements of the show===\n====The 1970s====\n{{original research section|date=November 2015}}\nThe show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as [[human sexuality|sexual]] attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the [[1970s recession]], mistrust of the [[government of the United States|American government]] by [[blue-collar worker]]s, and [[underage drinking]]/teenage [[recreational drug use|drug use]]. The series also highlighted developments in the entertainment industry, including the television [[remote control|remote]] (\"the clicker\"), [[reruns]], [[VCR]], and [[cable television|cable TV]]; the [[video games]] ''[[Pong]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]''; the [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] and [[Disco]]; [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]]; and Eric's obsession with ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ifc.com/shows/that-70s-show/blog/2015/12/that-70s-show-history|title=13 Times That '70s Show Tackled History|work=IFC|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}</ref> The show has been compared to ''[[Happy Days]]'', which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/arts/television/12hoch.html?_r=0|title=Even Those 70's Kids Should Have Seen It Coming|quote=Like 'Happy Days', 'That 70's Show' blends smart comedy with light social commentary.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2006-02-12|last1=Hochman|first1=David}}</ref>\n\nBeginning with the second season, the show focused less on the sociopolitical aspects of the story. For example, the dynamic of the relationship between Eric and Donna was altered in later seasons to more closely resemble the relationships of other \"[[Supercouple|power couples]]\" on teen dramas. Likewise, the first season of the show featured a recurring, more dramatic storyline in which the Formans were in danger of losing their home due to Red's hours being cut back at the auto parts plant where he worked. Storylines in later seasons were generally presented more comically and less dramatically.\n\nThe show also featured guest-starring actors from 1970s TV shows, such as [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Valerie Harper]] and [[Betty White]] (''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''), [[Tom Poston]] and [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] (''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''), [[Pamela Sue Martin]] (''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]''), [[Tim Reid]] and [[Howard Hesseman]] (''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''), [[Eve Plumb]], [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] and [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]] (''[[The Brady Bunch]]''), [[Tom Bosley]] and [[Marion Ross]] (''[[Happy Days]]''), [[Monty Hall]] (''[[Let's Make A Deal]]''), [[Gavin MacLeod]] (''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''), [[Don Knotts]], [[Richard Kline]] and [[Jenilee Harrison]] (''[[Three's Company]]''), and [[Danny Bonaduce]] and [[Shirley Jones]] (''[[The Partridge Family]]''). Series recurring cast member [[Tanya Roberts]] also starred in a popular show in the 1970s (''[[Charlie's Angels]]'').\n\nBeginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: [[Led Zeppelin]] (season 5), [[The Who]] (Season 6), [[The Rolling Stones]] (season 7), and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (season 8, except for the finale, titled \"That '70s Finale\").<ref>{{cite book|last1=Egan|first1=James|title=3000 Facts about TV Shows|date=2016|publisher=Lulu|page=328}}</ref>\n\n====Split screens====\nOne device in the show is to present a split screen in which two pairs of characters speak. One character is usually seeking advice on a problem with a character in the second pairing and the other character advises them. Although the conversations appear to mirror each other, notable differences often occur. It is most often used by the couples of the show, with each member of the couple being advised on the relationship. For example, in the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 3)#ep62|Who Wants It More?]]\", Donna and Eric tell Jackie and Hyde that they have been holding out on each other sexually for three days and that maybe they should cave. Both Jackie and Hyde tell Donna and Eric not to cave or the \"caver\" will be owned by the other.\n\n====Dream sequences====\nThe show includes character daydream sequences, some of which refer to or parody fads and films of the time, such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Rocky]]'', and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.\n\nThe character picturing the dream sometimes also narrates it, but regardless, the other characters present see the same dream. In the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep183|Stone Cold Crazy]]\", Jackie mentioned she liked the song playing in Fez's dream sequence. The sequences are usually introduced by a wobbling screen transition. Sometimes, the transition is absent when the characters who imagine the scene believe they are real (for example, Eric's dream about Donna in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep2|Eric's Birthday]]\" or Jackie's dream about Hyde proposing in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 7)#ep168|It's All Over Now]]\").\n\nIn the 100th episode, \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep100|That '70s Musical]]\", all singing scenes were Fez's dream sequences.\n\n====The circle====\n[[File:70sFinaleCircle.png|200px|thumb|right|The circle illustrated the teens' marijuana use, usually in [[Eric Forman|Eric's]] basement. The picture is of the final scene of the series.]]\n\nIn the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as he or she speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme [[wide-angle lens]] added to the \"drug-induced\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word \"marijuana\" while in the circle (except in one episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 3)#ep52|Reefer Madness]]\"), often referring to it as \"stuff\" or a \"stash\". In the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep81|Bye-Bye Basement]]\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \"weed\"; in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep82|The Relapse]]\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\" in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep13|Ski Trip]]\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep5|Eric's Burger Job]]\", Kelso blames his \"roach clip\" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (\"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep15|That Wrestling Show]]\" and \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep24|Hyde Moves In]]\"), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \"Cannabis Sativa\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep17|The Pill]]\", Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \"That kid's on dope!\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.\n\nAs the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep96|Class Picture]]\", \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 6)#ep136|I'm A Boy]]\", \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 6)#ep147|Substitute]]\", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle sans smoke replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.\n\n====The stupid helmet====\nThe stupid helmet refers to a replica of a [[Green Bay Packers]] helmet that a character is forced to wear after having done or said something deemed stupid by the rest of the gang. Eric had to wear it when he said he wanted to propose to Donna and Fez wore it when he started banging his head on the table after trying to help Kelso keep Jackie. The helmet can be seen in the Forman basement on a shelf behind the cast. When the series concluded in 2006, the last one up the staircase had to call Red a \"dumbass\", something he always called the kids. Since Kelso was the last one up, he grabbed the helmet.\n\n====The water tower====\nIn many episodes, the teenaged characters often hang out on a local [[water tower]]. At the end of several water tower segments, at least one character falls off (usually Kelso). When Charlie Richardson (played by [[Bret Harrison]]) fell off and died in season 8, the water tower was renamed in his honor.\n\nAfter Charlie's death, Kelso fell off again, but survived, leading him to believe he was \"invincible\". In the \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep21|Water Tower episode]]\", the gang painted a [[marijuana leaf]] on the tower, but it looked more like a green hand giving [[the finger]]. In the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep127|The Immigrant Song (a.k.a. Fez Gets Busted)]]\" Kelso paints Jackie and his name on the tower to annoy Hyde just before falling and ending up in the hospital. During this episode, Fez paints his manhood on the tower but only gets as far as drawing a circle when the police arrive to arrest him. Kelso was known to fall off the water tower once in every grade since middle school. This is also where Eric proposes to Donna (\"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep110|Hot Dog]]\"), and where Jackie and Fez share their first official kiss  in the [[That '70s Finale|show's finale]].\n\n====Scene transitions====\nIn the first season, scene transitions (also known as [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]]) consisted of animated [[smiley]] buttons<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Ken|title=That '70s Show|url=https://www.ew.com/article/1998/09/18/70s-show|website=EW.com}}</ref> or still images of faces from the 1970s with only the mouth moving using [[Syncro-Vox]], usually yelling, in a rock form, \"Yeahhh!\" or something similar (ex. [[Farrah Fawcett]] saying \"Yeah!\" or [[Richard Nixon]] saying \"Are you ready to rock and roll?\") The smiley buttons were removed for re-runs and home video, replaced with flowers likewise exploding, replicating, deflating or bouncing around. Sometimes they would be visuals of [[lava lamps]] with the show's logo plummeting to the bottom of the screen in front of it.\n\nBeginning in season 2, transitions featured the characters doing something in front of a colorful, psychedelic, [[lava lamp]]-like background. These transitions featured the most prominent characters of the scene usually dancing, falling or making facial expressions. The music accompanying these colorful sequences would match the tone of the episode and characters.\n\nBy the show's final season, new transitions were created to accommodate cast changes (e.g. Donna's hair color, Leo continuing as a series regular and the insertion of Randy).\n\n\"Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)\" is the only episode where Laurie Forman is featured in a transition. Tanya Roberts is the only regular actor not to be featured in a transition.\n\n====The Vista Cruiser====\nMany of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \"Aztec Gold\" 1969 [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]], handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.\n\nThat particular [[station wagon]] was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for \"no more than\" [[US$]]500.<ref>{{youtube|id=0IPM_CMRQko|title=That 70s Show wrap party Access Hollywood official}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tate |first=James |url=http://editorial.autos.msn.com/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=1080100&icid=autos_0909004&GT1=22008#9 |title=MSN Autos list of 'Ten Greatest Cars On Television \u2013 Ever!' |publisher=Editorial.autos.msn.com |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717033659/http://editorial.autos.msn.com/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=1080100&icid=autos_0909004&GT1=22008#9 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Running gags and catchphrases====\n{{original research section|date=August 2017}}\nIn one of the show's major [[running gags]], Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of [[catchphrase]], \"kicking your ass\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/that-70s-show-took-tv-adolescence-down-into-the-baseme-1798270795|title=That \u201970s Show took TV adolescence down into the basement (where it belongs)|last=Adams|first=Erik|website=TV Club|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> For example, in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 2)#ep43|Kitty and Eric's Night Out]]\", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, \"I swear I'll kick his ass!\" In \"[[That '70s Show (season 4)#ep90|Eric's Hot Cousin]]\", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, \"And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass\", and, in \"[[That '70s Show (season 4)#ep97|Prank Day]]\", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone \"horribly, horribly wrong\" Red says, \"Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot ''doesn't'' plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!\" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.\n\nSome other notable running gags and catchphrases are:\n* Red's favorite insult is \"dumbass\", the origin of which is revealed in \"[[That '70s Show (season 2)#ep30|Halloween]]\". Ironically, Eric is the first character to say \"dumbass\" in \"[[That '70s Show (season 1)#ep5|Eric's Burger Job]]\". The insult is adopted by the whole gang and even occasionally by Kitty. Red regularly comes up with new choice insults such as \"kettlehead\" (which refers to Kelso).\n* Fez's country of origin is never revealed. Sometimes, Fez is about to disclose where he is from, or at least hint at it, but something happens to prevent him from doing so, like someone entering the room as seen in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 1)#ep14|Stolen Car]]\", or Fez rambling in \"[[Love of My Life (That '70s Show)|Love of My Life]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gazettereview.com/2017/02/happened-wilmer-vader-news-updates/|title=What Happened to Wilmer Valderrama - 2017 Update - The Gazette Review|last=Carter|first=Brooke|date=2017-02-13|work=The Gazette Review|access-date=2017-08-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Fez's real name was also never revealed.

According to Kelso in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 3)#ep64|Dine and Dash]]\", a good burn consists of two elements: \"You didn't see it coming; parts of it really hurt.\"\n* Hyde would usually give Kelso a punch in the arm for either his stupidity or bad behavior.\n* Kelso yells \"Ow, my eye!\" when Hyde rough-houses with him. For example, in the episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep96|Class Picture]]\", a series of flashbacks feature Hyde beating up Kelso. While the two are out of the immediate sight of the audience, Kelso yells, \"Ow, my eye!\" and the scene cuts to the next flashback. This gag is repeated several times throughout the series, although the only time Kelso appears with an injured eye is in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 4)#ep95|Jackie's Cheese Squeeze]]\" after he was punched by Todd, Jackie's manager. On that occasion, Kelso did not yell, \"Ow, my eye!\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/weird-running-jokes-tv-shows-friends/|title=15 Weirdest Running Jokes You Didn't Notice In Favorite TV Shows|date=2016-12-15|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Fez uses the phrase \"Good day\", followed by another cast member saying, \"But Fez...\" and Fez immediately interrupts with an exclamatory, \"I said good day!\" In some instances, the words vary, but the interaction is the same.\n* Eric has a never-ending streak of quoting ''[[Star Wars]]''. In several episodes, he relates things to ''Star Wars'', or quotes the film. In times of trouble, he brings a toy light saber and his going-away present from Donna was her dressing up as [[Princess Leia]].\n* Everyone who calls Eric's action figures \"dolls\" is always loudly corrected by Eric: \"They're action figures!\"\n* Kitty often uses alcohol or her use is mentioned, particularly after she starts menopause during the fifth season.\n* Fez's sex life or usually lack thereof.

He is best known for winning the 2001 F. Scott Fitzgerald Short Story Award and for writing Half a Man, a poetry collection about his [[Gulf War]] experience.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nBorn into a [[US Air Force]] family, Bill Glose spent much of his childhood on military bases in foreign countries\u2014Japan, then [[Okinawa]], then [[England]]. His father, John Glose, was a fighter-bomber pilot who flew an [[F4 Phantom]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1979, John was stationed at [[Langley Air Force Base]] in [[Hampton Roads]] and ever since Bill has called [[Virginia]] his home.<ref>[http://www.billglose.com/bio.htm Bill Glose Bio]</ref> Glose graduated from [[Virginia Tech]] in 1989 with a BS in Civil Engineering.\n\nAfter graduation, Glose was commissioned as an Army officer and [[paratrooper]] assigned to the [[82nd Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Bragg]]. He commanded a rifle platoon in combat during the Gulf War and later commanded a Delta (anti-tank) platoon. He earned Airborne, Ranger, Jumpmaster and Combat Infantryman badges during his military career.\n\nAfter he got out of the Army in 1995, Glose spent three years working in factories in [[Chicago]] and [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]]. In 1998, he walked away from his production career to become a full-time writer.\n\n[[File:Fawn&Bill1-sml.jpg|thumb|left|Bill Glose kissing a fawn on a stop during his Walk Across Virginia]]\n\nIn 2009, Glose began a walk across Virginia that would eventually zigzag through every region in the state, cross each of the six state borders (including [[Washington DC]]), and eventually cover over 1,500 miles.<ref>[http://www.billglose.com/blog/billswalk.htm A Walk Across Virginia]</ref> The start point was the First Landing Monument in [[Virginia Beach]] and the endpoint was the [[Cumberland Gap]] in Tennessee.

During the 1999 college football season he wrote for ''The Pigskin Post'' as their Big East correspondent. That same year, he began reviewing books for [[The Virginian-Pilot]], which led to his position as a contributing editor at ''Virginia Living'' (March 2003-April 2020). In 2005, Glose became a feature writer for ''Super Lawyers'' magazine, interviewing and writing profiles about top national lawyers.<ref>[http://www.superlawyers.com/articles/writer/Bill-Glose/5682f298fdd29aad0ce6c2ad603f442f.html Super Lawyers Articles Written by Bill Glose]</ref> He has also worked as a technical writer for [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] and as a writing coach with Professional English, where he coached [[NASA]] scientists, business managers and students.\n\n[[File:Bglosespeaking.jpg|thumb|Bill Glose speaking at the 2001 F.

One of his highlights during the journal's three-year existence was publishing a short story, \u201cThe Cherry Man,\u201d by [[Khaled Hosseini]] before Hosseini became internationally famous.\n\nFrom 2015-2016, Glose served as the Vice President for the Eastern Region of the Poetry Society of Virginia.

Myers]] (General, USAF, Ret. 15th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff): \u201cBill Glose's poetry brings the last 12 years of war in the Middle East and Central Asia into sharp focus. He elicits all the many emotions that a soldier experiences and allows us a rare glimpse into how the people fighting and those caught up in conflict see war. Everyone will learn from this work.\u201d<ref>[http://www.prlog.org/12221452-futurecycle-press-publishes-veterans-book-of-war-poems.html FutureCycle Press publishes veteran's book of war poems] (press release).</ref>\n\nJackie Mohan: \u201cVirginia is in good hands as Glose's well-honed expertise with language and lyricism takes the reader on a journey across the state. While some poems ruminate on nature more generally, his poems are strongest when he describes the quirks and histories of specific locations, from Tangier Island to the James River to Norfolk, such as how Norfolk got its mermaids. His poems also tell the stories of the people he encountered along his way, from notable figures of times long gone, such as Capt. John Smith, to the lives of Virginians today.\u201d <ref>[http://pilotonline.com/entertainment/books/article_8c4586b6-49c1-11e9-80bf-e7db827ba243.html Poets Alphin, Glose see Virginia through different eyes], ''The Virginian-Pilot'', March 22, 2019.</ref>\n\nLyn C. A. Gardner: \u201cThis accomplished collection by a Hampton Roads poet touches both the horrors and wonders of human life, providing philosophical reflections about life and relationships and taking the time to understand and empathize with both strangers and family. Starting from his own encounters but reaching far beyond them, Bill Glose succeeds admirably at the difficult task of making the poet's specific, personal experience universal.\u201d<ref>[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/VALib/v56_n3/pdf/v56n3.pdf Review of ''The Human Touch''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905102309/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/VALib/v56_n3/pdf/v56n3.pdf |date=September 5, 2015 }}, ''Virginia Libraries Journal'', Vol. 56, No. 3, Page 32.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{official website|http://www.billglose.com}}\n* [http://writersalmanac.org/episodes/20170701/ The Writer's Almanac], The Writer's Almanac, 1 July 2017.\n* [http://chrisricecooper.blogspot.com/2014/05/versatile-literary-writer-bill-glose.html Cutting to the Bones], \u201cChris Rice Cooper\u201d. 27 May 2014.\n* [http://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/books/writers-block-blog/dp-writers-block-new-works-tidewater-poets-20131018,0,7415736.post New works from Tidewater poets], ''The Daily Press''. 21 October 2013\n* [https://amoskeagjournal.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/author-spotlight-bill-glose/ Author Spotlight: Bill Glose], ''Amoskeag: The Literary Journal of [[Southern New Hampshire University]]''. 17 October 2012\n* [http://articles.dailypress.com/2000-08-19/news/0008190189_1_rejection-writers-fall-issue ''New Literary Magazine Showcases Local Talent''], ''The Daily Press'', 19 August 2000\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glose, Bill}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American male journalists]]\n[[Category:American army personnel of the Gulf War]]\n[[Category:20th-century American poets]]\n[[Category:21st-century American poets]]\n[[Category:American fiction writers]]\n[[Category:United States Army officers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=February 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox person\n|name    = Bill Glose\n|image   = Bill-Glose-headshot-by-Linda-Walsh.jpg\n|caption = Glose in 2013 (photo by Linda Walsh)\n}}\n\n'''Bill Glose''' (born Riverside, California) is an American journalist, poet, and fiction writer.

Myers]] (General, USAF, Ret. 15th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff): \u201cBill Glose's poetry brings the last 12 years of war in the Middle East and Central Asia into sharp focus. He elicits all the many emotions that a soldier experiences and allows us a rare glimpse into how the people fighting and those caught up in conflict see war. Everyone will learn from this work.\u201d<ref>[http://www.prlog.org/12221452-futurecycle-press-publishes-veterans-book-of-war-poems.html FutureCycle Press publishes veteran's book of war poems] (press release).</ref>\n\nJackie Mohan: \u201cVirginia is in good hands as Glose's well-honed expertise with language and lyricism takes the reader on a journey across the state. While some poems ruminate on nature more generally, his poems are strongest when he describes the quirks and histories of specific locations, from Tangier Island to the James River to Norfolk, such as how Norfolk got its mermaids. His poems also tell the stories of the people he encountered along his way, from notable figures of times long gone, such as Capt. John Smith, to the lives of Virginians today.\u201d <ref>[http://pilotonline.com/entertainment/books/article_8c4586b6-49c1-11e9-80bf-e7db827ba243.html Poets Alphin, Glose see Virginia through different eyes], ''The Virginian-Pilot'', March 22, 2019.</ref>\n\nLyn C. A. Gardner: \u201cThis accomplished collection by a Hampton Roads poet touches both the horrors and wonders of human life, providing philosophical reflections about life and relationships and taking the time to understand and empathize with both strangers and family. Starting from his own encounters but reaching far beyond them, Bill Glose succeeds admirably at the difficult task of making the poet's specific, personal experience universal.\u201d<ref>[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/VALib/v56_n3/pdf/v56n3.pdf Review of ''The Human Touch''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905102309/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/VALib/v56_n3/pdf/v56n3.pdf |date=September 5, 2015 }}, ''Virginia Libraries Journal'', Vol. 56, No. 3, Page 32.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{official website|http://www.billglose.com}}\n* [http://writersalmanac.org/episodes/20170701/ The Writer's Almanac], The Writer's Almanac, 1 July 2017.\n* [http://chrisricecooper.blogspot.com/2014/05/versatile-literary-writer-bill-glose.html Cutting to the Bones], \u201cChris Rice Cooper\u201d. 27 May 2014.\n* [http://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/books/writers-block-blog/dp-writers-block-new-works-tidewater-poets-20131018,0,7415736.post New works from Tidewater poets], ''The Daily Press''. 21 October 2013\n* [https://amoskeagjournal.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/author-spotlight-bill-glose/ Author Spotlight: Bill Glose], ''Amoskeag: The Literary Journal of [[Southern New Hampshire University]]''. 17 October 2012\n* [http://articles.dailypress.com/2000-08-19/news/0008190189_1_rejection-writers-fall-issue ''New Literary Magazine Showcases Local Talent''], ''The Daily Press'', 19 August 2000\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glose, Bill}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American male journalists]]\n[[Category:American army personnel of the Gulf War]]\n[[Category:20th-century American poets]]\n[[Category:21st-century American poets]]\n[[Category:American fiction writers]]\n[[Category:United States Army officers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers]]\n", "name_user": "TerryJ2", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added chapbook section plus magazines with wiki links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Glose"}

The film, based on [[Zane (author)|Zane]]'s best-selling novel of the same name and [[Film adaptation|adapted]] by Christina Welsh and [[Ernie Barbarash]], was released theatrically on January 30, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n\nZoe Reynard ([[Sharon Leal]]) has the perfect life with her husband Jason ([[Boris Kodjoe]]) and two children, and is the CEO of her own company which signs and develops aspiring artists. One evening she attends an art show of Quinton Canosa ([[William Levy (actor)|William Levy]]); the two meet and share some flirtation. Zoe later visits his apartment to discuss a contract, and the two have sex.\n\nZoe feels immense guilt and tries to end it with Quinton; they break up regularly but always inevitably end up getting back together. On one particular occasion, when Zoe goes to get back with Quinton, she finds him having sex with his neighbour.\n\nThroughout the film, Zoe is telling this story as a flashback to her psychotherapist, Dr. Marcella Spencer ([[Tasha Smith]]), who after diagnosing her with sex addiction, assumes it might have been something from Zoe's past that keeps coming back to haunt her and pressures her to confess. However, each time her psychotherapist asks, Zoe avoids the question and walks out.\n\nZoe's addiction begins to take over her life; she soon begins sleeping with a second man, Corey ([[Tyson Beckford]]), whom she met at a club. One day, when she comes home from work, she finds Corey at her home talking to her mother. Seeing the danger she had put her family in, Zoe decides that she wants to try to fix her marriage with Jason. She invites both Corey and Quinton to meet her at Quinton's apartment and breaks up with both of them.\n\nCorey becomes angry and lunges at her but Quinton blocks him. As Corey leaves, Quinton knocks him out with a vase. Zoe becomes afraid of Quinton and tries to calm him down; Quinton tells her that she is not going to leave him. Frightened, Zoe shoves glass artwork between them, smashing it to pieces. She then hides from Quinton who is chasing her with a knife. Suddenly Jason appears and smashes a sculpture over Quinton's head. \n\nZoe runs after Jason, apologizing profusely, but he rejects her. Out of desperation, Zoe walks in front of car, injuring herself. The two split up and Jason stays in a hotel. Zoe becomes a recluse but soon goes to a sex addiction group-therapy session. It is discovered that the root of Zoe's addiction was because of a rape committed by three boys when she was 10 years old. At the session she speaks of her deep love for her husband, and Jason walks in, kisses her and accepts her back.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Sharon Leal]] as Zoe Reynard, owner of Zoe & Co., an artist-marketing agency\n* [[Boris Kodjoe]] as Jason Reynard, Zoe's husband and an architect\n* [[William Levy (actor)|William Levy]] as Quinton Canosa, an artist who becomes Zoe's lover\n* [[Brandon Gonzales]] as Tony\n* [[Tyson Beckford]] as Corey, one of Zoe's lovers\n* [[Katerina Graham]] as Diamond, Quinton's other lover\n* [[Tasha Smith]] as Dr. Marcella Spencer, a psychotherapist specializing in sexual addiction\n* [[Maria Howell]] as Nina, Zoe's mother\n* [[Garrett Hines]] as Benny\n* [[Emayatzy Corinealdi]] as Brina, Zoe's assistant and best friend\n* Hunter Burke as Shane\n* Cameron Mills as 10 year old Zoe\n* Daniel O'Callaghan as chubby businessman\n* Landon Runion]as  Peter Reynard, Zoe's son\n* Lauren Marquez as Kayla Reynard, Zoe's daughter\n* John Newberg as Balthazar Crayne\n* Paul Hall as Marley\n* Omar Mughal as handsome man\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 2012 in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and the surrounding areas.\n\n==Reception==\n''Addicted'' received largely negative reviews from critics.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans.

Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

It is typically displayed when the danger increases. A study found that yowls could last as long as two seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Agonistic vocalizations: this term denotes a combination of growls, moans, and hisses that is followed by spitting, a feature more conspicuous in cheetah than in other cats. In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Churring: The purpose of this sound is similar to that of the chirp. It may resemble a growl. The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr is [[staccato]] and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3\u201315 separate pulses and last 0.1\u20131.3 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Mother-cub vocalizations: Apart from chirping, mothers use some other sounds to interact with their cubs. A repeated ''ihn ihn'' is used to gather the cubs, while a ''prr prr'' is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/>\n\nSocial meetings are marked by mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, grooming one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.<ref name=Estes/>\n\nTear streaks are a means of visual communication. The tear streaks combined with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscured from a distance, and so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Display behavior====\nCheetahs engage in several [[Display (zoology)|displays]] during fights, hunting, or self-defense. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Churring: The purpose of this sound is similar to that of the chirp. It may resemble a growl. The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr is [[staccato]] and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3\u201315 separate pulses and last 0.1\u20131.3 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Mother-cub vocalizations: Apart from chirping, mothers use some other sounds to interact with their cubs. A repeated ''ihn ihn'' is used to gather the cubs, while a ''prr prr'' is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/>\n\nSocial meetings are marked by mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, grooming one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.<ref name=Estes/>\n\nTear streaks are a means of visual communication. The tear streaks combined with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscured from a distance, and so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Display behavior====\nCheetahs engage in several [[Display (zoology)|displays]] during fights, hunting, or self-defense. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs until weaning was a mere 4.8%.

Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].
