During her husband's lifetime, she assisted him in building the world's largest collection of Shakespeare materials. After his death in 1930, she funded the completion of the Folger Shakespeare Library to house the collection, remaining involved with its administration until her death in 1936. \n\nIn 1932, she became the third woman to receive an honorary degree from [[Amherst College]], following [[Mary Emma Woolley]], president of Mount Holyoke College, in 1901; and Martha Dickinson Bianchi, editor of Emily Dickinson's poems, in 1931.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amherst Degree|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/06/23/102244114.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1931}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nEmily Clara Jordan was born in [[Ironton, Ohio]] to [[Edward Jordan (American lawyer)|Edward W. Jordan]] and his wife, Augusta Woodbury Ricker. She was the third of their three daughters, preceded by Mary Augusta and Elizabeth. Edward Jordan served as Solicitor of the Treasury Department under Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Andrew Johnson]], and her family lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], for that part of her childhood. Emily received her early education at Miss Ranney's School in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], which prepared women for teaching or higher education. There, Emily was instructed in English language and literature, modern languages, mathematics, philosophy, and the natural sciences. \n\nIn 1875, she followed both of her sisters to [[Vassar College]], where she was elected president of the 36-member class of 1879. At Vassar, Emily was accomplished in English composition and astronomy. She was educated in the latter subject by astronomer and Vassar professor [[Maria Mitchell]], who was also a distant relative of her future husband, Henry Clay Folger, via their common ancestor, [[Peter Foulger]].<ref>Grant, Stephen H.

Also see [http://www.folger.edu/history \"Emily Jordan Folger\"] on Folger website.</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\nEmily was introduced to Henry Clay Folger as early as 1880, at a meeting of the Irving Literary Circle of Brooklyn by Lillie Pratt, sister of Charles Pratt, with whom Folger attended [[Amherst College]]. At an 1882 club picnic, the Pratts prompted toasts from both Emily and Henry, who quoted ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'', respectively.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 2.</ref> Folger was a graduate of [[Columbia Law School]], and a young oil-company executive, who later became the president and then the chairman of [[Standard Oil of New York]]. Little else is known about their courtship; on October 6, 1885, Emily married Henry at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Emily had spent her teenage years. After the wedding, the Folgers moved into a Brooklyn home with Folger's parents. For many years, they lived in rented homes in Brooklyn, moving to [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in 1895, and to 24 Brevoort Place in 1910. They ultimately purchased an estate in [[Glen Cove, New York|Glen Cove]], Long Island, in 1929.<ref>Grant 2014, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> \n\nThey often stayed at [[The Homestead (Hot Springs, Virginia)|The Homestead]] resort in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]].<ref>Lynch, Kathleen, \"Folger, Emily Jordan\", ''American National Biography,'' Jon Garty and Mark Carnes (editors).

Washington, D.C.: Folger Shakespeare Library (distributed by University of Washington Press, Seattle), 2001, pp. 12\u201316.</ref> The Folgers had no children, and considered their vast collection of Shakespeareana and Early Modern objects their descendants.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 26.</ref>\n\n==Shakespeare collecting==\n[[File:Emily Jordan Folger in the Founders' Room (1932).jpg|thumb|right|Folger, in the Folger Shakespeare Library's Founders' Room, wearing [[Julia Marlowe]]'s [[Portia (The Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] costume, 1932]]\nDuring their marriage, Henry Folger's interest in the works of Shakespeare led him to gather the world's largest private Shakespeare collection. The couple's pursuit of rare items often began with Emily, who pored over booksellers' catalogs, marking items of interest to herself and to her husband. Later, Henry sorted through the catalogs and her notes to determine a set list of items on which to bid. Once items were purchased, Emily generated a [[catalog card]] for each acquisition, and cross-referenced these cards with the booksellers' catalogs to either avoid duplicate copies or upgrade to a better copy of a particular work.<ref>Mays, Andrea. ''The Millionaire and the Bard''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2015, p. 103.</ref> Their card catalog was stored in one of Standard Oil's Brooklyn warehouses.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 111.</ref>\n\nEmily Folger helped to catalog the acquisitions, traveled with her husband on many transatlantic collecting trips, researched possible acquisitions, and often advised him on purchases. She earned an M.A. from Vassar in 1896 for a thesis on \"The True Text of Shakespeare\", a survey of current scholarship on the subject. She also corresponded with [[Horace Howard Furness]], a leading American Shakespeare editor.<ref>Ziegler, Georgianna, \"Duty and Enjoyment: The Folgers as Shakespeare Collectors in the Gilded Age\", ''Shakespeare in American Life,'' Virginia and Alden Vaughan (eds.). Washington, D.C.: Folger Shakespeare Library, 2007, pp. 102, 105, and Lynch, Kathleen, \"Folger, Emily Jordan\", ''American National Biography,'' Jon Garty and Mark Carnes (editors). New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, vol. 8, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> Among the Shakespearean societies she and Henry joined as a result of their collecting were the [[Malone Society]], the Oxford Bibliographic Society, and the [[Shakespeare Club of Stratford-upon-Avon|Shakespeare Club]] in England, as well as the American Shakespeare Foundation, the Shakespeare Association of America, and the National Shakespeare Federation in the United States.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe Folgers occasionally wrote Shakespearean actresses, like [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Julia Marlowe]], to inquire about the purchase of manuscripts, props, and costumes used by the actresses. Among these acquisitions was the purple robe worn by Marlowe during her performance of [[Portia (The Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] in [[The Merchant of Venice]], which Emily wore when she prepared to bathe at the Homestead.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 32.</ref> Emily also kept a diary from 1906 to 1930 that recorded her responses to live performances of Shakespeare. The diary records Henry's reactions, as well as her own, to a production's actors, scenery, costumes, and direction.<ref> Mays 2015, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref> \n\nAfter her husband's death, Emily continued to add to the Library's collection; these acquisitions included the [[Ashbourne portrait]], which she incorrectly believed to be of William Shakespeare.<ref>Mays 2015, p. 264.</ref>\n\n==Folger Shakespeare Library==\n{{main|Folger Shakespeare Library}}\nBy about 1918, the Folgers began planning for a library to house the collection. The project and its chosen site in Washington became public in 1928, after the land had been assembled. Henry Folger retired from Standard Oil to devote himself to the project, but he died unexpectedly in 1930 during a hospital stay. At the time, construction had just started. Because of the [[Wall Street crash of 1929|1929 stock-market crash]], Henry Folger's estate was greatly reduced and could not cover the full cost of building and opening the library. Emily Folger, who served as executor of her husband's estate, donated millions of dollars of her own funds to finish construction and operate the library. She received an honorary doctorate in 1932 from [[Amherst College]] for her role in making the library possible.<ref>Ferington, Esther (ed.), ''Infinite Variety: Exploring the Folger Shakespeare Library''. Washington, D.C.: Folger Shakespeare Library (distributed by University of Washington Press, Seattle), 2001, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nAt an opening ceremony in April 1932, Emily Folger turned over the key to the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] to its trustees, saying that she did so for her husband and herself.

During her husband's lifetime, she assisted him in building the world's largest collection of Shakespeare materials. After his death in 1930, she funded the completion of the Folger Shakespeare Library to house the collection, remaining involved with its administration until her death in 1936. \n\nIn 1932, she became the third woman to receive an honorary degree from [[Amherst College]], following [[Mary Emma Woolley]], president of Mount Holyoke College, in 1901; and Martha Dickinson Bianchi, editor of Emily Dickinson's poems, in 1931.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amherst Degree|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/06/23/102244114.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1931}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nEmily Clara Jordan was born in [[Ironton, Ohio]] to [[Edward Jordan (American lawyer)|Edward W. Jordan]] and his wife, Augusta Woodbury Ricker. She was the third of their three daughters, preceded by Mary Augusta and Elizabeth. Edward Jordan served as Solicitor of the Treasury Department under Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Andrew Johnson]], and her family lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], for that part of her childhood. Emily received her early education at Miss Ranney's School in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], which prepared women for teaching or higher education. There, Emily was instructed in English language and literature, modern languages, mathematics, philosophy, and the natural sciences. \n\nIn 1875, she followed both of her sisters to [[Vassar College]], where she was elected president of the 36-member class of 1879. At Vassar, Emily was accomplished in English composition and astronomy. She was educated in the latter subject by astronomer and Vassar professor [[Maria Mitchell]], who was also a distant relative of her future husband, Henry Clay Folger, via their common ancestor, [[Peter Foulger]].<ref>Grant, Stephen H.

Also see [http://www.folger.edu/history \"Emily Jordan Folger\"] on Folger website.</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\nEmily was introduced to Henry Clay Folger as early as 1880, at a meeting of the Irving Literary Circle of Brooklyn by Lillie Pratt, sister of Charles Pratt, with whom Folger attended [[Amherst College]]. At an 1882 club picnic, the Pratts prompted toasts from both Emily and Henry, who quoted ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'', respectively.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 2.</ref> Folger was a graduate of [[Columbia Law School]], and a young oil-company executive, who later became the president and then the chairman of [[Standard Oil of New York]]. Little else is known about their courtship; on October 6, 1885, Emily married Henry at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Emily had spent her teenage years. After the wedding, the Folgers moved into a Brooklyn home with Folger's parents. For many years, they lived in rented homes in Brooklyn, moving to [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in 1895, and to 24 Brevoort Place in 1910. They ultimately purchased an estate in [[Glen Cove, New York|Glen Cove]], Long Island, in 1929.<ref>Grant 2014, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> \n\nThey often stayed at [[The Homestead (Hot Springs, Virginia)|The Homestead]] resort in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]].<ref>Lynch, Kathleen, \"Folger, Emily Jordan\", ''American National Biography,'' Jon Garty and Mark Carnes (editors).

The couple's pursuit of rare items often began with Emily, who pored over booksellers' catalogs, marking items of interest to herself and to her husband. Later, Henry sorted through the catalogs and her notes to determine a set list of items on which to bid. Once items were purchased, Emily generated a [[catalog card]] for each acquisition, and cross-referenced these cards with the booksellers' catalogs to either avoid duplicate copies or upgrade to a better copy of a particular work.<ref>Mays, Andrea. ''The Millionaire and the Bard''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2015, p. 103.</ref> Their card catalog was stored in one of Standard Oil's Brooklyn warehouses.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 111.</ref>\n\nEmily Folger helped to catalog the acquisitions, traveled with her husband on many transatlantic collecting trips, researched possible acquisitions, and often advised him on purchases. She earned an M.A. from Vassar in 1896 for a thesis on \"The True Text of Shakespeare\", a survey of current scholarship on the subject. She also corresponded with [[Horace Howard Furness]], a leading American Shakespeare editor.<ref>Ziegler, Georgianna, \"Duty and Enjoyment: The Folgers as Shakespeare Collectors in the Gilded Age\", ''Shakespeare in American Life,'' Virginia and Alden Vaughan (eds.). Washington, D.C.: Folger Shakespeare Library, 2007, pp. 102, 105, and Lynch, Kathleen, \"Folger, Emily Jordan\", ''American National Biography,'' Jon Garty and Mark Carnes (editors). New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, vol. 8, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> Among the Shakespearean societies she and Henry joined as a result of their collecting were the [[Malone Society]], the Oxford Bibliographic Society, and the [[Shakespeare Club of Stratford-upon-Avon|Shakespeare Club]] in England, as well as the American Shakespeare Foundation, the Shakespeare Association of America, and the National Shakespeare Federation in the United States.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe Folgers occasionally wrote Shakespearean actresses, like [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Julia Marlowe]], to inquire about the purchase of manuscripts, props, and costumes used by the actresses. Among these acquisitions was the purple robe worn by Marlowe during her performance of [[Portia (The Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] in [[The Merchant of Venice]], which Emily wore when she prepared to bathe at the Homestead.<ref>Grant 2014, p. 32.</ref> Emily also kept a diary from 1906 to 1930 that recorded her responses to live performances of Shakespeare. The diary records Henry's reactions, as well as her own, to a production's actors, scenery, costumes, and direction.<ref> Mays 2015, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref> \n\nAfter her husband's death, Emily continued to add to the Library's collection; these acquisitions included the [[Ashbourne portrait]], which she incorrectly believed to be of William Shakespeare.<ref>Mays 2015, p. 264.</ref>\n\n==Folger Shakespeare Library==\n{{main|Folger Shakespeare Library}}\nBy about 1918, the Folgers began planning for a library to house the collection. The project and its chosen site in Washington became public in 1928, after the land had been assembled. Henry Folger retired from Standard Oil to devote himself to the project, but he died unexpectedly in 1930 during a hospital stay. At the time, construction had just started. Because of the [[Wall Street crash of 1929|1929 stock-market crash]], Henry Folger's estate was greatly reduced and could not cover the full cost of building and opening the library. Emily Folger, who served as executor of her husband's estate, donated millions of dollars of her own funds to finish construction and operate the library. She received an honorary doctorate in 1932 from [[Amherst College]] for her role in making the library possible.<ref>Ferington, Esther (ed.), ''Infinite Variety: Exploring the Folger Shakespeare Library''. Washington, D.C.: Folger Shakespeare Library (distributed by University of Washington Press, Seattle), 2001, pages 16-17.</ref>\n\nAt an opening ceremony in April 1932, Emily Folger turned over the key to the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] to its trustees, saying that she did so for her husband and herself.

Because of its high [[tensile strength]] and low cost, it is a major component used in [[building]]s, [[infrastructure]], [[tool]]s, [[ship]]s, [[train]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[machine]]s, [[Home appliance|appliances]], and [[weapon]]s.\n\nIron is the [[base metal]] of steel. Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), [[Cubic crystal system|body centred cubic and face-centred cubic]], depending on its temperature.  In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell; in the face-centred cubic, there is one atom at the centre of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices.  It is the interaction of the [[allotropes of iron]] with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and [[cast iron]] their range of unique properties.\n\nIn pure iron, the [[crystal lattice|crystal structure]] has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite [[ductility|ductile]], or soft and easily formed.  In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of [[dislocation]]s.\n\nThe carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight. Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. These qualities include the [[hardness (materials science)|hardness]], [[Quenching|quenching behaviour]], need for [[Annealling (metallurgy)|annealling]], [[Tempering (metallurgy)|tempering behaviour]], [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]], and [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] of the resulting steel. The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility.\n\nSteel was produced in [[bloomery]] furnaces for thousands of years, but it's large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the [[blast furnace]] and production of [[crucible steel]]. This was followed by the [[open-hearth furnace]] and then the [[Bessemer process]] in [[England]] in the mid-19th \ncentury. With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of [[mass production|mass-produced]] steel began. Mild steel replaced [[wrought iron]].\n\nFurther refinements in the process, such as [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product. Today, steel is one of the most common manmade materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted [[standards organisations]].\n\n==Definitions and related materials==\nThe noun ''steel'' originates from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] adjective ''stahlij\u0105'' or ''stakhlijan'' (''made of steel''), which is related to ''stahlaz'' or ''stahlij\u0105'' (''standing firm'').<ref>{{OEtymD|steel}}</ref>\n\nThe carbon content of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain [[iron]]\u2013[[carbon]] [[alloy]]s.{{cn|date=February 2020}} These values vary depending on [[alloying elements]] such as [[manganese]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[tungsten]], and so on. In contrast, [[cast iron]] does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents higher than those of steel make a brittle alloy commonly called [[pig iron]]. While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, [[alloy steel]] is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: [[manganese]], [[nickel]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[boron]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]], [[tungsten]], [[cobalt]], and [[niobium]].<ref name=EM2>{{cite book|author1=Ashby, Michael F.  |author2=Jones, David R.H.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Engineering Materials 2|origyear=1986|edition=with corrections|year=1992|publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford|isbn=0-08-032532-7}}</ref> Additional elements, most frequently considered undesirable, are also important in steel: [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[silicon]], and traces of [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[copper]].\n\nPlain carbon-iron alloys with a higher than 2.1% carbon content are known as [[cast iron]]. With modern [[steelmaking]] techniques such as powder metal forming, it is possible to make very high-carbon (and other alloy material) steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by [[casting]] as it has a lower [[melting point]] than steel and good [[castability]] properties.<ref name=EM2/> Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make [[malleable iron]] or [[ductile iron]] objects. Steel is distinguishable from [[wrought iron]] (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of [[slag]].\n\n==Material properties==\n[[File:Iron carbon phase diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.9|Iron-carbon equilibrium [[phase diagram]], showing the conditions necessary to form different phases]]\n\nIron is commonly found in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] in the form of an [[ore]], usually an iron oxide, such as [[magnetite]] or [[hematite]]. Iron is extracted from [[iron ore]] by removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon which is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This process, known as [[smelting]], was first applied to metals with lower [[melting]] points, such as [[tin]], which melts at about {{convert|250|C|F|abbr=on}}, and [[copper]], which melts at about {{convert|1100|C|F|abbr=on}}, and the combination, bronze, which has a melting point lower than {{convert|1083|C|F|abbr=on}}. In comparison, cast iron melts at about {{convert|1375|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Smelting\">{{cite book|title=Smelting|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|year=2007|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/smelting}}</ref>  Small quantities of iron were smelted in ancient times, in the solid state, by heating the ore in a [[charcoal]] fire and then welding the clumps together with a hammer and in the process squeezing out the impurities.  With care, the carbon content could be controlled by moving it around in the fire. Unlike copper and tin, liquid or solid iron dissolves carbon quite readily.\n\nAll of these temperatures could be reached with ancient methods used since the [[Bronze Age]]. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond {{convert|800|C|F}}, it is important that smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy ([[pig iron]]) that retains too much carbon to be called steel.<ref name=\"Smelting\"/> The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.\n\nOther materials are often added to the iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. [[Nickel]] and [[manganese]] in steel add to its tensile strength and make the [[austenite]] form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, [[chromium]] increases hardness and melting temperature, and [[vanadium]] also increases hardness while making it less prone to [[metal fatigue]].<ref name=materialsengineer>{{cite web|title=Alloying of Steels|publisher=Metallurgical Consultants|date=2006-06-28|url=http://materialsengineer.com/E-Alloying-Steels.htm|accessdate=2007-02-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221070822/http://www.materialsengineer.com/E-Alloying-Steels.htm|archivedate=2007-02-21|df=}}</ref>\n\nTo inhibit corrosion, at least 11% chromium is added to steel so that a hard [[Passivation (chemistry)|oxide]] forms on the metal surface; this is known as [[stainless steel]]. Tungsten slows the formation of [[cementite]], keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing [[martensite]] to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in [[high speed steel]]. On the other hand, sulphur, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]] are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.<ref name=\"materials engineer\"/>\n\nThe [[density]] of steel varies based on the alloying constituents but usually ranges between {{convert|7750|and|8050|kg/m3|lb/ft3|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|7.75|and|8.05|g/cm3|oz/cuin|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|last = Elert|first = Glenn|title = Density of Steel|url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/KarenSutherland.shtml|accessdate = 2009-04-23}}</ref>\n\nEven in a narrow range of concentrations of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel, a number of different metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel. At [[room temperature]], the most stable form of pure iron is the [[body-centered cubic]] (BCC) structure called alpha iron or \u03b1-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005% at {{Convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}} and 0.021 wt% at  {{convert|723|C|F|abbr=on}}. The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]. At 910&nbsp;\u00b0C, pure iron transforms into a [[face-centered cubic]] (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or \u03b3-iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1%<ref>Sources differ on this value so it has been rounded to 2.1%, however, the exact value is rather academic because plain-carbon steel is very rarely made with this level of carbon. See:\n* {{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=363}}\u20142.08%.\n* {{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=75}}\u20142.11%.\n* {{harvnb|Ashby|Jones|1992}}\u20142.14%.</ref> (38 times that of ferrite) carbon at {{convert|1148|C|F|abbr=on}}, which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=363}}.</ref> When carbon moves out of solution with iron, it forms a very hard, but brittle material called cementite (Fe<sub>3</sub>C).\n\nWhen steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a eutectoid steel), are cooled, the [[austenitic]] phase (FCC) of the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to [[precipitate]] out of solution as [[cementite]], leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with a small percentage of carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called [[pearlite]], named for its resemblance to [[mother of pearl]]. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite [[grain boundaries]] until the percentage of carbon in the [[Grain (metal)|grains]] has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=365\u2013372}}.</ref> The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.\n\nAs the rate of cooling is increased the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face-centred austenite and forms [[martensite]]. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a [[body-centred tetragonal]] (BCT) structure. There is no thermal [[activation energy]] for the transformation from austenite to martensite.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbours.<ref name=\"smith&hashemi\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=373\u2013378}}.</ref>\n\nMartensite has a lower density (it expands during the cooling) than does austenite so that the transformation between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally take the form of [[physical compression|compression]] on the crystals of martensite and [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of [[shear stress|shear]] on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal [[work hardening]] and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quench hardening of steel|url=http://steel.keytometals.com/default.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&NM=12|accessdate=2009-07-19|work=keytometals.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217103241/http://steel.keytometals.com/default.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&NM=12|archivedate=2009-02-17|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Heat treatment===\n{{Main article|Heat treating}}\n\nThere are many types of [[heat treatment|heat treating]] processes available to steel. The most common are [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[quenching]], and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]. Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the eutectoid composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment.\n\nAnnealing is the process of heating the steel to a sufficiently high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]], [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]], and [[grain growth]]. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=249}}.</ref>\n\nQuenching involves heating the steel to create the austenite phase then quenching it in water or [[oil]]. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure.<ref name=\"smith&hashemi\"/> The steel is then tempered, which is just a specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensites into cementite, or [[spheroidite]] and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=388}}.</ref>\n\n==Steel production==\n{{Main article|Steelmaking}}\n{{See also|List of countries by steel production}}\n\n[[File: LightningVolt Iron Ore Pellets.jpg|thumb|[[Iron ore]] pellets for the production of steel]]\nWhen iron is smelted from its ore, it contains more carbon than is desirable.  To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added.  In the past, steel facilities would [[casting (metalworking)|cast]] the raw steel product into [[ingot|ingots]] which would be stored until use in further refinement processes that resulted in the finished product. In modern facilities, the initial product is close to the final composition and is [[continuous casting|continuously cast]] into long slabs, cut and shaped into bars and extrusions and heat-treated to produce a final product. Today, approximately 96% of steel is continuously cast, while only 4% is produced as ingots.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=361}}</ref>\n\nThe ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and [[hot rolling|hot rolled]] into slabs, [[Billet (semi-finished product)#Billet|billets]], or [[Billet (semi-finished product)#Bloom|blooms]]. Slabs are hot or [[cold rolling|cold rolled]] into [[sheet metal]] or plates. Billets are hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire.  Blooms are hot or cold rolled into [[structural steel]], such as [[I-beam]]s and [[rail tracks|rails]].

Because of its high [[tensile strength]] and low cost, it is a major component used in [[building]]s, [[infrastructure]], [[tool]]s, [[ship]]s, [[train]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[machine]]s, [[Home appliance|appliances]], and [[weapon]]s.\n\nIron is the [[base metal]] of steel. Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), [[Cubic crystal system|body centred cubic and face-centred cubic]], depending on its temperature.  In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell; in the face-centred cubic, there is one atom at the centre of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices.  It is the interaction of the [[allotropes of iron]] with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and [[cast iron]] their range of unique properties.\n\nIn pure iron, the [[crystal lattice|crystal structure]] has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite [[ductility|ductile]], or soft and easily formed.  In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of [[dislocation]]s.\n\nThe carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight. Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. These qualities include the [[hardness (materials science)|hardness]], [[Quenching|quenching behaviour]], need for [[Annealling (metallurgy)|annealling]], [[Tempering (metallurgy)|tempering behaviour]], [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]], and [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] of the resulting steel. The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron's ductility.\n\nSteel was produced in [[bloomery]] furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the [[blast furnace]] and production of [[crucible steel]]. This was followed by the [[open-hearth furnace]] and then the [[Bessemer process]] in [[England]] in the mid-19th \ncentury. With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of [[mass production|mass-produced]] steel began. Mild steel replaced [[wrought iron]].\n\nFurther refinements in the process, such as [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product. Today, steel is one of the most common manmade materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted [[standards organisations]].\n\n==Definitions and related materials==\nThe noun ''steel'' originates from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] adjective ''stahlij\u0105'' or ''stakhlijan'' (''made of steel''), which is related to ''stahlaz'' or ''stahlij\u0105'' (''standing firm'').<ref>{{OEtymD|steel}}</ref>\n\nThe carbon content of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain [[iron]]\u2013[[carbon]] [[alloy]]s.{{cn|date=February 2020}} These values vary depending on [[alloying elements]] such as [[manganese]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[tungsten]], and so on. In contrast, [[cast iron]] does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents higher than those of steel make a brittle alloy commonly called [[pig iron]]. While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, [[alloy steel]] is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: [[manganese]], [[nickel]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[boron]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]], [[tungsten]], [[cobalt]], and [[niobium]].<ref name=EM2>{{cite book|author1=Ashby, Michael F.  |author2=Jones, David R.H.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Engineering Materials 2|origyear=1986|edition=with corrections|year=1992|publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford|isbn=0-08-032532-7}}</ref> Additional elements, most frequently considered undesirable, are also important in steel: [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[silicon]], and traces of [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[copper]].\n\nPlain carbon-iron alloys with a higher than 2.1% carbon content are known as [[cast iron]]. With modern [[steelmaking]] techniques such as powder metal forming, it is possible to make very high-carbon (and other alloy material) steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by [[casting]] as it has a lower [[melting point]] than steel and good [[castability]] properties.<ref name=EM2/> Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make [[malleable iron]] or [[ductile iron]] objects. Steel is distinguishable from [[wrought iron]] (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of [[slag]].\n\n==Material properties==\n[[File:Iron carbon phase diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.9|Iron-carbon equilibrium [[phase diagram]], showing the conditions necessary to form different phases]]\n\nIron is commonly found in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] in the form of an [[ore]], usually an iron oxide, such as [[magnetite]] or [[hematite]]. Iron is extracted from [[iron ore]] by removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon which is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This process, known as [[smelting]], was first applied to metals with lower [[melting]] points, such as [[tin]], which melts at about {{convert|250|C|F|abbr=on}}, and [[copper]], which melts at about {{convert|1100|C|F|abbr=on}}, and the combination, bronze, which has a melting point lower than {{convert|1083|C|F|abbr=on}}. In comparison, cast iron melts at about {{convert|1375|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Smelting\">{{cite book|title=Smelting|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|year=2007|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/smelting}}</ref>  Small quantities of iron were smelted in ancient times, in the solid state, by heating the ore in a [[charcoal]] fire and then welding the clumps together with a hammer and in the process squeezing out the impurities.  With care, the carbon content could be controlled by moving it around in the fire. Unlike copper and tin, liquid or solid iron dissolves carbon quite readily.\n\nAll of these temperatures could be reached with ancient methods used since the [[Bronze Age]]. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond {{convert|800|C|F}}, it is important that smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy ([[pig iron]]) that retains too much carbon to be called steel.<ref name=\"Smelting\"/> The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.\n\nOther materials are often added to the iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. [[Nickel]] and [[manganese]] in steel add to its tensile strength and make the [[austenite]] form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, [[chromium]] increases hardness and melting temperature, and [[vanadium]] also increases hardness while making it less prone to [[metal fatigue]].<ref name=materialsengineer>{{cite web|title=Alloying of Steels|publisher=Metallurgical Consultants|date=2006-06-28|url=http://materialsengineer.com/E-Alloying-Steels.htm|accessdate=2007-02-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221070822/http://www.materialsengineer.com/E-Alloying-Steels.htm|archivedate=2007-02-21|df=}}</ref>\n\nTo inhibit corrosion, at least 11% chromium is added to steel so that a hard [[Passivation (chemistry)|oxide]] forms on the metal surface; this is known as [[stainless steel]]. Tungsten slows the formation of [[cementite]], keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing [[martensite]] to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in [[high speed steel]]. On the other hand, sulfur, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]] are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.<ref name=\"materialsengineer\"/>\n\nThe [[density]] of steel varies based on the alloying constituents but usually ranges between {{convert|7750|and|8050|kg/m3|lb/ft3|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|7.75|and|8.05|g/cm3|oz/cuin|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|last = Elert|first = Glenn|title = Density of Steel|url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/KarenSutherland.shtml|accessdate = 2009-04-23}}</ref>\n\nEven in a narrow range of concentrations of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel, a number of different metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel. At [[room temperature]], the most stable form of pure iron is the [[body-centered cubic]] (BCC) structure called alpha iron or \u03b1-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005% at {{Convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}} and 0.021 wt% at  {{convert|723|C|F|abbr=on}}. The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]. At 910&nbsp;\u00b0C, pure iron transforms into a [[face-centered cubic]] (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or \u03b3-iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1%<ref>Sources differ on this value so it has been rounded to 2.1%, however the exact value is rather academic because plain-carbon steel is very rarely made with this level of carbon. See:\n* {{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=363}}\u20142.08%.\n* {{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=75}}\u20142.11%.\n* {{harvnb|Ashby|Jones|1992}}\u20142.14%.</ref> (38 times that of ferrite) carbon at {{convert|1148|C|F|abbr=on}}, which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=363}}.</ref> When carbon moves out of solution with iron, it forms a very hard, but brittle material called cementite (Fe<sub>3</sub>C).\n\nWhen steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a eutectoid steel), are cooled, the [[austenitic]] phase (FCC) of the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to [[precipitate]] out of solution as [[cementite]], leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with a small percentage of carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called [[pearlite]], named for its resemblance to [[mother of pearl]]. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite [[grain boundaries]] until the percentage of carbon in the [[Grain (metal)|grains]] has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=365\u2013372}}.</ref> The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.\n\nAs the rate of cooling is increased the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face-centered austenite and forms [[martensite]]. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a [[body-centered tetragonal]] (BCT) structure. There is no thermal [[activation energy]] for the transformation from austenite to martensite.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.<ref name=\"smith&hashemi\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=373\u2013378}}.</ref>\n\nMartensite has a lower density (it expands during the cooling) than does austenite, so that the transformation between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally take the form of [[physical compression|compression]] on the crystals of martensite and [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of [[shear stress|shear]] on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal [[work hardening]] and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quench hardening of steel|url=http://steel.keytometals.com/default.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&NM=12|accessdate=2009-07-19|work=keytometals.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217103241/http://steel.keytometals.com/default.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&NM=12|archivedate=2009-02-17|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Heat treatment===\n{{Main article|Heat treating}}\n\nThere are many types of [[heat treatment|heat treating]] processes available to steel. The most common are [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[quenching]], and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]. Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the eutectoid composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment.\n\nAnnealing is the process of heating the steel to a sufficiently high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]], [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]], and [[grain growth]]. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=249}}.</ref>\n\nQuenching involves heating the steel to create the austenite phase then quenching it in water or [[oil]]. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure.<ref name=\"smith&hashemi\"/> The steel is then tempered, which is just a specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or [[spheroidite]] and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=388}}.</ref>\n\n==Steel production==\n{{Main article|Steelmaking}}\n{{See also|List of countries by steel production}}\n\n[[File: LightningVolt Iron Ore Pellets.jpg|thumb|[[Iron ore]] pellets for the production of steel]]\nWhen iron is smelted from its ore, it contains more carbon than is desirable.  To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added.  In the past, steel facilities would [[casting (metalworking)|cast]] the raw steel product into [[ingot|ingots]] which would be stored until use in further refinement processes that resulted in the finished product. In modern facilities, the initial product is close to the final composition and is [[continuous casting|continuously cast]] into long slabs, cut and shaped into bars and extrusions and heat-treated to produce a final product. Today, approximately 96% of steel is continuously cast, while only 4% is produced as ingots.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=361}}</ref>\n\nThe ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and [[hot rolling|hot rolled]] into slabs, [[Billet (semi-finished product)#Billet|billets]], or [[Billet (semi-finished product)#Bloom|blooms]]. Slabs are hot or [[cold rolling|cold rolled]] into [[sheet metal]] or plates. Billets are hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire.  Blooms are hot or cold rolled into [[structural steel]], such as [[I-beam]]s and [[rail tracks|rails]].  In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one [[assembly line]], with ore coming in and finished steel products coming out.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=361\u2013362}}.</ref> Sometimes after a steel's final rolling, it is heat treated for strength; however, this is relatively rare.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Bugayev|first = K.|last2 = Konovalov|first2 = Y.|last3 = Bychkov|first3 = Y.|last4 = Tretyakov|first4 = E.|last5 = Savin|first5 = Ivan V.|title = Iron and Steel Production|publisher = The Minerva Group, Inc.|year = 2001|url = https://books.google.com/?id=MJdIVtmwuUsC|isbn = 978-0-89499-109-7|page=225}}</ref>\n\n==History of steelmaking==\n{{Main article|History of ferrous metallurgy|History of the steel industry (1850\u20131970)}}\n\n[[File:Bas fourneau.png|thumb|upright|[[Bloomery]] smelting during the [[Middle Ages]]]]\n\n===Ancient steel===\nSteel was known in antiquity and was produced in [[Bloomery|bloomeries]] and crucibles.<ref name=\"Hilda Ellis Davidson pp.20\">Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998).
