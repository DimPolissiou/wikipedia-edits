The land boundary follows a [[water divide|watershed]] and is crossed by two roads (the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9]] and the [[A836 road|A836]]) and by one railway (the [[Far North Line]]). Across the [[Pentland Firth]], ferries link Caithness with [[Orkney]], and Caithness also has an airport at [[Wick, Highland|Wick]]. The Pentland Firth island of [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]] is within Caithness.\n\nThe name was also used for the [[earl of Caithness|earldom of Caithness]] ({{circa}} 1334 onwards) and for the [[Caithness (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness constituency]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1708 to 1918). Boundaries are not identical in all contexts, but the Caithness area {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}} lies entirely within the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[council areas of Scotland|council area]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe ''Caith'' element of ''Caithness'' comes from the name of a [[Picts|Pictish]] tribe known as the ''Cat'' or ''Catt'' people, or ''Catti'' (see [[Kingdom of Cat]]). The {{lang|non|-ness}} element comes from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and means \"headland\". The Norse called the area {{lang|non|Katanes}} (\"headland of the Catt people\"), and over time this became ''Caithness''.<ref name=snh>[http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf Gaelic and Norse in the Landscape: Placenames in Caithness and Sutherland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921192834/http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf |date=21 September 2011 }}. Scottish National Heritage. pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name for Caithness, {{lang|gd|Gallaibh}}, means \"among the strangers\" (the Norse). The Catti are represented in the Gaelic name for eastern [[Sutherland]], {{lang|gd|Cataibh}},<ref name=snh/> and the old Gaelic name for [[Shetland]], {{lang|gd|Innse Chat}}.\n\n==Geography==\n\nCaithness extends about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north-south and about 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east-west, with a roughly triangular-shaped area of about {{cvt|712|sqmi|km2}}. The topography is generally flat, in contrast to the majority of the remainder of the North of Scotland. Until the latter part of the 20th century when large areas were planted in conifers, this level profile was rendered still more striking by the almost total absence of forest.\n[[File:caithness.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Caithness landscape, looking towards [[Halkirk]] from Beinn Freiceadain]]\n\nIt is a land of open, rolling farmland, [[moorland]] and scattered settlements. The county is fringed to the north and east by dramatic coastal scenery and is home to large, internationally important colonies of seabirds. The surrounding waters of the [[Pentland Firth]] and the [[North Sea]] hold a great diversity of marine life. Notable features of the north coast are [[Sandside Bay]], [[Thurso Bay]] and [[Dunnet Bay]], [[Dunnet Head]] (the northern-most point of Britain) and [[Duncansby Head]] (the north-east tip of Britain); along the east coast can be found Freswick Bay, [[Sinclairs Bay]] and [[Wick Bay]]. To the north in Pentland Firth lies [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]], the only major island of the county. Away from the coast, the landscape is dominated by open moorland and blanket [[bog]] known as the [[Flow Country]] which is the largest expanse of blanket bog in [[Europe]], extending into Sutherland. This is divided up along the ''straths'' ([[river]] [[valley]]s) by more fertile farm and [[croft (land)|croft]] land. In the far south the landscape is slightly hillier, culminating in [[Morven, Caithness|Morvern]], the highest peak in the county at 706 m (2,316&nbsp;ft).\n\nThe county contain a number of lochs, though these are smaller in comparison with the rest of northern Scotland. The most prominent are Loch Heilen, Loch of Wester, Loch Scarmclate, [[Loch Watten]], Loch of Toftingall, Loch Stemster, Loch Hempriggs, Loch of Yarrows, Loch Sand, Loch Rangag, Loch Ruard, Loch an Thulachan, Loch More, Loch Caluim, Loch Tuim Ghlais, Loch Scye, [[Loch Shurrery]], [[Loch Calder]] and Loch Mey.\n\nThe underlying geology of most of Caithness is [[old red sandstone]] to an estimated depth of over 4,000 metres. This consists of the cemented sediments of [[Orcadian Basin|Lake Orcadie]], which is believed to have stretched from [[Shetland]] to [[Grampian]] during the [[Devonian]] period, about 370 million years ago. Fossilised fish and plant remains are found between the layers of sediment. Older metamorphic ([[granite]]) rock is apparent in the [[Scaraben]] and [[Ord, Highland|Ord]] area, in the relatively high southwest area of the county. Caithness' highest point ([[Morven, Caithness|Morven]]) is in this area.\n\nBecause of the ease with which the sandstone splits to form large flat slabs ([[flagstone]]) it is an especially useful building material, and has been used as such since [[Neolithic]] times.\n\n==Natural heritage==\n[[File:St John's Loch near Dunnet Head - geograph.org.uk - 326534.jpg|thumb|left|St John's Loch near [[Dunnet Head]] has the distinction of supporting the most northerly hatch of [[Mayfly]] in the British Isle.]]\nCaithness is one of the [[Watsonian vice-counties]], subdivisions of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] which are used largely for the purposes of biological recording and other scientific data-gathering. The vice-counties were introduced by [[Hewett Cottrell Watson]], who first used them in the third volume of his ''{{lang|la|Cybele Britannica}}'', published in 1852. He refined the system somewhat in later volumes, but the vice-counties remain unaffected by subsequent local government re-organisations, allowing more accurate comparisons of historical and modern data. They provide a stable basis for recording using similarly-sized units, and, although grid-based reporting has grown in popularity, they remain a standard in the vast majority of ecological surveys, allowing data collected over long periods of time to be compared easily.\n\nThe underlying geology, harsh climate, and long history of human occupation have shaped the natural heritage of Caithness. Today a diverse landscape incorporates both common and rare habitats and species, and Caithness provides a stronghold for many once common breeding species that have undergone serious declines elsewhere, such as [[wader]]s, [[European water vole|water vole]]s, and flocks of [[bird migration|over-wintering]] birds.\n\nMany rare mammals, birds, and fish have been sighted or caught in and around Caithness waters. [[Harbour porpoise]]s, dolphins (including [[Risso's dolphin|Risso's]], [[bottle-nosed dolphin|bottle-nosed]], [[common dolphin|common]], [[Atlantic white-sided dolphin|Atlantic white-sided]], and [[white-beaked dolphin]]s), and [[minke whale|minke]] and [[long-finned pilot whale]]s<ref>ALISTAIRMUNRO. 2017.

[[Norway]] has recognised Caithness as fully Scottish since the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266.\n\nThe study of Caithness prehistory is well represented in the county by groups including Yarrows Heritage Trust,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk/|title=Yarrows Heritage Trust - Home|author=|date=|website=www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> Caithness Horizons<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/caithness-horizons-museum-p256591|title=Caithness Horizons Museum|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Caithness Broch Project]].\n\n==Local government==\n===Early civic history===\nCaithness originally formed part of the shire or [[sheriffdom]] of [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]], but gradually gained independence: in 1455 the [[Earl of Caithness]] gained a grant of the justiciary and sheriffdom of the area from the Sheriff of Inverness. In 1503 an [[act of parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] confirmed the separate jurisdiction, with [[Dornoch]] and [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] named as [[burgh]]s in which the sheriff of Caithness was to hold courts. The area of the sheriffdom was declared to be identical to that of the [[Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness|Diocese of Caithness]]. The Sheriff of Inverness still retained power over important legal cases, however, until 1641. In that year, parliament declared Wick the head burgh of the shire of Caithness and the Earl of Caithness became the heritable sheriff.<ref>{{cite book |title=Caithness & Sutherland |url=https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft |last=Campbell |first=H F |series=Cambridge County Geographies |year=1920 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |pages=[https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft/page/1 1]\u20132 }}</ref> Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] of 1707, the term \"[[Counties of Scotland|county]]\" began to be applied to the shire, a process that was completed with the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1747.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whetstone |first1=Ann E. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=The Reform of the Scottish Sheriffdoms in the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |publisher=The North American Conference on British Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201371 |doi= |jstor=4048219}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Scottish Society 1707\u20131820 |last=Whatley |first=Christopher A |year=2000 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-7190-4540-0 |page=147 }}</ref> The county began to be known as Caithness-shire.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe population by 1841 had reached 36,343.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.IV'', (1848), London, Charles Knight, p.16</ref>\n\nThe county began to be used as a unit of local administration, and in 1890 was given an elected [[county council]] under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]]. Although officially within the county, the [[burghs]] of Wick and [[Thurso]] retained their status as autonomous local government areas; they were already well established as autonomous burghs with their own burgh councils. Ten [[parish]] councils covering rural areas were established in 1894.\n\nWick, a [[royal burgh]], served as the county's administrative centre.\n\nIn 1930, the parish councils were abolished under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929]].\n\n===1975\u201396===\nIn 1975, the Local Government council and the burgh councils were superseded under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] when Caithness became one of eight districts, each with its own \"district council\", within the new two-tier Highland [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. When created, the district included the whole of the county plus [[Tongue, Highland|Tongue]] and [[Strathnaver|Farr]] areas of the neighbouring [[Sutherland|county of Sutherland]]. The boundary was soon changed, however, to correspond with that between the counties. Caithness was one of eight districts in the Highland region.\n\nHighland region was also created in 1975, as one of nine two-tier local government regions of Scotland. Each region consisted of a number of districts and both regions and districts had their own elected [[Local government|councils]]. The creation of the Highland region and of Caithness as a district involved the abolition of the two [[burgh]] councils in Caithness, [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] and [[Thurso]], as well as the Caithness [[county council]].\n\nWick, which had been the administrative centre for the county, became the administrative centre for the district.\n\nIn 1996 local government in Scotland was again reformed, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], to create [[Council areas of Scotland|32 unitary council areas]]. The Highland region became the Highland unitary council area, and the functions of the district councils were absorbed by the [[Highland Council]].\n\n===1996 to 2007===\n[[Image:ScotlandHighlands.png|thumb|[[Highland council area]] 1996 to present]]\nIn 1996, Caithness and the other seven districts of the Highland region were merged into the unitary Highland [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]], under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]]. The new Highland Council then adopted the former districts as management areas and created a system of [[area committee]]s to represent the management areas.\n\nUntil 1999 the Caithness management and committee areas consisted of 8 out of the 72 Highland Council [[ward (politics)|ward]]s. Each ward elected one councillor by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\nIn 1999, however, ward boundaries were redrawn but management area boundaries were not. As a result, area committees were named after and made decisions for areas which they did not exactly represent. The new Caithness committee area, consisting of ten out of the 80 new Highland Council wards, did not include the village of [[Reay]], although that village was within the Caithness management area. For area committee representation the village was within the [[Sutherland]] committee area.\n\nNew wards were created for elections this year, 2007, polling on 3 May and, as the wards became effective for representational purposes, the Highland Council's management and committee structures were reorganised. The Caithness management area and the Caithness area committee were therefore abolished.\n\n=== 2007 to date===\nIn 2007 the [[Highland Council]], which is now the local government authority, created the [[Highland Council|Caithness ward management area]], which has boundaries similar to those of the historic county. It was divided between three new wards electing councillors by the [[single transferable vote]] system of election, which is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]]. One ward elects four councillors. Each of the other two elects three councillors. Also, the council's eight management areas were abolished, in favour of three new corporate management areas, with Caithness becoming a ward management area within the council's new [[Highland Council|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross operational management area]], which covers seven of the council's 22 new wards. The boundaries of the Caithness ward management area are not exactly those of the former Caithness management area, but they do include the village of Reay.\n\nThe ward management area is one of five within the corporate management area and until 2017 consisted of three wards, the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Landward Caithness ward]], the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Thurso ward]] and the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Wick ward]]. Each of the other ward management areas within the corporate management area consists of a single ward. In 2017 the three Caithness wards were reduced to two 'Town and County' wards, each returning four members to the Highland Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/info/695/council_information_performance_and_statistics/504/council_wards|title=Council wards|first=Heather|last=Butlin|website=www.highland.gov.uk}}</ref> this was a reduction of two Councillors from the last election in 2012.

For civil administration purposes, implementation of the act redefined parish boundaries, transferring part of Reay to the Sutherland parish of [[Farr, Sutherland|Farr]] and the fragment of Thurso to the parish of Halkirk.<ref>Boundary changes as described in ''Boundaries of Counties and Parishes in Scotland'', Hay Shennan, 1892</ref>\n\nIn the cases of two of the parishes, Thurso and Wick, each includes a burgh with the same name as the parish. For civil administration purposes each of these parishes was divided between the burgh and the landward (rural) area of the parish.\n\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.\n{| class=\"toptextcells\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are however the most local tier of statutory representation.\n\nUnder the 1973 Act, district councils were obliged to implement community council schemes. A Caithness district scheme was adopted in 1975, dividing the area of the district between 12 community councils.\n\nStatutory status for community councils was continued under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], and a Caithness scheme is now the responsibility of the [[Highland Council]].\n\nThe area of the former district of Caithness is now covered by 12 community council areas which are numbered and described as below in the Highland Council's ''Scheme for the Establishment of Community Councils in Caithness'', October 1997.

At the same time however, the county town of [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] was represented as a component of [[Tain Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Tain Burghs]] until 1832 and of [[Wick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Wick Burghs]] until 1918.\n\nBetween 1708 and 1832 the Caithness constituency was paired with [[Buteshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buteshire]] as ''alternating constituencies'': one constituency elected a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to one parliament and then the other elected an MP to the next. Between 1832 and 1918 Caithness elected an MP to every parliament.\n\nIn 1918 the Caithness constituency and Wick were merged into the then new constituency of [[Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness and Sutherland]]. In 1997 Caithness and Sutherland was merged into [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]].\n\nThe [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Scottish Parliament constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]] was created in 1999 and now has boundaries slightly different from those of the House of Commons constituency. It was replaced by the larger constituency of [[Caithness, Sutherland and Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Ross]] in 2011.\n\nThe modern constituencies may be seen as more sub-divisions of the Highland area than as representative of counties (and burghs). For its own purposes, however, the Highland Council uses more conservative sub-divisions, with names which refer back to the era of district councils and, in some cases, county councils.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Parliament]] Caithness is represented also as part of the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament region)|Highlands and Islands]] [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral region]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\n[[File:John o' Groats.JPG|thumb|right|John o' Groats]]\n[[File:Thurso from the hill at Mountpleasant - geograph.org.uk - 8869.jpg|thumb|right|Thurso]]\n[[File:Bridge of Wick - geograph.org.uk - 252159.jpg|thumb|right|Wick]]\nIn 2011, Caithness had a resident population of 26,486 (23,866 in 2001).

The land boundary follows a [[water divide|watershed]] and is crossed by two roads (the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9]] and the [[A836 road|A836]]) and by one railway (the [[Far North Line]]). Across the [[Pentland Firth]], ferries link Caithness with [[Orkney]], and Caithness also has an airport at [[Wick, Highland |Wick]]. The Pentland Firth island of [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]] is within Caithness.\n\nThe name was also used for the [[earl of Caithness |earldom of Caithness]] ({{circa}} 1334 onwards) and for the [[Caithness (UK Parliament constituency)| Caithness constituency]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1708 to 1918). Boundaries are not identical in all contexts, but the Caithness area {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}} lies entirely within the [[Highland (council area)| Highland]] [[council areas of Scotland |council area]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe ''Caith'' element of ''Caithness'' comes from the name of a [[Picts|Pictish]] tribe known as the ''Cat'' or ''Catt'' people, or ''Catti'' (see [[Kingdom of Cat]]). The {{lang|non|-ness}} element comes from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and means \"headland\". The Norse called the area {{lang|non|Katanes}} (\"headland of the Catt people\"), and over time this became ''Caithness''.<ref name=snh>[http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf Gaelic and Norse in the Landscape: Placenames in Caithness and Sutherland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921192834/http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/gaelic/gaelicnorseinthelandscape.pdf |date=21 September 2011 }}. Scottish National Heritage. pp.7\u20138</ref>\n\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name for Caithness, {{lang|gd|Gallaibh}}, means \"among the strangers\" (the Norse). The Catti are represented in the Gaelic name for eastern [[Sutherland]], {{lang|gd|Cataibh}},<ref name=snh/> and the old Gaelic name for [[Shetland]], {{lang|gd|Innse Chat}}.\n\n==Geography==\n\nCaithness extends about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north-south and about 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east-west, with a roughly triangular-shaped area of about {{cvt|712|sqmi|km2}}. The topography is generally flat, in contrast to the majority of the remainder of the North of Scotland. Until the latter part of the 20th century when large areas were planted in conifers, this level profile was rendered still more striking by the almost total absence of forest.\n[[File:caithness.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Caithness landscape, looking towards [[Halkirk]] from Beinn Freiceadain]]\n\nIt is a land of open, rolling farmland, [[moorland]] and scattered settlements. The county is fringed to the north and east by dramatic coastal scenery and is home to large, internationally important colonies of seabirds. The surrounding waters of the [[Pentland Firth]] and the [[North Sea]] hold a great diversity of marine life. Notable features of the north coast are [[Sandside Bay]], [[Thurso Bay]] and [[Dunnet Bay]], [[Dunnet Head]] (the northern-most point of Britain) and [[Duncansby Head]] (the north-east tip of Britain); along the east coast can be found Freswick Bay, [[Sinclairs Bay]] and [[Wick Bay]]. To the north in Pentland Firth lies [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]], the only major island of the county. Away from the coast, the landscape is dominated by open moorland and blanket [[bog]] known as the [[Flow Country]] which is the largest expanse of blanket bog in [[Europe]], extending into Sutherland. This is divided up along the ''straths'' ([[river]] [[valley]]s) by more fertile farm and [[croft (land)|croft]] land. In the far south the landscape is slightly hillier, culminating in [[Morven, Caithness|Morvern]], the highest peak in the county at 706 m (2,316 ft).\n\nThe county contain a number of lochs, though these are smaller in comparison with the rest of northern Scotland. The most prominent are Loch Heilen, Loch of Wester, Loch Scarmclate, [[Loch Watten]], Loch of Toftingall, Loch Stemster, Loch Hempriggs, Loch of Yarrows, Loch Sand, Loch Rangag, Loch Ruard, Loch an Thulachan, Loch More, Loch Caluim, Loch Tuim Ghlais, Loch Scye, [[Loch Shurrery]], [[Loch Calder]] and Loch Mey.\n\nThe underlying geology of most of Caithness is [[old red sandstone]] to an estimated depth of over 4,000 metres. This consists of the cemented sediments of [[Orcadian Basin|Lake Orcadie]], which is believed to have stretched from [[Shetland]] to [[Grampian]] during the [[Devonian]] period, about 370 million years ago. Fossilised fish and plant remains are found between the layers of sediment. Older metamorphic ([[granite]]) rock is apparent in the [[Scaraben]] and [[Ord, Highland|Ord]] area, in the relatively high southwest area of the county. Caithness' highest point ([[Morven, Caithness|Morven]]) is in this area.\n\nBecause of the ease with which the sandstone splits to form large flat slabs ([[flagstone]]) it is an especially useful building material, and has been used as such since [[Neolithic]] times.\n\n==Natural heritage==\n[[File:St John's Loch near Dunnet Head - geograph.org.uk - 326534.jpg|thumb|left|St John's Loch near [[Dunnet Head]] has the distinction of supporting the most northerly hatch of [[Mayfly]] in the British Isle.]]\nCaithness is one of the [[Watsonian vice-counties]], subdivisions of [[Great Britain| Britain]] and [[Ireland]] which are used largely for the purposes of biological recording and other scientific data-gathering. The vice-counties were introduced by [[Hewett Cottrell Watson]], who first used them in the third volume of his ''{{lang|la|Cybele Britannica}}'', published in 1852. He refined the system somewhat in later volumes, but the vice-counties remain unaffected by subsequent local government re-organisations, allowing more accurate comparisons of historical and modern data. They provide a stable basis for recording using similarly-sized units, and, although grid-based reporting has grown in popularity, they remain a standard in the vast majority of ecological surveys, allowing data collected over long periods of time to be compared easily.\n\nThe underlying geology, harsh climate, and long history of human occupation have shaped the natural heritage of Caithness. Today a diverse landscape incorporates both common and rare habitats and species, and Caithness provides a stronghold for many once common breeding species that have undergone serious declines elsewhere, such as [[wader]]s, [[European water vole|water vole]]s, and flocks of [[bird migration|over-wintering]] birds.\n\nMany rare mammals, birds, and fish have been sighted or caught in and around Caithness waters. [[Harbour porpoise]]s, dolphins (including [[Risso's dolphin|Risso's]], [[bottle-nosed dolphin|bottle-nosed]], [[common dolphin|common]], [[Atlantic white-sided dolphin|Atlantic white-sided]], and [[white-beaked dolphin]]s), and [[minke whale|minke]] and [[long-finned pilot whale]]s<ref>ALISTAIRMUNRO. 2017.

[[Norway]] has recognised Caithness as fully Scottish since the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266.\n\nThe study of Caithness prehistory is well represented in the county by groups including Yarrows Heritage Trust,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk/|title=Yarrows Heritage Trust - Home|author=|date=|website=www.yarrowsheritagetrust.co.uk|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> Caithness Horizons<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/caithness-horizons-museum-p256591|title=Caithness Horizons Museum|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Caithness Broch Project]].\n\n==Local government==\n===Early civic history===\nCaithness originally formed part of the shire or [[sheriffdom]] of [[Inverness-shire|Inverness]], but gradually gained independence: in 1455 the [[Earl of Caithness]] gained a grant of the justiciary and sheriffdom of the area from the Sheriff of Inverness. In 1503 an [[act of parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] confirmed the separate jurisdiction, with [[Dornoch]] and [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] named as [[burgh]]s in which the sheriff of Caithness was to hold courts. The area of the sheriffdom was declared to be identical to that of the [[Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness|Diocese of Caithness]]. The Sheriff of Inverness still retained power over important legal cases, however, until 1641. In that year, parliament declared Wick the head burgh of the shire of Caithness and the Earl of Caithness became the heritable sheriff.<ref>{{cite book |title=Caithness & Sutherland |url=https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft |last=Campbell |first=H F |series=Cambridge County Geographies |year=1920 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |pages=[https://archive.org/details/caithnesssutherl00campuoft/page/1 1]\u20132 }}</ref> Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] of 1707, the term \"[[Counties of Scotland|county]]\" began to be applied to the shire, a process that was completed with the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1747.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whetstone |first1=Ann E. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=The Reform of the Scottish Sheriffdoms in the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |publisher=The North American Conference on British Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201371 |doi= |jstor=4048219}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Scottish Society 1707\u20131820 |last=Whatley |first=Christopher A |year=2000 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-7190-4540-0 |page=147 }}</ref> The county began to be known as Caithness-shire.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe population by 1841 had reached 36,343.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.IV'', (1848), London, Charles Knight, p.16</ref>\n\nThe county began to be used as a unit of local administration, and in 1890 was given an elected [[county council]] under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]]. Although officially within the county, the [[burghs]] of Wick and [[Thurso]] retained their status as autonomous local government areas; they were already well established as autonomous burghs with their own burgh councils. Ten [[parish]] councils covering rural areas were established in 1894.\n\nWick, a [[royal burgh]], served as the county's administrative centre.\n\nIn 1930, the parish councils were abolished under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929]].\n\n===1975\u201396===\nIn 1975, the Local Government council and the burgh councils were superseded under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] when Caithness became one of eight districts, each with its own \"district council\", within the new two-tier Highland [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. When created, the district included the whole of the county plus [[Tongue, Highland|Tongue]] and [[Strathnaver|Farr]] areas of the neighbouring [[Sutherland|county of Sutherland]]. The boundary was soon changed, however, to correspond with that between the counties. Caithness was one of eight districts in the Highland region.\n\nHighland region was also created in 1975, as one of nine two-tier local government regions of Scotland. Each region consisted of a number of districts and both regions and districts had their own elected [[Local government|councils]]. The creation of the Highland region and of Caithness as a district involved the abolition of the two [[burgh]] councils in Caithness, [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] and [[Thurso]], as well as the Caithness [[county council]].\n\nWick, which had been the administrative centre for the county, became the administrative centre for the district.\n\nIn 1996 local government in Scotland was again reformed, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], to create [[Council areas of Scotland|32 unitary council areas]]. The Highland region became the Highland unitary council area, and the functions of the district councils were absorbed by the [[Highland Council]].\n\n===1996 to 2007===\n[[Image:ScotlandHighlands.png|thumb|[[Highland council area]] 1996 to present]]\nIn 1996, Caithness and the other seven districts of the Highland region were merged into the unitary Highland [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]], under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]]. The new Highland Council then adopted the former districts as management areas and created a system of [[area committee]]s to represent the management areas.\n\nUntil 1999 the Caithness management and committee areas consisted of 8 out of the 72 Highland Council [[ward (politics)|ward]]s. Each ward elected one councillor by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\nIn 1999, however, ward boundaries were redrawn but management area boundaries were not. As a result, area committees were named after and made decisions for areas which they did not exactly represent. The new Caithness committee area, consisting of ten out of the 80 new Highland Council wards, did not include the village of [[Reay]], although that village was within the Caithness management area. For area committee representation the village was within the [[Sutherland]] committee area.\n\nNew wards were created for elections this year, 2007, polling on 3 May and, as the wards became effective for representational purposes, the Highland Council's management and committee structures were reorganised. The Caithness management area and the Caithness area committee were therefore abolished.\n\n=== 2007 to date===\nIn 2007 the [[Highland Council]], which is now the local government authority, created the [[Highland Council|Caithness ward management area]], which has boundaries similar to those of the historic county. It was divided between three new wards electing councillors by the [[single transferable vote]] system of election, which is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]]. One ward elects four councillors. Each of the other two elects three councillors. Also, the council's eight management areas were abolished, in favour of three new corporate management areas, with Caithness becoming a ward management area within the council's new [[Highland Council|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross operational management area]], which covers seven of the council's 22 new wards. The boundaries of the Caithness ward management area are not exactly those of the former Caithness management area, but they do include the village of Reay.\n\nThe ward management area is one of five within the corporate management area and until 2017 consisted of three wards, the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Landward Caithness ward]], the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Thurso ward]] and the [[Highland Council wards created in 2007|Wick ward]]. Each of the other ward management areas within the corporate management area consists of a single ward. In 2017 the three Caithness wards were reduced to two 'Town and County' wards, each returning four members to the Highland Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/info/695/council_information_performance_and_statistics/504/council_wards|title=Council wards|first=Heather|last=Butlin|website=www.highland.gov.uk}}</ref> this was a reduction of two Councillors from the last election in 2012.

For civil administration purposes, implementation of the act redefined parish boundaries, transferring part of Reay to the Sutherland parish of [[Farr, Sutherland|Farr]] and the fragment of Thurso to the parish of Halkirk.<ref>Boundary changes as described in ''Boundaries of Counties and Parishes in Scotland'', Hay Shennan, 1892</ref>\n\nIn the cases of two of the parishes, Thurso and Wick, each includes a burgh with the same name as the parish. For civil administration purposes each of these parishes was divided between the burgh and the landward (rural) area of the parish.\n\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.\n{| class=\"toptextcells\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are however the most local tier of statutory representation.\n\nUnder the 1973 Act, district councils were obliged to implement community council schemes. A Caithness district scheme was adopted in 1975, dividing the area of the district between 12 community councils.\n\nStatutory status for community councils was continued under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], and a Caithness scheme is now the responsibility of the [[Highland Council]].\n\nThe area of the former district of Caithness is now covered by 12 community council areas which are numbered and described as below in the Highland Council's ''Scheme for the Establishment of Community Councils in Caithness'', October 1997.

At the same time however, the county town of [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] was represented as a component of [[Tain Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Tain Burghs]] until 1832 and of [[Wick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Wick Burghs]] until 1918.\n\nBetween 1708 and 1832 the Caithness constituency was paired with [[Buteshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buteshire]] as ''alternating constituencies'': one constituency elected a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to one parliament and then the other elected an MP to the next. Between 1832 and 1918 Caithness elected an MP to every parliament.\n\nIn 1918 the Caithness constituency and Wick were merged into the then new constituency of [[Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness and Sutherland]]. In 1997 Caithness and Sutherland was merged into [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]].\n\nThe [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Scottish Parliament constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]] was created in 1999 and now has boundaries slightly different from those of the House of Commons constituency. It was replaced by the larger constituency of [[Caithness, Sutherland and Ross (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Ross]] in 2011.\n\nThe modern constituencies may be seen as more sub-divisions of the Highland area than as representative of counties (and burghs). For its own purposes, however, the Highland Council uses more conservative sub-divisions, with names which refer back to the era of district councils and, in some cases, county councils.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Parliament]] Caithness is represented also as part of the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament region)|Highlands and Islands]] [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral region]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\n[[File:John o' Groats.JPG|thumb|right|John o' Groats]]\n[[File:Thurso from the hill at Mountpleasant - geograph.org.uk - 8869.jpg|thumb|right|Thurso]]\n[[File:Bridge of Wick - geograph.org.uk - 252159.jpg|thumb|right|Wick]]\nIn 2011, Caithness had a resident population of 26,486 (23,866 in 2001).

Note from the publisher, F.

He studied at [[Leeds University]], where he earned his [[sporting colours|colours]] in boxing and rugby, and graduated with a [[National Diploma (United Kingdom)|National Diploma]] in Agriculture (NDA) and then a National Diploma in Dairying (NDD) from the [[University of Glasgow]].\n\nAfter managerial positions on farms in [[Yorkshire]], [[East Anglia]], and [[Wales]], he moved to London to work as an advisor for cattle feed suppliers and later joined the [[Potato Marketing Board]].  While in London, he began his journalistic career, contributing regularly to ''Farmers Weekly'', ''The Dairy Farmer'', and other agricultural periodicals.  He also became active in the Peace Movement after attending lectures by Canon [[Dick Sheppard (priest)|Dick Sheppard]] who founded the [[Peace Pledge Union]] in 1934.  Newman Turner later became chairman of the Golders Green branch of the PPU. It was here that he met [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] who invited him to become vice president of his newly formed Society for the Creation of a Holy Nation, later renamed [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]].  Newman Turner registered as a [[conscientious objector]] (CO) in 1940 and became the manager of Goosegreen Farm, near [[Bridgwater]] in Somerset, which was run by a group of [[pacifist]]s and [[Quakers]] as a training centre for COs who were required to work on the land.\n\n==Organic farming==\n\nInspired by the work of [[Sir Albert Howard]], whose books ''An Agricultural Testament'' (1943) and ''Farming and Gardening for Health and Disease'' (1945) advocated composting, he restored the health of the rather run-down farm and its ailing livestock by the use of deep rooting herbal leys, fasting, and botanic remedies.{{refn|For more information on herbal leys, fasting, and botanic remedies, see e.g. \n<ref>{{cite journal\n |ref=harv \n |url=https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/files/cotswoldseeds/leys%20article_0.pdf\n |title=Herbal Leys\n |last=Wilkinson\n |first=Ian\n |issue=Spring 2011\n |journal=Cattle Breeder\n |year=2011}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal\n |author=Gregorini, C.

However, Newman Turner was keen to accumulate even more practical evidence and it was not until 1951 that [[Faber & Faber]] published ''Fertility Farming''.  This was followed by ''Herdsmanship'' (1953) and ''Fertility Pastures'' (1955).  In 1950 he had published a booklet under ''The Farmer'' imprint, \"Cure your own Cattle\". After an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK beginning around Jan-Feb 1951,<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39148/page/802/data.pdf''The London Gazette'', 13 February 1951, p. 802]</ref> he offered to take infected cattle into his herd to demonstrate that animals fed on organic pasture would have immunity to the disease or recover with natural treatment.<ref>Newman Turner, F.

Newman Turner was in demand as a spokesman on natural farming and animal rearing, appearing regularly on regional radio stations and, for a time, on BBC television's ''The Smokey Club'', a pet care programme presented by the zoologist [[George Cansdale]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Smokey Club, 12 January 1957 |work=BBC Genome Project  |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/bd769ec4bcdd4de1a90db9fbe085731c |publisher=BBC Television |accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe is also known to have been one of many notable figures sketched or painted by the famous Sutton Portrait Artist, Elva Blacker 1908-1984<ref>\nExhibition catalogue of artist Elva Blacker with details of a Newman Turner portrait</ref>\n\n==Human health==\n\nIn 1953 Newman Turner and his family sold Goosegreen Farm and moved to the Ferne Estate, near [[Shaftesbury]] on the borders of [[Dorset]] and [[Wiltshire]], to run the home farm on organic lines.  Ferne had been the home of the [[Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton#Marriage and issue|Dowager Duchess of Hamilton]], who had set up an animal sanctuary there.  His hope had been to establish an animal hospital using natural methods of treatment but this did not work out, owing to objections to him publishing from the Ferne estate.<ref>''The Farmer'', Autumn 1956, p12</ref>   Having by now qualified as a medical herbalist in the human field and consulted at the [[Society of Herbalists]]' Culpeper shops, founded by [[Hilda Leyel]] (Mrs C. F. Lyel) in London, Oxford, and Harrogate, he decided to sell his pedigree Jersey herd and focus on publishing and human health.  In 1958 the family moved to [[Letchworth Garden City]] where he established a practice in [[osteopathy]], [[naturopathy]] and medical herbalism. After Frank's demise, his eldest son Roger took over the clinic and ran it until his own retirement in January 2016.\n\n''The Farmer'' had featured a supplement on organic horticulture and, in 1957, Newman Turner launched ''The Gardener, Small Livestock and Pet Owner'' as a monthly magazine with eminent horticulturist [[W. E. Shewell-Cooper]], as associate editor, and [[Lawrence D. Hills]]  a regular contributor.  Lawrence Hills, a well known alpinist and horticultural writer, founded the [[Henry Doubleday Research Association]] (now [[Garden Organic]]) in 1954  and invited Newman Turner to become its first president, a position he held until his death. He had also taken on publication of the magazine of the [[National Institute of Medical Herbalists]] which he relaunched as ''Fitness and Health from Herbs''. In 1962 he was made a Fellow of the Institute for his work on behalf of herbal medicine.\n\nIn the early 1950s Newman Turner set up a company in Bridgwater, Organic Herbal Products, to supply natural pet foods and herbal remedies and, in 1962, with his wife, Lorna, Inter-Medics Ltd. a company importing herbal medicines and health food products from Germany and Switzerland. Neither of these is still operating. He died of a heart attack while visiting herbal suppliers in Bingen, Germany on 28 June 1964.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book\n |ref=harv  <!--{{sfn|Newman Turner|2009}} -->\n |last=Newman Turner\n |first=Frank\n |title=Cure your own Cattle \n |others=Reprint.

His hope had been to establish an animal hospital using natural methods of treatment but this did not work out, owing to objections to him publishing from the Ferne estate.<ref>''The Farmer'', Autumn 1956, p12</ref>   Having by now qualified as a medical herbalist in the human field and consulted at the [[Society of Herbalists]]' Culpeper shops, founded by [[Hilda Leyel]] (Mrs C. F. Lyel) in London, Oxford, and Harrogate, he decided to sell his pedigree Jersey herd and focus on publishing and human health.  In 1958 the family moved to [[Letchworth Garden City]] where he established a practice in [[osteopathy]], [[naturopathy]] and medical herbalism. After Frank's demise, his eldest son Roger took over the clinic and ran it until his own retirement in January 2016.\n\n''The Farmer'' had featured a supplement on organic horticulture and, in 1957, Newman Turner launched ''The Gardener, Small Livestock and Pet Owner'' as a monthly magazine with eminent horticulturist [[W. E. Shewell-Cooper]], as associate editor, and [[Lawrence D. Hills]]  a regular contributor.  Lawrence Hills, a well known alpinist and horticultural writer, founded the [[Henry Doubleday Research Association]] (now [[Garden Organic]]) in 1954  and invited Newman Turner to become its first president, a position he held until his death. He had also taken on publication of the magazine of the [[National Institute of Medical Herbalists]] which he relaunched as ''Fitness and Health from Herbs''. In 1962 he was made a Fellow of the Institute for his work on behalf of herbal medicine.\n\nIn the early 1950s Newman Turner set up a company in Bridgwater, Organic Herbal Products, to supply natural pet foods and herbal remedies and, in 1962, with his wife, Lorna, Inter-Medics Ltd. a company importing herbal medicines and health food products from Germany and Switzerland. Neither of these is still operating. He died of a heart attack while visiting herbal suppliers in Bingen, Germany on 28 June 1964.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book\n |ref=harv  <!--{{sfn|Newman Turner|2009}} -->\n |last=Newman Turner\n |first=Frank\n |title=Cure your own Cattle \n |others=Reprint.

It has been studied for its evolution of [[mimicry]], and for the several stable hybrid wing patterns within this [[type species|nominal species]]; it is one of the most dramatic examples of hybridization between non-mimetic and mimetic populations.\n\n''Limenitis arthemis'' can be split into two major groups, mainly based on one physical characteristic: the presence of a white band along the wings. Individuals of the northern group, called white admirals, have a conspicuous white band that traverse both the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal and ventral]] surfaces of the wing, while those of the southern group, called red-spotted purples, lack that trait as they have evolved to mimic the poisonous pipevine swallowtail (''[[Battus philenor]]''). Due to [[hybrid zone|overlap in distribution]] among the two major groups, intermediates are numerous as [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] occurs frequently.\n\n== Taxonomy and phylogenetics ==\n''Limenitis arthemis'' is a butterfly species in the tribe [[Limenitidini]] of the family [[Nymphalidae]]. The Limenitidini are a tribe of the better known \"brush-footed butterflies\", as they are known to perch on hindlegs, whereas the other two forelegs are positioned curled up. These two forelegs often have brush-like hairs, which is a key identifier of the ''Nymphalidae''. The Limenitidini consist of 25 species grouped primarily by region. The ''Basilarchia'' species group, spread in North America, include the American white admiral species, ''L. arthemis,'' as well as ''L. archippus, L. lorquini,'' and ''L. weidemeyerii.''<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0256 |pmid=19369265 |pmc=2686656 |title=A single origin of Batesian mimicry among hybridizing populations of admiral butterflies (''Limenitis arthemis'') rejects an evolutionary reversion to the ancestral phenotype |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=276 |issue=1667 |pages=2557\u201365 |year=2009 |last1=Savage |first1=Wesley K. |last2=Mullen |first2=Sean P.}}</ref>\n\n== Description and identification ==\n''Limenitis arthemis'' is described to be beautiful and highly active. The butterfly species themselves can be divided into two major groups simply from one main characteristic, the white band on the upper wings. However, besides the look of the butterfly, ''L. arthemis'' are in constant motion. Their flights are short in duration and at low altitudes, flying only about 2 to 3 feet off the ground. When not in flight, ''L. arthemis'' are constantly walking over leaves and folding their wings. They enjoy the sun as many are found to be resting at the highest points on trees. During the short period they are at rest, ''L. arthemis'' keep their wings closed, body at a 45 degree angle upwards, and antennae straight forward.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBoth sexes of this species are identical except that the females are slightly larger than the males.<ref name=\"rcgt\">Rick Cech and Guy Tudor (2005).

Some individuals have a row of red submarginal spots, while others have this area being blue. The underside of the wings is a blackish color with a broad white post-median band. The basal area of both wings contains many red spots. The submarginal area may contain a row of red spots and the marginal area having bluish spots.

''L a. arthemis'' or the white admiral live on the far north side of the continent, ranging from New England and southern Great Lakes area all the way to various parts of Canada. ''L. a. astyanax'' are based further south from the New England and southern Great Lake boundary; the hybridization region is the overlapped region of New England and southern Great Lakes.

Male ''L. arthemis'' are known to be very aggressive when it comes down to defending an area bountiful of female mates. Male residents perch under the sun until another male comes into the vicinity; these engagements generally last approximately 1\u20135 minutes. Once conflicts comes to an end, males periodically patrol their territory for other outsiders tempted to take over the territory.

Mate-locating behaviors for males tended to start in the afternoon, between 11&nbsp;am and 4&nbsp;pm. Most males perched as a sign of defense of the territory. Males tend not to favor perching on host trees, but rather on various of foliage like maple, elm trees, or raspberry bushes, generally about 1\u20132 meters off the ground. This particular mating behavior seems ironic because males should want to perch on host trees as females tend to seek mates in areas where resources like food or host trees are bountiful. Therefore, many times, males are defending areas that do not consist of the most females.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Male-male behavior ===\nMales tend to display aggressive behavior with each other during territorial fights.

It has been studied for its evolution of [[mimicry]], and for the several stable hybrid wing patterns within this [[type species|nominal species]]; it is one of the most dramatic examples of hybridization between non-mimetic and mimetic populations.\n\n''Limenitis arthemis'' can be split into two major groups, mainly based on one physical characteristic: the presence of a white band along the wings. Individuals of the northern group, called white admirals, have a conspicuous white band that traverse both the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal and ventral]] surfaces of the wing, while those of the southern group, called red-spotted purples, lack that trait as they have evolved to mimic the poisonous pipevine swallowtail (''[[Battus philenor]]''). Due to [[hybrid zone|overlap in distribution]] among the two major groups, intermediates are numerous as [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] occurs frequently.\n\n== Taxonomy and phylogenetics ==\n''Limenitis arthemis'' is a butterfly species in the tribe [[Limenitidini]]  of the family [[Nymphalidae]]. The Limenitidini are a tribe of the better known \"brush-footed butterflies\", as they are known to perch on hindlegs, whereas the other two forelegs are positioned curled up. These two forelegs often have brush-like hairs, which is a key identifier of the ''Nymphalidae''. The Limenitidini consist of 25 species grouped primarily by region. The ''Basilarchia'' species group, spread in North America, include the American white admiral species, ''L. arthemis,'' as well as ''L. archippus, L. lorquini,'' and ''L. weidemeyerii.''<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0256 |pmid=19369265 |pmc=2686656 |title=A single origin of Batesian mimicry among hybridizing populations of admiral butterflies (''Limenitis arthemis'') rejects an evolutionary reversion to the ancestral phenotype |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=276 |issue=1667 |pages=2557\u201365 |year=2009 |last1=Savage |first1=Wesley K. |last2=Mullen |first2=Sean P.}}</ref>\n\n== Description and identification ==\n''Limenitis arthemis'' is described to be beautiful and highly active. The butterfly species themselves can be divided into two major groups simply from one main characteristic, the white band on the upper wings. However, besides the look of the butterfly, ''L. arthemis'' are in constant motion. Their flights are short in duration and at low altitudes, flying only about 2 to 3 feet off the ground. When not in flight, ''L. arthemis'' are constantly walking over leaves and folding their wings. They enjoy the sun as many are found to be resting at the highest points on trees. During the short period they are at rest, ''L. arthemis'' keep their wings closed, body at a 45 degree angle upwards, and antennae straight forward.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBoth sexes of this species are identical except that the females are slightly larger than the males.<ref name=\"rcgt\">Rick Cech and Guy Tudor (2005).

Some individuals have a row of red submarginal spots, while others have this area being blue. The underside of the wings is a blackish color with a broad white post-median band. The basal area of both wings contains many red spots. The submarginal area may contain a row of red spots and the marginal area having bluish spots.

''L a. arthemis'' or the white admiral live on the far north side of the continent, ranging from New England and southern Great Lakes area all the way to various parts of Canada. ''L. a. astyanax'' are based further south from the New England and southern Great Lake boundary; the hybridization region is the overlapped region of New England and southern Great Lakes. These butterflies spend their days in [[deciduous]] woodlands, along the edges of the forest in shady areas, including roadsides.<ref>[https://wisconsinbutterflies.org/butterfly/species/96-red-spotted-purple Wisconsin Butterflies.org]</ref>\n\n== Home range and territoriality ==\n\n=== Male territoriality display ===\nWhen males are searching for mates, they generally try to defend areas that have high female visitation rates, regardless of the amount of resources. Male ''L. arthemis'' are known to be very aggressive when it comes down to defending an area bountiful of female mates. Male residents perch under the sun until another male comes into the vicinity; these engagements generally last approximately 1\u20135 minutes. Once conflicts comes to an end, males periodically patrol their territory for other outsiders tempted to take over the territory. Males also have high fidelity to the territory they are defending.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal |first1=MI |last1=Lederhouse |year=1993 |title=Territoriality along flyways as mate-locating behavior in male Limenitis arthemis (Nymphalidae) |url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US9406672 |journal=Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society |language=English }}</ref>\n\n== Food resources ==\n\n=== Caterpillars ===\nCaterpillars of the [[hybrid zone|hybrid region]] generally feed on tree species in the plant family Salicacceae, including aspen, poplar, and willow trees.

However, some larvae are able to mature during the summer, so they emerge as the second brood early fall. The second brood also mate and lay eggs, but often these larvae are not yet mature enough to undergo hibernation.

The two major subspecies that dominate the hybridization are ''L. a. arthemis'' (white admiral) and ''L. a. astyanax'' (red-spotted purple). The white admiral is characterized by a bright, white band on its wings, while the red-spotted purple lacks the white band, but has cooler blue-green shades on its wings. Hybridization occurs between a narrow area across New England, southern Ontario, and the Great Lakes, also known as the \"suture region\". It is at these regions that the subspecies were formed.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00366.x |pmid=18331459 |title=Hybrid Zone Origins, Species Boundaries, and the Evolution of Wing-Pattern Diversity in a Polytypic Species Complex of North American Admiral Butterflies (Nymphalidae: Limenitis) |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=1400\u201317 |year=2008 |last1=Mullen |first1=Sean P |last2=Dopman |first2=Erik B |last3=Harrison |first3=Richard G }}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00401.x |pmid=18410533 |title=A Rare Model Limits the Distribution of Its More Common Mimic: A Twist on Frequency-Dependent Batesian Mimicry |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=1798\u2013803 |year=2008 |last1=Ries |first1=Leslie |last2=Mullen |first2=Sean P}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one study, these hybrid zones were of secondary origin, meaning that both the white admiral and the red-spotted purple are already genetically distinct and the two diverged lineages reconnect at this hybrid area.<ref name=\":0\" /> They were able to support their claim by examining various of [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondria DNA]] of the population to determine the similarities and differences of the origins of the hybrid zones and the evolution of mimicry. Another study suggests that hybridization is highly frequent in this species because similar species mate together regardless of being the same butterfly or not. For instance, the ''L. arthemis'' was found to be mating with a ''L. archippus'' butterfly in New England.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Charles V. |last1=Covell |year=1994 |title=Field observations of matings between female ''Limenitis archippus'' and male ''L. arthemis'' subspecies (Nymphalidae) |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/80701 |journal=Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society |language=English |volume=48 }}</ref>\n\n== Mating ==\n\n=== Mate searching behavior ===\n[[File:L Arthemis Mississauga Ontario Canada - Top view.jpg|thumb|''Limenitis arthemis'' Mississauga Ontario Canada - Top view]]\nWhen males are searching for female mates, they tend to seek territories plentiful of the number of visits the females make to that specific area. Mate-locating behaviors for males tended to start in the afternoon, between 11&nbsp;am and 4&nbsp;pm. Most males perched as a sign of defense of the territory. Males tend not to favor perching on host trees, but rather on various of foliage like maple, elm trees, or raspberry bushes, generally about 1\u20132 meters off the ground. This particular mating behavior seems ironic because males should want to perch on host trees as females tend to seek mates in areas where resources like food or host trees are bountiful. Therefore, many times, males are defending areas that do not consist of the most females.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Male-male behavior ===\nMales tend to display aggressive behavior with each other during territorial fights. Fights have been classified into two types: 1) jostling, which are contests over eclosed or eclosing females and 2) aerial maneuvers, which are fought over ownership of [[mating]] territories in a specific [[breeding ground]].<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |last1=Kemp |first1=Darrell J. |last2=Wiklund |first2=Christer |title=Fighting without Weaponry: A Review of Male-Male Contest Competition in Butterflies |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=2001 |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=429\u2013442 |jstor=4601913 |doi=10.1007/s002650100318 }}</ref> These fights are significant due to the ability of female butterflies to \"double-mate\" which introduce the idea of sperm precedence and [[competition]] to reproduce between males. A study showed that within female butterflies that \"double-mate\" a small percent of the [[Offspring|progeny]] resulted from the mixing of sperm, which illustrate the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the male. Therefore, there is an incentive for males to claim their mate prior to other males, which can also affect male mate-seeking strategies as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Platt |first1=A.

After which a series of flight patterns such as circling flights, vertical and/or horizontal chases, and hovering flights ensue. It is established that the \"[[competition]]\" component of the fight is the circling flight, often followed by the horizontal chase in which the 'loser' is chased from the disputed territory. Territorial fights are not limited to [[mating]], but it is a method to optimize their mate-seeking behavior.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Female-male behavior ===\nOnce a female lands on a leaf, the male lands behind her quite shortly after.
