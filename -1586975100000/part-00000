in charge of [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]]. Woodhouse played football as a central [[midfielder]], and competed as a [[light-welterweight]] boxer. He is the former British light-welterweight champion. His career in [[the Football League]] spanned across nine seasons, earning four [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 football team]]. Woodhouse's professional boxing record stands at 29 fights 22 wins, 13 of which are by [[knock-out]], and 7 defeats.\n\nHe started his footballing career with [[York City F.C.|York City]]'s centre of excellence before joining [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. In November 2001, he was transferred to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a fee of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1 million, before joining [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in January 2003, on loan for five months. He then joined [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on a free transfer in October 2003. In May 2005, he joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for \u00a325,000, before joining [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] just eight months later in January 2006.

In September 2006, he won his first professional boxing match, defeating Dean Marcantonio, on points, knocking him down twice in the final round.\n\nHe was convicted of assaulting a police officer and of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in April 2006.

Minnesota, despite losing [[David Cobb (American football)|David Cobb]] to the NFL last year and going through a mid-season coaching transition, had a lot to prove as they entered the undefeated #5 Iowa's home stadium in an attempt to deliver the upset. Mitch Leidner, who had not lived up to expectations early in the season, was coming off a good run of games, and had two weeks earlier come within a 4th-down pass at the 1 to beating a hot Michigan team.\n\nMinnesota hung on well to the Hawkeyes but were unable to stop the Iowa halfbacks. LeShun Daniels Jr. ran for nearly 200 yards, and CJ Beathard scored on a play action bootleg in the red zone, reminiscent of Iowa great Chuck Long's game-winning bootleg against Michigan State in 1985.\n\nIowa kept building on its lead all night, and LeShun Daniels Jr. broke through the box to run it in 51 yards in the final 3 minutes. With Minnesota down two scores, Shannon Brooks took the offense on a high-energy no-huddle drive through the air that took less than 1 minute to score. Minnesota's onside kick failed, and Iowa took the win, 40\u201335.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Purdue===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Purdue at <small>#5</small> Iowa'''\n|Visitor=Boilermakers\n|V1=0 |V2=10 |V3=3 |V4=7\n|Host='''#5 Hawkeyes'''\n|H1=14 |H2=6 |H3=7 |H4=13\n|Date=November 21\n|Location=[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n|StartTime=11:00 AM\n|TimeZone=CST\n|ElapsedTime=3:16\n|Attendance=62,920\n|Weather=27\u00b0F, Mostly sunny, Wind 25 MPH\n|Referee=Jeff Servinski\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Beth Mowins]], [[Anthony Becht]], Paul Carcaterra\n|TVStation=[[ESPN2]]\n}}\n*'''Sources:''' <small>[http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3068&path=football Box score]</small>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=8:54 |Team=Iowa |Event=LeShun Daniels 2-yard run (Marshall Koehn kick) |Score=Iowa 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=4:32 |Team=Iowa |Event=LeShun Daniels 13-yard run (Marshall Koehn kick) |Score=Iowa 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=13:40 |Team=Iowa |Event=Matt VandeBerg 7-yard pass from C.J.

Since the Rose Bowl traditionally gives a bid to the winner of the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences, and due to the new College Football Playoff system where the conference champion was likely to enter the playoff, the Rose Bowl committee had announced prior to the Big Ten Championship Game that they would give a bid to the second highest-ranked Big Ten team if a Big Ten team entered the playoff, since it was clear that the winner of the Big Ten Championship Game would finish in the Top 4 ranking.\n\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>5 Iowa was named the home team and #6 Stanford was named the away team. Sports analysts had anticipated the contest to be exciting, due mainly to the matchup between Iowa's strong run defense and Stanford running back [[Christian McCaffrey]], the [[Heisman Trophy]] runner-up. Iowa's run defense finished the season ranked 14th, allowing only 121 yards per game and having defeated historically rushing teams like Wisconsin, Indiana, and Nebraska.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rushing Defense {{!}} FBS Football Statistics - NCAA.com|url = https://www.ncaa.com/stats/football/fbs/current/team/24|website = NCAA.com|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref> Contrarily, Christian McCaffrey led the FBS in the 2015 season with 3,864 all-purpose yards, which came from punt/kick returns, runs from scrimmage, and passes out of the backfield.<ref>{{Cite web|title = All Purpose {{!}} FBS Football Statistics - NCAA.com|url = https://www.ncaa.com/stats/football/fbs/current/individual/20|website = NCAA.com|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref>\n\nChristian McCaffrey caught a short pass and turned it into a 75-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage. The Hawkeyes were unable to stop him, as he averaged 9.6 YPC (172 yards on 18 carries), returned a punt for a touchdown, and converted many third downs. Though he did not rush for any touchdowns from scrimmage, he proved to be the primary playmaker for Stanford, catching a third (4) of Kevin Hogan's passes. McCaffrey was such an offensive threat that Hogan was able to make large gains with the read option, including a wide-open first-quarter option TD run.\n\nIowa was unable to get their run game going, rushing as a team for 1.3 YPC (48 yards on 38 carries). The longest Iowa runs came from LeShun Daniels, Jr. and Akrum Wadley (14 and 12 yards, respectively),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Stanford vs. Iowa \u2013 Box Score \u2013 January 1, 2016 \u2013 ESPN|url = http://espn.go.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=400852737|website = ESPN.com|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref> as well as a 14-yard scramble by Beathard. Iowa's inability to establish a run game closed up Iowa's potential for play-action passing, which has been Beathard's bread and butter all season. Jordan Canzeri, Iowa's power halfback, was unable to churn significant yardage, and 3rd-team halfback Akrum Wadley (who had a 200-yard game at Northwestern, when Daniels and Canzeri were both injured) split ballcarrying duties with Daniels in the second half. Iowa's halfbacks, their biggest threat all season, were overall unable to garner any significant yardage on the ground; Derek Mitchell, Jr., Iowa's 4th-team halfback, saw significant action lining up in the backfield and caught 4 passes for 41 yards, and Wadley also contributed to the pass game by catching 3 for 60.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanford shut Iowa out in the first half 35\u20130, with Stanford's 35 points the most scored in the first half of a Rose Bowl in its entire 102-year history.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = Christian McCaffrey sets Rose Bowl record as Stanford routs Iowa|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2016/01/01/christian-mccaffrey-sets-rose-bowl-record-stanford-routs-iowa/78195914/|website = USA TODAY|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref> Stanford's 21\u20130 first-quarter lead was also the most first-quarter points scored by one team in Rose Bowl history.<ref name=\":1\" /> Christian McCaffrey gained a total of 368 all-purpose yards, setting another Rose Bowl record.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy the second half, Stanford's explosiveness slowed down, scoring just 10 second-half points versus their 35 first-half points. Iowa did not score until the 3rd quarter when placekicker Marshall Koehn kicked a field goal after converting on 4th down earlier in the drive; Beathard threw 2 touchdowns in the 4th quarter, with Koehn missing one of the two PATs.\n\nIowa had a slight advantage in time of possession, possessing the ball for almost 33 minutes, though they were simply unable to make meaning out of their possessions.

Minnesota, despite losing [[David Cobb (American football)|David Cobb]] to the NFL last year and going through a mid-season coaching transition, had a lot to prove as they entered the undefeated #5 Iowa's home stadium in an attempt to deliver the upset. Mitch Leidner, who had not lived up to expectations early in the season, was coming off a good run of games, and had two weeks earlier come within a 4th-down pass at the 1 to beating a hot Michigan team.\n\nMinnesota hung on well to the Hawkeyes but were unable to stop the Iowa halfbacks. LeShun Daniels Jr. ran for nearly 200 yards, and CJ Beathard scored on a play action bootleg in the red zone, reminiscent of Iowa great Chuck Long's game-winning bootleg against Michigan State in 1985.\n\nIowa kept building on its lead all night, and LeShun Daniels Jr. broke through the box to run it in 51 yards in the final 3 minutes. With Minnesota down two scores, Shannon Brooks took the offense on a high-energy no-huddle drive through the air that took less than 1 minute to score. Minnesota's onside kick failed, and Iowa took the win, 40\u201335.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Purdue===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Purdue at <small>#5</small> Iowa'''\n|Visitor=Boilermakers\n|V1=0 |V2=10 |V3=3 |V4=7\n|Host='''#5 Hawkeyes'''\n|H1=14 |H2=6 |H3=7 |H4=13\n|Date=November 21\n|Location=[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n|StartTime=11:00 AM\n|TimeZone=CST\n|ElapsedTime=3:16\n|Attendance=62,920\n|Weather=27\u00b0F, Mostly sunny, Wind 25 MPH\n|Referee=Jeff Servinski\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Beth Mowins]], [[Anthony Becht]], Paul Carcaterra\n|TVStation=[[ESPN2]]\n}}\n*'''Sources:''' <small>[http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3068&path=football Box score]</small>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=8:54 |Team=Iowa |Event=LeShun Daniels 2-yard run (Marshall Koehn kick) |Score=Iowa 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=4:32 |Team=Iowa |Event=LeShun Daniels 13-yard run (Marshall Koehn kick) |Score=Iowa 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=13:40 |Team=Iowa |Event=Matt VandeBerg 7-yard pass from C.J.

Since the Rose Bowl traditionally gives a bid to the winner of the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences, and due to the new College Football Playoff system where the conference champion was likely to enter the playoff, the Rose Bowl committee had announced prior to the Big Ten Championship Game that they would give a bid to the second highest-ranked Big Ten team if a Big Ten team entered the playoff, since it was clear that the winner of the Big Ten Championship Game would finish in the Top 4 ranking.\n\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>5 Iowa was named the home team and #6 Stanford was named the away team. Sports analysts had anticipated the contest to be exciting, due mainly to the matchup between Iowa's strong run defense and Stanford running back [[Christian McCaffrey]], the [[Heisman Trophy]] runner-up. Iowa's run defense finished the season ranked 14th, allowing only 121 yards per game and having defeated historically rushing teams like Wisconsin, Indiana, and Nebraska.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rushing Defense {{!}} FBS Football Statistics - NCAA.com|url = https://www.ncaa.com/stats/football/fbs/current/team/24|website = NCAA.com|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref> Contrarily, Christian McCaffrey led the FBS in the 2015 season with 3,864 all-purpose yards, which came from punt/kick returns, runs from scrimmage, and passes out of the backfield.<ref>{{Cite web|title = All Purpose {{!}} FBS Football Statistics - NCAA.com|url = https://www.ncaa.com/stats/football/fbs/current/individual/20|website = NCAA.com|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref>\n\nChristian McCaffrey caught a short pass and turned it into a 75-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage. The Hawkeyes were unable to stop him, as he averaged 9.6 YPC (172 yards on 18 carries), returned a punt for a touchdown, and converted many third downs. Though he did not rush for any touchdowns from scrimmage, he proved to be the primary playmaker for Stanford, catching a third (4) of Kevin Hogan's passes. McCaffrey was such an offensive threat that Hogan was able to make large gains with the read option, including a wide-open first-quarter option TD run.\n\nIowa was unable to get their run game going, rushing as a team for 1.3 YPC (48 yards on 38 carries). The longest Iowa runs came from LeShun Daniels, Jr. and Akrum Wadley (14 and 12 yards, respectively),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Stanford vs. Iowa \u2013 Box Score \u2013 January 1, 2016 \u2013 ESPN|url = http://espn.go.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=400852737|website = ESPN.com|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref> as well as a 14-yard scramble by Beathard. Iowa's inability to establish a run game closed up Iowa's potential for play-action passing, which has been Beathard's bread and butter all season. Jordan Canzeri, Iowa's power halfback, was unable to churn significant yardage, and 3rd-team halfback Akrum Wadley (who had a 200-yard game at Northwestern, when Daniels and Canzeri were both injured) split ballcarrying duties with Daniels in the second half. Iowa's halfbacks, their biggest threat all season, were overall unable to garner any significant yardage on the ground; Derek Mitchell, Jr., Iowa's 4th-team halfback, saw significant action lining up in the backfield and caught 4 passes for 41 yards, and Wadley also contributed to the pass game by catching 3 for 60.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanford shut Iowa out in the first half 35\u20130, with Stanford's 35 points the most scored in the first half of a Rose Bowl in its entire 102-year history.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = Christian McCaffrey sets Rose Bowl record as Stanford routs Iowa|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2016/01/01/christian-mccaffrey-sets-rose-bowl-record-stanford-routs-iowa/78195914/|website = USA TODAY|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}</ref> Stanford's 21\u20130 first-quarter lead was also the most first-quarter points scored by one team in Rose Bowl history.<ref name=\":1\" /> Christian McCaffrey gained a total of 368 all-purpose yards, setting another Rose Bowl record.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy the second half, Stanford's explosiveness slowed down, scoring just 10 second-half points versus their 35 first-half points. Iowa did not score until the 3rd quarter when placekicker Marshall Koehn kicked a field goal after converting on 4th down earlier in the drive; Beathard threw 2 touchdowns in the 4th quarter, with Koehn missing one of the two PATs.\n\nIowa had a slight advantage in time of possession, possessing the ball for almost 33 minutes, though they were simply unable to make meaning out of their possessions.
