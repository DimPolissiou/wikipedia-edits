Lightweight blocks can also be produced using [[autoclaved aerated concrete]]. \n\n==Sizes and structure==\nThe use of blockwork allows structures to be built in the traditional [[masonry]] style with layers (or courses) of staggered blocks. Concrete blocks may be produced with hollow centers (cores) to reduce [[weight]] or improve [[building insulation|insulation]].  Blocks come in modular sizes, with the most popular typically referred to (by their thickness) as \"4-inch\", \"6-inch\", \"8-inch\", and \"12-inch\". In the US, CMU blocks are nominally {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide.  Their actual dimensions are {{convert|3/8|in}} less than the nominal dimensions (to allow for {{frac|3|8}}-inch mortar joints between blocks in any orientation).<ref>[https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/masonry/concblocksizes.html The Architect's Toolbox]</ref> In Ireland and the UK, blocks are usually {{convert|440|x|215|x|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} excluding mortar joints. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, blocks are usually {{convert|390|x|190|x|190|mm|in|abbr=on}} excluding mortar joints.\n\nBlock cores are typically tapered so that their top surface (as laid) has a greater surface on which to spread a mortar bed and for easier handling. Most CMU's have two cores, but three- and four-core units are also produced. A core also allows for the insertion of [[rebar|steel reinforcement]] to span courses in order to increase [[tensile strength]].  This is accomplished by [[grout]]ing the voids of blocks containing rebar with concrete. Thus reinforced, CMU walls are better able to resist lateral forces such as [[wind load]] and seismic forces.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=61\u201363}}\n\nA variety of specialized shapes exist to allow special construction features.  U-shaped blocks or knockout blocks with notches to allow the construction of [[bond beam]]s or [[lintel]] assemblies, using horizontal reinforcing grouted into place in the cavity. Blocks with a channel on the end, known as \"jamb blocks\", allow doors to be secured to wall assemblies. Blocks with grooved ends permit the construction of [[Expansion joint|control joints]], allowing a filler material to be anchored between the un-mortared block ends. Other features, such as radiused corners known as \"[[bullnose]]s\" may be incorporated. A wide variety of decorative profiles also exist.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=66-68}}\n\nConcrete masonry units may be formulated with special aggregates to produce specific colors or textures for finish use. Special textures may be produced by splitting a ribbed or solid two-block unit; such factory-produced units are called \"split-rib\" or \"split-face\" blocks.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=68-70}} Blocks may be scored by grooves the width of a mortar joint to simulate different block modules. For example, an {{convert|8|by(x)|16|in|adj=on}} block may be scored in the middle to simulate {{convert|8|by(x)|8|in|adj=on}} masonry, with the grooves filled with mortar and struck to match the true joints.<ref name=ching1>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis D.K.|title=A Visual Dictionary of Architecture|year=2012|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]], Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-64885-8|edition=2nd|page=168}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===Uses===\nConcrete block, when built with integral steel reinforcing or in tandem with [[Reinforced concrete#Use in construction|concrete columns and tie beams]] and [[Rebar#Use in concrete and masonry|reinforced with rebar]], is a very common building material for the [[load-bearing wall]]s of buildings, in what is termed '''concrete block structure''' ('''CBS''') construction. American [[suburban]] [[houses]] typically employ a concrete [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] and slab with a concrete block wall on the perimeter. Other common uses for concrete block wall is interior fire-rated partition walls, and exterior backup wall for attachment of building envelope systems and fa\u00e7ades.\n\n===Structural properties===\nConcrete masonry walls may be ungrouted, partially [[grout]]ed, or fully grouted, the latter two enhancing their structural strength. Additionally, steel reinforcement bars ([[rebar]])  can be used both vertically and horizontally inside a CMU wall to maximize its structural performance. The cells in which the rebar is placed must be grouted for the bars to bond to the wall. For this reason, high seismic zones typically only allow fully grouted walls in their building codes. The American design code that guides design engineers in using CMU as a structural system is the ''Masonry Standards Joint Committee's Building Code Requirements & Specification for Masonry Structures'' (TMS 402/ACI 530/ASCE 5). The compressive strength of concrete masonry units and masonry walls varies from approximately {{convert|1000|psi|MPa|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5000|psi|MPa|0|abbr=on}} based on the type of concrete used to manufacture the unit, stacking orientation, the type of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] used to build the wall, and other factors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cement.org/pdf_files/IS276.pdf|title=Compressive Strength of Masonry |publisher=Portland Cement Organization |format=PDF |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc26362/nrcc26362.pdf |title=Comprehensive Strength of Hollow Concrete Blockwork |format=PDF |publisher=Government of Canada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916124303/http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc26362/nrcc26362.pdf |date=4 June 1986 |archivedate=2017-06-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/reference/Henley-s-20th-Century-Formulas-Recipes-Processes-Vol3/Properties-of-Concrete-Blocks-8212-Strength.html|title=Properties of Concrete Blocks \u2014 Strength|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Brick#Concrete bricks|Concrete bricks]]\n* [[Gypsum block]]\n* [[Rusticated concrete block]]\n*[[Fly ash brick]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Beall|first=Christine|title=Masonry Design and Detailing for Architects, Engineers and Builders|year=1987|location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|isbn=0-07-004223-3|pages=61\u201363 |ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Concrete blocks}}\n* [http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Concrete-Block.html How Products Are Made: Volume 3 Concrete Block]\n* [http://www.cmacn.org Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada]\n* [http://www.ncma.org National Concrete Masonry Association]\n* [http://www.masoncontractors.org/ Mason Contractors Association of America]\n* [http://www.cba-blocks.org.uk/ Concrete Block Association]\n* [http://www.masonryinstitute.org/ Masonry Institute of America]\n* [http://classicrockfaceblock.com/the-history-behind-rock-face-block/ \"The History Behind Rock Face Block\"]\u2014Classic Rock Face Block\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Soil-based building materials]]\n", "text_old": "{{selfref|\"Cinderblock\" redirects here.

He is regarded by some pundits to be the best modern goalkeeper.\n\nA tall, large, athletic, and physically strong player, Neuer has earned critical acclaim from former players and pundits for his speed, stamina, composure, concentration, consistency, and mentality, as well as for being able to adapt to any given situation on the pitch. He is particularly known for his exceptional reflexes, shot-stopping abilities, speed, and footwork, as well as his ability to read the game, and come out to collect crosses, which enables him to command his area effectively. When the situation demands, he will also often essentially fill the role of a sweeper when opposing players have beaten the offside trap or his team's defensive line, by quickly rushing out of goal to anticipate opponents and clear the ball; his skill, speed and decision-making in this area enables his teams to maintain a high defensive line. Because of his unique playing style, Neuer has been described as a \"sweeper-keeper\", and has been credited with revolutionising the role of the goalkeeper in modern times. He has also been praised by pundits for his positioning between the posts, as well as his ability in one-on-one situations; furthermore, he is effective at stopping penalties, and \u2013 uncommon for a goalkeeper \u2013 has also been known to take and score them in shoot-outs.\n\nA former outfield player in his youth, in addition to his goalkeeping ability, Neuer has also been praised for his excellent ball control and for his accurate distribution of the ball with both his hands and feet; his long throwing range and ability to kick the ball into deep areas with either foot enables him to the play the ball out on the ground or create plays or launch swift counter-attacks from the back. Regarding his technical skills on the ball in comparison to other players in his role, Neuer has stated that he could play in the German third division as a centre-back if so desired. Due to his leadership and vocal presence in goal, he also excels at communicating with his defenders and organising his team's defensive line.{{#tag:ref|See<ref name=\"newrepublic_1\">{{cite

He is regarded by some pundits to be the best modern goalkeeper.\n\nA tall, large, athletic, and physically strong player, Neuer has earned critical acclaim from former players and pundits for his speed, stamina, composure, concentration, consistency, and mentality, as well as for being able to adapt to any given situation on the pitch. He is particularly known for his exceptional reflexes, shot-stopping abilities, speed, and footwork, as well as his ability to read the game, and come out to collect crosses, which enables him to command his area effectively. When the situation demands, he will also often essentially fill the role of a sweeper when opposing players have beaten the offside trap or his team's defensive line, by quickly rushing out of goal to anticipate opponents and clear the ball; his skill, speed and decision-making in this area enables his teams to maintain a high defensive line. Because of his unique playing style, Neuer has been described as a \"sweeper-keeper\", and has been credited with revolutionising the role of the goalkeeper in modern times. He has also been praised by pundits for his positioning between the posts, as well as his ability in one-on-one situations; furthermore, he is effective at stopping penalties, and \u2013 uncommon for a goalkeeper \u2013 has also been known to take and score them in shoot-outs.\n\nA former outfield player in his youth, in addition to his goalkeeping ability, Neuer has also been praised for his excellent ball control and for his accurate distribution of the ball with both his hands and feet; his long throwing range and ability to kick the ball into deep areas with either foot enables him to the play the ball out on the ground or create plays or launch swift counter-attacks from the back. Regarding his technical skills on the ball in comparison to other players in his role, Neuer has stated that he could play in the German third division as a centre-back if so desired. Due to his leadership and vocal presence in goal, he also excels at communicating with his defenders and organising his team's defensive line.{{#tag:ref|See<ref name=\"newrepublic_1\">{{cite

Milan|Milan]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine national team]] as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]]. From February to July 2016, he was an assistant coach of the Ukraine national team, at the time led by [[Mykhailo Fomenko]]. On 15 July 2016, shortly after the nation's elimination from [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Shevchenko was appointed Ukraine's head coach.\n\nShevchenko is ranked as the fifth top goalscorer in all [[UEFA club competition records and statistics|European competitions]] with 67 goals. With a tally of 176 goals scored for Milan, Shevchenko is the second most prolific player in the history of the club, and is also the all-time top scorer of the ''[[Derby della Madonnina]]'' (the [[Local derby|derby]] between Milan and their local rivals [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]) with 14 goals. Furthermore, he is the all-time top scorer for the Ukrainian national team with 48 goals.\n\nShevchenko's career has been highlighted by many awards, the most prestigious of which was the [[Ballon d'Or]] in 2004 (becoming the third Ukrainian, after [[Oleh Blokhin]] and [[Igor Belanov]], to receive it). He won the [[UEFA Champions League]] in 2003 with Milan, and he has also won various league and cup titles in [[Ukrainian Premier League|Ukraine]], [[Serie A|Italy]] and [[Premier League|England]]. He was also an UEFA Champions League runner-up in [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]] and [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008]]. He was named in the [[FIFPro#FIFA FIFPro World XI|FIFA World XI]] for 2005.\n\nIn his illustrious international career, the striker led Ukraine as captain to the quarter-finals in their first ever [[FIFA World Cup]] appearance in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], and also took part at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\nOn 28 July 2012, Shevchenko announced that he was quitting football for politics.<ref name=SForward/> He stood for election to the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] in the October [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election]],<ref name=2012Benjamins/> but [[Ukraine \u2013 Forward!|his party]] failed to win parliamentary representation.<ref name=NYTSVOB8112012>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 November 2012|title=Ukraine\u2019s Ultranationalists Show Surprising Strength at Polls|p=A11}}</ref><ref name=\"Proportional votes\">{{cite web|title=Proportional votes|language=uk|url=http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vnd2012/wp300pt001f01=900.html|publisher=[[Central Electoral Commission of Ukraine]]}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nShevchenko was born in the family of ''[[Praporshchik]]'' Mykola Hryhorovych Shevchenko in 1976. In 1979, his family moved to the newly built neighborhood in Kiev \u2013 [[Obolon Raion|Obolon]] (Minsk District was created in 1975).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lombardytophotels.com/it/sheva7.html|title=Sheva7 - Sito Ufficiale - Sheva7|website=www.lombardytophotels.com|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> In Kiev, Shevchenko went to the 216th City School and in 1986 (aged 9) enrolled into the football section coached by Oleksandr Shpakov. Because of the [[Chernobyl disaster|accident]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], together with his sport group he was evacuated temporarily from the city. At an early age, he also was a competitive [[Boxing|boxer]] in the LLWI Ukrainian junior league,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/441854-sporting-heroes-why-andriy-shevchenko-is-the-brett-favre-of-soccer|title=Sporting Heroes: Why Andriy Shevchenko Is the Brett Favre of Soccer|author=Sakakeeny, Bryan|publisher=Bleacher Report |date=23 August 2010|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> but eventually he elected to move on to [[Association football|football]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Dynamo Kyiv===\nIn 1986, Shevchenko failed a dribbling test for entrance to a specialist sports school in [[Kiev]], but happened to catch the eye of a [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] scout while playing in a youth tournament, and was thus brought to the club. Four years later, Shevchenko was on the Dynamo under-14 team for the [[Ian Rush]] Cup (now the Welsh Super Cup); he finished as the tournament's top scorer and was awarded a pair of Rush's boots as a prize by the then-[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] player.\n\nShevchenko started out his professional career at age 16 when he came on for only 12 minutes as a substitute in a 0\u20132 home loss to the Odessa second team [[FC Chornomorets-2 Odessa|Chornomorets-2 Odessa]] on 5 May 1993. He was a substitute for the last six home games of the [[1992\u201393 Ukrainian First League]] and did not score any goals. The next [[1993\u201394 Ukrainian First League|1993\u201394]] season at the second tier, Shevchenko was the top goal scorer for [[Dynamo-2 Kyiv|Dynamo-2]] with 12 goals, and he made his first appearance in the starting XI. Shevchenko scored his first goal against [[FC Chortkiv|Krystal Chortkiv]] at the home 1\u20131 draw on 7 October 1993. During the same season, he recorded his first hat-trick in a home game against [[FC Artania Ochakiv|Artania Ochakiv]] on 21 November 1993 which Dynamo-2 won 4\u20131. Shevchenko stayed with Dynamo-2 until the end of 1994 and once again he was called up for one game in late 1996.\n\nHe made his Premier League debut for Dynamo senior squad on 8 November 1994 in an away game against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] when he was 18. It was actually his second game for the senior squad overall after he played a home game of National Cup competition on 5 November 1994 against [[FC Skala Stryi|Skala Stryi]]. That year Shevchenko became a national champion and became a cup holder with Dynamo. He won his second league title the next season, scoring 6 goals in 20 matches, and scored a [[hat-trick]] in the first half of a [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League]] road match against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], which Dynamo won 4\u20130. His 19 goals in 23 league matches and six goals in ten [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches (including a hat-trick over two legs against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]) were followed by 28 total goals in all competitions in 1998\u201399. He won the domestic league title with Dynamo in each of his five seasons with the club.\n\n===A.C. Milan===\nIn 1999, Shevchenko joined [[Italy|Italian]] club [[A.C. Milan]] for a then-record transfer fee of $25&nbsp;million. He made his league debut on 28 August 1999 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sheva ritorna dove \u00e8 \"nato\"|url=https://www.gazzetta.it/primi_piani/calcio/2004/pp_1.0.297825652.shtml|work=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]] |date=29 August 1999|accessdate=8 November 2019|language=it}}</ref> Alongside five other players \u2013 [[Michel Platini]], [[John Charles]], [[Gunnar Nordahl]], [[Istvan Nyers]], and [[Ferenc Hirzer]] \u2013 he managed, as a foreign player, to win the [[Serie A]] scoring title in his debut season, finishing with 24 goals in 32 matches. Shevchenko maintained his excellent form into the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301 season]], scoring 24 goals in 34 matches. Shevchenko also managed to score nine goals in 14 matches in the Champions League. Milan, however, failed to get past the second group stage.\n[[File:Andriy Shevchenko - 2004 - AC Milan (2).jpg|thumb|Shevchenko with A.C.

He finished top goalscorer in Serie A in [[2003\u201304 Serie A|2003\u201304]] for the second time in his career, scoring 24 goals in 32 matches as Milan won the ''[[Scudetto]]'' for the first time in five years. He also scored the winning goal in the [[UEFA Super Cup]] victory over [[FC Porto|Porto]], leading to Milan's second trophy of the season. In August 2004, he scored three goals against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] as Milan won the [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. Shevchenko capped off the year by being named the 2004 [[Ballon d'Or|European Player of the Year]], becoming the third Ukrainian player ever to win the award after [[Oleg Blokhin]] and [[Igor Belanov]]. In the same year, Shevchenko was also inducted into the [[FIFA 100]].\n\nHe scored 17 goals in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]] after missing several games with a fractured cheekbone. Shevchenko made Champions League history the following season; on 23 November 2005, he scored all four goals in Milan's 4\u20130 group stage drubbing of [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]], becoming only the fifth player to accomplish this feat; his company includes [[Marco van Basten]], [[Simone Inzaghi]], [[Dado Pr\u0161o]] and [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] (while [[Lionel Messi]] joined that group in the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|2009\u201310 season]] and Robert Lewandowski in [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League|2012\u201313]] and [[2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League|2019\u201320]]), and the only one to have done it in an away game. Milan eventually lost the tournament when Shevchenko missed the crucial penalty in the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], he scored his last Milan goal in the second leg of the quarter-finals as they eliminated [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] after a last-minute comeback in a 3\u20131 victory.<ref>{{cite news|title=AC Milan 3\u20131 Lyon (Aggregate: 3\u20131)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4872268.stm|department=BBC Sport|date=4 April 2006|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> In the semi-finals, Milan lost to eventual winners Barcelona 1\u20130, a match where Shevchenko controversially had a last minute equalizer denied by the referee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4933626.stm|department=BBC Sport|title=Barcelona 0\u20130 AC Milan (agg 1\u20130)|date=26 April 2006|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> Despite this, he still ended up being the top scorer of the whole competition with 9 goals in 12 games.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=6 July 2005|url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/ucl/2005/md13_1_6.pdf|title=Top Scorers \u2013 Final \u2013 Wednesday 17&nbsp;May&nbsp;2006 (after match)|date=17 May 2006|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 February 2006, Shevchenko became Milan's second highest all-time goalscorer, behind Gunnar Nordahl, after netting against [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993|Treviso]].<ref>{{cite web|date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.acmilan.com/NewsDetail_popup.aspx?idNews=24158&progr=14 |title=Sheva 56 Goals off Nordahl |publisher=[[A.C.

His first goal of the season came three days later, equalising for Chelsea in a match against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]], which turned out to be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's last game as manager of Chelsea. Throughout the season, Shevchenko was in and out of the starting lineup because of injuries and the appointment of [[Avram Grant]] following the departure of Mourinho. During the Christmas period, however, Shevchenko enjoyed a good run of form. He scored the first goal in Chelsea's 2\u20130 win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and he was named [[Man of the Match]] in Chelsea's 4\u20134 draw against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], scoring twice (including a stunning 25-yard shot into the top left hand corner) and assisting [[Alex (footballer, born 1982)|Alex]] to make the score 3\u20132 in Chelsea's favour. Shevchenko scored his last goal in the 2007\u201308 season in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. He finished the season with five league goals in 17 games. Shevchenko also played a part in a pre-season match which was against his former team, Milan.\n\n===Loan to Milan===\nShevchenko was not used very often in the starting lineup at Chelsea, and with the appointment of [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], he was deemed surplus to requirements. Due to this, Milan vice-president [[Adriano Galliani]] offered to take Shevchenko back to the [[San Siro]] and Shevchenko was [[loan (sports)|loan]]ed back to his old club for the [[2008\u201309 Serie A|2008\u201309 season]].\n\nShevchenko's second spell was considered unsuccessful, as he failed to score any league goals and only scored 2 goals in 26 appearances, starting only nine of those games. At the end of the season, Milan confirmed that Shevchenko would be returning to Chelsea for the final year of his four-year contract.

With a tally of 176 goals scored for Milan, Shevchenko is the second most prolific player in the history of the club, and is also the all-time top scorer of the ''[[Derby della Madonnina]]'' (the [[Local derby|derby]] between Milan and their local rivals [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]) with 14 goals. Furthermore, he is the all-time top scorer for the Ukrainian national team with 48 goals.\n\nShevchenko's career has been highlighted by many awards, the most prestigious of which was the [[Ballon d'Or]] in 2004 (becoming the third Ukrainian, after [[Oleh Blokhin]] and [[Igor Belanov]], to receive it). He won the [[UEFA Champions League]] in 2003 with Milan, and he has also won various league and cup titles in [[Ukrainian Premier League|Ukraine]], [[Serie A|Italy]] and [[Premier League|England]]. He was also an UEFA Champions League runner-up in [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]] and [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008]]. He was named in the [[FIFPro#FIFA FIFPro World XI|FIFA World XI]] for 2005.\n\nIn his illustrious international career, the striker led Ukraine as captain to the quarter-finals in their first ever [[FIFA World Cup]] appearance in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], and also took part at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\nOn 28 July 2012, Shevchenko announced that he was quitting football for politics.<ref name=SForward/> He stood for election to the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] in the October [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election]],<ref name=2012Benjamins/> but [[Ukraine \u2013 Forward!|his party]] failed to win parliamentary representation.<ref name=NYTSVOB8112012>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 November 2012|title=Ukraine\u2019s Ultranationalists Show Surprising Strength at Polls|p=A11}}</ref><ref name=\"Proportional votes\">{{cite web|title=Proportional votes|language=uk|url=http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vnd2012/wp300pt001f01=900.html|publisher=[[Central Electoral Commission of Ukraine]]}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nShevchenko was born in the family of ''[[Praporshchik]]'' Mykola Hryhorovych Shevchenko in 1976. In 1979, his family moved to the newly built neighborhood in Kiev \u2013 [[Obolon Raion|Obolon]] (Minsk District was created in 1975).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lombardytophotels.com/it/sheva7.html|title=Sheva7 - Sito Ufficiale - Sheva7|website=www.lombardytophotels.com|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> In Kiev, Shevchenko went to the 216th City School and in 1986 (aged 9) enrolled into the football section coached by Oleksandr Shpakov. Because of the [[Chernobyl disaster|accident]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], together with his sport group he was evacuated temporarily from the city. At an early age, he also was a competitive [[Boxing|boxer]] in the LLWI Ukrainian junior league,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/441854-sporting-heroes-why-andriy-shevchenko-is-the-brett-favre-of-soccer|title=Sporting Heroes: Why Andriy Shevchenko Is the Brett Favre of Soccer|author=Sakakeeny, Bryan|publisher=Bleacher Report |date=23 August 2010|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> but eventually he elected to move on to [[Association football|football]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Dynamo Kyiv===\nIn 1986, Shevchenko failed a dribbling test for entrance to a specialist sports school in [[Kiev]], but happened to catch the eye of a [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] scout while playing in a youth tournament, and was thus brought to the club. Four years later, Shevchenko was on the Dynamo under-14 team for the [[Ian Rush]] Cup (now the Welsh Super Cup); he finished as the tournament's top scorer and was awarded a pair of Rush's boots as a prize by the then-[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] player.\n\nShevchenko started out his professional career at age 16 when he came on for only 12 minutes as a substitute in a 0\u20132 home loss to the Odessa second team [[FC Chornomorets-2 Odessa|Chornomorets-2 Odessa]] on 5 May 1993. He was a substitute for the last six home games of the [[1992\u201393 Ukrainian First League]] and did not score any goals. The next [[1993\u201394 Ukrainian First League|1993\u201394]] season at the second tier, Shevchenko was the top goal scorer for [[Dynamo-2 Kyiv|Dynamo-2]] with 12 goals, and he made his first appearance in the starting XI. Shevchenko scored his first goal against [[FC Chortkiv|Krystal Chortkiv]] at the home 1\u20131 draw on 7 October 1993. During the same season, he recorded his first hat-trick in a home game against [[FC Artania Ochakiv|Artania Ochakiv]] on 21 November 1993 which Dynamo-2 won 4\u20131. Shevchenko stayed with Dynamo-2 until the end of 1994 and once again he was called up for one game in late 1996.\n\nHe made his Premier League debut for Dynamo senior squad on 8 November 1994 in an away game against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] when he was 18. It was actually his second game for the senior squad overall after he played a home game of National Cup competition on 5 November 1994 against [[FC Skala Stryi|Skala Stryi]]. That year Shevchenko became a national champion and became a cup holder with Dynamo. He won his second league title the next season, scoring 6 goals in 20 matches, and scored a [[hat-trick]] in the first half of a [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League]] road match against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], which Dynamo won 4\u20130. His 19 goals in 23 league matches and six goals in ten [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches (including a hat-trick over two legs against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]) were followed by 28 total goals in all competitions in 1998\u201399. He won the domestic league title with Dynamo in each of his five seasons with the club.\n\n===A.C. Milan===\nIn 1999, Shevchenko joined [[Italy|Italian]] club [[A.C. Milan]] for a then-record transfer fee of $25&nbsp;million. He made his league debut on 28 August 1999 in a 2\u20132 draw with [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sheva ritorna dove \u00e8 \"nato\"|url=https://www.gazzetta.it/primi_piani/calcio/2004/pp_1.0.297825652.shtml|work=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]] |date=29 August 1999|accessdate=8 November 2019|language=it}}</ref> Alongside five other players \u2013 [[Michel Platini]], [[John Charles]], [[Gunnar Nordahl]], [[Istvan Nyers]], and [[Ferenc Hirzer]] \u2013 he managed, as a foreign player, to win the [[Serie A]] scoring title in his debut season, finishing with 24 goals in 32 matches. Shevchenko maintained his excellent form into the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301 season]], scoring 24 goals in 34 matches. Shevchenko also managed to score nine goals in 14 matches in the Champions League.

He finished top goalscorer in Serie A in [[2003\u201304 Serie A|2003\u201304]] for the second time in his career, scoring 24 goals in 32 matches as Milan won the ''[[Scudetto]]'' for the first time in five years. He also scored the winning goal in the [[UEFA Super Cup]] victory over [[FC Porto|Porto]], leading to Milan's second trophy of the season. In August 2004, he scored three goals against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] as Milan won the [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. Shevchenko capped off the year by being named the 2004 [[Ballon d'Or|European Player of the Year]], becoming the third Ukrainian player ever to win the award after [[Oleg Blokhin]] and [[Igor Belanov]]. In the same year, Shevchenko was also inducted into the [[FIFA 100]].\n\nHe scored 17 goals in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]] after missing several games with a fractured cheekbone. Shevchenko made Champions League history the following season; on 23 November 2005, he scored all four goals in Milan's 4\u20130 group stage drubbing of [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]], becoming only the fifth player to accomplish this feat; his company includes [[Marco van Basten]], [[Simone Inzaghi]], [[Dado Pr\u0161o]] and [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] (while [[Lionel Messi]] joined that group in the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|2009\u201310 season]] and Robert Lewandowski in [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League|2012\u201313]] and [[2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League|2019\u201320]]), and the only one to have done it in an away game. Milan eventually lost the tournament when Shevchenko missed the crucial penalty in the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], he scored his last Milan goal in the second leg of the quarter-finals as they eliminated [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] after a last-minute comeback in a 3\u20131 victory.<ref>{{cite news|title=AC Milan 3\u20131 Lyon (Aggregate: 3\u20131)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4872268.stm|department=BBC Sport|date=4 April 2006|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> In the semi-finals, Milan lost to eventual winners Barcelona 1\u20130, a match where Shevchenko controversially had a last minute equalizer denied by the referee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4933626.stm|department=BBC Sport|title=Barcelona 0\u20130 AC Milan (agg 1\u20130)|date=26 April 2006|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> Despite this, he still ended up being the top scorer of the whole competition with 9 goals in 12 games.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=6 July 2005|url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/ucl/2005/md13_1_6.pdf|title=Top Scorers \u2013 Final \u2013 Wednesday 17&nbsp;May&nbsp;2006 (after match)|date=17 May 2006|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 February 2006, Shevchenko became Milan's second highest all-time goalscorer, behind Gunnar Nordahl, after netting against [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993|Treviso]].<ref>{{cite web|date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.acmilan.com/NewsDetail_popup.aspx?idNews=24158&progr=14 |title=Sheva 56 Goals off Nordahl |publisher=[[A.C.

His first goal of the season came three days later, equalising for Chelsea in a match against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]], which turned out to be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's last game as manager of Chelsea. Throughout the season, Shevchenko was in and out of the starting lineup because of injuries and the appointment of [[Avram Grant]] following the departure of Mourinho. During the Christmas period, however, Shevchenko enjoyed a good run of form. He scored the first goal in Chelsea's 2\u20130 win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and he was named [[Man of the Match]] in Chelsea's 4\u20134 draw against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], scoring twice (including a stunning 25-yard shot into the top left hand corner) and assisting [[Alex (footballer, born 1982)|Alex]] to make the score 3\u20132 in Chelsea's favour. Shevchenko scored his last goal in the 2007\u201308 season in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. He finished the season with five league goals in 17 games. Shevchenko also played a part in a pre-season match which was against his former team, Milan.\n\n===Loan to Milan===\nShevchenko was not used very often in the starting lineup at Chelsea, and with the appointment of [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], he was deemed surplus to requirements. Due to this, Milan vice-president [[Adriano Galliani]] offered to take Shevchenko back to the [[San Siro]] and Shevchenko was [[loan (sports)|loan]]ed back to his old club for the [[2008\u201309 Serie A|2008\u201309 season]].\n\nShevchenko's second spell was considered unsuccessful, as he failed to score any league goals and only scored 2 goals in 26 appearances, starting only nine of those games. At the end of the season, Milan confirmed that Shevchenko would be returning to Chelsea for the final year of his four-year contract.
