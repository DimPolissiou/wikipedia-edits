The details of his life are not well recorded, but it is known that he was a prominent member of the [[Irish Confederacy]] which governed much of Ireland between 1642 and 1649.\n\nHe was a member of a leading Dublin landowning family,  who lost most of their  their possessions after the failure of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. He is now remembered mainly as the author of ''Landgartha'', the first play by an Irish playwright to be produced in an Irish [[theatre]],  and as the father of the poet Eleanor Burnell.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Burnell, Henry |first=John Thomas|last=Gilbert|volume=7}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nHe was the son of Christopher Burnell of [[Balgriffin]], and grandson of [[Henry Burnell]], [[Recorder of Dublin]], who died in 1614.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.223</ref> The [[Burnell family]] had been landowners in [[Dublin]] since the late fourteenth century and were Lords of the Manors of Balgriffin and [[Castleknock]]. They had a long tradition of serving as judges, especially on the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]]; but most of them were stubbornly [[Roman Catholic]] in their religious beliefs and as a result. after the [[Protestant Reformation]] their loyalty to the Crown was often suspect. Little is known of Henry's personal life, except that he was  rich and eligible  enough to marry one of  the Earl of Roscommon's daughters.  He probably inherited his  money from his grandfather, who made a fortune at the [[Irish Bar]].\n\n==Landgartha==\n''Landgartha'', Burnell's only surviving play,<ref>We know of at least one earlier play, now lost.</ref> was produced at the [[Werburgh Street Theatre]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]] 1640. it was the first work by an Irish playwright to be produced on the Irish stage<ref>There is reason to think  that Burnell had tried, but failed to have an earlier play produced in Dublin.</ref> and one of the last productions  before the theatre closed in 1641.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> The text of the play was published in Dublin in 1641 under the title \"Landgartha, a tragi-comedy as it was presented in the new theatre in Dublin with good applause\". The foreword contains evidence that Burnell wrote other plays which have not survived.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> He is thought to have collaborated with the leading English dramatist [[James Shirley]], who was working in Dublin  between 1635 and 1640.   The creation of a distinctive Irish theatre was a personal project of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], and Burnell benefitted from his patronage, despite Strafford's generally poor relations with the [[Anglo-Irish]] gentry.<ref>Wedgwood, C. V.   ''Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford 1593\u20131641: a Revaluation'' Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 pp.226\u20137</ref>\n\n===Summary of the play===\nThe main characters are the heroine Landgartha, a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] \"Amazon\"; Frollo, King of [[Sweden]] and conqueror of [[Norway]]; Reyner, King of [[Denmark]]; Harald, his rival, and Uraca, daughter of Frollo.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\nLandgartha, seeking to free her country from Frollo's tyranny, makes an alliance with Reyner and agrees to marry him. They are victorious in battle and Landgartha kills Frollo herself. She and Reyner marry and have children but her happiness is short-lived. Reyner abandons her and contemplates remarrying Uraca, but when Reyner is threatened with destruction by his rival Harald, Landgartha loyally comes to his aid and defeats Harald. The play ends on a note of reconciliation: it is agreed that the children of Landgartha and Reyner will rule both Denmark and Norway, while Uraca gives up her hope of marrying Reyner. Whether Landgartha and Reyner will live together once more as man and wife is left unclear. Burnell later defended the inconclusive ending, pointing out that his play was neither a comedy or a tragedy, but something in between (as he himself described it,  a \"[[tragicomedy]]\"). This was a  valid point since the tragicomedy was by the seventeen century familiar  to English audiences.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n===Possible political themes===\nBecause of  the troubled period it was written in, and because of  Burnell's later political career, some scholars have looked for political themes in the play.<ref>Pilkington, Lionel \"Theatre and Ireland\"  Red Globe Press 2010 p.28</ref> It has been suggested that Landgartha symbolises the old [[Anglo-Irish]] ruling class to which Burnell belonged, and that Reyner represents the New English aristocracy who, by denying the Anglo-Irish their full share in public life, abandoned them. In the alternative, it can be read as a straightforward  defence of England's colonizing role in Ireland.<ref>Pilkington p.28</ref> A more elaborate parallel suggests that Reyner represents [[King Charles I of England]] and that the plot reflects the political turbulence which led to the [[English Civil War]].\n\n===Reputation as a playwright===\nBurnell refers to the \"good applause\" his play received, and quotes an English writer who called him \"the true heir of [[Ben Jonson]]\", an opinion which few critics either then or later have shared.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> In more recent times, the biographer of his patron the Earl of Strafford gave her frank view that while ''Landgartha'' was an important milestone in the development of the Irish theatre, it has no merits whatsoever as a play.<ref>Wedgwood p.22</ref> That this view was widely shared in Burnell's own time is suggested by his bitter reference to \"the other babblers\"  (i.e. critics) who had apparently ridiculed his play, and whom he in turn regarded with contempt.  His efforts to have an earlier play produced had apparently failed, due in his opinion to the hostility of his critics.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n==Irish Confederacy==\nGiven his status as a leading Catholic landowner of [[the Pale]], with a long family tradition of opposition to the Crown, it was natural that Burnell should be a prominent member of the Irish Confederacy. However little is known of his role in the events of 1641\u20139, except that he lost his estates at Balgriffin and Castleknock almost at once, and that his family never recovered them.  He was living at another family estate at Castlerickard in [[County Meath]] in 1642, and was still alive in 1654.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. Vol. 6 1920 p.21</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children ==\nBurnell married Frances Dillon, third daughter of [[James Dillon, 1st Earl of Roscommon]] and his wife Eleanor Barnewall; she died in 1640.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> They had four sons and five daughters. The most notable of their children was their daughter Eleanor, one of the few Irish women poets of the seventeenth century. Although her surviving body of  work consists only of a  few [[Latin]] verses, she is unique in being the only female Anglo-Irish poet of her time.<ref>Stevenson, Jane  ''Women Latin Poets from Ancient Times to the Eighteenth Century''  [[Oxford University Press]] 2005 p.384</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnell, Henry}}\n[[Category:1590s births]]\n[[Category:1650s deaths]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:Year of death uncertain]]\n\n[[Category:17th-century Irish politicians]]\n[[Category:17th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:Irish male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:People from Castleknock\u200e]]\n[[Category:17th-century male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n\n'''Henry Burnell''' (c. 1590-c. 1654) was an Irish politician, playwright and landowner of the seventeenth century.

At one time, KMOX and KMOV (formerly KMOX-TV) were [[sister station]]s, both owned by CBS.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nKMOX was started in the early 1920s by a group of businessmen who formed a company known as \"The Voice of St. Louis, Inc.\"  According to the station's official website, the '''KMOX''' [[call sign]] was assigned by the Federal Radio Commission (a forerunner of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]). The station's owners wanted KVSL, for \"Voice of St. Louis.\"  The owners also applied for KMO, with MO the abbreviation for Missouri, but those call letters had been in use by another station since 1922, KMO (now [[KKMO]]) in [[Tacoma, Washington]].  KMOX [[sign-on|signed on]] the air on December 24, 1925. The \"X\" was added because the starting date was Christmas Eve, or \"X\"mas Eve.  A local legend states the call letters mean [[Kirkwood, Missouri|'''K'''irkwood, '''M'''issouri]] '''O'''n '''X'''mas.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 1927, the station gave prominent coverage to the [[Charles Lindbergh]] flight across the Atlantic, in his plane, The [[Spirit of St. Louis]]. That same year, KMOX became one of the first 16 stations in the [[CBS Radio News|CBS Radio Network]].<ref>\n''Radio Digest'', September 1927, quoted in: McLeod, Elizabeth (September 20, 2002).

In 1955, [[Robert Hyland|Robert Hyland Jr.]] became KMOX's general manager, a role he held for nearly forty years. It was Hyland who leveraged KMOX's relationship with the Cardinals, signing many lucrative advertising contracts with local businesses.\n\nHyland made the decision in 1960 to eliminate the station's afternoon music programming, the last of the non-talk shows.  That made KMOX the first full-time [[talk radio]] station in the country, helping keep KMOX dominance in the St. Louis [[media market|radio market]] for many decades. On February 29, 1960, [[Jack Buck]] hosted the first \"At Your Service\" program, which included an interview with former [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. That program, like the sports and talk shows that soon followed, pioneered a format for radio featuring news maker interviews, guest appearances, and calls from listeners.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nAfter Hyland died in 1992, Rod Zimmerman was named general manager. He departed in 1998 to manage CBS station [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] Radio in [[Chicago]].\n\nKMOX picked up ''[[Costas Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994.

The station's owners wanted KVSL, for \"Voice of St. Louis.\"  The owners also applied for KMO, with MO the abbreviation for Missouri, but those call letters had been in use by another station since 1922, KMO (now [[KKMO]]) in [[Tacoma, Washington]].  KMOX [[sign-on|signed on]] the air on December 24, 1925. The \"X\" was added because the starting date was Christmas Eve, or \"X\"mas Eve.  A local legend states the call letters mean [[Kirkwood, Missouri|'''K'''irkwood, '''M'''issouri]] '''O'''n '''X'''mas.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 1927, the station gave prominent coverage to the [[Charles Lindbergh]] flight across the Atlantic, in his plane, The [[Spirit of St. Louis]].

Those with a family history of alcoholism are more likely to develop it themselves (Enoch & Goldman, 2001); however, many individuals have developed alcoholism without a family history of the disease.  Since the consumption of alcohol is necessary to develop alcoholism, the availability of and attitudes towards alcohol in an individual's environment affect their likelihood of developing the disease.

However, this came decades after Rush and Trotter wrote their works, and some historians argue that the idea that habitual drinking was a diseased state emerged earlier.<ref>Along with Levine, see Roy Porter (\"Drinking Man's Disease: the 'Pre-History' of Alcoholism in Georgian Britain,\" ''British Journal of Addiction'' 80 (1985): 385-96) who places the idea to emerge with Trotter, Jessica Warner [\"'Resolved to Drink No More': Addiction as a preindustrial construct\" ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'' 55 (1994): 685-91] who uses a narrow reading of 17th century sermons to place it in the 1600s, Peter Ferentzy [\"From Sin to Disease: Differences and similarities between past and current conceptions on 'chronic drunkenness'\" ''Contemporary Drug Problems'' 28 (2001): 362-90] who successfully challenges Warner's argument by showing that the term \"disease\" was applied to many conditions that had little to do with physical debility, and James Nicholls [\"Vinum Britannicum: The 'Drink Question' in Early Modern England\" ''Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An interdisciplinary Journal'' 22 (2008): 6-25] who draws it together and argues that the idea emerged at different times in different places.</ref>\n\nGiven this controversy, the best one can say is that the idea that habitual alcohol drinking was a disease had become more acceptable by the middle of the nineteenth century, although many writers still argued it was a vice, a sin, and not the purview of medicine but of religion.<ref>See, for example, books with such telling titles as John Edwards Todd, ''Drunkenness, a Vice--not a Disease'' (1882).</ref>\n\nBetween 1980 and 1991, medical organizations, including the AMA, worked together to establish policies regarding their positions on the disease theory. These policies were developed in 1987 in part because third-party reimbursement for treatment was difficult or impossible unless alcoholism were categorized as a disease. The policies of the AMA, formed through consensus of the federation of state and specialty medical societies within their House of Delegates, state, in part: <blockquote>\"The AMA endorses the proposition that drug dependencies, including alcoholism, are diseases and that their treatment is a legitimate part of medical practice.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1991, the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections.\n\n== Controlled drinking ==\nThe disease theory is often interpreted as implying that problem drinkers are incapable of returning to 'normal' problem free drinking, and therefore that treatment should focus on total abstinence. Some critics have used [http://findings.org.uk/count/downloads/download.php?file=cont_drink.hot evidence of controlled drinking] in formerly dependent drinkers to dispute the disease theory of alcoholism.\n\nThe first major empirical challenge to this interpretation of the disease theory followed a 1962 study by Dr. D.

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying \u0394FosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker. If \u0394FosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure (and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance), then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker (Figure 2). Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&nbsp;...<br /><br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cellular basis\">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin.

The report highlights the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms of action of different types of psychoactive substances, and explains how the use of these substances can lead to the development of dependence syndrome.\" The report states that \"dependence has not previously been recognized as a disorder of the brain, in the same way that psychiatric and mental illnesses were not previously viewed as being a result of a disorder of the brain. However, with recent advances in neuroscience, it is clear that dependence is as much a disorder of the brain as any other neurological or psychiatric illness.\"\n\nThe [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] and the [[American Medical Association]] both maintain extensive policy regarding alcoholism.

It funds approximately 90 percent of all such research in the United States. The official NIAAA position is that \"alcoholism is a disease. The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water. An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family, health, or legal problems.

These policies were developed in 1987 in part because third-party reimbursement for treatment was difficult or impossible unless alcoholism were categorized as a disease. The policies of the AMA, formed through consensus of the federation of state and specialty medical societies within their House of Delegates, state, in part: <blockquote>\"The AMA endorses the proposition that drug dependencies, including alcoholism, are diseases and that their treatment is a legitimate part of medical practice.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1991, the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections.\n\n== Controlled drinking ==\nThe disease theory is often interpreted as implying that problem drinkers are incapable of returning to 'normal' problem free drinking, and therefore that treatment should focus on total abstinence.

It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker. If \u0394FosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure (and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance), then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker (Figure 2). Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&nbsp;...<br /><br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cellular basis\">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin.

The [[American Hospital Association]], the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], and the [[American College of Physicians]] classify \"alcoholism\" as a [[disease]].\n\nIn the US, the [[National Institutes of Health]] has a specific institute, the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA), concerned with the support and conduct of biomedical and behavioral research on the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. It funds approximately 90 percent of all such research in the United States. The official NIAAA position is that \"alcoholism is a disease. The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water. An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family, health, or legal problems. Like many other diseases, alcoholism is chronic, meaning that it lasts a person's lifetime; it usually follows a predictable course; and it has symptoms. The risk for developing alcoholism is influenced both by a person's genes and by his or her lifestyle.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/FAQs/General-English/default.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509165736/http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/FAQs/General-English/default.htm|deadurl=y|title=FAQs for the General Public<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nCertain medications including opioid antagonists such as [[naltrexone]] have been shown to be effective in the treatment of alcoholism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=R\u00f6sner|first=Susanne|last2=Hackl-Herrwerth|first2=Andrea|last3=Leucht|first3=Stefan|last4=Vecchi|first4=Simona|last5=Srisurapanont|first5=Manit|last6=Soyka|first6=Michael|date=2010-12-08|title=Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=12|pages=CD001867|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001867.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=21154349|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\nSome physicians, scientists and others have rejected the disease theory of alcoholism on logical, empirical and other grounds.<ref>Heavy Drinking, Fingarette, Herbert, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-06754-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robinroom.net|title=Robin Room|work=robinroom.net}}</ref><ref>Peele, S.

A disease cannot be cured by force of will; therefore, adding the medical label transfers the responsibility from the abuser to caregivers. Inevitably the abusers become unwilling victims, and just as inevitably they take on that role.  They argue that the disease theory of alcoholism exists only to benefit the professionals' and governmental agencies responsible for providing recovery services, and the disease model has not offered a solution for those attempting to stop abusive alcohol and drug use.<ref name=\"baldwinresearch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baldwinresearch.com/alcoholism.cfm |title=Alcoholism: A disease of speculation |publisher=Baldwinresearch.com |date=2002-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref>\n\nThese critics hold that by removing some of the stigma and personal responsibility the disease concept actually increases alcoholism and drug abuse and thus the need for treatment.<ref name=\"baldwinresearch\" />  This is somewhat supported by a study which found that a greater belief in the disease theory of alcoholism and higher commitment to total abstinence to be factors correlated with increased likelihood that an alcoholic would have a full-blown relapse (substantial continued use) following an initial lapse (single use).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller WR, Westerberg VS, Harris RJ, Tonigan JS  | title = What predicts relapse?
