He achieved national recognition for his studies of individual nineteenth-century American authors.\n\nAfter teaching at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] for 38 years, he was forced into retirement in 1960 after pleading guilty to charges stemming from the possession of pictures of semi-nude males that the law deemed pornographic.<ref group=lower-alpha>In 2006, ''The New York Times'' described the objectionable materials as \"'beefcake' magazines and pictures of men \u2014 illegal pornography then, but much of it like today's Calvin Klein underwear ads.\" <br>\u2022 McFadden, ''New York Times'', February 20, 2006. \n</ref><ref name=mcfadden>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/20/obituaries/20dorius.html Robert D.

He studied English Literature at [[Harvard]], graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1921. His writing career began when [[Van Wyck Brooks]], the Harvard teacher he most admired, invited him to write for ''[[The Freeman#Earlier publications called The Freeman|The Freeman]]'' while he was still an undergraduate. After a short period teaching at the high school level, Arvin joined the English faculty at [[Smith College]] and, though he never earned a doctorate, won a tenured position. One of his students was [[Sylvia Plath]], the poet and novelist.\n\nHe taught at Smith College for 38 years and was Mary Augusta Jordan Professor of English during the year before his retirement in 1961. He rarely left Northampton for long nor travelled far. He visited Europe only once in the summer of 1929 or 1930. He spent a year's leave of absence in the mid-1920s as the editor of ''Living Age'', a weekly compendium of articles from British and American periodicals.<ref>Daniel Aaron and Sylvan Schendler, eds., ''American Pantheon: Essays'' (NY: Delacorte Press 1966), xxii, 251</ref>\n\nArvin often wrote about political issues and took public political positions. For example, in 1936, on the day when Harvard celebrated its 300th anniversary, he joined a group of 28 Harvard graduates in an attack on retired Harvard president [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] for his role years earlier on an advisory Committee to Massachusetts Governor [[Alvan T. Fuller]] that found that [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] had received a fair trial. Among his co-signors were editor [[Malcolm Cowley]] and author [[John Dos Passos]].<ref>''New York Times'': [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10F73F58107A93CBA81782D85F428385F9& \"Assail Dr. Lowell on Sacco Decision,\" Sept. 19, 1936], accessed Dec. 28, 2009; see also Barry Werth, ''The Scarlet Professor: Newton Arvin: A Literary Life Shattered by Scandal'' (NY: Doubleday, 2001), 54-6</ref>\n\nHis first book-length publication, ''Hawthorne'', appeared in 1929.

There in the summer of 1946 he met and began a two-year affair with the young [[Truman Capote]]. Newton addressed him as \"Precious Spooky\" in amorous letters that went on to discuss literary matters.<ref name=mcgrath/> In 1948 Capote dedicated his novel ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' to Arvin, and he later described how much he learned from Arvin saying: \"Newton was my Harvard\".<ref>Werth, ''Scarlet Professor'', 3, 61-66, 108-13</ref>\n\nArvin came to national attention with the publication in 1950 of ''Herman Melville'', a critical biography of the novelist.

He is concerned with the man's evolution in a way that leaves an extraordinary impression of concentrated sympathetic awareness.</blockquote>\n\nHe particularly valued how Arvin's integration of the details of Melville's biography&ndash;his Calvinist background, the mental breakdown of the father he so loved, his mother's transformation by his father's failure and early death&ndash;exposes Melville's \"grandeur and weakness.\"<ref name=kazin>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1950/05/07/archives/the-burning-human-values-in-melville-herman-melville.html Alfred Kazin, \"The Burning Human Values in Melville,\" May 7, 1950], accessed January 7, 2010</ref>\n\nArvin was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|National institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1952.<ref>American Academy of Arts and Letters: [http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php Deceased Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726004624/http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php |date=2011-07-26 }}, accessed January 5, 2010</ref> [[Edmund Wilson]] wrote that of all critics of American literature only Arvin and his teacher Van Wyck Brooks \"can themselves be called first-rate writers.\"<ref name=demott>''The New York Review of Books'': Benjamin DeMott, \"The Sad Tale of Newton Arvin\", November 29, 2001</ref>\n\nThough Arvin's ''Whitman'' reflected some of his leftist sympathies in the 1930s, he responded to the Cold War with renewed cultural patriotism. In a 1952 essay titled \"Our Country and Our Culture\" in ''Partisan Review'' he wrote:<ref>Robert S. Ward, \"Review of ''American Pantheon'',\" in ''New England Quarterly'', v. 39 (1966), 413-5</ref>\n\n:That period, at any rate is over, and the habit of rejection, of repudiation, of mere exacerbated alienation, has ceased to seem relevant or defensible&ndash;inevitably, since the culture we profoundly cherish is now disastrously threatened from without, and the truer this becomes, the intenser becomes the awareness of our necessary identification with it.\n\n==Scandal==\nIn 1960, the office of the [[United States Postmaster General]] (then [[Arthur Ellsworth Summerfield]]) initiated a campaign against the distribution and possession of lewd materials, including soft-core homosexually-themed pictures. At the same time, local officials in Northampton were engaged in an anti-homosexual crusade. (See [[Lavender scare]].) On September 2, officers of the [[Massachusetts State Police]] arrested Arvin on pornography-related charges. The police charged Arvin with \"being a lewd person\" and charged both him and a Smith faculty colleague, Edward Spofford, with \"possession of obscene photographs.\" Police said Arvin led them to Spofford and that both implicated other male faculty members. Arvin, they said, admitted \"displaying the photographs at his apartment and swapping them with others.\"<ref>''New York Times'': [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10FC345A1A7A93C6A91782D85F448685F9& \"2 Smith Teachers Held in Vice Case,\" September 4, 1960], accessed January 5, 2010</ref> Further reports specified that the pictures were of males, later revealed as issues of ''Grecian Guild Pictorial'' and ''Trim: Young America's Favorite Physique Publication'' containing pictures of semi-nude men.<ref name=mcgrath>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/arts/design/24yadd.html Charles McGrath, \"Shadows of Yaddo,\" October 23, 2008], accessed January 5, 2010</ref><ref name=usps>For the finding of the General Counsel's Office of the Post Office Department with respect to these publications, see United States Postal Service: [http://www.usps.com/judicial/1960deci/1-246.htm \"Departmental Decision,\" April 28, 1960], accessed January 6, 2010</ref>\n\nArvin eventually pleaded guilty, paid fines of $1200, and was given a one-year suspended sentence and placed on probation.<ref name=demott/>\n\nSmith College suspended Arvin from teaching, but kept him on half salary until retirement age.

He is concerned with the man's evolution in a way that leaves an extraordinary impression of concentrated sympathetic awareness.</blockquote>\n\nHe particularly valued how Arvin's integration of the details of Melville's biography&ndash;his Calvinist background, the mental breakdown of the father he so loved, his mother's transformation by his father's failure and early death&ndash;exposes Melville's \"grandeur and weakness.\"<ref name=kazin>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1950/05/07/archives/the-burning-human-values-in-melville-herman-melville.html Alfred Kazin, \"The Burning Human Values in Melville,\" May 7, 1950], accessed January 7, 2010</ref>\n\nArvin was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|National institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1952.<ref>American Academy of Arts and Letters: [http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php Deceased Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726004624/http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php |date=2011-07-26 }}, accessed January 5, 2010</ref> [[Edmund Wilson]] wrote that of all critics of American literature only Arvin and his teacher Van Wyck Brooks \"can themselves be called first-rate writers.\"<ref name=demott>''The New York Review of Books'': Benjamin DeMott, \"The Sad Tale of Newton Arvin\", November 29, 2001</ref>\n\nThough Arvin's ''Whitman'' reflected some of his leftist sympathies in the 1930s, he responded to the Cold War with renewed cultural patriotism. In a 1952 essay titled \"Our Country and Our Culture\" in ''Partisan Review'' he wrote:<ref>Robert S.

At the same time, local officials in Northampton were engaged in an anti-homosexual crusade. (See [[Lavender scare]].) On September 2, officers of the [[Massachusetts State Police]] arrested Arvin on pornography-related charges. The police charged Arvin with \"being a lewd person\" and charged both him and a Smith faculty colleague, Edward Spofford, with \"possession of obscene photographs.\" Police said Arvin led them to Spofford and that both implicated other male faculty members.

The city administers one village, G\u0103z\u0103rie.\n\n==History==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1930 |6616\n|1948 |5868\n|1956 |12934\n|1966 |18714\n|1977 |20862\n|1992 |25560\n|2002 |25532\n|2011 |21787\n}}\n\nFirst mentioned in 1467, the locality was listed among the [[Moldavia]]n villages on the ''Bawer map'' of 1783. A ''[[t\u00e2rg]]'' was first attested in this location in 1832; it had 188 houses and 588 inhabitants.\n\nIn 1921, Moine\u0219ti was designated a ''comun\u0103 urban\u0103'' (\"urban commune\"), with its own coat of arms and local administration, but a step short of being considered a city. It became a [[Municipalities of Romania|municipality]] in 2002. The 2011 census counted 20,855 inhabitants.\n\n==Economy==\nThe area around Moine\u0219ti is rich in natural resources such as [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[salt]] and [[timber]]. Between the years 1950s and 1980s Moine\u0219ti experienced a steady economic growth thanks to the large petroleum extracting industry. After 1990, however, following the nationwide industry [[privatization]] Moine\u0219ti's economy changed dramatically, at some points reaching level of [[unemployment]] of over 20%.\n\n==Dada monument==\nIn 1896, honoring [[Tristan Tzara]], the founder of [[Dadaism]] who was born in Moine\u0219ti, a monument was built on the side of the road that enters the town. It was created from concrete and steel by the German-Romanian sculptor [[Ingo Glass]] in the true [[Dada]] spirit and it is 25 meters long, 2.6 meters wide and 10 meters high and it weighs 120 tons.\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourist attractions in Moine\u0219ti include: B\u0103i Park (with healing mineral waters), Pine Tree Park, Ghindaru Hill (where archaeologists discovered artefacts of the pre-Cucuteni culture, over 5,000 years old), the Dada Monument (dedicated to Tristan Tzara), Cet\u0103\u021buia (Dacian fortified city archaeologically certified) and the Jewish Cemetery (where the oldest tombstone with recognisable text dates back to 1692).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismmoinesti.ro/|title=Moinesti Tourism|last=|first=|date=26 April 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== People==\n* [[Hedi Enghelberg]], writer\n* [[Nestor Rate\u0219]], journalist, Head of Romanian Desk of Radio Free Europe 1989, 1994-2002<ref>{{cite web|title=Nestor Ratesh|url=http://www.europalibera.org/author/21410.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Moses Rosen]], Chief [[Rabbi]] of Romania from 1948 to 1994\n* [[Moshe David Shuv]], born Mo\u0219e David Iancovici, early Zionist and founder of [[Rosh Pinna]]\n* [[Tristan Tzara]], writer and founder of [[Dada]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Moine\u0219ti}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Bac\u0103u County}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moinesti}}\n[[Category:Moine\u0219ti|*]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Bac\u0103u County]]\n[[Category:Jewish communities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Cities in Romania]]\n\n\n{{Bac\u0103u-geo-stub}}\n{{Jewish-hist-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moine%C8%99ti"}

At first, the Madurai Saurashtra Sabha was formed in the year 1895 and it was formally registered in the year 1900 with many objectives. The formation of this Sabha was the first step towards [[social mobilization]]. The Sabha's administration is carried out by elected Councillors and office bearers. It has its own rules and regulations regarding holding of elections, rights and duties of office bearers and celebration of social functions. The election to the Sabha is held once in three years. The [[social]] life of the Saurashtrians is controlled almost wholly by the Saurashtra Sabha. This organisation is a committee of the leading men of the community, which manages and controls all the schools and public institutions, the [[temple]] and its worship, and all political, [[Religion|religious]], and social questions among the Saurashtrians.\n\nThe Saurashtra Madhya (central) Sabha, which has its headquarters at [[Madurai]] now remains as the cultural center for all the Saurashtrians living in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Many well-to-do [[Merchant|merchants]] and [[philanthropists]] of the community have contributed substantially to the growth of these institutions.

This resulted in the Aboriginal population of the region declining by 90% from 1898 levels. In the 1930s many of the surviving Aborigines were moved to the Old Lockhart Mission. Those Aborigines who remained in their territory were from the Morrobalama, Lamalama, and Umbindhamu tribes, and lived there until 1961. During that time, most of the Aborigines worked on local cattle stations or were killed by mounted police. In 1961 the Aborigines who had remained on their lands were moved to the tip of the Cape York Peninsula. By the 1990s, the total number of speakers was reduced to four elderly speakers.

The original proposal was the centrepiece of a larger scheme to create a \u00a3300 million sports village on a {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} site.<ref>''[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=16815565%26siteid=50002-name_page.html  Blues chief reveals regeneration dream]'' \u2013 Birmingham Mail, 15 March 2006 (Accessed 10 March 2007)</ref>\n\nThe proposal was for a 55,000-seat arena was to be part-funded by [[Las Vegas Sands]], but the hopes of securing a licence for a [[super casino]] on site were rejected and Birmingham City F.C. were then unable to proceed with the plans for the stadium.<ref>[http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-citys-new-owners-open-123632 Birmingham City's new owners open talks over new stadium]</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe proposed stadium and sports village was to be located on a site currently occupied by [[Birmingham Wheels]] in the 'Wheels Adventure Park' of the [[Saltley]] area of Birmingham. The site is bounded by several active railway lines, a canal and numerous major roads.<ref>[http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/000DF51B-5BCE-135F-A6F10C01AC1BF814.jpg Satellite image of the location with phase boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027144037/http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/000DF51B-5BCE-135F-A6F10C01AC1BF814.jpg |date=27 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn relation to other areas, the site is near the St Andrews neighbourhood of [[Bordesley Green]] which is home to the [[St Andrews (stadium)|St Andrews Stadium]]. The stadium is to the southwest of the development. [[Small Heath, Birmingham|Small Heath]] is to the south whilst [[Nechells]] is located to the west and [[Aston]] to the north. It is 1.1 miles (1.77 kilometres) from [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street station]] in the city centre.\n\nPhase 1 covers the Wheels Adventure Park and would have included the stadium within it. In terms of area, it was almost equal to that of Phase 2. Phase 1 would require the least amount of demolition as the land is largely untouched by development. The northern boundary of Phase 1 was determined by the [[Rugby-Birmingham-Stafford Line]] which serves the area via the nearby [[Adderley Park railway station]]. The western boundary was determined by another railway line and partially by a canal whilst the eastern boundary is determined by a road. Phase 2, to the south, is the separated from Phase 1 via the boundary of land owned by Birmingham Wheels. Within the phase would be a soccer dome, indoor arena, basketball courts, health and fitness centre, Olympic-sized swimming pool and an entertainment complex, which would be attached to the stadium.\n\nPhase 2 was the most southerly phase of the development and is a predominantly industrial site. Occupied by many workshops and warehouses, it required some of the most demolition needed for the project. This part of the sports village would have been home to community football pitches, tennis courts, residences, a hotel and large retail space. The southern and eastern boundaries are determined via roads and the small western boundary, via a railway line.\n\nPhase 3 was the smallest phase in terms of area and would have been used for the construction of residential properties and park land. The site is occupied by warehouses and workshops. It is separated through the centre via a road creating two thin strips of land which are bounded to the east by a canal.\n\nThe entire {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} site is contaminated as a result of heavy industry in the past and many of the buildings are derelict.<ref>[http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/paper.jpg  Scan of newspaper article reporting the bid for the casino] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027055549/http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/paper.jpg |date=27 October 2007 }}</ref> It is believed the cost of decontaminating the land would be at \u00a31 million an acre.<ref name=\"18 May\">''[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=19125215%26siteid=50002-name_page.html New super stadium a step closer]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604053259/http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D19125215%26siteid%3D50002-name_page.html |date=4 June 2011 }}'' \u2013 Birmingham Mail, 18 May 2007 (Accessed 29 May 2007)</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe new stadium would have been a multi-purpose 55,000-seater stadium<ref>[http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/cob%20stadium.jpg Design specifications for the stadium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027143837/http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/cob%20stadium.jpg |date=27 October 2007 }}</ref> which can host [[cricket]], [[football (soccer)|football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and concerts.

There had been mixed views over the submission of the bid for permission to build the casino on the site and it faced competition from other locations such as [[Blackpool]], [[Manchester]] and [[The O2 (London)|The O2]] in London with Manchester being the city selected to construct the supercasino.\n\nThe stadium would have been one of the most expensive developments in the city at an estimated \u00a3300 million.

The site is bounded by several active railway lines, a canal and numerous major roads.<ref>[http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/000DF51B-5BCE-135F-A6F10C01AC1BF814.jpg Satellite image of the location with phase boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027144037/http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/000DF51B-5BCE-135F-A6F10C01AC1BF814.jpg |date=27 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn relation to other areas, the site is near the St Andrews neighbourhood of [[Bordesley Green]] which is home to the [[St Andrews (stadium)|St Andrews Stadium]]. The stadium is to the southwest of the development. [[Small Heath, Birmingham|Small Heath]] is to the south whilst [[Nechells]] is located to the west and [[Aston]] to the north. It is 1.1 miles (1.77 kilometres) from [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street station]] in the city centre.\n\nPhase 1 covers the Wheels Adventure Park and would have included the stadium within it. In terms of area, it was almost equal to that of Phase 2. Phase 1 would require the least amount of demolition as the land is largely untouched by development. The northern boundary of Phase 1 was determined by the [[Rugby-Birmingham-Stafford Line]] which serves the area via the nearby [[Adderley Park railway station]]. The western boundary was determined by another railway line and partially by a canal whilst the eastern boundary is determined by a road. Phase 2, to the south, is the separated from Phase 1 via the boundary of land owned by Birmingham Wheels. Within the phase would be a soccer dome, indoor arena, basketball courts, health and fitness centre, Olympic-sized swimming pool and an entertainment complex, which would be attached to the stadium.\n\nPhase 2 was the most southerly phase of the development and is a predominantly industrial site. Occupied by many workshops and warehouses, it required some of the most demolition needed for the project. This part of the sports village would have been home to community football pitches, tennis courts, residences, a hotel and large retail space. The southern and eastern boundaries are determined via roads and the small western boundary, via a railway line.\n\nPhase 3 was the smallest phase in terms of area and would have been used for the construction of residential properties and park land. The site is occupied by warehouses and workshops. It is separated through the centre via a road creating two thin strips of land which are bounded to the east by a canal.\n\nThe entire {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} site is contaminated as a result of heavy industry in the past and many of the buildings are derelict.<ref>[http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/paper.jpg  Scan of newspaper article reporting the bid for the casino] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027055549/http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/paper.jpg |date=27 October 2007 }}</ref> It is believed the cost of decontaminating the land would be at \u00a31 million an acre.<ref name=\"18 May\">''[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=19125215%26siteid=50002-name_page.html New super stadium a step closer]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604053259/http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D19125215%26siteid%3D50002-name_page.html |date=4 June 2011 }}'' - Birmingham Mail, 18 May 2007 (Accessed 29 May 2007)</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe new stadium would have been a multi-purpose 55,000-seater stadium<ref>[http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/cob%20stadium.jpg Design specifications for the stadium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027143837/http://www.digitalbrain.com/knhadriang98/web/City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium/cob%20stadium.jpg |date=27 October 2007 }}</ref> which can host [[cricket]], [[football (soccer)|football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and concerts.

It would have been the largest football stadium in the city.\n\nThe sports village proposed for the city which will surround the stadium is similar to the Olympic Village proposed for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], however on a smaller scale.\n\nThe [[supercasino]] which was proposed for the site along with the stadium was to become the first in the country. There had been mixed views over the submission of the bid for permission to build the casino on the site and it faced competition from other locations such as [[Blackpool]], [[Manchester]] and [[The O2 (London)|The O2]] in London with Manchester being the city selected to construct the supercasino.\n\nThe stadium would have been one of the most expensive developments in the city at an estimated \u00a3300 million. This is rivalled by the [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bullring Shopping Centre]], [[Snowhill]], [[Gateway Plus]], [[Arena Central]] and [[Martineau Galleries]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of English football stadiums by capacity]]\n* [[List of cricket grounds in England and Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Birmingham City F.C.}}\n{{Warwickshire CCC}}\n{{Proposed British Football Stadiums}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:City Of Birmingham Stadium}}\n[[Category:Birmingham City F.C.]]\n[[Category:Proposed football venues in England]]\n[[Category:Proposed stadiums in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Defunct cricket grounds in England|Grounds]]\n[[Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Cricket in Warwickshire]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY (audit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Birmingham_Stadium"}

In common parlance, as in \"having shellfish for dinner\", it can refer to anything from clams and oysters to lobster and shrimp. For regulatory purposes it is often narrowly defined as filter-feeding [[molluscs]] such as clams, mussels, and oyster to the exclusion of [[crustacean]]s and all else.<ref>[http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish/harvesting_notices/index.asp Maryland Shellfish Harvesting Areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011102911/http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish/harvesting_notices/index.asp |date=11 October 2006 }}, Maryland Department of the Environment</ref>\n\nAlthough the term is primarily applied to [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species, edible [[freshwater]] invertebrates such as [[crayfish]] and river [[mussels]] are also sometimes grouped under the umbrella term \"shellfish\".\n\nAlthough their shells may differ, all shellfish are invertebrates.  As non-mammalian animals that spend their entire lives in water they are \"fish\" in an informal sense; however, the term \u201dfinfish\u201d is sometimes used to distinguish [[fish]], animals defined by having [[vertebrate|vertebrae]], from shellfish in modern terminology.\n\nThe word \"shellfish\" is both singular and plural; the rarely used \"shellfishes\" is sometimes employed to distinguish among various types of shellfish.<ref>{{cite book | title=Fishermen: A Community living from the Sea | page=119 | last1=Festing | first1=Sally | year=1999 | location=Stamford | publisher=Shaun Tyas | isbn=978-1-900289-22-1 | edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n==Shellfish in various cuisines==\nArchaeological finds have shown that humans have been making use of shellfish as a food item for hundreds of thousands of years. In the present, shellfish dishes are a feature of almost all the [[cuisine]]s of the world,  providing an important source of protein in many cuisines around the world, especially in the countries with coastal areas.\n\n[[File:Sakura ebi.jpg|thumb|180px|Sakura ebi ('cherry shrimp')]]\n\n===In Japan===\nIn the [[Japanese cuisine]], chefs often use shellfish and their [[roe]] in different dishes. [[Sushi]] (vinegared rice, topped with other ingredients, including shellfish, fish, meat and vegetables) features both raw and cooked shellfish.  [[Sashimi]] primarily consists of very fresh raw seafood, sliced into thin pieces. Both sushi and sashimi are served with soy sauce and [[wasabi]] paste (a Japanese [[horseradish]] root, a spice with extremely strong, hot flavor), thinly sliced pickled ginger root, and a simple garnish such as [[Perilla|shiso]] (a kitchen herb, member of the [[Mentha|mint]] family) or finely shredded daikon radish, or both.\n\n===In the United States===\n[[File:Boiled Maine Lobster.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Boiled [[American lobster|Maine lobster]]]]\n[[Lobster]] in particular is a great delicacy in the [[United States]], where families in the Northeast region make them into the centerpiece of a [[New England clam bake|clam bake]], usually for special occasions. Lobsters are eaten on much of the East Coast; the [[American lobster]] ranges from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] down to about the [[Carolinas]], but is most often associated with [[Maine]]. A typical meal involves boiling the lobster with some slight seasoning and then serving it with drawn butter, [[baked potato]], and [[corn on the cob]].\n\n[[Clam digging|Clamming]] is done both commercially and recreationally along the Northeast coastline of the US. Various type of clams are incorporated into the [[cuisine of New England]]. The soft-shelled clam is eaten either [[Fried clam|fried]] or [[New England Clam Boil|steamed]] (and then called \"[[soft-shell Clam|steamers]]\"). Many types of clams can be used for [[clam chowder]], but the [[quahog]], a hard shelled clam also known as a chowder clam, is often used because the long cooking time softens its tougher meat.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Maryland]] region has generally been associated more with crabs, but in recent years the area has been trying to reduce its catch of [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs]], as wild populations have been depleted.  This has not, however, stemmed the demand: Maryland-style [[crabcake]]s are still a well known treat in crabhouses all over the bay, though the catch now comes from points farther south.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[File:Scallop sandwich (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Scallop]] sandwich served in San Diego]]\nIn the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], and particularly the gulf states, [[shrimping]] is an important industry. Copious amounts of shrimp are harvested each year in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to satisfy a national demand for shrimp. Locally, prawns and shrimp are often deep fried; in the Cajun and Creole kitchens of [[Louisiana]], shrimp and prawns are a common addition to traditional recipes like [[jambalaya]] and certain stews. [[Crawfish]] are a well known and much eaten delicacy there, often boiled in huge pots and heavily spiced.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn many major cities with active fishing ports, raw oyster bars are also a feature of shellfish consumption.

In common parlance, as in \"having shellfish for dinner\", it can refer to anything from clams and oysters to lobster and shrimp. For regulatory purposes it is often narrowly defined as filter-feeding [[molluscs]] such as clams, mussels, and oyster to the exclusion of [[crustacean]]s and all else.<ref>[http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish/harvesting_notices/index.asp Maryland Shellfish Harvesting Areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011102911/http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish/harvesting_notices/index.asp |date=11 October 2006 }}, Maryland Department of the Environment</ref>\n\nAlthough the term is primarily applied to [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species, edible [[freshwater]] invertebrates such as [[crayfish]] and river [[mussels]] are also sometimes grouped under the umbrella term \"shellfish\".\n\nAlthough their shells may differ, all shellfish are invertebrates.  As non-mammalian animals that spend their entire lives in water they are \"fish\" in an informal sense; however, the term \u201dfinfish\u201d is sometimes used to distinguish [[fish]], animals defined by having [[vertebrate|vertebrae]], from shellfish in modern terminology.\n\nThe word \"shellfish\" is both singular and plural; the rarely used \"shellfishes\" is sometimes employed to distinguish among various types of shellfish.<ref>{{cite book | title=Fishermen: A Community living from the Sea | page=119 | last1=Festing | first1=Sally | year=1999 | location=Stamford | publisher=Shaun Tyas | isbn=978-1-900289-22-1 | edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n==Shellfish in various cuisines==\nArchaeological finds have shown that humans have been making use of shellfish as a food item for hundreds of thousands of years. In the present, shellfish dishes are a feature of almost all the [[cuisine]]s of the world,  providing an important source of protein in many cuisines around the world, especially in the countries with coastal areas.\n\n[[File:Sakura ebi.jpg|thumb|180px|Sakura ebi ('cherry shrimp')]]\n\n===In Japan===\nIn the [[Japanese cuisine]], chefs often use shellfish and their [[roe]] in different dishes. [[Sushi]] (vinegared rice, topped with other ingredients, including shellfish, fish, meat and vegetables) features both raw and cooked shellfish.  [[Sashimi]] primarily consists of very fresh raw seafood, sliced into thin pieces. Both sushi and sashimi are served with soy sauce and [[wasabi]] paste (a Japanese [[horseradish]] root, a spice with extremely strong, hot flavor), thinly sliced pickled ginger root, and a simple garnish such as [[Perilla|shiso]] (a kitchen herb, member of the [[Mentha|mint]] family) or finely shredded daikon radish, or both.\n\n===In the United States===\n[[File:Boiled Maine Lobster.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Boiled [[American lobster|Maine lobster]]]]\n[[Lobster]] in particular is a great delicacy in the [[United States]], where families in the Northeast region make them into the centerpiece of a [[New England clam bake|clam bake]], usually for special occasions. Lobsters are eaten on much of the East Coast; the [[American lobster]] ranges from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] down to about the [[Carolinas]], but is most often associated with [[Maine]]. A typical meal involves boiling the lobster with some slight seasoning and then serving it with drawn butter, [[baked potato]], and [[corn on the cob]].\n\n[[Clam digging|Clamming]] is done both commercially and recreationally along the Northeast coastline of the US. Various type of clams are incorporated into the [[cuisine of New England]]. The soft-shelled clam is eaten either [[Fried clam|fried]] or [[New England Clam Boil|steamed]] (and then called \"[[soft-shell Clam|steamers]]\"). Many types of clams can be used for [[clam chowder]], but the [[quahog]], a hard shelled clam also known as a chowder clam, is often used because the long cooking time softens its tougher meat.\n\nThe [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Maryland]] region has generally been associated more with crabs, but in recent years the area has been trying to reduce its catch of [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs]], as wild populations have been depleted.  This has not, however, stemmed the demand: Maryland-style [[crabcake]]s are still a well known treat in crabhouses all over the bay, though the catch now comes from points farther south.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[File:Scallop sandwich (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Scallop]] sandwich served in San Diego]]\nIn the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], and particularly the gulf states, [[shrimping]] is an important industry. Copious amounts of shrimp are harvested each year in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to satisfy a national demand for shrimp. Locally, prawns and shrimp are often deep fried; in the Cajun and Creole kitchens of [[Louisiana]], shrimp and prawns are a common addition to traditional recipes like [[jambalaya]] and certain stews. [[Crawfish]] are a well known and much eaten delicacy there, often boiled in huge pots and heavily spiced.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn many major cities with active fishing ports, raw oyster bars are also a feature of shellfish consumption. When served freshly shucked (opened) and iced, one may find a liquid inside the shell, called the liquor.
