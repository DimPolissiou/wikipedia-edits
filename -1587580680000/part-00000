Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  She taught at [[State University of New York]] but quit academia after receiving promotion and tenure in her fifth year.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxd451POnpYC&pg=PT485&dq=Marly+Youmans&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Marly%20Youmans&f=false| title=Southern writers: a new biographical dictionary| editors=Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Bryan Albin Giemza| publisher=LSU Press| year= 2006| isbn=978-0-8071-3123-7 }}</ref>\n\n== Writing ==\nHer published work consists of five books of poetry, eight novels and two fantasies for young readers, as well as uncollected short stories, essays and poems. Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on. Her novels have been described as 'literary fiction at its finest' in ''Books and Culture''<ref>[http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2012/may/whitecamellia.html Linda McCullough Moore, Books and Culture, May 2012]</ref> while ''The Advocate'' has cited her skill at mastering poetic forms.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/utility/homepagestories/4857392-129/poets-invite-readers-to-share Greg Langley, ''The Advocate'', 30 January 2013]</ref> The editor of Books and Culture says, \"Youmans (pronounced like 'yeoman' with an 's' added) is the best-kept secret among contemporary American writers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top Ten Books of 2003|url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2003/december/031222.html|website = Books and Culture|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>\n\nHer books demonstrate a number of continuing interests: in lives lived close to nature, whether in the past (''Catherwood'') or the future (''Thaliad''), magic, faith and redemption (''Val/Orson'', ''The Foliate Head'') and the individual\u2019s journey from youth to adulthood (''Inglewood'', ''A Death at the White Camelia Orphanage''). Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts. She provided the title poems for an illustrated anthology, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins''.<ref>Bonta, Dave, Callum James, Andrea Selch, Catriona Urquhart, Damian Walford Davies and Marly Youmans, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins'' (2011: Carolina Wren Press) {{ISBN|978-0-932112-89-7}}\n</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nYoumans has been awarded many \"book of the year\" and \"best of the year\" citations by magazines, newspapers, and organizations.

South Carolina]]) is an American poet, novelist and short story writer. Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  She taught at [[State University of New York]] but quit academia after receiving promotion and tenure in her fifth year.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxd451POnpYC&pg=PT485&dq=Marly+Youmans&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Marly%20Youmans&f=false| title=Southern writers: a new biographical dictionary| editors=Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Bryan Albin Giemza| publisher=LSU Press| year= 2006| isbn=978-0-8071-3123-7 }}</ref>\n\n== Writing ==\nHer published work consists of five books of poetry, eight novels and two fantasies for young readers, as well as uncollected short stories, essays and poems. Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on. Her novels have been described as 'literary fiction at its finest' in ''Books and Culture''<ref>[http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2012/may/whitecamellia.html Linda McCullough Moore, Books and Culture, May 2012]</ref> while ''The Advocate'' has cited her skill at mastering poetic forms.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/utility/homepagestories/4857392-129/poets-invite-readers-to-share Greg Langley, ''The Advocate'', 30 January 2013]</ref> The editor of Books and Culture says, \"Youmans (pronounced like 'yeoman' with an 's' added) is the best-kept secret among contemporary American writers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top Ten Books of 2003|url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2003/december/031222.html|website = Books and Culture|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>\n\nHer books demonstrate a number of continuing interests: in lives lived close to nature, whether in the past (''Catherwood'') or the future (''Thaliad''), magic, faith and redemption (''Val/Orson'', ''The Foliate Head'') and the individual\u2019s journey from youth to adulthood (''Inglewood'', ''A Death at the White Camelia Orphanage''). Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts. She provided the title poems for an illustrated anthology, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins''.<ref>Bonta, Dave, Callum James, Andrea Selch, Catriona Urquhart, Damian Walford Davies and Marly Youmans, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins'' (2011: Carolina Wren Press) {{ISBN|978-0-932112-89-7}}\n</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nYoumans has been awarded many \"book of the year\" and \"best of the year\" citations by magazines, newspapers, and organizations.

Other factors, including the continued hostility from the Kandian government and a rival cinnamon trade from China, led to a 40% decline in the volume of cinnamon exported between 1785 and 1791. Despite attempts to clear land around Negombo and create cinnamon plantations, by the time the British commander [[Colonel Stuart]] took over the trade in 1796, it was clear that the industry was in decline. Poor policies put in place by [[Frederick North]] the first [[Governor of British Ceylon]] exacerbated the problem. By the 1830s commercial interest had moved elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the British takeover of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815, Negombo lost its strategic value as an outpost of Colombo. However it continued to develop in commercial influence. The Negombo fishery was at the heart of the seafood trade in Ceylon, and many migrant fisherman arrived annually with the profits of their ventures going into the small, prosperous town. In 1907 Negombo was connected to the massive railway project that was linking the island together under British control and encouraging the growth of plantations in coconuts, tea and coffee.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - SRI LANKAN FISHING BOAT. 2.jpg|thumb|A traditional fishing boat]]\nNegombo is about {{convert|2|m|0}} above sea level, and Negombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The Dutch canal flows in the heart of the city. The lagoon is one of the most scenic landmarks of Negombo. There are over 190 species of wildlife and plenty of birds in its mangroves. The northern border of the city is formed by the Ma Oya river which meets the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nNegombo features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The city receives rainfall mainly from the Southwestern monsoons from May to August and October to January. During the remaining months there is a little precipitation due to [[Convective]] rains. The average annual precipitation is about {{convert|2,400|mm|0}}. The average temperature varies {{convert|24|C|0}} to {{convert|30|C|0}}, and there are high humidity levels from February to April.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Negombo, Sri Lanka\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 31\n|Mar high C = 31\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 31\n|Jun high C = 29\n|Jul high C = 29\n|Aug high C = 29\n|Sep high C = 29\n|Oct high C = 29\n|Nov high C = 29\n|Dec high C = 29\n|year high C = 30\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 23\n|Apr low C = 24\n|May low C = 26\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 25\n|Aug low C = 25\n|Sep low C = 25\n|Oct low C = 24\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 24\n|Jan precipitation mm = 89\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69\n|Mar precipitation mm = 147\n|Apr precipitation mm = 231\n|May precipitation mm = 371\n|Jun precipitation mm = 224\n|Jul precipitation mm = 135\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160\n|Oct precipitation mm = 348\n|Nov precipitation mm = 315\n|Dec precipitation mm = 147\n|year precipitation mm = 2345\n|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Negombo Lagoon ==\n\n[[Negombo Lagoon]] is large semi-enclosed coastal water body with plenty of natural resources. The lagoon is fed by number of small rivers and the Dutch canal. It is linked to the Indian Ocean by a narrow channel to the north, near Negombo city. The lagoon and the marsh land area also support local agriculture and forestry. It has extensive mangrove swamps and attracts a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon supports so many distinct species of flora, fauna and as well as another species of birds and variety of animals. [[Negombo Lagoon]] is a major local and tourist attraction primarily for sightseeing and boating tours.\n\nThe fishermen who are based at the Negombo lagoon live in abject poverty in shanty [[thatch palm]] villages along the water's edge. They rely mainly on their traditional knowledge of the seasons for their livelihood, using [[outrigger canoe]]s carved out of tree trunks and nylon nets to bring in modest catches from September through April. Their boats are made in two forms \u2013 oruvas (a type of [[sailing canoe]]) and paruvas (a large, man-powered [[catamaran]] fitted with kurlon dividers). The men are regularly forced to head out to the ocean to fish, often losing money in the [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] process. In recent years, the villagers have supplemented the income earned from fishing by collecting 'toddy', or palm sap, which is used to brew [[Arrack (drink)|arrack]].<ref name=\"gv\" />\n\n==Zones and neighborhood==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*Athgala\n*Basiyawatte\n*Bolawalana <ref>{{cite web|title=Bolawalana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Bolawalana,+Negombo/@7.2010284,79.8496734,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eef72d6450d5:0x6c7b59d175d8a34b}}</ref> \n*Dalupotha \n*Daluwakotuwa\n*Dungalpitiya\n*Duwa\n*Duwane\n*Ethukala <ref>{{cite web|title= Ethukala |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Ethukala,+Negombo/@7.2320684,79.8402233,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb163654703:0x20a21aba22188162}}</ref>\n*Kadolkale\n*Kamachchodai <ref>{{cite web|title= Kamachchode |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kamachchode,+Negombo/@7.2139989,79.8259948,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee9f2f0cbe0f:0x73288c5878ca247b}}</ref>\n*[[Kandawala, Negombo|Kandawala]]\n*Kattuwa <ref>{{cite web|title= Kattuwa |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kattuwa,+Negombo/@7.2239664,79.8284387,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeba04148e07:0xbf6a9b4cf339268b}}</ref>\n*Katuwapitiya <ref>{{cite web|title=Katuwapitiya|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Katuwapitiya,+Negombo/@7.2115705,79.8615422,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eee6055fc955:0x738a691b89b342bc}}</ref>\n*Kimbulapitiya \n*Kochchikade\n*Kurana <ref>{{cite web|title= Kurana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kurana,+Negombo/@7.1904851,79.8507839,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee596f4df825:0x130028b2ec5135cb}}</ref> \n*Kudapadu\n*Mahahunupitiya, also known as Maha Hunupitiya, a predominantly Catholic neighborhood<ref>{{cite web|title= Mahunupitiya |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Mahunupitiya,+Negombo/@7.1892061,79.8617362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee50a347a401:0x638b5450d9c6331c}}</ref><ref name=22Apr>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/asia/sri-lanka-blast-victims.html|title=Why Kill the Innocents?|date=22 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019|first1=|last1=|first2=|last2=|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n*Munnakkarai \n*Muruthena\n*Nugawala\n*Palangathura\n*Pallansena\n*Periyamulla <ref>{{cite web|title= Periyamulla |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Periyamulla,+Negombo/@7.221981,79.8428607,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb94826a1e3:0x6e7016123f2b139c}}</ref> \n*Pitipana \n*Poruthota\n*Raheemanabad <ref>{{cite web|title= Raheemanabad |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Rahumanabath,+Negombo/@7.2200783,79.8478043,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eebf0f86fa7d:0x2ad2ba2874a4ec13}}</ref> \n*Sarakkuwa\n*Sellakanda\n*Thillanduwa\n*Thaladuwa\n*Thalahena\n*Udyar Thoppu <ref>{{cite web|title= Udayar Thoppuwa|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Udayar+Thoppuwa,+Negombo/@7.215488,79.8340627,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeea8f3c0335:0x6fc86e34b3c6fa0a}}</ref> \n*Wella veediya\n*Welihena\n*Kadirana\n*Akkarapanaha\n*Thimbirigaskatuwa\n*Katana\n{{div col end|3}}\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:SL Negombo asv2020-01 img02 Dutch canal.jpg|thumb|Built by the Dutch to transport spices, now used by the local fisherman to get to the sea, Dutch canal in Negombo]]\nThe [[E03 expressway (Sri Lanka)|Airport Expressway]] (E03) opened in 2013 links the capital [[Colombo]] through the Katunayake Interchange with Negombo city minimising travelling time to approximately 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n[[File:Negombo bus terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Negombo bus terminal]]\nThere are highway bus services running between from Negombo to Galle and Matara (the southern tip of the country)  using the Southern Expressway.\n\nThe [[A3 road (Sri Lanka)|A3]] main road from [[Colombo]], goes through Negombo, extends to [[Jaffna]], and [[Trincomalee]] via [[Anuradhapura]].

Other factors, including the continued hostility from the Kandian government and a rival cinnamon trade from China, led to a 40% decline in the volume of cinnamon exported between 1785 and 1791. Despite attempts to clear land around Negombo and create cinnamon plantations, by the time the British commander [[Colonel Stuart]] took over the trade in 1796, it was clear that the industry was in decline. Poor policies put in place by [[Frederick North]] the first [[Governor of British Ceylon]] exacerbated the problem. By the 1830s commercial interest had moved elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the British takeover of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815, Negombo lost its strategic value as an outpost of Colombo. However it continued to develop in commercial influence. The Negombo fishery was at the heart of the seafood trade in Ceylon, and many migrant fisherman arrived annually with the profits of their ventures going into the small, prosperous town. In 1907 Negombo was connected to the massive railway project that was linking the island together under British control and encouraging the growth of plantations in coconuts, tea and coffee.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - SRI LANKAN FISHING BOAT. 2.jpg|thumb|A traditional fishing boat]]\nNegombo is about {{convert|2|m|0}} above sea level, and Negombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The Dutch canal flows in the heart of the city. The lagoon is one of the most scenic landmarks of Negombo. There are over 190 species of wildlife and plenty of birds in its mangroves. The northern border of the city is formed by the Ma Oya river which meets the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nNegombo features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The city receives rainfall mainly from the Southwestern monsoons from May to August and October to January. During the remaining months there is a little precipitation due to [[Convective]] rains. The average annual precipitation is about {{convert|2,400|mm|0}}. The average temperature varies {{convert|24|C|0}} to {{convert|30|C|0}}, and there are high humidity levels from February to April.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Negombo, Sri Lanka\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 30\n|Feb high C = 31\n|Mar high C = 31\n|Apr high C = 31\n|May high C = 31\n|Jun high C = 29\n|Jul high C = 29\n|Aug high C = 29\n|Sep high C = 29\n|Oct high C = 29\n|Nov high C = 29\n|Dec high C = 29\n|year high C = 30\n|Jan low C = 22\n|Feb low C = 22\n|Mar low C = 23\n|Apr low C = 24\n|May low C = 26\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 25\n|Aug low C = 25\n|Sep low C = 25\n|Oct low C = 24\n|Nov low C = 23\n|Dec low C = 22\n|year low C = 24\n|Jan precipitation mm = 89\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69\n|Mar precipitation mm = 147\n|Apr precipitation mm = 231\n|May precipitation mm = 371\n|Jun precipitation mm = 224\n|Jul precipitation mm = 135\n|Aug precipitation mm = 109\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160\n|Oct precipitation mm = 348\n|Nov precipitation mm = 315\n|Dec precipitation mm = 147\n|year precipitation mm = 2345\n|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Negombo Lagoon ==\n\n[[Negombo Lagoon]] is large semi-enclosed coastal water body with plenty of natural resources. The lagoon is fed by number of small rivers and the Dutch canal. It is linked to the Indian Ocean by a narrow channel to the north, near Negombo city. The lagoon and the marsh land area also support local agriculture and forestry. It has extensive mangrove swamps and attracts a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon supports so many distinct species of flora, fauna and as well as another species of birds and variety of animals. [[Negombo Lagoon]] is a major local and tourist attraction primarily for sightseeing and boating tours.\n\nThe fishermen who are based at the Negombo lagoon live in abject poverty in shanty [[thatch palm]] villages along the water's edge. They rely mainly on their traditional knowledge of the seasons for their livelihood, using [[outrigger canoe]]s carved out of tree trunks and nylon nets to bring in modest catches from September through April. Their boats are made in two forms \u2013 oruvas (a type of [[sailing canoe]]) and paruvas (a large, man-powered [[catamaran]] fitted with kurlon dividers). The men are regularly forced to head out to the ocean to fish, often losing money in the [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] process. In recent years, the villagers have supplemented the income earned from fishing by collecting 'toddy', or palm sap, which is used to brew [[Arrack (drink)|arrack]].<ref name=\"gv\" />\n\n==Zones and neighborhood==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*Athgala\n*Basiyawatte\n*Bolawalana <ref>{{cite web|title=Bolawalana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Bolawalana,+Negombo/@7.2010284,79.8496734,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eef72d6450d5:0x6c7b59d175d8a34b}}</ref> \n*Dalupotha \n*Daluwakotuwa\n*Dungalpitiya\n*Duwa\n*Duwane\n*Ethukala <ref>{{cite web|title= Ethukala |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Ethukala,+Negombo/@7.2320684,79.8402233,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb163654703:0x20a21aba22188162}}</ref>\n*Kadolkale\n*Kamachchodai <ref>{{cite web|title= Kamachchode |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kamachchode,+Negombo/@7.2139989,79.8259948,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee9f2f0cbe0f:0x73288c5878ca247b}}</ref>\n*[[Kandawala, Negombo|Kandawala]]\n*Kattuwa <ref>{{cite web|title= Kattuwa |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kattuwa,+Negombo/@7.2239664,79.8284387,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeba04148e07:0xbf6a9b4cf339268b}}</ref>\n*Katuwapitiya <ref>{{cite web|title=Katuwapitiya|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Katuwapitiya,+Negombo/@7.2115705,79.8615422,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eee6055fc955:0x738a691b89b342bc}}</ref>\n*Kimbulapitiya \n*Kochchikade\n*Kurana <ref>{{cite web|title= Kurana |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Kurana,+Negombo/@7.1904851,79.8507839,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee596f4df825:0x130028b2ec5135cb}}</ref> \n*Kudapadu\n*Mahahunupitiya, also known as Maha Hunupitiya, a predominantly Catholic neighborhood<ref>{{cite web|title= Mahunupitiya |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Mahunupitiya,+Negombo/@7.1892061,79.8617362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2ee50a347a401:0x638b5450d9c6331c}}</ref><ref name=22Apr>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/asia/sri-lanka-blast-victims.html|title=Why Kill the Innocents?|date=22 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019|first1=|last1=|first2=|last2=|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n*Munnakkarai \n*Muruthena\n*Nugawala\n*Palangathura\n*Pallansena\n*Periyamulla <ref>{{cite web|title= Periyamulla |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Periyamulla,+Negombo/@7.221981,79.8428607,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeb94826a1e3:0x6e7016123f2b139c}}</ref> \n*Pitipana \n*Poruthota\n*Raheemanabad <ref>{{cite web|title= Raheemanabad |url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Rahumanabath,+Negombo/@7.2200783,79.8478043,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eebf0f86fa7d:0x2ad2ba2874a4ec13}}</ref> \n*Sarakkuwa\n*Sellakanda\n*Thillanduwa\n*Thaladuwa\n*Thalahena\n*Udyar Thoppu <ref>{{cite web|title= Udayar Thoppuwa|url=https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Udayar+Thoppuwa,+Negombo/@7.215488,79.8340627,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ae2eeea8f3c0335:0x6fc86e34b3c6fa0a}}</ref> \n*Wella veediya\n*Welihena\n*Kadirana\n*Akkarapanaha\n*Thimbirigaskatuwa\n*Katana\n{{div col end|3}}\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:SL Negombo asv2020-01 img02 Dutch canal.jpg|thumb|Built by the Dutch to transport spices, now used by the local fisherman to get to the sea, Dutch canal in Negombo]]\nThe [[E03 expressway (Sri Lanka)|Airport Expressway]] (E03) opened in 2013 links the capital [[Colombo]] through the Katunayake Interchange with Negombo city minimising travelling time to approximately 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n[[File:Negombo bus terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Negombo bus terminal]]\nThere are highway bus services running between from Negombo to Galle and Matara (the southern tip of the country)  using the Southern Expressway.\n\nThe [[A3 road (Sri Lanka)|A3]] main road from [[Colombo]], goes through Negombo, extends to [[Jaffna]], and [[Trincomalee]] via [[Anuradhapura]].

Although their original idea of an underwater restaurant was not feasible at the time, the idea was expanded into a {{Convert|22|acre|adj=on}} marine zoological park along the shore of Mission Bay in San Diego. After an investment of about $1.5 million, the park opened with 45 employees, several dolphins, sea lions and two seawater aquariums, and hosted more than 400,000 visitors in its first year of operation.<ref name=\"aqua_history\"/>\n\nInitially held as a private partnership, SeaWorld offered its stock publicly in 1968 enabling them to expand and open additional parks. The second SeaWorld location, [[SeaWorld Ohio]], opened in 1970, followed by [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in 1973 and [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] (the largest of the parks) in 1988. SeaWorld Ohio was later sold to [[Six Flags]] in January 2001.<ref name=\"aqua_history\"/> The parks were owned and operated by [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] between 1976 and 1989, when they were purchased by [[Anheuser-Busch]] Companies, Inc. After Anheuser-Busch was acquired by [[InBev]], SeaWorld San Diego and the rest of the company's theme parks were sold to the [[Blackstone Group]] in December 2009, which operates the park through its SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment division.<ref name=\"prospectus\"/>\n\nSeaWorld currently leases the land from the City of San Diego with the lease expiring in 2048. The premises must be used as a marine mammal park and no other marine mammal park may be operated by SeaWorld within 560 miles of the City limits.<ref name=\"prospectus\"/>\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:SeaWorld San Diego Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of the park.]]\n\n===Shows===\nMany of ''SeaWorld's'' shows are seasonal and may change based on the time of year.\n\n* ''Orca Encounter'': a show highlighting the park's [[killer whales]] and various aspects of their lives.\n* ''Dolphin Days'': guests can meet the Whale & Dolphin family and learn what inspires their trainers.\n* ''Sea Lions Live'': a show that spoofs television shows and music, featuring [[California sea lions]] and [[Asian small-clawed otters]].\n* ''Sea Rescue'': an indoor theater that shows episodes of ABC's Sea Rescue about SeaWorld efforts saving injured marine animals.\n* ''Cirque Electrique'': a summertime evening show featuring world-class acrobatic performances.

Although their original idea of an underwater restaurant was not feasible at the time, the idea was expanded into a {{Convert|22|acre|adj=on}} marine zoological park along the shore of Mission Bay in San Diego. After an investment of about $1.5 million, the park opened with 45 employees, several dolphins, sea lions and two seawater aquariums, and hosted more than 400,000 visitors in its first year of operation.<ref name=\"aqua_history\"/>\n\nInitially held as a private partnership, SeaWorld offered its stock publicly in 1968 enabling them to expand and open additional parks. The second SeaWorld location, [[SeaWorld Ohio]], opened in 1970, followed by [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in 1973 and [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] (the largest of the parks) in 1988. SeaWorld Ohio was later sold to [[Six Flags]] in January 2001.<ref name=\"aqua_history\"/> The parks were owned and operated by [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] between 1976 and 1989, when they were purchased by [[Anheuser-Busch]] Companies, Inc. After Anheuser-Busch was acquired by [[InBev]], SeaWorld San Diego and the rest of the company's theme parks were sold to the [[Blackstone Group]] in December 2009, which operates the park through its SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment division.<ref name=\"prospectus\"/>\n\nSeaWorld currently leases the land from the City of San Diego with the lease expiring in 2048.
