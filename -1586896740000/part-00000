Raster graphics deal more practically than vector graphics with photographs and photo-realistic images, while vector graphics often serve better for [[typesetting]] or for [[graphic design]]. Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 [[pixels per inch]] (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 [[dots per inch]] (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor.

Because, through the dithering process, the printer builds a single image pixel out of several printer dots to increase [[color depth]], the printer's DPI setting must be set far higher than the desired PPI to ensure sufficient color depth without sacrificing image resolution.

Chatham is home to the [[Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge]], and the decommissioned [[Monomoy Point Light]] both located on [[Monomoy Island]]. A popular attraction is the [[Chatham Light]], which is an operational lighthouse that is operated by the [[United States Coast Guard]].\n\n==History==\nNative American tribes who lived in the area before European colonization included the [[Nauset]], specifically the Manomoy or Monomoy people. The expansive lands over which they roamed were known to them as Manamoyik or Monomoit. Explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] landed here in October 1606 at a place he christened \"Port Fortun\u00e9\", where he contacted (and skirmished with) the Nauset. Twelve years later another group of Europeans gave it the name \"Sutcliffe's Inlets\".<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/> Neither name stuck, and the location was not permanently occupied by Europeans until English settlers reached Monomoit in 1664.<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/> The town was incorporated on June 11, 1712,<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/> at which point it was renamed after [[Chatham, Kent]], [[England]]. Its territory expanded with the annexation of Strong Island and its vicinity on February 7, 1797.<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/>\n\nLocated at the \"elbow\" of Cape Cod, the community became a [[shipping]], [[fishing]], and [[whaling]] center. Chatham's early prosperity would leave it with a considerable number of 18th century buildings, whose charm helped it develop into a popular summer resort.\n\nChatham is home to the [[Chatham Lighthouse]], which was established by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1808 to protect the ships circling the Cape. The 1808 towers were replaced in 1841 by twin brick towers that were eventually lost to erosion. The pair were rebuilt in 1877 out of cast iron across the street from its original location, where the light is today. The northern of the two was moved to [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]] to become the [[Nauset Light]] in 1923, when the northern tower was declared surplus. Today, the keeper's house is home to a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] station which patrols the waters of the Atlantic and Nantucket Sound from Wellfleet to West Yarmouth.  The first reforesting project in America took place on Great Hill in 1821 when Selectmen had pine trees and beach grass planted to prevent erosion and to keep sand from blowing over the village.<ref name=names>{{cite book|title=The Names of Cape Cod | first1 = Eugene | last1 = Green | first2 = William | last2 = Sachse | first3 = Brian | last3 = McCaulley | year = 2006 | publisher = Arcadia Press | isbn = 978-1-933212-84-5 | page = 96 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[urban sprawl]] has invaded the Cape, the town of Chatham still boasts a quaint and walkable [[Main Street]], home to numerous family-owned and -operated shops, restaurants, and businesses. The main shopping area features pedestrian-friendly [[crosswalk]]s, on-street [[parallel parking]], and some parking lots that are off Main Street. During the summer, concerts are held in a [[gazebo]] on Main Street, and not far from the shops is where the [[Chatham Anglers]] baseball team plays, as part of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] on the peninsula for collegiate-age players.\n\nChatham, like much of Cape Cod, is suffering from an exodus of young people and young families due to high housing prices and a lack of social and professional opportunities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/grown.cfm |title=WCAI &#124; How We've Grown |publisher=Wgbh.org |accessdate=2013-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919131310/http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/grown.cfm |archive-date=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The majority of homes in Chatham sit empty in the winter months until the summer when second-home owners come to use their summer/vacation homes, or they are used as weekly rentals for tourists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/tcc.cfm |title=WCAI &#124; Two Cape Cods: Hidden Poverty on the Cape and Islands |publisher=Wgbh.org |accessdate=2013-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409212739/http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/tcc.cfm |archivedate=2013-04-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/travel/escapes/06Capecod.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Laura M. | last=Holson | title=In Winter, Cape Cod Vacations are Quiet and Peaceful | date=March 5, 2009}}</ref> As of February 22, 2012, the average listing price for a home in Chatham was $1.3 million.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Chatham-Massachusetts/ |title=Chatham, MA real estate overview |publisher=Trulia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn summer, Chatham grows to a population of an estimated 30,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Facilities are overcrowded, and there continues to be limited parking in the Main Street Business District.

The town has four post offices, all located at various points along Route 28. The town is home to the Eldredge Public Library, named for its benefactor and designed by a student of [[H. H. Richardson]]. The town operates several piers, beaches, boat landings and recreation areas throughout town. The nearest hospital is [[Cape Cod Hospital]] in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]].\n\n==Education==\nUntil 2013, Chatham operated its own school system for the town's 700 students. The Chatham Elementary School served students from pre-kindergarten through fourth grade, the Chatham Middle School served students from fifth through eighth grade, and [[Chatham High School (Massachusetts)|Chatham High School]] served grades nine through twelve. Chatham's athletics teams were known as the Blue Devils, and wore blue and white. In December 2010, Chatham and the neighboring town of Harwich voted to regionalize their school systems into the Monomoy Regional school system.

Chatham is home to the [[Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge]], and the decommissioned [[Monomoy Point Light]] both located on [[Monomoy Island]]. A popular attraction is the [[Chatham Light]], which is an operational lighthouse that is operated by the [[United States Coast Guard]].\n\n==History==\nNative American tribes who lived in the area before European colonization included the [[Nauset]], specifically the Manomoy or Monomoy people. The expansive lands over which they roamed were known to them as Manamoyik or Monomoit. Explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] landed here in October 1606 at a place he christened \"Port Fortun\u00e9\", where he contacted (and skirmished with) the Nauset. Twelve years later another group of Europeans gave it the name \"Sutcliffe's Inlets\".<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/> Neither name stuck, and the location was not permanently occupied by Europeans until English settlers reached Monomoit in 1664.<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/> The town was incorporated on June 11, 1712,<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/> at which point it was renamed after [[Chatham, Kent]], [[England]]. Its territory expanded with the annexation of Strong Island and its vicinity on February 7, 1797.<ref name=\"chatam-hist\"/>\n\nLocated at the \"elbow\" of Cape Cod, the community became a [[shipping]], [[fishing]], and [[whaling]] center. Chatham's early prosperity would leave it with a considerable number of 18th century buildings, whose charm helped it develop into a popular summer resort.\n\nChatham is home to the [[Chatham Lighthouse]], which was established by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1808 to protect the ships circling the Cape. The 1808 towers were replaced in 1841 by twin brick towers that were eventually lost to erosion. The pair were rebuilt in 1877 out of cast iron across the street from its original location, where the light is today. The northern of the two was moved to [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]] to become the [[Nauset Light]] in 1923, when the northern tower was declared surplus. Today, the keeper's house is home to a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] station which patrols the waters of the Atlantic and Nantucket Sound from Wellfleet to West Yarmouth.

The main shopping area features pedestrian-friendly [[crosswalk]]s, on-street [[parallel parking]], and some parking lots that are off Main Street. During the summer, concerts are held in a [[gazebo]] on Main Street, and not far from the shops is where the [[Chatham Anglers]] baseball team plays, as part of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] on the peninsula for collegiate-age players.\n\nChatham, like much of Cape Cod, is suffering from an exodus of young people and young families due to high housing prices and a lack of social and professional opportunities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/grown.cfm |title=WCAI &#124; How We've Grown |publisher=Wgbh.org |accessdate=2013-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919131310/http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/grown.cfm |archive-date=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The majority of homes in Chatham sit empty in the winter months until the summer when second-home owners come to use their summer/vacation homes, or they are used as weekly rentals for tourists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/tcc.cfm |title=WCAI &#124; Two Cape Cods: Hidden Poverty on the Cape and Islands |publisher=Wgbh.org |accessdate=2013-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409212739/http://www.wgbh.org/wcai/tcc.cfm |archivedate=2013-04-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/travel/escapes/06Capecod.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Laura M. | last=Holson | title=In Winter, Cape Cod Vacations are Quiet and Peaceful | date=March 5, 2009}}</ref> As of February 22, 2012, the average listing price for a home in Chatham was $1.3 million.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Chatham-Massachusetts/ |title=Chatham, MA real estate overview |publisher=Trulia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn summer, Chatham grows to a population of an estimated 30,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Facilities are overcrowded, and there continues to be limited parking in the Main Street Business District. Beaches are affected by this increase of population. Limited parking exists in established parking areas, and the town's most popular beach, Lighthouse Beach, has only off the street parking, which sometimes involves a long walk to her sandy shores.\n\n===Historical sites and museums===\n* Atwood House (1752)\n* Caleb Nickerson House (1772)\n* Chatham Railroad Museum (1887)\n* Josiah Mayo House (c. 1820)\n* Marconi Maritime Museum [1914]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Earl in Chatham.JPG|thumb|left|Chatham Lighthouse during [[Hurricane Earl (2010)|Hurricane Earl]] on September 3, 2010]]\n[[File:Chatham sunset.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset in Chatham]]\nThe town occupies the southeast corner (the \"elbow\") of Cape Cod. The town's villages include [[Chatham (CDP), Massachusetts|Chatham proper]], [[Chatham Port, Massachusetts|Chatham Port]], North Chatham, [[West Chatham, Massachusetts|West Chatham]], and South Chatham (west of West Chatham). Chatham is bordered by [[Harwich, Massachusetts|Harwich]] to the west, Pleasant Bay and [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, and [[Nantucket Sound]] to the south. The town is {{convert|35|mi}} south of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]] and east of the [[Sagamore Bridge]], {{convert|20|mi}} east of [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]], and {{convert|85|mi}} southeast of [[Boston]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|63.2|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|41.8|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|21.4|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 33.88%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe mainland portion of the town is typical of Cape Cod, with several ponds, brooks, rivers, harbors, and inlets around the town.  The town includes two narrow strips of land which serve as a barrier between the Atlantic and the mainland; the northern of these is the southern part of the [[Cape Cod National Seashore]].  There are several islands, including Strong Island, Tern Island (which is a sanctuary), Morris Island, Stage Island, and [[Monomoy Island]], a {{convert|7.25|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} island south of the corner of the town which is home to the [[Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge]].  Erosion has changed the region over the years&mdash;for example, an island named [[Slut's Bush]] once existed until it vanished under water by the mid 19th century.<ref>The New England historical and genealogical register, Volume 18. https://books.google.com/books?id=TTkONJrQrtYC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Chatham, Massachusetts has a warm-summer, wet all year, [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'').

The average seasonal (Nov-Apr) snowfall total is around 30 in (76&nbsp;cm). The average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in [[nor'easter]] activity. The [[plant hardiness zone]] is 7b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 5.2&nbsp;\u00b0F (-14.9&nbsp;\u00b0C) and Chatham is the northernmost 7b in the USA east of the Pacific Northwest.<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2019-06-28|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box |width=auto\t\n|location = Chatham, Barnstable County, Massachusetts (1981 \u2013 2010 averages)\n|single line = Y\t\n|Jan high F =\t38.0\n|Feb high F =\t39.2\n|Mar high F =\t44.1\n|Apr high F =\t51.9\n|May high F =\t60.9\n|Jun high F =\t69.2\n|Jul high F =\t75.9\n|Aug high F =\t76.0\n|Sep high F =\t69.9\n|Oct high F =\t59.9\n|Nov high F =\t52.2\n|Dec high F =\t43.7\n|year high F=\t56.8\n| Jan mean F =\t31.5\n| Feb mean F =\t32.6\n| Mar mean F =\t37.5\n| Apr mean F =\t45.5\n| May mean F =\t54.3\n| Jun mean F =\t63.1\n| Jul mean F =\t69.7\n| Aug mean F =\t69.7\n| Sep mean F =\t63.7\n| Oct mean F =\t53.9\n| Nov mean F =\t46.1\n| Dec mean F =\t37.2\n| year mean F =\t50.5\n|Jan low F =\t25.0\n|Feb low F =\t26.0\n|Mar low F =\t30.9\n|Apr low F =\t39.1\n|May low F =\t47.6\n|Jun low F =\t57.0\n|Jul low F =\t63.5\n|Aug low F =\t63.5\n|Sep low F =\t57.5\n|Oct low F =\t47.8\n|Nov low F =\t39.9\n|Dec low F =\t30.7\n|year low F=\t44.1\n|precipitation colour = green\t\n|Jan precipitation inch =\t3.82\n|Feb precipitation inch =\t3.82\n|Mar precipitation inch =\t4.64\n|Apr precipitation inch =\t4.45\n|May precipitation inch =\t3.62\n|Jun precipitation inch =\t3.59\n|Jul precipitation inch =\t3.03\n|Aug precipitation inch =\t3.47\n|Sep precipitation inch =\t3.66\n|Oct precipitation inch =\t3.61\n|Nov precipitation inch =\t3.89\n|Dec precipitation inch =\t3.98\n|year precipitation inch=\t45.58\n| humidity colour = green\t\n| Jan humidity =\t72.6\n| Feb humidity =\t70.9\n| Mar humidity =\t68.6\n| Apr humidity =\t71.4\n| May humidity =\t73.7\n| Jun humidity =\t78.5\n| Jul humidity =\t81.0\n| Aug humidity =\t80.1\n| Sep humidity =\t79.1\n| Oct humidity =\t76.3\n| Nov humidity =\t72.4\n| Dec humidity =\t71.1\n| year humidity =\t74.7\n| Jan dew point F = 23.7\n| Feb dew point F = 24.2\n| Mar dew point F = 28.1\n| Apr dew point F = 36.8\n| May dew point F = 46.1\n| Jun dew point F = 56.3\n| Jul dew point F = 63.6\n| Aug dew point F = 63.3\n| Sep dew point F = 57.1\n| Oct dew point F = 56.6\n| Nov dew point F = 37.7\n| Dec dew point F = 28.7\n| year dew point F = 42.8\n|source 1 = PRISM Climate Group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U|website=www.prism.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=June 26, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ecology==\n\nAccording to the [[A.
