A [[Chilean Americans|Chilean-American]], Fring is a major [[methamphetamine]] distributor in the [[Southwestern United States]] who uses several legitimate businesses, including a chain of successful fast food [[fried chicken restaurant]]s called Los Pollos Hermanos (The Chicken Brothers) and an [[industrial laundry]] facility called Lavanderia Brillante, as fronts for a vast drug operation. Fring maintains a positive public image; he is a [[boosterism|booster]] for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), befriending the special agent in charge and making large donations to the [[Albuquerque]] office's civic and charitable events. However, he is ruthless and Machiavellian in managing his vast drug empire. He employs a number of enforcers and has personally killed rivals and associates.<ref name=\"AMC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/gustavo-fring |title=Gustavo Fring |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |access-date=October 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nGustavo has a mysterious background, but is supposedly a native of [[Chile]]; he is sometimes referred to by cartel members as \"The Chilean\". In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Pi\u00f1ata (Better Call Saul)|Pi\u00f1ata]]\", Gus tells a comatose Hector a story about a [[coati]] that ate the fruit from a [[Pouteria lucuma|l\u00facuma]] tree Gus tended during his childhood in Chile.  In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Magic Man (Better Call Saul)|Magic Man]]\", Lalo Salamanca refers to a mysterious incident involving Gus which took place in [[Santiago]].

Seeking to expand their drug trade, they met with Mexican cartel leader [[Don Eladio Vuente]]. Eladio rejected their offer, preferring to continue to distribute cocaine, and accused them of disrespect for producing meth in his territory without his permission. [[Hector Salamanca]], one of Eladio's right-hand men, shot Max in the head and forced Gus to watch as Max bled into Eladio's swimming pool. Eladio spared Gus because of his unknown but apparently powerful connection to Chile, but forced him to cooperate with the cartel under Eladio's terms. Gus then moved to Albuquerque and began operating Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants throughout the southwestern United States, which he used to facilitate distribution of the cartel's drugs. While he remains outwardly loyal to the cartel, he spends the next 20 years nursing a grudge against Eladio and Hector and waiting for his chance at revenge. As shown in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Dedicado a Max]]\", at some point before or during the events of ''Better Call Saul'', Gus acquires a small villa just inside the Mexican border.  The villa serves as the residence for [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry_Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]], and Gus installs a fountain there which is dedicated to Max.\n\nGustavo Fring is established as an alias, as neither the DEA nor Gus' enforcer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] can find any records about him prior to his arrival in Mexico. In a flashback during the ''Breaking Bad'' episode \"[[One Minute (Breaking Bad)|One Minute]]\", Hector mockingly refers to him as \"Grand [[Generalissimo]]\", implying that Gus had a connection to the Pinochet regime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guffey |first1=Ensley F. |last2=Koontz |first2= K.

Instead of killing Tuco, Mike arranges for Tuco to assault him in view of the police, leading to Tuco's arrest. Mike fears Hector will learn that Mike arranged for Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned that Hector will retaliate against Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike acts preemptively by preparing to assassinate Hector, but is interrupted at the last moment. Mike tracks this interruption to Gus, who explains that he wants to be the one to determine when Hector will die. However, Gus encourages Mike to continue to disrupt the trucks Hector uses to bring ice cream store supplies and drugs from Mexico and send cash back to the cartel.  After Mike disrupts two shipments without revealing his identity, Hector demands that Gus temporarily use his Los Pollos Hermanos trucks to ship both Hector's and Gus' drugs. Gus, who had wanted this result from the start, appears to reluctantly agree.  He later attempts to pay Mike, but Mike refuses the money.  Instead, he asks for assistance laundering the $250,000 he stole from one of Hector's trucks, which Gus provides by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive to hire Mike as a contracted security expert and pay him monthly consulting fees.\n\nWith the new transport agreement in place, Nacho and Arturo Colon arrive at the Los Pollos Hermanos warehouse and farm to pick up a drug shipment, and Nacho attempts to strong-arm his way into taking six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five.  When Gus' subordinate [[Tyrus Kitt]] calls Gus for guidance, Gus recognizes an opportunity to infiltrate the Salamanca organization and tells Tyrus to give Nacho the extra kilo.  Nacho fears that Hector will learn of his role in Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned about Hector's intent to take over Nacho's father's upholstery store for use as a front business.  He secretly swaps Hector's angina medication for a [[placebo]], hoping to induce a fatal heart attack.  At a meeting between Juan Bolsa, Gus, Hector and Nacho, Bolsa informs them that the use of Gus' trucks to move the drugs and cash for both organizations will be a permanent arrangement.  Hector's angry outburst leads to a stroke, and Gus calls for an ambulance while administering first aid that saves Hector's life, though he is comatose.  Nacho follows Mike's previous advice to switch the placebos for Hector's real medication so that foul play will not be suspected.  Gus appears to notice Nacho's actions, but says nothing.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nHector is rushed to the hospital, while Gus is summoned along with Nacho and Arturo to a meeting with Bolsa at the Los Pollos distribution plant, where Bolsa declares that until further notice, the Salamanca operation will continue with Nacho and Arturo in charge until Hector recovers. Suspicious of Nacho's behavior following Hector's stroke, Gus has Victor surveil Nacho, and Victor observes Nacho disposing of the placebo pills he switched with Hector's real medication.\n\nNot wanting to lose his revenge opportunity, Gus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Medical Center]] in Baltimore to oversee Hector's treatment. Upon reviewing Hector's medical records, Gus realizes there is no nitroglycerin in Hector's system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo make their next scheduled drug pickup, Arturo strong arms his way into taking an extra kilo, as Nacho did previously.  Arturo brags about his success as they leave, but Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo to death with a plastic bag, then uses his knowledge of Nacho's activities to blackmail Nacho into becoming a double agent.\n\nTyrus and [[Victor (Breaking Bad)|Victor]] stage a roadside shooting and car fire to make it appear as though Nacho and Arturo were attacked and the drugs they picked up stolen by a rival gang, the Espinosas, which also frames the Espionsas for the truck Mike hijacked while concealing his identity and covers up Nacho's new role as Gus' spy in the Salamanca organization. As part of the scheme, Victor shoots Nacho twice and leaves him on the side of the road near the car.  Nacho calls the Cousins for help and they burn the car, then take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera for emergency surgery that saves his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho's car to the Espinosas.  Nacho then falsely identifies the Espinosas as his attackers.  The Cousins kill everyone in the Espinosa compound and retrieve the \"stolen\" drugs, then leave for Mexico to escape police scrutiny.  Nacho sees that by getting the Salamancas to wipe out the Espinosas, Gus has expanded his drug territory, but he does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.\n\nA year later, Hector has recovered to the point where his mental faculties are sound, but his mobility is limited to the index finger of his right hand. Gus ends his specialized care, in effect trapping Hector's healed mind inside his unhealed body.  Hector's nephew Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in managing the family business. While he privately thanks Gus for coming to Hector's aid, he begins to surveil Gus' activities.\n\nGus plans for a secret \"superlab\" to be constructed under an industrial laundry Gus has purchased for the purpose, which will enable him to produce methamphetamine on the U.S. side of the border rather than relying on cartel cocaine from Mexico. Mike arranges for engineers to be interviewed for the job while Gus secretly looks on. The first candidate is rejected after he glibly assures Mike that the job will be easy and can be done without difficulty even under the constraints Gus requires.  The second candidate, [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], impresses Gus with his forthright analysis of the time, expense, and risk associated with the project, which he calls difficult but not impossible. Gus hires Werner to oversee construction of the lab.\n\nTo accomplish the project in secret, Gus buys a warehouse on the outskirts of the city in which he has long-term living quarters built for Werner and his German crew, who maintain secrecy by travelling from their quarters to the job site unseen, work only at night, and do no work above ground. When construction falls behind schedule, Werner effects an escape and plans to rendezvous with his wife.  Mike catches up to him and realizes that Werner inadvertently revealed some construction details to Lalo.  Gus informs Mike that Werner will have to be killed in order to protect the secret of the lab, and plans to send men to do it.  Mike says that since supervising Werner was his responsibility, he will carry out the execution, which he does by shooting Werner in the head.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to take cocaine of inferior quality when picking up the Salamanca's drugs at Los Pollos Hermanos.  Rumors of the \"stepped on\" product reach Nacho and Domingo, who report them to Lalo. Lalo confirms the impurity of the cocaine in a visit to Salamanca street dealers.  In a meeting with Lalo and Juan Bolsa, Gus falsely claims that Werner Ziegler was working under Mike's supervision to construct a chilling system for Gus's chicken farm, and that Werner fled after stealing cocaine.  Gus goes on to claim that in an effort to hide the loss, he replaced the stolen cocaine with locally produced methamphetamine.  The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's departure from Albuquerque, pursuit by Mike, and subsequent death.  Lalo accepts Gus's cover story and apology, but remains suspicious.  Juan reminds Lalo that Gus enjoys the trust of Don Eladio, and indicates that Lalo should let the matter drop.  Because Lalo remains suspicious, Gus shuts down construction of the underground meth lab and has Mike send Werner's workers home.  Gus offers to continue paying Mike during the delay, but Mike declines out of frustration over Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner.\n\nGus coerces Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho gains Lalo's trust, and after Domingo is arrested, Nacho and Lalo use Jimmy/Saul to secure Domingo's release from jail in exchange for the location of several of Gus' dead drops. Nacho reports the plan to Gus, who plans to cancel the drops, but Nacho advises that this will reveal a mole within the Salamanca organization. Gus agrees and on the night of the transfer he tensely waits as Victor and Diego make sure that the DEA and local police seize nearly a million dollars but find no leads to Gus.\n\nMike spends several weeks feeling depressed over Werner's death and drinks to excess. After he is injured by a local gang, Gug has him taken to a pueblo Gus owns just inside the Mexican border, which includes a fountain dedicated to Max. Dr. Barry Goodman tends to Mike's wounds and Mike stays to heal. Gus visits and asks Mike to join his organization, saying that he wants Mike with him because Mike understands his need for revenge.\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to report to Mike about his activities to undermine the Salamanca organization. Mike works under an assumed name to secretly point the police towards Lalo for the murder of Fred the money wire store clerk. Lalo is surrounded by police and arrested. In jail under an assumed name, Lalo contacts Nacho from jail and says he wants Nacho to burn down Gus's flagship Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide status reports to Peter, the Madrigal CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the status of the meth lab and Gus assures Peter he will get the plan back on track. When Gus returns home, he and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as the mole in the Salamanca organization by destroy Gus's restaurant. Gus wants Lalo released, so he has Mike provide Jimmy the details of his investigation into Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling him to win a motion to release Lalo on bail.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWhen [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] seeks a buyer for his high-quality meth, [[Saul Goodman]] arranges a meeting with the unknown purchaser. Walt and his partner, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]), arrive at a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in the South Valley, but the buyer seemingly never shows up, with Jesse and Walt unaware that Gus, the restaurant manager, had been silently watching them. Walt realizes this later, and arranges a second meeting with only himself and Gus. Gus tells him that he is not interested in conducting business since Jesse was late and [[substance intoxication|high]] for the first meeting, and is thus potentially unreliable. Walt persuades Gus to reconsider his decision, promising that he will never have to deal with Jesse and that their product will earn him enormous returns.\n\nGus eventually agrees to purchase 38 pounds of Walt's meth for $1.2 million but only if it can be delivered within a limited time at a remote location. With Jesse unconscious after taking [[heroin]] with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]], Walt is forced to miss the birth of his daughter Holly to make the delivery. Shortly afterward, Gus is given a tour of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s [[Albuquerque]] field office, along with other local [[boosterism|boosters]]. While there, he discovers that Walt has [[lung cancer]] and that his brother-in-law, [[Hank Schrader]], is a DEA agent.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nGus is pleased with the quality of Walt's blue meth, and offers him $3 million for three months of his time to cook more in a high-tech \"superlab\" hidden under an industrial laundry that Gus owns. Walt initially refuses, but Gus eventually convinces Walt that he should cook for his family's financial security. Gus provides him [[Gale Boetticher]], the talented chemist who set up the superlab, to help cook, but Walt needs to placate Jesse after Hank assaults him, so he convinces Gus to bring Jesse back as his assistant. Gus informs the cartel that once Walt is done with his three months, they will be free to kill him. [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] are impatient and travel from Mexico to the US to carry out the murder, but Gus intervenes and points them to Hank, who actually killed Tuco. Gus anonymously warns Hank about the pending attack, enabling Hank to kill Marco and critically injure Leonel, despite becoming nearly paralyzed from the waist down. Gus uses his influence with the police to distract them at the hospital so Mike can fatally inject Leonel.\n\nThe attempt on Hank's life leads to a large-scale crackdown on the cartel, and Juan Bolsa is killed. Realizing his own life was at stake, Walt agrees to continue cooking in the superlab for an extended period for $15 million with Jesse aiding him, but Gus is still concerned about Jesse's loyalties. Jesse learns that drug dealers who work for Gus were responsible for the death of Tom\u00e1s, the young brother of Jesse's girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]. Before Jesse can kill them himself, Walt runs them over with his car and tells Jesse to flee. Walt explains to Gus that this was just a \"hiccup\" in their agreement. Gus agrees to overlook the matter but reinstates Gale as Walt's assistant, and privately tells Gale to learn all of Walt's methods so that he can take over from Walt. Walt realizes that Gus is trying to groom Gale as his replacement, meaning his life is at risk, so he secretly meets with Jesse and asks him to find out where Gale lives. Once Jesse finds Gale's apartment, Walt sets out to kill him, but Victor stops him and brings him to the lab, where Mike is waiting. Walt asks Mike to let him call Jesse and convince him to come to the lab, but instead Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale. Victor rushes to Gale's apartment, but Jesse arrives first and fatally shoots Gale.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nGus arrives at the lab, where Walt and Jesse have been secured by Victor and Mike.  Knowing he was recognized at Gale's apartment, Victor fears for his life and attempts to show his continued usefulness to Gus by beginning to cook meth, which he learned how to do while guarding Walt and Jesse.  Walt begs for Gus to spare them, but they are shocked when Gus slices open Victor's neck and lets him bleed to death in front of them. Gus calmly tells Walt and Jesse to get back to work, and increases oversight in the lab by installing security cameras and having Mike and Tyrus watch them while they work. Mike suggests to Gus that they may be able to drive a wedge between Walt and Jesse. Mike takes Jesse out of the lab to help pick up dead drops and carry out other tasks, and arranges for Jesse to foil a pre-planned attack on him, which boosts Jesse's confidence and increases his sense of loyalty to Mike and Gus. Gus is impressed by Jesse's mettle, and has Mike involve him in more work outside the lab. Worried about their safety, Walt gives Jesse a cigarette with a capsule of [[ricin]] hidden inside and tells him to poison Gus when he gets the chance, but Jesse does not follow through.\n\nGus arranges to meet with Don Eladio and the other cartel leaders to work out the differences that have caused the cartel to disrupt Gus' business and he brings Mike and Jesse with him. Jesse cooks a superior batch of meth and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico and work for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse.  During the party at Eladio's house to celebrate their rapprochement, Gus tricks Eladio and most of the other cartel leaders into drinking from a poisoned bottle of tequila. Gus takes the first drink to alleviate suspicion, but forces himself to vomit afterwards. During the fight that ensues after cartel leaders begin dying from the poison's effects, Jesse helps the ill Gus and wounded Mike escape, killing Hector's last living grandson, Joaquin Salamanca, in the process.  He brings them to Dr. Goodman's makeshift hospital Gus had previously arranged at his villa, where both receive treatment.  After recovering, Gus returns to Albuquerque and taunts Hector, telling him the cartel leaders are all dead, and that because of Joaquin's death, the Salamanca family line ends with Hector.  Jesse is no longer loyal to Walt and refuses to serve as his protector.  With the DEA beginning to connect Gale's death to Gus, Gus fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's family if he retaliates or informs.\n\nConsidering his life at risk, Walt attempts to kill Gus with a [[pipe bomb]] attached to his car, but Gus senses something amiss and walks away from the vehicle. Panicked, Walt recovers the bomb and hides at his home.  After unsuccessfully attempting to enlist Jesse in aiding him to kill Gus, Walt poisons Andrea's son Brock and convinces Jesse Gus is responsible.  Jesse agrees to help Walt and tells him about Gus' routine, including his visits to Hector at the nursing home.  Walt convinces Hector to help him by promising him final revenge on Gus. Hector pretends to have turned informant to the DEA.  Gus visits Hector to find out why he was at the DEA office.  Hector refuses to acknowledge Gus as Gus prepares to kill him with a lethal injection.  Before Gus administers the shot, Hector suddenly turns to face him, stares at him intently and repeatedly rings the bell on his wheelchair. Too late, Gus sees that the bell is attached to the detonator of Walt's pipe bomb, which Walt had installed on the underside of Hector's wheelchair. The resulting explosion kills Hector and Tyrus immediately. Gus appears uninjured as he calmly walks out of the room and adjusts his tie, but the scene slowly reveals that the explosion removed the right side of his face and head, and Gus falls to the floor and dies.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nThough Gus doesn't appear his death has numerous consequences. The continuing investigation into Gus' death reaches his restaurant business and the destroyed superlab, which Walt and Jesse burned after Gus died. Knowing that the security camera recordings stored on Gus' laptop can incriminate them, Walt, Jesse, and Mike use an electromagnet outside the police station to erase the laptop's hard drive while it is in the police evidence room.  The police recover the account numbers and access codes for the offshore accounts Gus previously set up to pay his employees for their silence and seize the accounts.  Mike, Walt, and Jesse partner in a new meth business, with Mike continuing to pay Gus' former employees out of his share of the profits in order to assure their continued silence.  When police successfully interdict these payments, Walt fears his identity will be exposed and attempts to obtain the employees' names from Mike so he can have them killed. When Mike refuses, Walt kills him. Walt then obtains the names from Lydia Rodart-Quayle and has Gus' former employees killed in prison before they can reveal his identity, effectively bringing an end to Gus' drug distribution empire.\n\n== Character development ==\n[[File:Giancarlo Esposito cropped retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Giancarlo Esposito]] portrays Gus Fring in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe character Gustavo Fring is named after the former [[Germany national football team|German International]] [[Torsten Frings]].<ref name=\"DieWelt\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article161675759/Breaking-Bad-Schurke-nach-deutschem-Trainer-benannt.html |title=Breaking-Bad-Schurke nach deutschem Trainer benannt |date=January 31, 2017 |work=[[Die Welt]] |access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> Initially, [[Giancarlo Esposito]] was offered a character that was described to him as \"very admirable, very polite\", and he decided to play that character as if he had \"some kind of a secret\".

Fring maintains a positive public image; he is a [[boosterism|booster]] for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), befriending the special agent in charge and making large donations to the [[Albuquerque]] office's civic and charitable events. However, he is ruthless and Machiavellian in managing his vast drug empire.

Seeking to expand their drug trade, they met with Mexican cartel leader [[Don Eladio Vuente]]. Eladio rejected their offer, preferring to continue to distribute cocaine, and accused them of disrespect for producing meth in his territory without his permission. [[Hector Salamanca]], one of Eladio's right-hand men, shot Max in the head and forced Gus to watch as Max bled into Eladio's swimming pool. Eladio spared Gus because of his unknown but apparently powerful connection to Chile, but forced him to cooperate with the cartel under Eladio's terms. Gus then moved to Albuquerque and began operating Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants throughout the southwestern United States, which he used to facilitate distribution of the cartel's drugs. While he remains outwardly loyal to the cartel, he spends the next 20 years nursing a grudge against Eladio and Hector and waiting for his chance at revenge. As shown in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Dedicado a Max]]\", at some point before or during the events of ''Better Call Saul'', Gus acquires a small villa just inside the Mexican border.  The villa serves as the residence for [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry_Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]], and Gus installs a fountain there which is dedicated to Max.\n\nGustavo Fring is established as an alias, as neither the DEA nor Gus' enforcer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] can find any records about him prior to his arrival in Mexico. In a flashback during the ''Breaking Bad'' episode \"[[One Minute (Breaking Bad)|One Minute]]\", Hector mockingly refers to him as \"Grand [[Generalissimo]]\", implying that Gus had a connection to the Pinochet regime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guffey |first1=Ensley F. |last2=Koontz |first2= K.

Instead of killing Tuco, Mike arranges for Tuco to assault him in view of the police, leading to Tuco's arrest. Mike fears Hector will learn that Mike arranged for Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned that Hector will retaliate against Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike acts preemptively by preparing to assassinate Hector, but is interrupted at the last moment. Mike tracks this interruption to Gus, who explains that he wants to be the one to determine when Hector will die. However, Gus encourages Mike to continue to disrupt the trucks Hector uses to bring ice cream store supplies and drugs from Mexico and send cash back to the cartel.  After Mike disrupts two shipments without revealing his identity, Hector demands that Gus temporarily use his Los Pollos Hermanos trucks to ship both Hector's and Gus' drugs. Gus, who had wanted this result from the start, appears to reluctantly agree.  He later attempts to pay Mike, but Mike refuses the money.  Instead, he asks for assistance laundering the $250,000 he stole from one of Hector's trucks, which Gus provides by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive to hire Mike as a contracted security expert and pay him monthly consulting fees.\n\nWith the new transport agreement in place, Nacho and Arturo Colon arrive at the Los Pollos Hermanos warehouse and farm to pick up a drug shipment, and Nacho attempts to strong-arm his way into taking six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five.  When Gus' subordinate [[Tyrus Kitt]] calls Gus for guidance, Gus recognizes an opportunity to infiltrate the Salamanca organization and tells Tyrus to give Nacho the extra kilo.  Nacho fears that Hector will learn of his role in Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned about Hector's intent to take over Nacho's father's upholstery store for use as a front business.  He secretly swaps Hector's angina medication for a [[placebo]], hoping to induce a fatal heart attack.  At a meeting between Juan Bolsa, Gus, Hector and Nacho, Bolsa informs them that the use of Gus' trucks to move the drugs and cash for both organizations will be a permanent arrangement.  Hector's angry outburst leads to a stroke, and Gus calls for an ambulance while administering first aid that saves Hector's life, though he is comatose.  Nacho follows Mike's previous advice to switch the placebos for Hector's real medication so that foul play will not be suspected.  Gus appears to notice Nacho's actions, but says nothing.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nHector is rushed to the hospital, while Gus is summoned along with Nacho and Arturo to a meeting with Bolsa at the Los Pollos distribution plant, where Bolsa declares that until further notice, the Salamanca operation will continue with Nacho and Arturo in charge until Hector recovers. Suspicious of Nacho's behavior following Hector's stroke, Gus has Victor surveil Nacho, and Victor observes Nacho disposing of the placebo pills he switched with Hector's real medication.\n\nNot wanting to lose his revenge opportunity, Gus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Medical Center]] in Baltimore to oversee Hector's treatment. Upon reviewing Hector's medical records, Gus realizes there is no nitroglycerin in Hector's system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo make their next scheduled drug pickup, Arturo strong arms his way into taking an extra kilo, as Nacho did previously.  Arturo brags about his success as they leave, but Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo to death with a plastic bag, then uses his knowledge of Nacho's activities to blackmail Nacho into becoming a double agent.\n\nTyrus and [[Victor (Breaking Bad)|Victor]] stage a roadside shooting and car fire to make it appear as though Nacho and Arturo were attacked and the drugs they picked up stolen by a rival gang, the Espinosas, which also frames the Espionsas for the truck Mike hijacked while concealing his identity and covers up Nacho's new role as Gus' spy in the Salamanca organization. As part of the scheme, Victor shoots Nacho twice and leaves him on the side of the road near the car.  Nacho calls the Cousins for help and they burn the car, then take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera for emergency surgery that saves his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho's car to the Espinosas.  Nacho then falsely identifies the Espinosas as his attackers.  The Cousins kill everyone in the Espinosa compound and retrieve the \"stolen\" drugs, then leave for Mexico to escape police scrutiny.  Nacho sees that by getting the Salamancas to wipe out the Espinosas, Gus has expanded his drug territory, but he does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.\n\nA year later, Hector has recovered to the point where his mental faculties are sound, but his mobility is limited to the index finger of his right hand. Gus ends his specialized care, in effect trapping Hector's healed mind inside his unhealed body.  Hector's nephew Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in managing the family business. While he privately thanks Gus for coming to Hector's aid, he begins to surveil Gus' activities.\n\nGus plans for a secret \"superlab\" to be constructed under an industrial laundry Gus has purchased for the purpose, which will enable him to produce methamphetamine on the U.S. side of the border rather than relying on cartel cocaine from Mexico. Mike arranges for engineers to be interviewed for the job while Gus secretly looks on. The first candidate is rejected after he glibly assures Mike that the job will be easy and can be done without difficulty even under the constraints Gus requires.  The second candidate, [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], impresses Gus with his forthright analysis of the time, expense, and risk associated with the project, which he calls difficult but not impossible. Gus hires Werner to oversee construction of the lab.\n\nTo accomplish the project in secret, Gus buys a warehouse on the outskirts of the city in which he has long-term living quarters built for Werner and his German crew, who maintain secrecy by travelling from their quarters to the job site unseen, work only at night, and do no work above ground. When construction falls behind schedule, Werner effects an escape and plans to rendezvous with his wife.  Mike catches up to him and realizes that Werner inadvertently revealed some construction details to Lalo.  Gus informs Mike that Werner will have to be killed in order to protect the secret of the lab, and plans to send men to do it.  Mike says that since supervising Werner was his responsibility, he will carry out the execution, which he does by shooting Werner in the head.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to take cocaine of inferior quality when picking up the Salamanca's drugs at Los Pollos Hermanos.  Rumors of the \"stepped on\" product reach Nacho and Domingo, who report them to Lalo. Lalo confirms the impurity of the cocaine in a visit to Salamanca street dealers.  In a meeting with Lalo and Juan Bolsa, Gus falsely claims that Werner Ziegler was working under Mike's supervision to construct a chilling system for Gus's chicken farm, and that Werner fled after stealing cocaine.  Gus goes on to claim that in an effort to hide the loss, he replaced the stolen cocaine with locally-produced methamphetamine.  The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's departure from Albuquerque, pursuit by Mike, and subsequent death.  Lalo accepts Gus's cover story and apology, but remains suspicious.  Juan reminds Lalo that Gus enjoys the trust of Don Eladio, and indicates that Lalo should let the matter drop.  Because Lalo remains suspicious, Gus shuts down construction of the underground meth lab and has Mike send Werner's workers home.  Gus offers to continue paying Mike during the delay, but Mike declines out of frustration over Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner.\n\nGus coerces Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho gains Lalo's trust, and after Domingo is arrested, Nacho and Lalo use Jimmy/Saul to secure Domingo's release from jail in exchange for the location of several of Gus' dead drops. Nacho reports the plan to Gus, who plans to cancel the drops, but Nacho advises that this will reveal a mole within the Salamanca organization. Gus agrees and on the night of the transfer he tensely waits as Victor and Diego make sure that the DEA and local police seize nearly a million dollars but find no leads to Gus.\n\nMike spends several weeks feeling depressed over Werner's death and drinks to excess. After he is injured by a local gang, Gug has him taken to a pueblo Gus owns just inside the Mexican border, which includes a fountain dedicated to Max. Dr. Barry Goodman tends to Mike's wounds and Mike stays to heal. Gus visits and asks Mike to join his organization, saying that he wants Mike with him because Mike understands his need for revenge.\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to report to Mike about his activities to undermine the Salamanca organization. Mike works under an assumed name to secretly point the police towards Lalo for the murder of Fred the money wire store clerk. Lalo is surrounded by police and arrested. In jail under an assumed name, Lalo contacts Nacho from jail and says he wants Nacho to burn down Gus's flagship Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide status reports to Peter, the Madrigal CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the status of the meth lab and Gus assures Peter he will get the plan back on track. When Gus returns home, he and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as the mole in the Salamanca organization by destroy Gus's restaurant. Gus wants Lalo released, so he has Mike provide Jimmy the details of his investigation into Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling him to win a motion to release Lalo on bail.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWhen [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] seeks a buyer for his high-quality meth, [[Saul Goodman]] arranges a meeting with the unknown purchaser. Walt and his partner, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]), arrive at a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in the South Valley, but the buyer seemingly never shows up, with Jesse and Walt unaware that Gus, the restaurant manager, had been silently watching them. Walt realizes this later, and arranges a second meeting with only himself and Gus. Gus tells him that he is not interested in conducting business since Jesse was late and [[substance intoxication|high]] for the first meeting, and is thus potentially unreliable. Walt persuades Gus to reconsider his decision, promising that he will never have to deal with Jesse and that their product will earn him enormous returns.\n\nGus eventually agrees to purchase 38 pounds of Walt's meth for $1.2 million but only if it can be delivered within a limited time at a remote location. With Jesse unconscious after taking [[heroin]] with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]], Walt is forced to miss the birth of his daughter Holly to make the delivery. Shortly afterward, Gus is given a tour of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s [[Albuquerque]] field office, along with other local [[boosterism|boosters]]. While there, he discovers that Walt has [[lung cancer]] and that his brother-in-law, [[Hank Schrader]], is a DEA agent.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nGus is pleased with the quality of Walt's blue meth, and offers him $3 million for three months of his time to cook more in a high-tech \"superlab\" hidden under an industrial laundry that Gus owns. Walt initially refuses, but Gus eventually convinces Walt that he should cook for his family\u2019s financial security. Gus provides him [[Gale Boetticher]], the talented chemist who set up the superlab, to help cook, but Walt needs to placate Jesse after Hank assaults him, so he convinces Gus to bring Jesse back as his assistant. Gus informs the cartel that once Walt is done with his three months, they will be free to kill him. [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] are impatient and travel from Mexico to the US to carry out the murder, but Gus intervenes and points them to Hank, who actually killed Tuco. Gus anonymously warns Hank about the pending attack, enabling Hank to kill Marco and critically injure Leonel, despite becoming nearly paralyzed from the waist down. Gus uses his influence with the police to distract them at the hospital so Mike can fatally inject Leonel.\n\nThe attempt on Hank's life leads to a large-scale crackdown on the cartel, and Juan Bolsa is killed. Realizing his own life was at stake, Walt agrees to continue cooking in the superlab for an extended period for $15 million with Jesse aiding him, but Gus is still concerned about Jesse's loyalties. Jesse learns that drug dealers who work for Gus were responsible for the death of Tom\u00e1s, the young brother of Jesse's girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]. Before Jesse can kill them himself, Walt runs them over with his car and tells Jesse to flee. Walt explains to Gus that this was just a \"hiccup\" in their agreement. Gus agrees to overlook the matter but reinstates Gale as Walt's assistant, and privately tells Gale to learn all of Walt's methods so that he can take over from Walt. Walt realizes that Gus is trying to groom Gale as his replacement, meaning his life is at risk, so he secretly meets with Jesse and asks him to find out where Gale lives. Once Jesse finds Gale's apartment, Walt sets out to kill him, but Victor stops him and brings him to the lab, where Mike is waiting. Walt asks Mike to let him call Jesse and convince him to come to the lab, but instead Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale. Victor rushes to Gale's apartment, but Jesse arrives first and fatally shoots Gale.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nGus arrives at the lab, where Walt and Jesse have been secured by Victor and Mike.  Knowing he was recognized at Gale's apartment, Victor fears for his life and attempts to show his continued usefulness to Gus by beginning to cook meth, which he learned how to do while guarding Walt and Jesse.  Walt begs for Gus to spare them, but they are shocked when Gus slices open Victor's neck and lets him bleed to death in front of them. Gus calmly tells Walt and Jesse to get back to work, and increases oversight in the lab by installing security cameras and having Mike and Tyrus watch them while they work. Mike suggests to Gus that they may be able to drive a wedge between Walt and Jesse. Mike takes Jesse out of the lab to help pick up dead drops and carry out other tasks, and arranges for Jesse to foil a pre-planned attack on him, which boosts Jesse's confidence and increases his sense of loyalty to Mike and Gus. Gus is impressed by Jesse's mettle, and has Mike involve him in more work outside the lab. Worried about their safety, Walt gives Jesse a cigarette with a capsule of [[ricin]] hidden inside and tells him to poison Gus when he gets the chance, but Jesse does not follow through.\n\nGus arranges to meet with Don Eladio and the other cartel leaders to work out the differences that have caused the cartel to disrupt Gus' business and he brings Mike and Jesse with him. Jesse cooks a superior batch of meth and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico and work for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse.  During the party at Eladio's house to celebrate their rapprochement, Gus tricks Eladio and most of the other cartel leaders into drinking from a poisoned bottle of tequila. Gus takes the first drink to alleviate suspicion, but forces himself to vomit afterwards. During the fight that ensues after cartel leaders begin dying from the poison's effects, Jesse helps the ill Gus and wounded Mike escape, killing Hector's last living grandson, Joaquin Salamanca, in the process.  He brings them to Dr. Goodman's makeshift hospital Gus had previously arranged at his villa, where both receive treatment.  After recovering, Gus returns to Albuquerque and taunts Hector, telling him the cartel leaders are all dead, and that because of Joaquin's death, the Salamanca family line ends with Hector.  Jesse is no longer loyal to Walt and refuses to serve as his protector.  With the DEA beginning to connect Gale's death to Gus, Gus fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's family if he retaliates or informs.\n\nConsidering his life at risk, Walt attempts to kill Gus with a [[pipe bomb]] attached to his car, but Gus senses something amiss and walks away from the vehicle. Panicked, Walt recovers the bomb and hides at his home.  After unsuccessfully attempting to enlist Jesse in aiding him to kill Gus, Walt poisons Andrea's son Brock and convinces Jesse Gus is responsible.  Jesse agrees to help Walt and tells him about Gus' routine, including his visits to Hector at the nursing home.  Walt convinces Hector to help him by promising him final revenge on Gus. Hector pretends to have turned informant to the DEA.  Gus visits Hector to find out why he was at the DEA office.  Hector refuses to acknowledge Gus as Gus prepares to kill him with a lethal injection.  Before Gus administers the shot, Hector suddenly turns to face him, stares at him intently and repeatedly rings the bell on his wheelchair. Too late, Gus sees that the bell is attached to the detonator of Walt's pipe bomb, which Walt had installed on the underside of Hector's wheelchair. The resulting explosion kills Hector and Tyrus immediately. Gus appears uninjured as he calmly walks out of the room and adjusts his tie, but the scene slowly reveals that the explosion removed the right side of his face and head, and Gus falls to the floor and dies.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nThough Gus doesn't appear his death has numerous consequences. The continuing investigation into Gus' death reaches his restaurant business and the destroyed superlab, which Walt and Jesse burned after Gus died. Knowing that the security camera recordings stored on Gus' laptop can incriminate them, Walt, Jesse, and Mike use an electromagnet outside the police station to erase the laptop's hard drive while it is in the police evidence room.  The police recover the account numbers and access codes for the offshore accounts Gus previously set up to pay his employees for their silence and seize the accounts.  Mike, Walt, and Jesse partner in a new meth business, with Mike continuing to pay Gus' former employees out of his share of the profits in order to assure their continued silence.  When police successfully interdict these payments, Walt fears his identity will be exposed and attempts to obtain the employees' names from Mike so he can have them killed. When Mike refuses, Walt kills him. Walt then obtains the names from Lydia Rodart-Quayle and has Gus' former employees killed in prison before they can reveal his identity, effectively bringing an end to Gus' drug distribution empire.\n\n== Character development ==\n[[File:Giancarlo Esposito cropped retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Giancarlo Esposito]] portrays Gus Fring in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe character Gustavo Fring is named after the former [[Germany national football team|German International]] [[Torsten Frings]].<ref name=\"DieWelt\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article161675759/Breaking-Bad-Schurke-nach-deutschem-Trainer-benannt.html |title=Breaking-Bad-Schurke nach deutschem Trainer benannt |date=January 31, 2017 |work=[[Die Welt]] |access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> Initially, [[Giancarlo Esposito]] was offered a character that was described to him as \"very admirable, very polite\", and he decided to play that character as if he had \"some kind of a secret\".

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]].

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.
