He is widely considered one of the greatest military commanders in world history. His father, [[Hamilcar Barca]], was a leading Carthaginian commander during the [[First Punic War]] (264\u2013241&nbsp;BC). His younger brothers were [[Mago Barca|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]], and he was brother-in-law to [[Hasdrubal the Fair]]; all also commanded Carthaginian armies.\n\nHannibal lived during a period of great tension in the western Mediterranean Basin, triggered by the emergence of the [[Roman Republic]] as a great power after it had established its supremacy over Italy. Although Rome had won the [[First Punic War]], [[revanchism]] prevailed in Carthage, symbolised by the alleged pledge that Hannibal made to his father never to be a friend of Rome. The [[Second Punic War]] broke out in 218 after Hannibal's attack on [[Saguntum]], an ally of Rome in [[Hispania]].  He then made his famous military exploit of carrying war to Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] with his [[Elephants in war|African elephants]]. In his first few years in Italy, he won a succession of dramatic victories at [[Battle of the Trebia|the Trebia]], [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]], and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. He distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles accordingly. Hannibal's well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer several Italian cities allied to Rome. Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years, but could not win a decisive victory, as the Romans led by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]] avoided confrontation with him, instead waging a war of [[Fabian strategy|attrition]]. A counter-invasion of North Africa led by [[Scipio Africanus]] forced him to return to Carthage. Scipio eventually defeated Hannibal at the [[Battle of Zama]], having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAfter the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of [[shophet|sufet]]. He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome; however, those reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, and he fled into voluntary exile. During this time, he lived at the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] court, where he acted as military advisor to [[Antiochus III the Great]] in his war against Rome. Antiochus met defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] and was forced to accept Rome's terms, and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. His flight ended in the court of [[Bithynia]]. He was afterwards betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself.\n\nHannibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of Mediterranean antiquity, together with [[Philip of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], Scipio Africanus and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. [[Plutarch]] states that Scipio supposedly asked Hannibal \"who the greatest general was\", to which Hannibal replied \"either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Titus Flamininus'' 21.3\u20134.  Plutarch adds that \"when asked what his choices would be if he had beaten Scipio, he replied that he would be the best of them all\".  However, Plutarch gives another version in his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 8.2: \"Pyrrhus, Scipio, then himself\".</ref> Military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] called Hannibal the \"father of strategy\",<ref name=\"dodge\">{{cite book|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 BC|first=Theodore Ayrault |last=Dodge|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1995}}</ref> because Roman armies adopted elements of his military tactics into their own strategic arsenal.\n\n==Name==\n''Hannibal'' was a common [[Hannibal (given name)|Carthaginian personal name]]. It is recorded in Carthaginian sources as {{sc|\u1e25nb\u02bfl}}{{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&pg=PA565 565]}} ({{lang-xpu|\ud802\udd07\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0f\ud802\udd0b}}). It is a combination of the common Carthaginian masculine given name [[Hanno (disambiguation)|Hanno]] with the [[Northwest Semitic]] [[Canaan]]ite deity [[Baal]] (<small>lit.</small>{{nbsp}}\"lord\"). Its precise vocalization remains a matter of debate. Suggested readings include ''\u1e24annoba\u02bfal'',<ref name=brown>Brown, John Pairman. 2000.

Although he is by far the most famous Hannibal, when further clarification is necessary he is usually referred to as \"Hannibal, son of Hamilcar\", or Hannibal the Barcid, the latter term applying to the family of his father, Hamilcar Barca.  ''[[B-R-Q|Barca]]'' ({{lang-xpu|\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd12}}, {{sc|brq}}) is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[cognomen]] meaning \"lightning\" or \"thunderbolt\",<ref>{{citation |last=Sullivan |first=Robert Joseph |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d24CAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA489 |p=489 |year=1877 }}</ref> a surname acquired by Hamilcar on account of the swiftness and ferocity of his attacks.<ref>S. Lancel, ''Hannibal'' p.6.</ref>  Although they did not inherit the surname from their father, Hamilcar's progeny are collectively known as the [[Barcids]].<ref>Ameling, Walter ''Karthago: Studien zu Milit\u00e4r, Staat und Gesellschaft'' pp. 81\u20132.</ref>  Modern historians occasionally refer to Hannibal's brothers as \"Hasdrubal Barca\" and \"Mago Barca\" to distinguish them from the multitudes of other Carthaginians named ''Hasdrubal'' and ''Mago'',{{cn|date=January 2020}} but this practice is ahistorical, and is rarely applied to Hannibal.\n\n==Background and early career==\n[[File:Hasdrubal coin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Carthaginian coin depicting [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]] (245\u2013207 BC), one of Hannibal's younger brothers, wearing a ''[[diadem]]'']]\n[[File:Dishekel hispano-cartagin\u00e9s-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|Carthaginian]] [[shekel]], dated 237\u2013227 BC, depicting the Punic god [[Melqart]] (equivalent of [[Hercules]]/[[Heracles]]), most likely with the features of [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of Hannibal; on the reverse is a man riding an elephant]]\n[[File:Carthage, quarter shekel, 237-209 BC, SNG BM Spain 102.jpg|alt=|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|quarter shekel]] of Carthage, perhaps minted in Spain; the obverse may depict Hannibal with the traits of a young [[Melqart]]; the reverse features one of his famous [[war elephants]].<ref>''Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum, Great Britain, Volume IX, British Museum, Part 2: Spain'', London, 2002, n\u00b0 102.</ref>]]\n\nHannibal was one of the sons of [[Hamilcar Barca]], a Carthaginian leader. He was born in what is present day northern Tunisia, one of many [[Mediterranean]] regions colonised by the [[Canaanites]] from their homelands in [[Phoenicia]]. He had several sisters and two brothers, [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]] and [[Mago Barca|Mago]]. His brothers-in-law were [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] and the [[Numidians|Numidian]] king [[Naravas]]. He was still a child when his sisters married, and his brothers-in-law were close associates during his father's struggles in the [[Mercenary War]] and the Punic conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>Lancel, S. ''Hannibal'' p.6.</ref>\n\nAfter Carthage's defeat in the [[First Punic War]], Hamilcar set out to improve his family's and Carthage's fortunes. With that in mind and supported by [[C\u00e1diz|Gades]], Hamilcar began the subjugation of the tribes of the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage at the time was in such a poor state that it lacked a navy able to transport his army; instead, Hamilcar had to march his forces across [[Numidia]] towards the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and then cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969). ''Hannibal: Challenging Rome's Supremacy'' p.91.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Polybius]], Hannibal much later said that when he came upon his father and begged to go with him, Hamilcar agreed and demanded that he swear that as long as he lived he would never be a friend of Rome. There is even an account of him at a very young age (9 years old) begging his father to take him to an overseas war.

He maintained this post for eight years until 221&nbsp;BC. Soon the Romans became aware of an alliance between Carthage and the [[Celts]] of the [[Po Valley]] in [[Northern Italy]]. The Celts were amassing forces to invade farther south in Italy, presumably with Carthaginian backing. Therefore, the Romans preemptively invaded the Po region in 225&nbsp;BC.

De Beer was one of only three interpreters \u2013 the others being John Lazenby and Jakob Seibert \u2013 to have visited all the Alpine high passes and presented a view on which was most plausible.

The fired rockfall event is mentioned only by Livy; Polybius is mute on the subject and there is no evidence<ref>Mahaney, W.C., et al., 2009. \"The Traversette rockfall: geomorphological reconstruction and importance in interpreting classical history.\" Archaeometry, v. 52, no. 1, pp. 156\u2013172.</ref> of carbonized rock at the only two-tier rockfall in the Western Alps, located below the [[Col de la Traversette]] (Mahaney, 2008). If Polybius is correct in his figure for the number of troops that he commanded after the crossing of the Rh\u00f4ne, this would suggest that he had lost almost half of his force. Historians such as Serge Lancell have questioned the reliability of the figures for the number of troops that he had when he left Hispania.<ref>S. Lancel, ''Hannibal'' (1995; English translation 1999) page 60.</ref> From the start, he seems to have calculated that he would have to operate without aid from Hispania.\n\nHannibal's vision of military affairs was derived partly from the teaching of his Greek tutors and partly from experience gained alongside his father, and it stretched over most of the Hellenistic World of his time. Indeed, the breadth of his vision gave rise to his grand strategy of conquering Rome by opening a northern front and subduing allied city-states on the peninsula, rather than by attacking Rome directly. Historical events which led to the defeat of Carthage during the First Punic War when his father commanded the Carthaginian Army also led Hannibal to plan the invasion of Italy by land across the Alps.\n\nThe task was daunting, to say the least. It involved the mobilization of between 60,000 and 100,000 troops and the training of a war-elephant corps, all of which had to be provisioned along the way. The alpine invasion of Italy was a military operation that would shake the Mediterranean World of 218&nbsp;BC with repercussions for more than two decades.\n\n===Battle of Trebia===\n{{Main|Battle of the Trebia}}\n[[File:Battle trebia.gif|thumb|right|300px|A diagram depicting the tactics used in the [[Battle of the Trebia]]]]\nHannibal's perilous march brought him into the Roman territory and frustrated the attempts of the enemy to fight out the main issue on foreign ground. His sudden appearance among the [[Gaul]]s of the Po Valley, moreover, enabled him to detach those tribes from their new allegiance to the Romans before the Romans could take steps to check the rebellion. [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was the consul who commanded the Roman force sent to intercept Hannibal (he was also the father of Scipio Africanus). He had not expected Hannibal to make an attempt to cross the Alps, since the Romans were prepared to fight the war in the Iberian Peninsula. With a small detachment still positioned in Gaul, Scipio made an attempt to intercept Hannibal. He succeeded, through prompt decision and speedy movement, in transporting his army to Italy by sea in time to meet Hannibal. Hannibal's forces moved through the Po Valley and were engaged in the [[Battle of Ticinus]]. Here, Hannibal forced the Romans to evacuate the plain of [[Lombardy]], by virtue of his superior [[cavalry]].<ref name=\"dodge_old\">[[Theodore Ayrault Dodge|Dodge, Theodore]]. ''Hannibal''. Cambridge Massachusetts: De Capo Press, 1891 {{ISBN|0-306-81362-9}}</ref> The victory was minor, but it encouraged the Gauls and Ligurians to join the Carthaginian cause, whose troops bolstered his army back to around 40,000 men. Scipio was severely injured, his life only saved by the bravery of his son who rode back onto the field to rescue his fallen father. Scipio retreated across the Trebia to camp at [[Piacenza|Placentia]] with his army mostly intact.<ref name=\"dodge_old\" />\n\nThe other [[Roman consul]]ar army was rushed to the Po Valley. Even before news of the defeat at Ticinus had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered Consul [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] to bring his army back from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal, by skillful maneuvers, was in position to head him off, for he lay on the direct road between Placentia and Arminum, by which Sempronius would have to march to reinforce Scipio. He then captured Clastidium, from which he drew large amounts of supplies for his men. But this gain was not without loss, as Sempronius avoided Hannibal's watchfulness, slipped around his flank, and joined his colleague in his camp near the [[Trebbia|Trebia River]] near [[Piacenza|Placentia]]. There Hannibal had an opportunity to show his masterful military skill at the Trebia in December of the same year, after wearing down the superior Roman [[infantry]], when he cut it to pieces with a surprise attack and ambush from the flanks.\n\n===Battle of Lake Trasimene===\n{{Main|Battle of Lake Trasimene}}\nHannibal quartered his troops for the winter with the Gauls, whose support for him had abated. In the spring of 217&nbsp;BC, Hannibal decided to find a more reliable base of operations farther south. Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius (the new consuls of Rome) were expecting Hannibal to advance on Rome, and they took their armies to block the eastern and western routes that Hannibal could use.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'', Book III, 77</ref>\n[[File:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|right|300px|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], 217&nbsp;BC.<br />From the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]\nThe only alternative route to central Italy lay at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This area was practically one huge marsh, and happened to be overflowing more than usual during this particular season. Hannibal knew that this route was full of difficulties, but it remained the surest and certainly the quickest way to central Italy. [[Polybius]] claims that Hannibal's men marched for four days and three nights, \"through a land that was under water\", suffering terribly from fatigue and enforced want of sleep. He crossed without opposition over both the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] (during which he lost his right eye<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Selby Watson |author2=Marcus Junianus |author3=Justinus, Cornelius |author4=Nepos, Eutropius | url = https://archive.org/details/justincornelius00watsgoog |quote=hannibal greatest. | title = Justin, Cornelius Nepos, and Eutropius: Literally Translated, with Notes | year = 1853 | publisher = H.

As Polybius recounts, \"he [Hannibal] calculated that, if he passed the camp and made a descent into the district beyond, Flaminius (partly for fear of popular reproach and partly of personal irritation) would be unable to endure watching passively the devastation of the country but would spontaneously follow him... and give him opportunities for attack.\"<ref>[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]], ''Strategy'', New York City, New York, Penguin Group, 1967</ref> At the same time, Hannibal tried to break the allegiance of Rome's allies by proving that Flaminius was powerless to protect them. Despite this, Flaminius remained passively encamped at Arretium. Hannibal marched boldly around Flaminius' left flank, unable to draw him into battle by mere devastation, and effectively cut him off from Rome (thus executing the first recorded [[turning movement]] in military history). He then advanced through the uplands of [[Etruria]], provoking Flaminius into a hasty pursuit and catching him in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]]. There Hannibal destroyed Flaminius' army in the waters or on the adjoining slopes, killing Flaminius as well (see [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]]). This was the most costly ambush that the Romans ever sustained until the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against the [[Parthian Empire]].\n\nHannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance upon Rome, but he realized that, without [[siege engine]]s, he could not hope to take the capital. He preferred to exploit his victory by entering into central and southern Italy and encouraging a general revolt against the sovereign power.<ref>[http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/hannibal/Parker_J_P_01.pdf USAWC] ''Comparing Strategies of the 2nd Punic War'' by James Parker.

Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the [[Fabian strategy|strategy named after him]], avoiding open battle while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal's vicinity in order to watch and limit his movements.\n\nHannibal ravaged Apulia but was unable to bring Fabius to battle, so he decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. Fabius closely followed Hannibal's path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn out of the defensive. This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed that it was a form of cowardice.\n\nHannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated lowlands of Campania, but Fabius had ensured that all the passes were blocked out of Campania. To avoid this, Hannibal deceived the Romans into thinking that the Carthaginian army was going to escape through the woods. As the Romans moved off towards the woods, Hannibal's army occupied the pass, and then made their way through the pass unopposed. Fabius was within striking distance but in this case his caution worked against him. Smelling a stratagem (rightly), he stayed put. For the winter, Hannibal found comfortable quarters in the [[Apulia]]n plain. What Hannibal achieved in extricating his army was, as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] puts it, \"a classic of ancient generalship, finding its way into nearly every historical narrative of the war and being used by later military manuals\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Adrian K. ''The Roman Army at War 100 BC&nbsp;\u2014 AD 200'', New York</ref> This was a severe blow to Fabius' prestige and soon after this his period of dictatorial power ended.\n\n===Battle of Cannae===\n[[File:Battle cannae destruction.gif|right|thumb|330px|Destruction of the Roman army (red), courtesy of the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]{{Main|Battle of Cannae}}\nIn the spring of 216&nbsp;BC, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain.

In the meantime, the Romans hoped to gain success through sheer strength and weight of numbers, and they raised a new army of unprecedented size, estimated by some to be as large as 100,000 men, but more likely around 50\u201380,000.<ref name=\"cottrell\">Cottrell, Leonard, ''Enemy of Rome'', Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans and allied legions resolved to confront Hannibal and marched southward to [[Apulia]]. They eventually found him on the left bank of the Aufidus River, and encamped {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On this occasion, the two armies were combined into one, the consuls having to alternate their command on a daily basis. Varro was in command on the first day, a man of reckless and hubristic nature (according to Livy) and determined to defeat Hannibal.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> Hannibal capitalized on the eagerness of Varro and drew him into a trap by using an [[Pincer movement|envelopment tactic]]. This eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the combat area. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak center, but the Libyan mercenaries on the wings, swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible. Hannibal's chief cavalry commander [[Maharbal]] led the mobile [[Numidian cavalry]] on the right, and they shattered the Roman cavalry opposing them. Hannibal's Iberian and Gallic heavy cavalry, led by Hanno on the left, defeated the Roman heavy cavalry, and then both the Carthaginian heavy cavalry and the Numidians attacked the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape.\n\nDue to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal managed to surround and destroy all but a small remnant of his enemy, despite his own inferior numbers. Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000\u201370,000 Romans were killed or captured.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Among the dead were Roman Consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], as well as two consuls for the preceding year, two [[quaestor]]s, twenty-nine out of the forty-eight [[military tribune]]s, and an additional eighty senators (at a time when the Roman Senate was composed of no more than 300 men, this constituted 25%\u201330% of the governing body). This makes the battle one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], and one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history (in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day).<ref name=\"cottrell\"/>\n\nAfter Cannae, the Romans were very hesitant to confront Hannibal in pitched battle, preferring instead to weaken him by attrition, relying on their advantages of interior lines, supply, and manpower. As a result, Hannibal fought no more major battles in Italy for the rest of the war. It is believed that his refusal to bring the war to Rome itself was due to a lack of commitment from Carthage of men, money, and material&nbsp;\u2014 principally siege equipment. Whatever the reason, the choice prompted Maharbal to say, \"Hannibal, you know how to gain a victory, but not how to use one.\"<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps'', p.

Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed [[tyrant]] [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]]. It is often argued that, if Hannibal had received proper material reinforcements from Carthage, he might have succeeded with a direct attack upon Rome. Instead, he had to content himself with subduing the fortresses that still held out against him, and the only other notable event of 216&nbsp;BC was the defection of certain Italian territories, including [[Capua]], the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. However, only a few of the Italian city-states that he had expected to gain as allies defected to him.\n\n===Stalemate===\nThe war in Italy settled into a strategic stalemate. The Romans used the [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] strategy that Fabius had taught them, and which, they finally realized, was the only feasible means of defeating Hannibal.<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps: The Invasion of Italy and the Second Punic War'', p.

His immediate objectives were reduced to minor operations centered mainly round the cities of [[Campania]].\n\nThe forces detached to his lieutenants were generally unable to hold their own, and neither his home government nor his new ally Philip V of Macedon helped to make up his losses. His position in southern Italy, therefore, became increasingly difficult and his chance of ultimately conquering Rome grew ever more remote. Hannibal still won a number of notable victories: completely destroying two Roman armies in 212&nbsp;BC, and killing two consuls (including the famed [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]) in a battle in 208&nbsp;BC. However, Hannibal slowly began losing ground\u2014inadequately supported by his Italian allies, abandoned by his government (either because of jealousy or simply because Carthage was overstretched), and unable to match Rome's resources. He was never able to bring about another grand decisive victory that could produce a lasting strategic change.\n\nCarthaginian political will was embodied in the ruling oligarchy. There was a Carthaginian Senate, but the real power was with the inner \"[[Council of 30 Nobles]]\" and the board of judges from ruling families known as the \"[[Hundred and Four]]\". These two bodies came from the wealthy, commercial families of Carthage. Two political factions operated in Carthage: the war party, also known as the \"[[Barcid]]s\" (Hannibal's family name); and the peace party led by [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]]. Hanno had been instrumental in denying Hannibal's requested reinforcements following the battle at Cannae.\n\nHannibal started the war without the full backing of Carthaginian oligarchy. His attack of Saguntum had presented the oligarchy with a choice of war with Rome or loss of prestige in Iberia. The oligarchy, not Hannibal, controlled the strategic resources of Carthage. Hannibal constantly sought reinforcements from either Iberia or North Africa. Hannibal's troops who were lost in combat were replaced with less well-trained and motivated mercenaries from Italy or Gaul. The commercial interests of the Carthaginian oligarchy dictated the reinforcement and supply of Iberia rather than Hannibal throughout the campaign.\n\n===Hannibal's retreat in Italy===\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Scipio Africanus]] from the [[Villa of the Papyri]]]]\nIn March 212&nbsp;BC, Hannibal [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)|captured]] [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in a surprise attack but he failed to obtain control of its harbour. The tide was slowly turning against him, and in favor of Rome.\n\nThe Roman consuls mounted a [[Battle of Capua|siege of Capua]] in 212 BC. Hannibal attacked them, forcing their withdrawal from Campania. He moved to Lucania and destroyed a 16,000-man Roman army at the [[Battle of the Silarus]], with 15,000 Romans killed. Another opportunity presented itself soon after, a Roman army of 18,000 men being destroyed by Hannibal at the [[Battle of Herdonia (212 BC)|first battle of Herdonia]] with 16,000 Roman dead, freeing Apulia from the Romans for the year. The Roman consuls mounted another [[Battle of Capua (211 BC)|siege of Capua]] in 211&nbsp;BC, conquering the city. Hannibal attempted to lift the siege with an assault on the Roman siege lines but failed. He marched on Rome to force the recall of the Roman armies. He drew off 15,000 Roman soldiers, but the siege continued and Capua fell. In 212 BC, Marcellus [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|conquered]] Syracuse and the Romans destroyed the Carthaginian army in Sicily in 211\u2013210 BC. In 210 BC, the Romans entered into an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] to counter [[Philip V of Macedon]]. Philip, who attempted to exploit Rome's preoccupation in Italy to conquer [[Illyria]], now found himself under attack from several sides at once and was quickly subdued by Rome and her Greek allies.\n\nIn 210&nbsp;BC, Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by inflicting a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Herdonia (210 BC)|Battle of Herdonia]] (modern [[Ordona]]) in Apulia upon a [[proconsul]]ar army and, in 208&nbsp;BC, destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of [[Locri]] at the [[Battle of Petelia]]. But with the loss of Tarentum in 209&nbsp;BC and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of [[Samnium]] and [[Lucania]], his hold on south Italy was almost lost. In 207&nbsp;BC, he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the [[battle of the Metaurus]], he retired to [[Calabria]], where he maintained himself for the ensuing years. His brother's head had been cut off, carried across Italy, and tossed over the palisade of Hannibal's camp as a cold message of the iron-clad will of the Roman Republic. The combination of these events marked the end to Hannibal's success in Italy. With the failure of his brother Mago in [[Liguria]] (205\u2013203&nbsp;BC) and of his own negotiations with Phillip V, the last hope of recovering his ascendancy in Italy was lost. In 203&nbsp;BC, after nearly fifteen years of fighting in Italy, and with the military fortunes of Carthage rapidly declining, Hannibal was recalled to Carthage to direct the defense of his native country against a Roman invasion under Scipio Africanus.\n\n{{anchor|Conclusion of the Second Punic War}}\n\n==Conclusion of the Second Punic War (203\u2013201 BC)==\n{{anchor|Return}}\n\n===Return to Carthage===\n[[File:Campagna africana di Scipione 202 aC.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Final act of the Second Punic War with the [[battle of Zama]] (202 BC)]]\n\nIn 203&nbsp;BC, Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party in Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno Lacinia]] at [[Crotone|Crotona]], he sailed back to Africa.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12582/12582-h/12582-h.htm#b46 |title=28.46 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> His arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, which placed him in command of a combined force of [[Africa]]n [[conscription|levies]] and his mercenaries from Italy. In 202&nbsp;BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a fruitless peace conference. Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due to Roman allegations of \"Punic Faith,\" referring to the breach of protocols that ended the First Punic War by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, and a Carthaginan attack on a stranded Roman fleet. Scipio and Carthage had worked out a peace plan, which was approved by Rome. The terms of the treaty were quite modest, but the war had been long for the Romans. Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire. Masinissa ([[Numidia]]) was to be independent. Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity. But Carthage then made a terrible blunder. Its long-suffering citizens had captured a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and stripped it of supplies, an action that aggravated the faltering negotiations. Meanwhile, Hannibal, recalled from Italy by the Carthaginian Senate, had returned with his army. Fortified by both Hannibal and the supplies, the Carthaginians rebuffed the treaty and Roman protests. The decisive [[battle of Zama]] soon followed; the defeat removed Hannibal's air of invincibility.\n\n===Battle of Zama (202 BC)===\n{{Main|Battle of Zama}}\nUnlike most battles of the [[Second Punic War]], at Zama, the Romans were superior in cavalry and the Carthaginians had the edge in infantry. This Roman cavalry superiority was due to the betrayal of [[Masinissa]], who had earlier assisted Carthage in Iberia, but changed sides in 206&nbsp;BC with the promise of land and due to his personal conflicts with [[Syphax]], a Carthaginian ally. Although the aging Hannibal was suffering from mental exhaustion and deteriorating health after years of campaigning in Italy, the Carthaginians still had the advantage in numbers and were boosted by the presence of 80 war elephants.<!-- 80 elephants, cited to sources by main article -->\n\n[[File:Slaget ved Zama - Cornelis Cort, 1567.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of the [[Battle of Zama]] by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567. Note that [[Asian elephant]]s are illustrated rather than the very small [[North African elephant]]s used by Carthage.]]\n\nThe Roman cavalry won an early victory by swiftly routing the Carthaginian horse, and standard Roman tactics for limiting the effectiveness of the Carthaginian war elephants were successful, including playing trumpets to frighten the elephants into running into the Carthaginian lines. Some historians say that the elephants routed the Carthaginian cavalry and not the Romans, whilst others suggest that it was actually a tactical retreat planned by Hannibal.<ref>Scullard, H.H. ''Scipio Africanus: Soldier and Politician'', p. 150, 1970. Gabriel, Richard. ''Scipio Africanus: Rome's Greatest General'', p. 192, 2008</ref> Whatever the truth, the battle remained closely fought. At one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory, but Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry, having routed the Carthaginian cavalry, attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to collapse.\n\nWith their foremost general defeated, the Carthaginians had no choice but to surrender. Carthage lost approximately 20,000 troops with an additional 15,000 wounded. In contrast, the Romans suffered only 2,500 casualties. The last major battle of the Second Punic War resulted in a loss of respect for Hannibal by his fellow Carthaginians. The conditions of defeat were such that Carthage could no longer battle for Mediterranean supremacy.\n\n==Later career==\n{{anchor|Peacetime Carthage}}\n[[File:Carthage Tetradrachm Tanit &amp; Horse, with a Serrated Edge.

When Phormio finished a discourse on the duties of a general, Hannibal was asked his opinion. He replied, \"I have seen during my life many old fools; but this one beats them all.\" Another story, according to [[Aulus Gellius]], is that when Antiochus III showed off the gigantic and elaborately equipped army he had created to invade Greece to Hannibal, he asked him if they would be enough for the Roman Republic, to which Hannibal replied, \"I think all this will be enough, yes, quite enough, for the Romans, even though they are most avaricious.\"<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]].

Even [[Cicero]], when he talked of Rome and its two great enemies, spoke of the \"honourable\" [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and the \"cruel\" Hannibal. Yet a different picture sometimes emerges. When Hannibal's successes had brought about the death of two [[Roman consul]]s, he vainly searched for the body of [[Gaius Flaminius]] on the shores of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]], held ceremonial rituals in recognition of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (General)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], and sent [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]]' ashes back to his family in Rome. Any bias attributed to [[Polybius]], however, is more troublesome. [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]] considered the Greek scholar a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus]],<ref>[[Ronald J. Mellor|Mellor, Ronald J.]] ''The Historians of Ancient Rome''</ref> while H. Ormerod does not view him as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' when it came to his pet peeves, the Aetolians, the Carthaginians, and the Cretans.<ref>Omerod, H. ''Piracy in the Ancient World'', p.141</ref> Nonetheless, Polybius did recognize that the reputation for cruelty the Romans attached to Hannibal might in reality have been due to mistaking him for one of his officers, Hannibal Monomachus.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969).

M. W.

According to [[Appian]], several years after the Second Punic War, Hannibal served as a political advisor in the Seleucid Kingdom and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] arrived there on a diplomatic mission from Rome.\n{{quote|It is said that at one of their meetings in the gymnasium Scipio and Hannibal had a conversation on the subject of generalship, in the presence of a number of bystanders, and that Scipio asked Hannibal whom he considered the greatest general, to which the latter replied, \"[[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedonia]]\".\n\nTo this Scipio assented since he also yielded the first place to Alexander. Then he asked Hannibal whom he placed next, and he replied, \"[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]\", because he considered boldness the first qualification of a general; \"for it would not be possible\", he said, \"to find two kings more enterprising than these\".\n\nScipio was rather nettled by this, but nevertheless he asked Hannibal to whom he would give the third place, expecting that at least the third would be assigned to him; but Hannibal replied, \"to myself; for when I was a young man I conquered Hispania and crossed the Alps with an army, the first after [[Hercules]].\"\n\nAs Scipio saw that he was likely to prolong his self-laudation he said, laughing, \"where would you place yourself, Hannibal, if you had not been defeated by me?\" Hannibal, now perceiving his jealousy, replied, \"in that case I should have put myself before Alexander\". Thus Hannibal continued his self-laudation, but flattered Scipio in an indirect manner by suggesting that he had conquered one who was the superior of Alexander.\n\nAt the end of this conversation Hannibal invited Scipio to be his guest, and Scipio replied that he would be so gladly if Hannibal were not living with [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]], who was held in suspicion by the Romans. Thus did they, in a manner worthy of great commanders, cast aside their enmity at the end of their wars.<ref name=\"appian\">Appian, ''History of the Syrian Wars'', \u00a710 and \u00a711 at [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html Livius.org]</ref>}}\n\nMilitary academies all over the world continue to study Hannibal's exploits, especially his victory at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]].<ref>{{cite document | title=THE INFLUENCE OF HANNIBAL OF CARTHAGE ON THE ART OF WAR AND HOW HIS LEGACY HAS BEEN INTERPRETED | author=RICK JAY MESSER|citeseerx = 10.1.1.582.1385}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hannibal in Italy by Jacopo Ripanda - Sala di Annibale - Palazzo dei Conservatori - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|right| Hannibal's celebrated feat in crossing the Alps with [[war elephant]]s passed into European legend: detail of a fresco by [[Jacopo Ripanda]], {{circa | 1510}}, [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nMaximilian Otto Bismarck Caspari, in his article in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1910-1911), praises Hannibal in these words:\n{{quotation|As to the transcendent military genius of Hannibal there cannot be two opinions. The man who for fifteen years could hold his ground in a hostile country against several powerful armies and a succession of able generals must have been a commander and a [[:wikt:tactician|tactician]] of supreme capacity. In the use of strategies and [[ambush|ambuscades]] he certainly surpassed all other generals of antiquity. Wonderful as his achievements were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he received from Carthage. As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh levies on the spot. We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it was of North Africans, Iberians and [[Gauls]]. Again, all we know of him comes for the most part from hostile sources. The Romans feared and hated him so much that they could not do him justice. Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices were equally great, among which he singles out his more than Punic perfidy and an inhuman cruelty. For the first there would seem to be no further justification than that he was consummately skillful in the use of ambuscades. For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare. Sometimes he contrasts most favorably with his enemy. No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated by [[Gaius Claudius Nero]] on the vanquished [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. Polybius merely says that he was accused of cruelty by the Romans and of avarice by the Carthaginians. He had indeed bitter enemies, and his life was one continuous struggle against destiny. For steadfastness of purpose, for organizing capacity and a mastery of military science he has perhaps never had an equal.<ref name=\"1911britannica\">{{Cite EB1911 |last= Caspari |first= M.O.B. |wstitle= Hannibal (general)}}</ref>}}\n\nEven the Roman chroniclers acknowledged Hannibal's supreme military leadership, writing that \"he never required others to do what he could and would not do himself\".<ref>[http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/hannibal.html Hannibal] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160101031649/http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/hannibal.html |date= 1 January 2016 }} at ''CarpeNoctem.tv''</ref>\nAccording to Polybius 23, 13, p.&nbsp;423:\n{{quote |It is a remarkable and very cogent proof of Hannibal's having been by nature a real leader and far superior to anyone else in statesmanship, that though he spent seventeen years in the field, passed through so many barbarous countries, and employed to aid him in desperate and extraordinary enterprises numbers of men of different nations and languages, no one ever dreamt of conspiring against him, nor was he ever deserted by those who had once joined him or submitted to him.}}\n[[File:Museum of Antiquities Hannibal.JPG|thumb |A bust of Hannibal, 17th century, [[Museum of Antiquities (Saskatoon)]]]]\n\nCount [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] developed his eponymously titled \"[[Schlieffen Plan]]\" (1905/1906) from his military studies, with a particularly heavy emphasis on the envelopment technique which Hannibal employed to surround and destroy the Roman army in the [[Battle of Cannae]].<ref>{{cite book|ref= harv|last= Daly|first= Gregory|authorlink= Gregory Daly|title= Cannae: The Experience of Battle in the Second Punic War|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qayiX4SFonkC&pg=PR10|year= 2003|publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-32743-5}}, p. x</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref= harv|last= Cottrell|first= Leonard|authorlink= Leonard Cottrell|title= Hannibal: Enemy of Rome|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zRx9xyqkJKwC&pg=RA4-PA134|year= 1992|publisher= Perseus Books Group|isbn= 978-0-306-80498-4}}, p. 134</ref> [[George S.

No battle in history is a finer sample of tactics than Cannae. But he was yet greater in logistics and strategy. No captain ever marched to and fro among so many armies of troops superior to his own numbers and material as fearlessly and skillfully as he. No man ever held his own so long or so ably against such odds. Constantly overmatched by better soldiers, led by generals always respectable, often of great ability, he yet defied all their efforts to drive him from Italy, for half a generation. Excepting in the case of Alexander, and some few isolated instances, all wars up to the Second Punic War, had been decided largely, if not entirely, by battle-tactics. Strategic ability had been comprehended only on a minor scale. Armies had marched towards each other, had fought in parallel order, and the conqueror had imposed terms on his opponent. Any variation from this rule consisted in ambuscades or other stratagems. That war could be waged by avoiding in lieu of seeking battle; that the results of a victory could be earned by attacks upon the enemy's communications, by flank-maneuvers, by seizing positions from which safely to threaten him in case he moved, and by other devices of strategy, was not understood... [However] For the first time in the history of war, we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harassing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster\u2014all with a well-conceived purpose of placing his opponent at a strategic disadvantage...

He is widely considered one of the greatest military commanders in world history. His father, [[Hamilcar Barca]], was a leading Carthaginian commander during the [[First Punic War]] (264\u2013241&nbsp;BC). His younger brothers were [[Mago Barca|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]], and he was brother-in-law to [[Hasdrubal the Fair]]; all also commanded Carthaginian armies.\n\nHannibal lived during a period of great tension in the western Mediterranean Basin, triggered by the emergence of the [[Roman Republic]] as a great power after it had established its supremacy over Italy. Although Rome had won the First Punic War, [[revanchism]] prevailed in Carthage, symbolised by the alleged pledge that Hannibal made to his father never to be a friend of Rome. The [[Second Punic War]] broke out in 218 after Hannibal's attack on [[Saguntum]], an ally of Rome in [[Hispania]].  He then made his famous military exploit of carrying war to Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] with his [[Elephants in war|African elephants]]. In his first few years in Italy, he won a succession of dramatic victories at [[Battle of the Trebia|the Trebia]], [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]], and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. He distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles accordingly. Hannibal's well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer several Italian cities allied to Rome. Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years, but could not win a decisive victory, as the Romans led by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]] avoided confrontation with him, instead waging a war of [[Fabian strategy|attrition]]. A counter-invasion of North Africa led by [[Scipio Africanus]] forced him to return to Carthage. Scipio eventually defeated Hannibal at the [[Battle of Zama]], having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAfter the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of [[shophet|sufet]]. He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome; however, those reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, and he fled into voluntary exile. During this time, he lived at the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] court, where he acted as military advisor to [[Antiochus III the Great]] in his war against Rome. Antiochus met defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] and was forced to accept Rome's terms, and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. His flight ended in the court of [[Bithynia]]. He was afterwards betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself.\n\nHannibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of Mediterranean antiquity, together with [[Philip of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], Scipio Africanus and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. [[Plutarch]] states that Scipio supposedly asked Hannibal \"who the greatest general was\", to which Hannibal replied \"either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Titus Flamininus'' 21.3\u20134.  Plutarch adds that \"when asked what his choices would be if he had beaten Scipio, he replied that he would be the best of them all\".  However, Plutarch gives another version in his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 8.2: \"Pyrrhus, Scipio, then himself\".</ref> Military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] called Hannibal the \"father of strategy\",<ref name=\"dodge\">{{cite book|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 BC|first=Theodore Ayrault |last=Dodge|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1995}}</ref> because Roman armies adopted elements of his military tactics into their own strategic arsenal.\n\n==Name==\n''Hannibal'' was a common [[Hannibal (given name)|Carthaginian personal name]]. It is recorded in Carthaginian sources as {{sc|\u1e25nb\u02bfl}}{{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&pg=PA565 565]}} ({{lang-xpu|\ud802\udd07\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0f\ud802\udd0b}}). It is a combination of the common Carthaginian masculine given name [[Hanno (disambiguation)|Hanno]] with the [[Northwest Semitic]] [[Canaan]]ite deity [[Baal]] (<small>lit.</small>{{nbsp}}\"lord\"). Its precise vocalization remains a matter of debate. Suggested readings include ''\u1e24annoba\u02bfal'',<ref name=brown>Brown, John Pairman. 2000.

Although he is by far the most famous Hannibal, when further clarification is necessary he is usually referred to as \"Hannibal, son of Hamilcar\", or Hannibal the Barcid, the latter term applying to the family of his father, Hamilcar Barca.  ''[[B-R-Q|Barca]]'' ({{lang-xpu|\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd12}}, {{sc|brq}}) is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[cognomen]] meaning \"lightning\" or \"thunderbolt\",<ref>{{citation |last=Sullivan |first=Robert Joseph |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d24CAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA489 |p=489 |year=1877 }}</ref> a surname acquired by Hamilcar on account of the swiftness and ferocity of his attacks.<ref>S.

He was born in what is present day northern Tunisia, one of many [[Mediterranean]] regions colonised by the [[Canaanites]] from their homelands in [[Phoenicia]]. He had several sisters and two brothers, [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]] and [[Mago Barca|Mago]]. His brothers-in-law were [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] and the [[Numidians|Numidian]] king [[Naravas]]. He was still a child when his sisters married, and his brothers-in-law were close associates during his father's struggles in the [[Mercenary War]] and the Punic conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>Lancel, S. ''Hannibal'' p.6.</ref>\n\nAfter Carthage's defeat in the [[First Punic War]], Hamilcar set out to improve his family's and Carthage's fortunes. With that in mind and supported by [[C\u00e1diz|Gades]], Hamilcar began the subjugation of the tribes of the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage at the time was in such a poor state that it lacked a navy able to transport his army; instead, Hamilcar had to march his forces across [[Numidia]] towards the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and then cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969). ''Hannibal: Challenging Rome's Supremacy'' p.91.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Polybius]], Hannibal much later said that when he came upon his father and begged to go with him, Hamilcar agreed and demanded that he swear that as long as he lived he would never be a friend of Rome. There is even an account of him at a very young age (9 years old) begging his father to take him to an overseas war. In the story, Hannibal's father took him up and brought him to a sacrificial chamber. Hamilcar held Hannibal over the fire roaring in the chamber and made him swear that he would never be a friend of Rome. Other sources report that Hannibal told his father, \"I swear so soon as age will permit...I will use fire and steel to arrest the destiny of Rome.\"<ref name=\"dodge\"/><ref>[http://www.reversespins.com/patton.html Reverse Spins] ''Patton, the Second Coming of Hannibal''.</ref> According to the tradition, Hannibal's oath took place in the town of [[Pe\u00f1\u00edscola]], today part of the [[Valencian Community]], Spain.<ref>Hilowitz, Beverley (1974).

Hasdrubal pursued a policy of consolidation of Carthage's Iberian interests, even signing a [[treaty]] with Rome whereby Carthage would not expand north of the [[Ebro]] so long as Rome did not expand south of it.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969).

The Roman scholar [[Livy]] gives a depiction of the young Carthaginian: \"No sooner had he arrived...the old soldiers fancied they saw Hamilcar in his youth given back to them; the same bright look; the same fire in his eye, the same trick of countenance and features. Never was one and the same spirit more skillful to meet opposition, to obey, or to command[.]\"<ref name=\"brainfly1\"/>\n\nLivy also records that Hannibal married a woman of [[Castulo]], a powerful Spanish city closely allied with Carthage.<ref name=\"brainfly1\"/> The Roman [[epic poet]] [[Silius Italicus]] names her as [[Imilce]].<ref>Silius Italicus, ''Punica'', III, 97</ref> Silius suggests a Greek origin for Imilce, but [[Gilbert Charles-Picard]] argued for a Punic heritage based on an etymology from the Semitic root m-l-k ('chief, the 'king').<ref>[[Gilbert Charles-Picard|Picard, Gilbert Charles]](1967), ''Hannibal'' p. 119</ref> Silius also suggests the existence of a son,<ref>Silius Italicus, ''Punica'', III, 63-64</ref> who is otherwise not attested by Livy, [[Polybius]], or [[Appian]].\n\nAfter he assumed command, Hannibal spent two years consolidating his holdings and completing the conquest of Hispania, south of the Ebro.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dodge|first=Theodore Ayrault|authorlink=Theodore Ayrault Dodge|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 B.C., with a Detailed Account of the Second Punic War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8nOkDyOwnUC&pg=PA143|year=2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81362-7}}, page 143</ref> In his first campaign, Hannibal attacked and stormed the [[Olcades]]' strongest centre, Alithia, which promptly led to their surrender, and brought Punic power close to the River [[Tagus]]. His following campaign in 220 BC was against the [[Vaccaei]] to the west, where he stormed the Vaccaen strongholds of Helmantice and Arbucala. On his return home, laden with many spoils, a coalition of Spanish tribes, led by the [[Carpetani]], attacked, and Hannibal won his first major battlefield success and showed off his tactical skills at the battle of the River Tagus.<ref>Hoyos, D. ''Hannibal's Dynasty: Power and Politics in the Western Mediterranean, 247\u2013183 BC'', pp. 89\u201391, 2003</ref> However, Rome, fearing the growing strength of Hannibal in Iberia, made an alliance with the city of [[Sagunto|Saguntum]], which lay a considerable distance south of the River Ebro and claimed the city as its [[protectorate]]. Hannibal not only perceived this as a breach of the treaty signed with Hasdrubal, but as he was already planning an attack on Rome, this was his way to start the war. So he laid [[siege]] to the city, which fell after eight months.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969). ''Hannibal: Challenging Rome's Supremacy'' p.112-113.</ref>\n\nHannibal sent the booty from Saguntum to Carthage, a shrewd move which gained him much support from the government; Livy records that only [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]] spoke against him.<ref name=\"brainfly1\"/> In Rome, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] reacted to this apparent violation of the treaty by dispatching a delegation to Carthage to demand whether Hannibal had destroyed Saguntum in accordance with orders from Carthage.

He maintained this post for eight years until 221&nbsp;BC. Soon the Romans became aware of an alliance between Carthage and the [[Celts]] of the [[Po Valley]] in [[Northern Italy]]. The Celts were amassing forces to invade farther south in Italy, presumably with Carthaginian backing. Therefore, the Romans preemptively invaded the Po region in 225&nbsp;BC. By 220&nbsp;BC, the Romans had annexed the area as [[Cisalpine Gaul]].<ref>Fagan, Garret G. \"The History of Ancient Rome\". Lecture 13: \"The Second Punic War\". Teaching Company, \"Great Courses\" series.</ref> Hasdrubal was assassinated around the same time (221&nbsp;BC), bringing Hannibal to the fore. It seems that the Romans lulled themselves into a false sense of security, having dealt with the threat of a Gallo-Carthaginian invasion, and perhaps knowing that the original Carthaginian commander had been killed.\n\nHannibal departed [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] in late spring of 218&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lancel|first=Serge|authorlink=Serge Lancel|title=Hannibal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uVh2FH-LF4C&pg=PA225|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-21848-7}}, p. 225</ref> He fought his way through the northern tribes to the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]], subduing the tribes through clever mountain tactics and stubborn fighting.

Hunt responds to this by proposing that Hannibal's Celtic guides purposefully misguided the Carthaginian general.\n\nMost recently, W. C.

Mahaney ''et al''. have concluded that this and other evidence strongly supports the Col de la Traversette as being the 'Hannibalic Route' as had been argued by [[Gavin de Beer]] in 1974. De Beer was one of only three interpreters \u2013 the others being John Lazenby and Jakob Seibert \u2013 to have visited all the Alpine high passes and presented a view on which was most plausible. Both De Beer and Siebert had selected the Col de la Traversette as the one most closely matching the ancient descriptions.<ref>de Beer, S. G., 1974, Hannibal: The struggle for power in the Mediterranean, Book Club Associates, London.</ref> [[Polybius]] wrote that Hannibal had crossed the highest of the Alpine passes: Col de la Traversette, between the upper Guil valley and the upper Po river is the highest pass. It is moreover the most southerly, as [[Varro]] in his ''De re rustica'' relates, agreeing that Hannibal's Pass was the highest in Western Alps and the most southerly. Mahaney ''et al''. argue that factors used by De Beer to support Col de la Traversette including \"gauging ancient place names against modern, close scrutiny of times of flood in major rivers and distant viewing of the Po plains\" taken together with \"massive radiocarbon and microbiological and parasitical evidence\" from the alluvial sediments either side of the pass furnish \"supporting evidence, proof if you will\" that Hannibal's invasion went that way.<ref>W.

G., 1969, Hannibal: Challenging Rome's supremacy, Viking, New York, NY. pp. 163-180</ref>\n\nBy Livy's account, the crossing was accomplished in the face of huge difficulties.<ref>Livy History of Rome book21,36</ref> These Hannibal surmounted with ingenuity, such as when he used [[fire-setting|vinegar and fire]] to break through a rockfall.<ref>Livy History of Rome, Book 21 sections 32\u201336</ref> According to Polybius, he arrived in Italy accompanied by 20,000-foot soldiers, 4,000 horsemen, and only a few elephants. The fired rockfall event is mentioned only by Livy; Polybius is mute on the subject and there is no evidence<ref>Mahaney, W.C., et al., 2009. \"The Traversette rockfall: geomorphological reconstruction and importance in interpreting classical history.\" Archaeometry, v. 52, no. 1, pp. 156\u2013172.</ref> of carbonized rock at the only two-tier rockfall in the Western Alps, located below the [[Col de la Traversette]] (Mahaney, 2008). If Polybius is correct in his figure for the number of troops that he commanded after the crossing of the Rh\u00f4ne, this would suggest that he had lost almost half of his force. Historians such as Serge Lancell have questioned the reliability of the figures for the number of troops that he had when he left Hispania.<ref>S. Lancel, ''Hannibal'' (1995; English translation 1999) page 60.</ref> From the start, he seems to have calculated that he would have to operate without aid from Hispania.\n\nHannibal's vision of military affairs was derived partly from the teaching of his Greek tutors and partly from experience gained alongside his father, and it stretched over most of the Hellenistic World of his time. Indeed, the breadth of his vision gave rise to his grand strategy of conquering Rome by opening a northern front and subduing allied city-states on the peninsula, rather than by attacking Rome directly. Historical events which led to the defeat of Carthage during the First Punic War when his father commanded the Carthaginian Army also led Hannibal to plan the invasion of Italy by land across the Alps.\n\nThe task was daunting, to say the least. It involved the mobilization of between 60,000 and 100,000 troops and the training of a war-elephant corps, all of which had to be provisioned along the way. The alpine invasion of Italy was a military operation that would shake the Mediterranean World of 218&nbsp;BC with repercussions for more than two decades.\n\n===Battle of Trebia===\n{{Main|Battle of the Trebia}}\n[[File:Battle trebia.gif|thumb|right|300px|A diagram depicting the tactics used in the [[Battle of the Trebia]]]]\nHannibal's perilous march brought him into the Roman territory and frustrated the attempts of the enemy to fight out the main issue on foreign ground. His sudden appearance among the [[Gaul]]s of the Po Valley, moreover, enabled him to detach those tribes from their new allegiance to the Romans before the Romans could take steps to check the rebellion. [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was the consul who commanded the Roman force sent to intercept Hannibal (he was also the father of Scipio Africanus). He had not expected Hannibal to make an attempt to cross the Alps, since the Romans were prepared to fight the war in the Iberian Peninsula. With a small detachment still positioned in Gaul, Scipio made an attempt to intercept Hannibal. He succeeded, through prompt decision and speedy movement, in transporting his army to Italy by sea in time to meet Hannibal. Hannibal's forces moved through the Po Valley and were engaged in the [[Battle of Ticinus]]. Here, Hannibal forced the Romans to evacuate the plain of [[Lombardy]], by virtue of his superior [[cavalry]].<ref name=\"dodge_old\">[[Theodore Ayrault Dodge|Dodge, Theodore]]. ''Hannibal''. Cambridge Massachusetts: De Capo Press, 1891 {{ISBN|0-306-81362-9}}</ref> The victory was minor, but it encouraged the Gauls and Ligurians to join the Carthaginian cause, whose troops bolstered his army back to around 40,000 men. Scipio was severely injured, his life only saved by the bravery of his son who rode back onto the field to rescue his fallen father. Scipio retreated across the Trebia to camp at [[Piacenza|Placentia]] with his army mostly intact.<ref name=\"dodge_old\" />\n\nThe other [[Roman consul]]ar army was rushed to the Po Valley. Even before news of the defeat at Ticinus had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered Consul [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] to bring his army back from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal, by skillful maneuvers, was in position to head him off, for he lay on the direct road between Placentia and Arminum, by which Sempronius would have to march to reinforce Scipio. He then captured Clastidium, from which he drew large amounts of supplies for his men. But this gain was not without loss, as Sempronius avoided Hannibal's watchfulness, slipped around his flank, and joined his colleague in his camp near the [[Trebbia|Trebia River]] near [[Piacenza|Placentia]]. There Hannibal had an opportunity to show his masterful military skill at the Trebia in December of the same year, after wearing down the superior Roman [[infantry]], when he cut it to pieces with a surprise attack and ambush from the flanks.\n\n===Battle of Lake Trasimene===\n{{Main|Battle of Lake Trasimene}}\nHannibal quartered his troops for the winter with the Gauls, whose support for him had abated. In the spring of 217&nbsp;BC, Hannibal decided to find a more reliable base of operations farther south. Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius (the new consuls of Rome) were expecting Hannibal to advance on Rome, and they took their armies to block the eastern and western routes that Hannibal could use.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'', Book III, 77</ref>\n[[File:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|right|300px|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], 217&nbsp;BC.<br />From the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]\nThe only alternative route to central Italy lay at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This area was practically one huge marsh, and happened to be overflowing more than usual during this particular season. Hannibal knew that this route was full of difficulties, but it remained the surest and certainly the quickest way to central Italy. [[Polybius]] claims that Hannibal's men marched for four days and three nights, \"through a land that was under water\", suffering terribly from fatigue and enforced want of sleep. He crossed without opposition over both the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] (during which he lost his right eye<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Selby Watson |author2=Marcus Junianus |author3=Justinus, Cornelius |author4=Nepos, Eutropius | url = https://archive.org/details/justincornelius00watsgoog |quote=hannibal greatest. | title = Justin, Cornelius Nepos, and Eutropius: Literally Translated, with Notes | year = 1853 | publisher = H.

As Polybius recounts, \"he [Hannibal] calculated that, if he passed the camp and made a descent into the district beyond, Flaminius (partly for fear of popular reproach and partly of personal irritation) would be unable to endure watching passively the devastation of the country but would spontaneously follow him... and give him opportunities for attack.\"<ref>[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]], ''Strategy'', New York City, New York, Penguin Group, 1967</ref> At the same time, Hannibal tried to break the allegiance of Rome's allies by proving that Flaminius was powerless to protect them. Despite this, Flaminius remained passively encamped at Arretium. Hannibal marched boldly around Flaminius' left flank, unable to draw him into battle by mere devastation, and effectively cut him off from Rome (thus executing the first recorded [[turning movement]] in military history). He then advanced through the uplands of [[Etruria]], provoking Flaminius into a hasty pursuit and catching him in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]]. There Hannibal destroyed Flaminius' army in the waters or on the adjoining slopes, killing Flaminius as well (see [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]]). This was the most costly ambush that the Romans ever sustained until the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against the [[Parthian Empire]].\n\nHannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance upon Rome, but he realized that, without [[siege engine]]s, he could not hope to take the capital. He preferred to exploit his victory by entering into central and southern Italy and encouraging a general revolt against the sovereign power.<ref>[http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/hannibal/Parker_J_P_01.pdf USAWC] ''Comparing Strategies of the 2nd Punic War'' by James Parker.

Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the [[Fabian strategy|strategy named after him]], avoiding open battle while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal's vicinity in order to watch and limit his movements.\n\nHannibal ravaged Apulia but was unable to bring Fabius to battle, so he decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. Fabius closely followed Hannibal's path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn out of the defensive. This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed that it was a form of cowardice.\n\nHannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated lowlands of Campania, but Fabius had ensured that all the passes were blocked out of Campania. To avoid this, Hannibal deceived the Romans into thinking that the Carthaginian army was going to escape through the woods. As the Romans moved off towards the woods, Hannibal's army occupied the pass, and then made their way through the pass unopposed. Fabius was within striking distance but in this case his caution worked against him. Smelling a stratagem (rightly), he stayed put. For the winter, Hannibal found comfortable quarters in the [[Apulia]]n plain. What Hannibal achieved in extricating his army was, as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] puts it, \"a classic of ancient generalship, finding its way into nearly every historical narrative of the war and being used by later military manuals\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Adrian K. ''The Roman Army at War 100 BC&nbsp;\u2014 AD 200'', New York</ref> This was a severe blow to Fabius' prestige and soon after this his period of dictatorial power ended.\n\n===Battle of Cannae===\n[[File:Battle cannae destruction.gif|right|thumb|330px|Destruction of the Roman army (red), courtesy of the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]{{Main|Battle of Cannae}}\nIn the spring of 216&nbsp;BC, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. By capturing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial sources of supply.<ref name=\"polybius\">{{cite web| url = http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/polybius-cannae.html | title = Internet Ancient History Sourcebook}}</ref> Once the Roman Senate resumed their consular elections in 216&nbsp;BC, they appointed [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] as [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the meantime, the Romans hoped to gain success through sheer strength and weight of numbers, and they raised a new army of unprecedented size, estimated by some to be as large as 100,000 men, but more likely around 50\u201380,000.<ref name=\"cottrell\">Cottrell, Leonard, ''Enemy of Rome'', Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans and allied legions resolved to confront Hannibal and marched southward to [[Apulia]]. They eventually found him on the left bank of the Aufidus River, and encamped {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On this occasion, the two armies were combined into one, the consuls having to alternate their command on a daily basis. Varro was in command on the first day, a man of reckless and hubristic nature (according to Livy) and determined to defeat Hannibal.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> Hannibal capitalized on the eagerness of Varro and drew him into a trap by using an [[Pincer movement|envelopment tactic]]. This eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the combat area. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak center, but the Libyan mercenaries on the wings, swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible. Hannibal's chief cavalry commander [[Maharbal]] led the mobile [[Numidian cavalry]] on the right, and they shattered the Roman cavalry opposing them. Hannibal's Iberian and Gallic heavy cavalry, led by Hanno on the left, defeated the Roman heavy cavalry, and then both the Carthaginian heavy cavalry and the Numidians attacked the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape.\n\nDue to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal managed to surround and destroy all but a small remnant of his enemy, despite his own inferior numbers. Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000\u201370,000 Romans were killed or captured.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Among the dead were Roman Consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], as well as two consuls for the preceding year, two [[quaestor]]s, twenty-nine out of the forty-eight [[military tribune]]s, and an additional eighty senators (at a time when the Roman Senate was composed of no more than 300 men, this constituted 25%\u201330% of the governing body). This makes the battle one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], and one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history (in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day).<ref name=\"cottrell\"/>\n\nAfter Cannae, the Romans were very hesitant to confront Hannibal in pitched battle, preferring instead to weaken him by attrition, relying on their advantages of interior lines, supply, and manpower. As a result, Hannibal fought no more major battles in Italy for the rest of the war. It is believed that his refusal to bring the war to Rome itself was due to a lack of commitment from Carthage of men, money, and material&nbsp;\u2014 principally siege equipment. Whatever the reason, the choice prompted Maharbal to say, \"Hannibal, you know how to gain a victory, but not how to use one.\"<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps'', p.

Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed [[tyrant]] [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]]. It is often argued that, if Hannibal had received proper material reinforcements from Carthage, he might have succeeded with a direct attack upon Rome. Instead, he had to content himself with subduing the fortresses that still held out against him, and the only other notable event of 216&nbsp;BC was the defection of certain Italian territories, including [[Capua]], the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. However, only a few of the Italian city-states that he had expected to gain as allies defected to him.\n\n===Stalemate===\nThe war in Italy settled into a strategic stalemate. The Romans used the [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] strategy that Fabius had taught them, and which, they finally realized, was the only feasible means of defeating Hannibal.<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps: The Invasion of Italy and the Second Punic War'', p.

His immediate objectives were reduced to minor operations centered mainly round the cities of [[Campania]].\n\nThe forces detached to his lieutenants were generally unable to hold their own, and neither his home government nor his new ally Philip V of Macedon helped to make up his losses. His position in southern Italy, therefore, became increasingly difficult and his chance of ultimately conquering Rome grew ever more remote. Hannibal still won a number of notable victories: completely destroying two Roman armies in 212&nbsp;BC, and killing two consuls (including the famed [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]) in a battle in 208&nbsp;BC. However, Hannibal slowly began losing ground\u2014inadequately supported by his Italian allies, abandoned by his government (either because of jealousy or simply because Carthage was overstretched), and unable to match Rome's resources. He was never able to bring about another grand decisive victory that could produce a lasting strategic change.\n\nCarthaginian political will was embodied in the ruling oligarchy. There was a Carthaginian Senate, but the real power was with the inner \"[[Council of 30 Nobles]]\" and the board of judges from ruling families known as the \"[[Hundred and Four]]\". These two bodies came from the wealthy, commercial families of Carthage. Two political factions operated in Carthage: the war party, also known as the \"[[Barcid]]s\" (Hannibal's family name); and the peace party led by [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]]. Hanno had been instrumental in denying Hannibal's requested reinforcements following the battle at Cannae.\n\nHannibal started the war without the full backing of Carthaginian oligarchy. His attack of Saguntum had presented the oligarchy with a choice of war with Rome or loss of prestige in Iberia. The oligarchy, not Hannibal, controlled the strategic resources of Carthage. Hannibal constantly sought reinforcements from either Iberia or North Africa. Hannibal's troops who were lost in combat were replaced with less well-trained and motivated mercenaries from Italy or Gaul. The commercial interests of the Carthaginian oligarchy dictated the reinforcement and supply of Iberia rather than Hannibal throughout the campaign.\n\n===Hannibal's retreat in Italy===\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Scipio Africanus]] from the [[Villa of the Papyri]]]]\nIn March 212&nbsp;BC, Hannibal [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)|captured]] [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in a surprise attack but he failed to obtain control of its harbour. The tide was slowly turning against him, and in favor of Rome.\n\nThe Roman consuls mounted a [[Battle of Capua|siege of Capua]] in 212 BC. Hannibal attacked them, forcing their withdrawal from Campania. He moved to Lucania and destroyed a 16,000-man Roman army at the [[Battle of the Silarus]], with 15,000 Romans killed. Another opportunity presented itself soon after, a Roman army of 18,000 men being destroyed by Hannibal at the [[Battle of Herdonia (212 BC)|first battle of Herdonia]] with 16,000 Roman dead, freeing Apulia from the Romans for the year. The Roman consuls mounted another [[Battle of Capua (211 BC)|siege of Capua]] in 211&nbsp;BC, conquering the city. Hannibal attempted to lift the siege with an assault on the Roman siege lines but failed. He marched on Rome to force the recall of the Roman armies. He drew off 15,000 Roman soldiers, but the siege continued and Capua fell. In 212 BC, Marcellus [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|conquered]] Syracuse and the Romans destroyed the Carthaginian army in Sicily in 211\u2013210 BC. In 210 BC, the Romans entered into an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] to counter [[Philip V of Macedon]]. Philip, who attempted to exploit Rome's preoccupation in Italy to conquer [[Illyria]], now found himself under attack from several sides at once and was quickly subdued by Rome and her Greek allies.\n\nIn 210&nbsp;BC, Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by inflicting a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Herdonia (210 BC)|Battle of Herdonia]] (modern [[Ordona]]) in Apulia upon a [[proconsul]]ar army and, in 208&nbsp;BC, destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of [[Locri]] at the [[Battle of Petelia]]. But with the loss of Tarentum in 209&nbsp;BC and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of [[Samnium]] and [[Lucania]], his hold on south Italy was almost lost. In 207&nbsp;BC, he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the [[battle of the Metaurus]], he retired to [[Calabria]], where he maintained himself for the ensuing years. His brother's head had been cut off, carried across Italy, and tossed over the palisade of Hannibal's camp as a cold message of the iron-clad will of the Roman Republic. The combination of these events marked the end to Hannibal's success in Italy. With the failure of his brother Mago in [[Liguria]] (205\u2013203&nbsp;BC) and of his own negotiations with Phillip V, the last hope of recovering his ascendancy in Italy was lost. In 203&nbsp;BC, after nearly fifteen years of fighting in Italy, and with the military fortunes of Carthage rapidly declining, Hannibal was recalled to Carthage to direct the defense of his native country against a Roman invasion under Scipio Africanus.\n\n{{anchor|Conclusion of the Second Punic War}}\n\n==Conclusion of the Second Punic War (203\u2013201 BC)==\n{{anchor|Return}}\n\n===Return to Carthage===\n[[File:Campagna africana di Scipione 202 aC.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Final act of the Second Punic War with the [[battle of Zama]] (202 BC)]]\n\nIn 203&nbsp;BC, Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party in Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno Lacinia]] at [[Crotone|Crotona]], he sailed back to Africa.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12582/12582-h/12582-h.htm#b46 |title=28.46 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> His arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, which placed him in command of a combined force of [[Africa]]n [[conscription|levies]] and his mercenaries from Italy. In 202&nbsp;BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a fruitless peace conference. Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due to Roman allegations of \"Punic Faith,\" referring to the breach of protocols that ended the First Punic War by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, and a Carthaginan attack on a stranded Roman fleet. Scipio and Carthage had worked out a peace plan, which was approved by Rome. The terms of the treaty were quite modest, but the war had been long for the Romans. Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire. Masinissa ([[Numidia]]) was to be independent. Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity. But Carthage then made a terrible blunder. Its long-suffering citizens had captured a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and stripped it of supplies, an action that aggravated the faltering negotiations. Meanwhile, Hannibal, recalled from Italy by the Carthaginian Senate, had returned with his army. Fortified by both Hannibal and the supplies, the Carthaginians rebuffed the treaty and Roman protests. The decisive [[battle of Zama]] soon followed; the defeat removed Hannibal's air of invincibility.\n\n===Battle of Zama (202 BC)===\n{{Main|Battle of Zama}}\nUnlike most battles of the [[Second Punic War]], at Zama, the Romans were superior in cavalry and the Carthaginians had the edge in infantry. This Roman cavalry superiority was due to the betrayal of [[Masinissa]], who had earlier assisted Carthage in Iberia, but changed sides in 206&nbsp;BC with the promise of land and due to his personal conflicts with [[Syphax]], a Carthaginian ally. Although the aging Hannibal was suffering from mental exhaustion and deteriorating health after years of campaigning in Italy, the Carthaginians still had the advantage in numbers and were boosted by the presence of 80 war elephants.<!-- 80 elephants, cited to sources by main article -->\n\n[[File:Slaget ved Zama - Cornelis Cort, 1567.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of the [[Battle of Zama]] by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567. Note that [[Asian elephant]]s are illustrated rather than the very small [[North African elephant]]s used by Carthage.]]\n\nThe Roman cavalry won an early victory by swiftly routing the Carthaginian horse, and standard Roman tactics for limiting the effectiveness of the Carthaginian war elephants were successful, including playing trumpets to frighten the elephants into running into the Carthaginian lines. Some historians say that the elephants routed the Carthaginian cavalry and not the Romans, whilst others suggest that it was actually a tactical retreat planned by Hannibal.<ref>Scullard, H.H.

At one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory, but Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry, having routed the Carthaginian cavalry, attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to collapse.\n\nWith their foremost general defeated, the Carthaginians had no choice but to surrender. Carthage lost approximately 20,000 troops with an additional 15,000 wounded. In contrast, the Romans suffered only 2,500 casualties. The last major battle of the Second Punic War resulted in a loss of respect for Hannibal by his fellow Carthaginians. The conditions of defeat were such that Carthage could no longer battle for Mediterranean supremacy.\n\n==Later career==\n{{anchor|Peacetime Carthage}}\n[[File:Carthage Tetradrachm Tanit &amp; Horse, with a Serrated Edge.

They considered him the greatest enemy Rome had ever faced. [[Livy]] gives us the idea that Hannibal was extremely cruel. Even [[Cicero]], when he talked of Rome and its two great enemies, spoke of the \"honourable\" [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and the \"cruel\" Hannibal. Yet a different picture sometimes emerges. When Hannibal's successes had brought about the death of two [[Roman consul]]s, he vainly searched for the body of [[Gaius Flaminius]] on the shores of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]], held ceremonial rituals in recognition of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (General)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], and sent [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]]' ashes back to his family in Rome. Any bias attributed to [[Polybius]], however, is more troublesome. [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]] considered the Greek scholar a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus]],<ref>[[Ronald J. Mellor|Mellor, Ronald J.]] ''The Historians of Ancient Rome''</ref> while H.

According to [[Appian]], several years after the Second Punic War, Hannibal served as a political advisor in the Seleucid Kingdom and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] arrived there on a diplomatic mission from Rome.\n{{quote|It is said that at one of their meetings in the gymnasium Scipio and Hannibal had a conversation on the subject of generalship, in the presence of a number of bystanders, and that Scipio asked Hannibal whom he considered the greatest general, to which the latter replied, \"[[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedonia]]\".\n\nTo this Scipio assented since he also yielded the first place to Alexander. Then he asked Hannibal whom he placed next, and he replied, \"[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]\", because he considered boldness the first qualification of a general; \"for it would not be possible\", he said, \"to find two kings more enterprising than these\".\n\nScipio was rather nettled by this, but nevertheless he asked Hannibal to whom he would give the third place, expecting that at least the third would be assigned to him; but Hannibal replied, \"to myself; for when I was a young man I conquered Hispania and crossed the Alps with an army, the first after [[Hercules]].\"\n\nAs Scipio saw that he was likely to prolong his self-laudation he said, laughing, \"where would you place yourself, Hannibal, if you had not been defeated by me?\" Hannibal, now perceiving his jealousy, replied, \"in that case I should have put myself before Alexander\". Thus Hannibal continued his self-laudation, but flattered Scipio in an indirect manner by suggesting that he had conquered one who was the superior of Alexander.\n\nAt the end of this conversation Hannibal invited Scipio to be his guest, and Scipio replied that he would be so gladly if Hannibal were not living with [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]], who was held in suspicion by the Romans. Thus did they, in a manner worthy of great commanders, cast aside their enmity at the end of their wars.<ref name=\"appian\">Appian, ''History of the Syrian Wars'', \u00a710 and \u00a711 at [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html Livius.org]</ref>}}\n\nMilitary academies all over the world continue to study Hannibal's exploits, especially his victory at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]].<ref>{{cite document | title=THE INFLUENCE OF HANNIBAL OF CARTHAGE ON THE ART OF WAR AND HOW HIS LEGACY HAS BEEN INTERPRETED | author=RICK JAY MESSER|citeseerx = 10.1.1.582.1385}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hannibal in Italy by Jacopo Ripanda - Sala di Annibale - Palazzo dei Conservatori - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|right| Hannibal's celebrated feat in crossing the Alps with [[war elephant]]s passed into European legend: detail of a fresco by [[Jacopo Ripanda]], {{circa | 1510}}, [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nMaximilian Otto Bismarck Caspari, in his article in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1910-1911), praises Hannibal in these words:\n{{quotation|As to the transcendent military genius of Hannibal there cannot be two opinions. The man who for fifteen years could hold his ground in a hostile country against several powerful armies and a succession of able generals must have been a commander and a [[:wikt:tactician|tactician]] of supreme capacity. In the use of strategies and [[ambush|ambuscades]] he certainly surpassed all other generals of antiquity. Wonderful as his achievements were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he received from Carthage. As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh levies on the spot. We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it was of North Africans, Iberians and [[Gauls]]. Again, all we know of him comes for the most part from hostile sources. The Romans feared and hated him so much that they could not do him justice. Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices were equally great, among which he singles out his more than Punic perfidy and an inhuman cruelty. For the first there would seem to be no further justification than that he was consummately skillful in the use of ambuscades. For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare. Sometimes he contrasts most favorably with his enemy. No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated by [[Gaius Claudius Nero]] on the vanquished [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. Polybius merely says that he was accused of cruelty by the Romans and of avarice by the Carthaginians. He had indeed bitter enemies, and his life was one continuous struggle against destiny.

Constantly overmatched by better soldiers, led by generals always respectable, often of great ability, he yet defied all their efforts to drive him from Italy, for half a generation. Excepting in the case of Alexander, and some few isolated instances, all wars up to the Second Punic War, had been decided largely, if not entirely, by battle-tactics. Strategic ability had been comprehended only on a minor scale. Armies had marched towards each other, had fought in parallel order, and the conqueror had imposed terms on his opponent. Any variation from this rule consisted in ambuscades or other stratagems. That war could be waged by avoiding in lieu of seeking battle; that the results of a victory could be earned by attacks upon the enemy's communications, by flank-maneuvers, by seizing positions from which safely to threaten him in case he moved, and by other devices of strategy, was not understood... [However] For the first time in the history of war, we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harassing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster\u2014all with a well-conceived purpose of placing his opponent at a strategic disadvantage... That it did so was due to the teaching of Hannibal.<ref name=\"dodge\" />}}\n\n===Other===\nHannibal is the \"hero\" of teenager [[Sigmund Freud]]. His idealized image is reflected in the analysis by the founder of [[psychoanalysis]] of his \"dreams of Rome\" in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. Freud then associates it with the adage \"All roads lead to Rome\". He writes indeed in The Interpretation of Dreams: \"Hannibal and Rome symbolized for the adolescent that I was the opposition between the tenacity of [[Judaism]] and the organizing spirit of the [[Catholic Church]]\".<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''L'interpr\u00e9tation du r\u00eave'' (''Die Traumdeutung'', 1900), ''\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Freud / Psychanalyse'' (OCF.P) IV, Paris: PUF/Quadrige, 2010, {{p.|234}}.</ref>\n\nSome qualities have been recognized by Hannibal since Antiquity: audacity, courage and pugnacity.

Worldwide, there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=IIHF |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/ |title=The world governing body |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Canada, the United States, Nordic countries, and some other European countries the sport is known simply as '''hockey'''; the name \"ice hockey\" is used in places where \"hockey\" more often refers to the more popular [[field hockey]], such as countries in [[South America]], [[Asia]], [[Ice hockey in Africa|Africa]], [[Australasia]], and some European countries including the [[Sport in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Sport in Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Sport in the Netherlands|Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Koninklijke Nederlandse Hockey Bond |url=https://hockey.nl/de-sport/organisatie/koninklijke-nederlandse-hockey-bond/ |accessdate=October 20, 2018 |agency=Hockey.nl}}</ref>\n\nIce hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as [[shinny]] and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] during the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the [[Big Six (ice hockey)|Big Six]]) predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953.<ref>Including former incarnations of them, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/men.html |title=IIHF World Championships: All Medalists: Men |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[World Cup of Hockey]] is organized by the National Hockey League and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. Furthermore, all 12 Women's Olympic and 36 [[IIHF World Women's Championship]] medals were awarded to one of these six countries.

By 1902, the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]] was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league\u2014the [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL)\u2014in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with [[amateur sports|amateurs]]). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\n\nIn 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\n\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].\n\n==Game==\n[[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]\nWhile the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used.

During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.\n\nWithin certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\n[[File:Dynamo Stadium - Ice hockey arena - Panorama after match.jpg|thumb|left|[[VTB Arena]] is an example of an indoor ice hockey arena. The arena is used by [[HC Dynamo Moscow]].]]\nHockey is an [[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]] game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}\n\nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term ''skaters'' is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A [[substitution (sport)|substitution]] of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[short-handed]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005\u201306 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.\n[[File:Military appreciation night South Carolina Stingrays.jpg|thumb|Players from the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] perform a line change. A line change is a substitution of an entire [[line (ice hockey)|line]] at once.]] \nThe boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to [[bodycheck]] opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a [[faceoff]]. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.\n\nThe three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: ''offside'', ''icing'', and the puck going out of play. A player is offside if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not \"ice the puck\", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the [[Plexiglas|glass]], or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.\n\nUnder IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.\n\n===Periods and overtime===\nA professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.\n[[File:GM Place Canucks 4 Overtimes.jpg|thumb|left|Scoreboard for a hockey game that ended in the seventh period. If a game is tied at the end of the third period, several leagues and tournaments have teams play additional periods until a goal is scored.]]\nVarious procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999\u20132000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).\n\nFrom the 1999\u20132000 until the 2003\u201304 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an ''empty net'' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015\u201316 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters (usually four, very rarely five) until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized team's penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf |title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2015\u20132016 |publisher=National Hockey League |year=2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Mueller shootout goal.jpg|thumb|Several leagues and tournaments have implemented the [[shootout (hockey)|shootout]] as a means to determine a winner, if the game remains tied after an extra overtime period]]\nInternational play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.\n\nThe overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the medal games in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.\n\n===Penalties===\n{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Richard Gynge going to penalty box.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An ice hockey player enters the penalty box. Players may be sent to the [[penalty box]] for rule infractions, forcing their team playing with one less player for a specified time.]]\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the ''[[penalty box]]'' and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing ''short-handed'' while the opposing team is on a ''[[power play (sport)|power play]]''.\n\nA two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as [[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]], [[elbow (strike)|elbowing]], [[roughing]], [[high-sticking]], [[delay of game|delay of the game]], [[too many men|too many players on the ice]], [[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]], illegal equipment, [[charging (ice hockey)|charging]] (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), interference, [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]], [[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]], kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), \"butt-ending\" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick\u2014a very rare penalty), \"spearing\", or [[cross-checking]]. As of the 2005\u20132006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for [[diving (ice hockey)|diving]], where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding (defined as \"check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com |access-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025043505/http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.\n[[File:Joel Larsson and Davis Dryden.jpg|thumb|upright|A hockey skater [[Hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]] another skater with his stick in an attempt to restrain him. Hooking is a rule infraction and may result in a minor penalty.]]\nSome varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned \"two-and-ten\"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.\n\nA [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.\n\n[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]\nOfficials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).\n\nIn the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the \"corners\" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.\n\nAn additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the [[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]. Prior to the 2005\u201306 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.\n\nThe NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and \"clutching and grabbing\" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States' amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (\"zero tolerance\").\n\nIn men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called ''[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]''. Not all physical contact is legal\u2014in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.\n\nA ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States' [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) for [[college ice hockey|college level hockey]]. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\n{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Montreal - Burlington 3 decembre 2011 021.jpg|thumb|Officials working under a four-official system. Orange armbands are worn by the referees to distinguish them from the lineswomen.]]\nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201353}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201352}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201354}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.\n\nThe most widespread system in use today is the \"three-man system\", that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the \"four-official system\", where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.\n\nOfficials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department |title=How to Get Started \u2013 Officials |url=http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\n{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}\n[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players, just like goaltender [[Sinuhe Wallinheimo]] pictured here.]]\nSince men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.\n \n[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.\n \nHockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} thick.\n \nThe hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|Injury}} Injury ==\nIce hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|\u2013|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players are allowed to contact other players but are not allowed to body check.\n\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of [[overuse injuries]] and injuries caused by [[early sports specialization]] by teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feeley |first=Brian T. |last2=Agel |first2=Julie |last3=LaPrade |first3=Robert F. |date=January 2016 |title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization? |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=234\u2013241 |doi=10.1177/0363546515576899 |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=25825379}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Hughston Health Alert, \"Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822231059/http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |title=Ice Hockey Injuries |publisher=Hughston Clinic}}</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood. Direct trauma to the head is estimated to account for 80% of all hockey injuries as a result of player contact with other players or hockey equipment.<ref name=\"hughston.com\"/>\n\nOne of the leading causes of head injury is body checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called \"boarding\"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head.\n\nThe most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. In recent years, the NHL has implemented new rules which penalize and suspend players for illegal checks to the heads, as well as checks to unsuspecting players. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare.\n\n==Tactics==\n===Checking===\n{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Body checking lesson.jpg|thumb|Youths being taught how to properly deliver a check in ice hockey]]\nAn important defensive tactic is checking\u2014attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally \"in possession\" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Body checking is also a penalty in certain leagues in order to reduce the chance of injury to players. Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.\n\n===Offensive tactics===\n{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}\nOffensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to \"shoot\" the puck.\n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660199222).jpg|left|upright|thumb|A [[National Hockey League|NHL]] fan exhibit, where visitors attempt to deflect the puck off the skaters in front of the goalie in order to score]]\nA ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.\n\nA team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.\n\nOne of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2\u20131\u20132]], 1\u20132\u20132, and 1\u20134. The 2\u20131\u20132 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1\u20132\u20132 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1\u20134 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.\n\nThere are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.\n\nA [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for \"decoy\", is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of \"dangling\", which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.\n\n===Fights===\n{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}\n[[File:Fight in ice hockey 2009.JPG|thumb|Fighting in ice hockey is officially prohibited in the rules, although it continues to be an established tradition in the sport in North America]]\nAlthough fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. [[enforcer (ice hockey)|Enforcers]] and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone receives what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |title=KAHC Suspended Players |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813154239/http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |archivedate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2009/03/17/hockey_fans_love_fighting_survey_says.html |title=Hockey fans love fighting, survey says |work=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Women's ice hockey}} Women's ice hockey ==\nIce hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing by 400 percent from 1995 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industry Canada |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |accessdate=December 4, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927042219/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |archivedate=September 27, 2004}}</ref> In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/canada.html |title=IIHF About Hockey Canada |publisher=Iihf.com |date=April 26, 1920 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> United States had 65,609,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/united-states.html |title=IIHF About United States |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Finland 4,760,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/finland.html |title=IIHF About Finland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=February 10, 1928 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Sweden 3,075<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/sweden.html |title=IIHF About Sweden |publisher=Iihf.com |date=March 23, 1912 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> and Switzerland 1,172.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/switzerland.html |title=IIHF About Switzerland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=November 23, 1908 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] (CWHL), [[Western Women's Hockey League]], [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL), [[Mid-Atlantic Women's Hockey League]], and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and Olympic teams, and [[recreation]]al teams.

Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.\n\nThe game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the sport is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There have been two major professional women's hockey leagues to have paid its players: the [[National Women's Hockey League]] with teams in the United States and the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] with teams in Canada, China, and the United States.\n\nThe first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. This was followed by the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|first IIHF World Championship in 1990]] in Ottawa. Women's ice hockey was added as a medal sport at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano, Japan]].

The league's history began after Canada's National Hockey Association decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League with four teams. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924 and had as many as 10 teams before contracting to six teams by 1942\u201343. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12-team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. In 1979, the 17-team NHL merged with the WHA creating a 21-team league.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey |title=Britannica |last=Fischler |first=Shirley |date= |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League |title=National Hockey League (NHL) |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=}}</ref> The league is expected to expand to 32 teams by 2021.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as \"The A\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024932/http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |archive-date=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 31 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a \"[[Farm team|farm league]]\" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003\u201304 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams.\n\nAs of 2019, there are three minor professional leagues with no NHL affiliations: the [[Federal Prospects Hockey League]] (FPHL), [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH), and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL).\n[[File:2007 Memorial Cup warmup.JPG|thumb|Pre-game warmups prior to a [[Memorial Cup]] game. The tourney serves as the championship for the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]].]]\n[[U Sports]] ice hockey is the highest level of play at the Canadian university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada's governing body for university sports. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.\nIn the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] is composed of college teams at the club level.\n\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe. The major junior players are considered amateurs as they are under 21-years-old and not paid a salary, however, they do get a stipend and play a schedule similar to a professional league. Typically, the [[NHL draft]]s many players directly from the major junior leagues.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are also amateur with players required to be under 21-years old, but do not get a stipend, which allows players to retain their eligibility for participation in [[College ice hockey#NCAA|NCAA ice hockey]].\n\n====Eurasia====\n[[File:Stamp-russia2016-hockey-gagarin-cup.png|thumb|A Russian stamp commemorating the [[Gagarin Cup]], which is presented to the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]]'s playoff champion. The KHL is the largest ice hockey league in Eurasia.]]\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008\u201309 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011\u201312 KHL season|2011\u201312 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The KHL currently comprises member clubs based in [[Belarus]] (1), [[China]] (1), [[Finland]] (1), [[Latvia]] (1), [[Kazakhstan]] (1) and [[Russia]] (19) for a total of 24.\n\nThe second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].\n\nThe highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lineup (5154107439).jpg|thumb|Players from the [[ZSC Lions]] line up prior to a game. The club plays in the Swiss [[National League A]].]]\nSeveral countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, Liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.\n\nBeginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008\u201309 [[Champions Hockey League (2008\u201309)|tournament of the same name]].\n\nThere are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the European Trophy, [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternational club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.\n\n====Other regions====\nThe [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].\n\n[[Ice hockey in Africa]] is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic national leagues, there are several regional leagues in [[South Africa]].\n\n===National team competitions===\n[[File:OvechkinKuba2010WinterOlympics.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian men's hockey team]] moves the puck as [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic's]] [[Filip Kuba]] defends against him, during the 2010 Olympics]]\nIce hockey has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. The United States won its first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]], amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad\u2014an event known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games up until 2018. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.\n\nNational teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.\n[[File:IIHF16WC - Game FIN v BLR.jpg|thumb|Skaters from the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finnish]] and [[Belarus men's national ice hockey team|Belorussian men's ice hockey teams]] shortly after a [[face-off]] during the [[2016 IIHF World Championship]]. The IIHF is an annual national team tournament.]]\nThe [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]], two series pitting the best Canadian and [[Soviet]] players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.\n\nSince the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name=\"IIHF WWC list\" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name=\"Hunter 1998 Olympics\" /> The only finals in the women's world championship or Olympics that did not involve both Canada and the United States were the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden and [[2019 IIHF Women's World Championship Final|2019 World Championship final]] between the US and Finland.\n\nOther ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]]. The annual [[Euro Hockey Tour]], an unofficial European championship between the national men's teams of the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden have been played since 1996\u201397.\n\n===Attendance records===\n{{Main|List of ice hockey games with highest attendance}}\n[[File:TheBigChillattheBigHouse.JPG|thumb|[[The Big Chill at the Big House]] was a collegiate ice hockey game played at [[Michigan Stadium]] in 2010.

These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as [[shinny]] and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] during the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the [[Big Six (ice hockey)|Big Six]]) predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953.<ref>Including former incarnations of them, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/men.html |title=IIHF World Championships: All Medalists: Men |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[World Cup of Hockey]] is organized by the National Hockey League and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. Furthermore, all 12 Women's Olympic and 36 [[IIHF World Women's Championship]] medals were awarded to one of these six countries.

In 1843 another British Army officer in [[Kingston, Ontario]] wrote, \"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"<ref name=\"queens\"/> An 1859 ''Boston Evening Gazette'' article referred to an early game of hockey on ice in Halifax that year.<ref name=\"origin\" /> An 1835 painting by John O'Toole depicts skaters with sticks and bung on a frozen stream in the American state of [[West Virginia]], at that time still part of [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"cancom\"/>\n\nIn the same era, the [[Mi'kmaq]], a [[First Nations]] people of the [[The Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], also had a stick-and-ball game.

By 1902, the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]] was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league\u2014the [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL)\u2014in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with [[amateur sports|amateurs]]). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\n\nIn 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\n\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].\n\n==Game==\n[[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]\nWhile the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used.

During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.\n\nWithin certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\n[[File:Dynamo Stadium - Ice hockey arena - Panorama after match.jpg|thumb|left|[[VTB Arena]] is an example of an indoor ice hockey arena. The arena is used by [[HC Dynamo Moscow]].]]\nHockey is an [[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]] game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}\n\nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term ''skaters'' is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A [[substitution (sport)|substitution]] of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[short-handed]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005\u201306 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.\n[[File:Military appreciation night South Carolina Stingrays.jpg|thumb|Players from the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] perform a line change. A line change is a substitution of an entire [[line (ice hockey)|line]] at once.]] \nThe boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to [[bodycheck]] opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a [[faceoff]]. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.\n\nThe three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: ''offside'', ''icing'', and the puck going out of play. A player is offside if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not \"ice the puck\", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the [[Plexiglas|glass]], or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.\n\nUnder IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.\n\n===Periods and overtime===\nA professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.\n[[File:GM Place Canucks 4 Overtimes.jpg|thumb|left|Scoreboard for a hockey game that ended in the seventh period. If a game is tied at the end of the third period, several leagues and tournaments have teams play additional periods until a goal is scored.]]\nVarious procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999\u20132000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).\n\nFrom the 1999\u20132000 until the 2003\u201304 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an ''empty net'' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015\u201316 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters (usually four, very rarely five) until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized team's penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf |title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2015\u20132016 |publisher=National Hockey League |year=2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Mueller shootout goal.jpg|thumb|Several leagues and tournaments have implemented the [[shootout (hockey)|shootout]] as a means to determine a winner, if the game remains tied after an extra overtime period]]\nInternational play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.\n\nThe overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the medal games in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.\n\n===Penalties===\n{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Richard Gynge going to penalty box.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An ice hockey player enters the penalty box. Players may be sent to the [[penalty box]] for rule infractions, forcing their team playing with one less player for a specified time.]]\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the ''[[penalty box]]'' and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing ''short-handed'' while the opposing team is on a ''[[power play (sport)|power play]]''.\n\nA two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as [[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]], [[elbow (strike)|elbowing]], [[roughing]], [[high-sticking]], [[delay of game|delay of the game]], [[too many men|too many players on the ice]], [[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]], illegal equipment, [[charging (ice hockey)|charging]] (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), interference, [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]], [[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]], kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), \"butt-ending\" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick\u2014a very rare penalty), \"spearing\", or [[cross-checking]]. As of the 2005\u20132006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for [[diving (ice hockey)|diving]], where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding (defined as \"check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com |access-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025043505/http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.\n[[File:Joel Larsson and Davis Dryden.jpg|thumb|upright|A hockey skater [[Hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]] another skater with his stick in an attempt to restrain him. Hooking is a rule infraction and may result in a minor penalty.]]\nSome varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned \"two-and-ten\"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.\n\nA [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.\n\n[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]\nOfficials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).\n\nIn the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the \"corners\" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.\n\nAn additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the [[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]. Prior to the 2005\u201306 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.\n\nThe NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and \"clutching and grabbing\" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States' amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (\"zero tolerance\").\n\nIn men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called ''[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]''. Not all physical contact is legal\u2014in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.\n\nA ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States' [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) for [[college ice hockey|college level hockey]]. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\n{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Montreal - Burlington 3 decembre 2011 021.jpg|thumb|Officials working under a four-official system. Orange armbands are worn by the referees to distinguish them from the lineswomen.]]\nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201353}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201352}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201354}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.\n\nThe most widespread system in use today is the \"three-man system\", that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the \"four-official system\", where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.\n\nOfficials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department |title=How to Get Started \u2013 Officials |url=http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\n{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}\n[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players, just like goaltender [[Sinuhe Wallinheimo]] pictured here.]]\nSince men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.\n \n[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.\n \nHockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} thick.\n \nThe hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|Injury}} Injury ==\nIce hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|\u2013|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players are allowed to contact other players but are not allowed to body check.\n\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of [[overuse injuries]] and injuries caused by [[early sports specialization]] by teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feeley |first=Brian T. |last2=Agel |first2=Julie |last3=LaPrade |first3=Robert F. |date=January 2016 |title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization? |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=234\u2013241 |doi=10.1177/0363546515576899 |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=25825379}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Hughston Health Alert, \"Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822231059/http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |title=Ice Hockey Injuries |publisher=Hughston Clinic}}</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood. Direct trauma to the head is estimated to account for 80% of all hockey injuries as a result of player contact with other players or hockey equipment.<ref name=\"hughston.com\"/>\n\nOne of the leading causes of head injury is body checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called \"boarding\"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head.\n\nThe most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. In recent years, the NHL has implemented new rules which penalize and suspend players for illegal checks to the heads, as well as checks to unsuspecting players. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare.\n\n==Tactics==\n===Checking===\n{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Body checking lesson.jpg|thumb|Youths being taught how to properly deliver a check in ice hockey]]\nAn important defensive tactic is checking\u2014attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally \"in possession\" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Body checking is also a penalty in certain leagues in order to reduce the chance of injury to players. Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.\n\n===Offensive tactics===\n{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}\nOffensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to \"shoot\" the puck.\n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660199222).jpg|left|upright|thumb|A [[National Hockey League|NHL]] fan exhibit, where visitors attempt to deflect the puck off the skaters in front of the goalie in order to score]]\nA ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.\n\nA team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.\n\nOne of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2\u20131\u20132]], 1\u20132\u20132, and 1\u20134. The 2\u20131\u20132 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1\u20132\u20132 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1\u20134 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.\n\nThere are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.\n\nA [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for \"decoy\", is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of \"dangling\", which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.\n\n===Fights===\n{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}\n[[File:Fight in ice hockey 2009.JPG|thumb|Fighting in ice hockey is officially prohibited in the rules, although it continues to be an established tradition in the sport in North America]]\nAlthough fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned.

A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone receives what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |title=KAHC Suspended Players |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813154239/http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |archivedate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2009/03/17/hockey_fans_love_fighting_survey_says.html |title=Hockey fans love fighting, survey says |work=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Women's ice hockey}} Women's ice hockey ==\nIce hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing by 400 percent from 1995 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industry Canada |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |accessdate=December 4, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927042219/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |archivedate=September 27, 2004}}</ref> In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/canada.html |title=IIHF About Hockey Canada |publisher=Iihf.com |date=April 26, 1920 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> United States had 65,609,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/united-states.html |title=IIHF About United States |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Finland 4,760,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/finland.html |title=IIHF About Finland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=February 10, 1928 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Sweden 3,075<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/sweden.html |title=IIHF About Sweden |publisher=Iihf.com |date=March 23, 1912 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> and Switzerland 1,172.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/switzerland.html |title=IIHF About Switzerland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=November 23, 1908 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] (CWHL), [[Western Women's Hockey League]], [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL), [[Mid-Atlantic Women's Hockey League]], and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and Olympic teams, and [[recreation]]al teams.

Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.\n\nThe game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the sport is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There have been two major professional women's hockey leagues to have paid its players: the [[National Women's Hockey League]] with teams in the United States and the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] with teams in Canada, China, and the United States.\n\nThe first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. This was followed by the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|first IIHF World Championship in 1990]] in Ottawa.

The league's history began after Canada's National Hockey Association decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League with four teams. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924 and had as many as 10 teams before contracting to six teams by 1942\u201343. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12-team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. In 1979, the 17-team NHL merged with the WHA creating a 21-team league.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey |title=Britannica |last=Fischler |first=Shirley |date= |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League |title=National Hockey League (NHL) |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=}}</ref> The league is expected to expand to 32 teams by 2021.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as \"The A\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024932/http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |archive-date=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 31 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a \"[[Farm team|farm league]]\" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003\u201304 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams.\n\nAs of 2019, there are three minor professional leagues with no NHL affiliations: the [[Federal Prospects Hockey League]] (FPHL), [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH), and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL).\n[[File:2007 Memorial Cup warmup.JPG|thumb|Pre-game warmups prior to a [[Memorial Cup]] game. The tourney serves as the championship for the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]].]]\n[[U Sports]] ice hockey is the highest level of play at the Canadian university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada's governing body for university sports. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.\nIn the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] is composed of college teams at the club level.\n\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe. The major junior players are considered amateurs as they are under 21-years-old and not paid a salary, however, they do get a stipend and play a schedule similar to a professional league. Typically, the [[NHL draft]]s many players directly from the major junior leagues.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are also amateur with players required to be under 21-years old, but do not get a stipend, which allows players to retain their eligibility for participation in [[College ice hockey#NCAA|NCAA ice hockey]].\n\n====Eurasia====\n[[File:Stamp-russia2016-hockey-gagarin-cup.png|thumb|A Russian stamp commemorating the [[Gagarin Cup]], which is presented to the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]]'s playoff champion. The KHL is the largest ice hockey league in Eurasia.]]\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008\u201309 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011\u201312 KHL season|2011\u201312 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The KHL currently comprises member clubs based in [[Belarus]] (1), [[China]] (1), [[Finland]] (1), [[Latvia]] (1), [[Kazakhstan]] (1) and [[Russia]] (19) for a total of 24.\n\nThe second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].\n\nThe highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lineup (5154107439).jpg|thumb|Players from the [[ZSC Lions]] line up prior to a game. The club plays in the Swiss [[National League A]].]]\nSeveral countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, Liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.\n\nBeginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008\u201309 [[Champions Hockey League (2008\u201309)|tournament of the same name]].\n\nThere are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the European Trophy, [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternational club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.\n\n====Other regions====\nThe [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].\n\n[[Ice hockey in Africa]] is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic national leagues, there are several regional leagues in [[South Africa]].\n\n===National team competitions===\n[[File:OvechkinKuba2010WinterOlympics.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian men's hockey team]] moves the puck as [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic's]] [[Filip Kuba]] defends against him, during the 2010 Olympics]]\nIce hockey has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. The United States won its first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]], amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad\u2014an event known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games up until 2018. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.\n\nNational teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.\n[[File:IIHF16WC - Game FIN v BLR.jpg|thumb|Skaters from the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finnish]] and [[Belarus men's national ice hockey team|Belorussian men's ice hockey teams]] shortly after a [[face-off]] during the [[2016 IIHF World Championship]]. The IIHF is an annual national team tournament.]]\nThe [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]], two series pitting the best Canadian and [[Soviet]] players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.\n\nSince the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name=\"IIHF WWC list\" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name=\"Hunter 1998 Olympics\" /> The only finals in the women's world championship or Olympics that did not involve both Canada and the United States were the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden and [[2019 IIHF Women's World Championship Final|2019 World Championship final]] between the US and Finland.\n\nOther ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]].

Pond hockey is commonly referred to in hockey circles as shinny. Its rules differ from traditional hockey because there is no hitting and very little shooting, placing a greater emphasis on skating, puckhandling and passing abilities.

Having started his career with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1996 he remained with the club for six years establishing himself in the Canaries' first team before moving to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in 2001. He went on to play for [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. Having been relegated out of the [[Football League]] with Grimsby in 2010, he was released by the club; he subsequently dropped into [[non-league football|non-league]], joining [[Lowestoft Town F.C.|Lowestoft Town]], where he remained for two seasons before retiring from competitive football in May 2012.\n\nForbes scored the last ever league goal for [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] at the [[Vetch Field]] against Shrewsbury Town on 30 April 2005 in a 1-0 win in front of 11,469 past a young Joe Hart . He then went on to score the winning goal against Bury to secure promotion to League 1 with a volley after 15 seconds in front of 6000 travelling Swansea fans.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Norwich City===\nForbes began his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1995. He played under several different managers in his six years at [[Carrow Road]], including [[Martin O'Neill]], [[Mike Walker (football manager)|Mike Walker]] and [[Bruce Rioch]]. Forbes remained with City from 1996 to 2001, he played in 131 league games, scoring 8 goals.\n\n===Luton Town===\nIn the summer of 2001 he moved to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in a \u00a360,000 deal, and played in three seasons at [[Kenilworth Road]], notably playing his best football under [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]].\n\n===Swansea City===\nForbes signed for [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]], who were then in [[Football League Two]], on a free transfer in 2004.

This coupled with playing second fiddle to other players and the failure to consistently earn a place in the team meant that he would only feature in 13 league matches throughout the entire season. Forbes had returned to fitness towards the end of the campaign but only made a cameo appearance as the season wound to a close. On 12 May 2010, Forbes was one of seven players placed who were deemed surplus to requirements and were placed on the transfer list by [[Grimsby Town FC|Grimsby]] manager [[Neil Woods]] following their relegation from the [[Football League]].<ref>[http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2050024,00.html Grimsby Town | News | Latest News | Latest News | 3 Released, 7 Transfer Listed<!-- Bot generated title -->]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008075751/http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10417~2050024%2C00.html |date=8 October 2011 }}</ref> After failing to find a new club, Forbes was handed a squad number for the 2010\u20132011 season along with [[Nick Colgan]], [[Nick Hegarty]] and [[Chris Jones (footballer born 1989)|Chris Jones]] who has also failed to sign terms elsewhere.

He went on to play for [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. Having been relegated out of the [[Football League]] with Grimsby in 2010, he was released by the club; he subsequently dropped into [[non-league football|non-league]], joining [[Lowestoft Town F.C.|Lowestoft Town]], where he remained for two seasons before retiring from competitive football in May 2012.\n\nForbes scored the last ever league goal for [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] at the [[Vetch Field]] against Shrewsbury Town on 30 April 2005 in a 1-0 win in front of 11,469 past a young Joe Hart . He then went on to score the winning goal against Bury to secure promotion to League 1 with a volley after 15 seconds in front of 6000 travelling Swansea fans.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Norwich City===\nForbes began his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1995. He played under several different managers in his six years at [[Carrow Road]], including [[Martin O'Neill]], [[Mike Walker (football manager)|Mike Walker]] and [[Bruce Rioch]].

This coupled with playing second fiddle to other players and the failure to consistently earn a place in the team meant that he would only feature in 13 league matches throughout the entire season. Forbes had returned to fitness towards the end of the campaign but only made a cameo appearance as the season wound to a close.
