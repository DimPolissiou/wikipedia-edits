A sequel titled ''Tokyo Ghoul:re'' was serialized in the same magazine between October 2014 and July 2018, and was later collected into sixteen ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes. A prequel titled ''Tokyo Ghoul [Jack]'' ran online on Jump Live.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation by studio [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]] aired on [[Tokyo MX]] between July 4, 2014, and September 19, 2014. A 12-episode second season, ''Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA'' (pronounced ''Tokyo Ghoul Root A''), which follows an original story, began airing on January 9, 2015, and concluded on March 27, 2015. In North America, [[Viz Media]] is publishing the manga while [[Funimation]] has licensed the anime series for streaming and home video distribution.\n\nA [[Tokyo Ghoul (film)|live-action film]] based on the manga was released in Japan on July 29, 2017. An anime adaptation based on the sequel manga ''Tokyo Ghoul:re'' began airing from April 3, 2018, and concluded on December 25, 2018, with the series being split into two seasons.cheatyszn\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Tokyo Ghoul'' is set in an alternate reality where [[ghoul]]s, creatures that look like normal people but can only survive by eating human flesh, live amongst the human population in secrecy, hiding their true nature in order to evade pursuit from the authorities. Ghouls have powers including enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a regular ghoul produces 4\u20137 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a normal human; they also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and can become solid instantly. A ghoul's skin is resistant to ordinary piercing weapons, and it has at least one special predatory organ called a {{nihongo||\u8d6b\u5b50|kagune|lead=yes}}, which it can manifest and use as a weapon during combat. Another distinctive trait of ghouls is that when they are excited or hungry, the color of their [[sclera]] in both eyes turns black and their irises red. This mutation is known as {{nihongo||\u8d6b\u773c|kakugan|\"red eye\"}}.\n\nA half-ghoul can either be born naturally as a ghoul and a human's offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some ghoul organs into a human. In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much stronger than a pure-blood ghoul. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the eyes undergoes the \"red eye\" transformation. Natural born half-ghouls are very rare, and creating half-ghouls artificially initially has a low success rate.\n\nThere is also the case of half-humans, hybrids of ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a Kagune while possessing enhanced abilities, like increased speed and reaction speed, but shortened lifespans. Naturally born half-ghouls can also eat like normal humans or like full ghouls.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Tokyo Ghoul characters}}\nThe story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive. The ghouls who manage the coffee shop \"Anteiku\" take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from his best friend Hideyoshi Nagachika.\n\nThe prequel series ''Tokyo Ghoul [Jack]'' follows the youths of Kish\u014d Arima and Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become acquainted when they join forces to investigate the death of Taishi's friend by the hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi eventually following Arima's path and joining the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), the federal agency tasked into dealing with crimes related to ghouls as well.\n\nThe sequel series ''Tokyo Ghoul:re'' follows an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity of Haise Sasaki (the result of horrific brain damage sustained from Kish\u014d Arima). He is the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators called \"Quinx Squad\" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing them to obtain the special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them, but still being able to live as normal humans.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of Tokyo Ghoul chapters}}\n''Tokyo Ghoul'' started as a manga series, written and drawn by Sui Ishida.

illustrated by [[Sui Ishida]]. It was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s [[seinen manga|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'' between September 2011 and September 2014, and it has been collected in fourteen ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of August 2014. A sequel titled ''Tokyo Ghoul:re'' was serialized in the same magazine between October 2014 and July 2018, and was later collected into sixteen ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes. A prequel titled ''Tokyo Ghoul [Jack]'' ran online on Jump Live.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation by studio [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]] aired on [[Tokyo MX]] between July 4, 2014, and September 19, 2014. A 12-episode second season, ''Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA'' (pronounced ''Tokyo Ghoul Root A''), which follows an original story, began airing on January 9, 2015, and concluded on March 27, 2015. In North America, [[Viz Media]] is publishing the manga while [[Funimation]] has licensed the anime series for streaming and home video distribution.\n\nA [[Tokyo Ghoul (film)|live-action film]] based on the manga was released in Japan on July 29, 2017. An anime adaptation based on the sequel manga ''Tokyo Ghoul:re'' began airing from April 3, 2018, and concluded on December 25, 2018, with the series being split into two seasons.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Tokyo Ghoul'' is set in an alternate reality where [[ghoul]]s, creatures that look like normal people but can only survive by eating human flesh, live amongst the human population in secrecy, hiding their true nature in order to evade pursuit from the authorities. Ghouls have powers including enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a regular ghoul produces 4\u20137 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a normal human; they also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and can become solid instantly. A ghoul's skin is resistant to ordinary piercing weapons, and it has at least one special predatory organ called a {{nihongo||\u8d6b\u5b50|kagune|lead=yes}}, which it can manifest and use as a weapon during combat. Another distinctive trait of ghouls is that when they are excited or hungry, the color of their [[sclera]] in both eyes turns black and their irises red. This mutation is known as {{nihongo||\u8d6b\u773c|kakugan|\"red eye\"}}.\n\nA half-ghoul can either be born naturally as a ghoul and a human's offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some ghoul organs into a human. In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much stronger than a pure-blood ghoul. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the eyes undergoes the \"red eye\" transformation. Natural born half-ghouls are very rare, and creating half-ghouls artificially initially has a low success rate.\n\nThere is also the case of half-humans, hybrids of ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a Kagune while possessing enhanced abilities, like increased speed and reaction speed, but shortened lifespans. Naturally born half-ghouls can also eat like normal humans or like full ghouls.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Tokyo Ghoul characters}}\nThe story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive. The ghouls who manage the coffee shop \"Anteiku\" take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from his best friend Hideyoshi Nagachika.\n\nThe prequel series ''Tokyo Ghoul [Jack]'' follows the youths of Kish\u014d Arima and Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become acquainted when they join forces to investigate the death of Taishi's friend by the hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi eventually following Arima's path and joining the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), the federal agency tasked into dealing with crimes related to ghouls as well.\n\nThe sequel series ''Tokyo Ghoul:re'' follows an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity of Haise Sasaki (the result of horrific brain damage sustained from Kish\u014d Arima). He is the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators called \"Quinx Squad\" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing them to obtain the special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them, but still being able to live as normal humans.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of Tokyo Ghoul chapters}}\n''Tokyo Ghoul'' started as a manga series, written and drawn by Sui Ishida.

{"title_page": "Galois group", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], more specifically in the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[Galois theory]], the '''Galois group''' of a certain type of [[field extension]] is a specific [[group (mathematics)|group]] associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the [[polynomial]]s that give rise to them via Galois groups is called [[Galois theory]], so named in honor of [[\u00c9variste Galois]] who first discovered them.\n\nFor a more elementary discussion of Galois groups in terms of [[permutation group]]s, see the article on [[Galois theory]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nSuppose that <math>E</math> is an extension of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>F</math> (written as <math>E/F</math> and read \"<math>E</math> over <math>F</math>\"). An [[automorphism]] of <math>E/F</math> is defined to be an automorphism of <math>E</math> that fixes <math>F</math> pointwise. In other words, an automorphism of {{math|''E''/''F''}} is an [[isomorphism]] <math>\\alpha:E\\to E</math> such that <math>\\alpha(x) = x</math> for each <math>x\\in F</math>. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all automorphisms of <math>E/F</math> forms a group with the operation of [[function composition]]. This group is sometimes denoted by <math>\\text{Aut}(E/F)</math>.\n\nIf <math>E/F</math> is a [[Galois extension]], then <math>\\text{Aut}(E/F)</math> is called the '''Galois group''' of <math>E/F</math>, and is usually denoted by <math>\\text{Gal}(E/F)</math>.<ref>Some authors refer to {{math|Aut(''E''/''F'')}} as the Galois group for arbitrary extensions {{math|''E''/''F''}} and use the corresponding notation, e.g. {{harvnb|Jacobson|2009}}.</ref>\n\nIf <math>E/F</math> is not a Galois extension, then the Galois group of <math>E/F</math> is sometimes defined as <math>\\text{Aut}(K/F)</math>, where <math>K</math> is the [[Galois closure]] of <math>E</math>\n\n=== Of a polynomial ===\nAnother definition of the Galois group comes from the Galois group of a polynomial <math>f \\in F[x]</math>. If there is a field <math>K/F</math> such that <math>f</math> factors as a product of linear polynomials<blockquote><math>f(x) = (x-\\alpha_1)\\cdots (x - \\alpha_k) \\in K[x]</math></blockquote>over the field <math>K</math>, then the '''Galois group of the polynomial''' <math>f</math> is defined as the Galois group of <math>K/F</math> where <math>K</math> is minimal among all such fields.\n\n== Structure of Galois groups ==\n\n=== Fundamental theorem of Galois theory ===\nOne of the important structure theorems from Galois theory comes from the [[Fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]. This states that given a finite Galois extension <math>K/k</math>, there is a bijection between the set of subgields <math>k \\subset E \\subset K</math> and the subgroups <math>H \\subset G</math>. Then, <math>E</math> is given by the set of invariants of <math>K</math> under the action of <math>H</math>, so<blockquote><math>E = K^H = \\{ a\\in K : ga = a \\text{ where } g \\in H \\}</math></blockquote>Moreover, if <math>H \\triangleleft G</math> is a [[Normal subgroup]] then <math>G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(E/k)</math>. And conversely, if <math>E/k</math> is a normal field extension, then the associated subgroup in <math>\\text{Gal}(K/k)</math> is a normal group.\n\n=== Lattice structure ===\nGiven Galois extensions <math>K_1,K_2 / k</math> with Galois groups <math>G_1,G_2</math>, then the field <math>K_1K_2</math> with Galois group <math>G = \\text{Gal}(K_1K_2/k)</math> has an injection<blockquote><math>G \\to G_1 \\times G_2</math></blockquote>which is an isomorphism whenever <math>K_1 \\cap K_2 = k</math>.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Inducting ====\nAs a corollary, this can be inducted finitely many times. Given Galois extensions <math>K_1,\\ldots, K_n / k</math> where <math>K_{i+1} \\cap (K_1\\cdots K_i) = k</math>, then there is an isomorphism of the corresponding Galois groups.<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(K_1\\ldots K_n/k) \\cong G_1\\times \\cdots \\times G_n</math></blockquote>\n\n==Examples==\nIn the following examples {{math|''F''}} is a field, and {{math|'''C'''}}, {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''Q'''}} are the fields of [[complex number|complex]], [[real number|real]], and [[rational number|rational]] numbers, respectively. The notation {{math|''F''(''a'')}} indicates the field extension obtained by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element {{math|''a''}} to the field {{math|''F''}}.\n\n=== Computational tools ===\n\n==== Cardinality of the Galois group and the degree of the field extension ====\nOne of the basic propositions required for completely determining the Galois groups<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://abstract.ups.edu/download/aata-20100827.pdf|title=Abstract Algebra|last=|first=|date=|website=|pages=372\u2013377|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> of a finite field extension is the following: Given a polynomial <math>f(x) \\in F[x]</math>, let <math>E/F</math> be its splitting field extension. Then the order of the Galois group is equal to the degree of the field extension; that is,<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(E/F) = [E:F]</math></blockquote>\n\n==== Eisenstein's criterion ====\nA useful tool for determining the Galois group of a polynomial comes from [[Eisenstein's criterion]]. If a polynomial <math>f \\in F[x]</math> factors into irreducible polynomials <math>f(x) = f_1(x)\\cdots f_k(x)</math> the Galois group of <math>f</math> can be determined using the Galois groups of each <math>f_i(x)</math> since the Galois group of <math>f</math> contains each of the Galois groups of the <math>f_i(x)</math>.\n\n=== Trivial group ===\n<math>\\text{Gal}(F/F)</math> is the trivial group that has a single element, namely the identity automorphism.\n\nAnother example of a Galois group which is trivial is {{math|Aut('''R'''/'''Q''')}}. Indeed, it can be shown that any automorphism of {{math|'''R'''}} must preserve the [[order theory|ordering]] of the real numbers and hence must be the identity.\n\nConsider the field {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''Q'''({{radic|2|3}})}}. The group {{math|Aut(K/'''Q''')}} contains only the identity automorphism. This is because <math>K</math> is not a [[normal extension]], since the other two cube roots of <math>2</math>, <math>e^{2\\pi i / 3}\\sqrt[3]{2}</math> and <math>e^{4\\pi i / 3}\\sqrt[3]{2}</math>, are missing from the extension\u2014in other words {{math|''K''}} is not a [[splitting field]].\n\n=== Finite Abelian groups ===\nThe Galois group {{math|Gal('''C'''/'''R''')}} has two elements, the identity automorphism and the [[complex conjugation]] automorphism<ref>{{citation|title=Classical Algebra: Its Nature, Origins, and Uses|first=Roger L.|last=Cooke|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|isbn=9780470277973|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JG-skeT1eWAC&pg=PA138}}.</ref>.\n\n==== Quadratic extensions ====\nThe degree two field extension <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}</math> has the Galois group {{math|Gal('''Q'''({{sqrt|2}})/'''Q''')}} with two elements, the identity automorphism and the automorphism <math>\\sigma</math> which exchanges +{{sqrt|2}} and \u2212{{sqrt|2}}. This example generalizes for an prime number <math>p \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>.\n\n==== Product of quadratic extensions ====\nUsing the lattice structure of Galois groups, for non-equal prime numbers <math>p_1,\\ldots,p_k</math> the Galois group of <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots, \\sqrt{p_k})/\\mathbb{Q}</math> is<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1},\\ldots, \\sqrt{p_k})/\\mathbb{Q}) & \n\\cong \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1})/\\mathbb{Q})\\times \\cdots \\times \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_k})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\\n&\\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>\n\n==== Cyclotomic extensions ====\nAnother useful class of examples comes from the splitting fields of [[Cyclotomic polynomial|cyclotomic polynomials]]. These are polynomials <math>\\Phi_n</math> defined as<blockquote><math>\\Phi_n(x) = \\prod_{\n\\begin{matrix}\n1 \\leq k \\leq n \\\\\n\\gcd(k,n) = 1\n\\end{matrix}\n} \\left( x - e^{2ik\\pi /n} \\right)</math></blockquote>whose degree is <math>\\phi(n)</math>, [[Euler's totient function]] at <math>n</math>. Then, the splitting field over <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> is <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)</math> and has automorphisms <math>\\sigma_a</math> sending <math>\\zeta_n \\mapsto \\zeta_n^a</math> for <math>1 \\leq a < n</math> relatively prime to <math>n</math>.

The study of field extensions and their relationship to the [[polynomial]]s that give rise to them via Galois groups is called [[Galois theory]], so named in honor of [[\u00c9variste Galois]] who first discovered them.\n\nFor a more elementary discussion of Galois groups in terms of [[permutation group]]s, see the article on [[Galois theory]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nSuppose that <math>E</math> is an extension of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>F</math> (written as <math>E/F</math> and read \"<math>E</math> over <math>F</math>\"). An [[automorphism]] of <math>E/F</math> is defined to be an automorphism of <math>E</math> that fixes <math>F</math> pointwise. In other words, an automorphism of {{math|''E''/''F''}} is an [[isomorphism]] <math>\\alpha:E\\to E</math> such that <math>\\alpha(x) = x</math> for each <math>x\\in F</math>. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all automorphisms of <math>E/F</math> forms a group with the operation of [[function composition]]. This group is sometimes denoted by <math>\\text{Aut}(E/F)</math>.\n\nIf <math>E/F</math> is a [[Galois extension]], then <math>\\text{Aut}(E/F)</math> is called the '''Galois group''' of <math>E/F</math>, and is usually denoted by <math>\\text{Gal}(E/F)</math>.<ref>Some authors refer to {{math|Aut(''E''/''F'')}} as the Galois group for arbitrary extensions {{math|''E''/''F''}} and use the corresponding notation, e.g. {{harvnb|Jacobson|2009}}.</ref>\n\nIf <math>E/F</math> is not a Galois extension, then the Galois group of <math>E/F</math> is sometimes defined as <math>\\text{Aut}(K/F)</math>, where <math>K</math> is the [[Galois closure]] of <math>E</math>\n\n=== Of a polynomial ===\nAnother definition of the Galois group comes from the Galois group of a polynomial <math>f \\in F[x]</math>. If there is a field <math>K/F</math> such that <math>f</math> factors as a product of linear polynomials<blockquote><math>f(x) = (x-\\alpha_1)\\cdots (x - \\alpha_k) \\in K[x]</math></blockquote>over the field <math>K</math>, then the '''Galois group of the polynomial''' <math>f</math> is defined as the Galois group of <math>K/F</math> where <math>K</math> is minimal among all such fields.\n\n== Structure of Galois groups ==\n\n=== Fundamental theorem of Galois theory ===\nOne of the important structure theorems from Galois theory comes from the [[Fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]. This states that given a finite Galois extension <math>K/k</math>, there is a bijection between the set of subgields <math>k \\subset E \\subset K</math> and the subgroups <math>H \\subset G</math>. Then, <math>E</math> is given by the set of invariants of <math>K</math> under the action of <math>H</math>, so<blockquote><math>E = K^H = \\{ a\\in K : ga = a \\text{ where } g \\in H \\}</math></blockquote>Moreover, if <math>H \\triangleleft G</math> is a [[Normal subgroup]] then <math>G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(E/k)</math>. And conversely, if <math>E/k</math> is a normal field extension, then the associated subgroup in <math>\\text{Gal}(K/k)</math> is a normal group.\n\n=== Lattice structure ===\nGiven Galois extensions <math>K_1,K_2 / k</math> with Galois groups <math>G_1,G_2</math>, then the field <math>K_1K_2</math> with Galois group <math>G = \\text{Gal}(K_1K_2/k)</math> has an injection<blockquote><math>G \\to G_1 \\times G_2</math></blockquote>which is an isomorphism whenever <math>K_1 \\cap K_2 = k</math>.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Inducting ====\nAs a corollary, this can be inducted finitely many times. Given Galois extensions <math>K_1,\\ldots, K_n / k</math> where <math>K_{i+1} \\cap (K_1\\cdots K_i) = k</math>, then there is an isomorphism of the corresponding Galois groups.<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(K_1\\ldots K_n/k) \\cong G_1\\times \\cdots \\times G_n</math></blockquote>\n\n==Examples==\nIn the following examples {{math|''F''}} is a field, and {{math|'''C'''}}, {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''Q'''}} are the fields of [[complex number|complex]], [[real number|real]], and [[rational number|rational]] numbers, respectively. The notation {{math|''F''(''a'')}} indicates the field extension obtained by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element {{math|''a''}} to the field {{math|''F''}}.\n\n=== Computational tools ===\n\n==== Cardinality of the Galois group and the degree of the field extension ====\nOne of the basic propositions required for completely determining the Galois groups<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://abstract.ups.edu/download/aata-20100827.pdf|title=Abstract Algebra|last=|first=|date=|website=|pages=372\u2013377|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> of a finite field extension is the following: Given a polynomial <math>f(x) \\in F[x]</math>, let <math>E/F</math> be its splitting field extension. Then the order of the Galois group is equal to the degree of the field extension; that is,<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(E/F) = [E:F]</math></blockquote>\n\n==== Eisenstein's criterion ====\nA useful tool for determining the Galois group of a polynomial comes from [[Eisenstein's criterion]]. If a polynomial <math>f \\in F[x]</math> factors into irreducible polynomials <math>f(x) = f_1(x)\\cdots f_k(x)</math> the Galois group of <math>f</math> can be determined using the Galois groups of each <math>f_i(x)</math> since the Galois group of <math>f</math> contains each of the Galois groups of the <math>f_i(x)</math>.\n\n=== Trivial group ===\n<math>\\text{Gal}(F/F)</math> is the trivial group that has a single element, namely the identity automorphism.\n\nAnother example of a Galois group which is trivial is {{math|Aut('''R'''/'''Q''')}}. Indeed, it can be shown that any automorphism of {{math|'''R'''}} must preserve the [[order theory|ordering]] of the real numbers and hence must be the identity.\n\nConsider the field {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''Q'''({{radic|2|3}})}}. The group {{math|Aut(K/'''Q''')}} contains only the identity automorphism. This is because <math>K</math> is not a [[normal extension]], since the other two cube roots of <math>2</math>, <math>e^{2\\pi i / 3}\\sqrt[3]{2}</math> and <math>e^{4\\pi i / 3}\\sqrt[3]{2}</math>, are missing from the extension\u2014in other words {{math|''K''}} is not a [[splitting field]].\n\n=== Finite Abelian groups ===\nThe Galois group {{math|Gal('''C'''/'''R''')}} has two elements, the identity automorphism and the [[complex conjugation]] automorphism<ref>{{citation|title=Classical Algebra: Its Nature, Origins, and Uses|first=Roger L.|last=Cooke|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|isbn=9780470277973|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JG-skeT1eWAC&pg=PA138}}.</ref>.\n\n==== Quadratic extensions ====\nThe degree two field extension <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}</math> has the Galois group {{math|Gal('''Q'''({{sqrt|2}})/'''Q''')}} with two elements, the identity automorphism and the automorphism <math>\\sigma</math> which exchanges +{{sqrt|2}} and \u2212{{sqrt|2}}.

These are polynomials <math>\\Phi_n</math> defined as<blockquote><math>\\Phi_n(x) = \\prod_{\n\\begin{matrix}\n1 \\leq k \\leq n \\\\\n\\gcd(k,n) = 1\n\\end{matrix}\n} \\left( x - e^{2ik\\pi /n} \\right)</math></blockquote>whose degree is <math>\\phi(n)</math>, [[Euler's totient function]] at <math>n</math>.

He joined a [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] expedition which departed [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in the spring of 1822.  Other trappers in this group included:  [[Jim Bridger]], David Jackson, [[Jedediah Smith]], [[Thomas Fitzpatrick (trapper)|Thomas Fitzpatrick]], [[Hugh Glass]], James Clyman, Daniel T. Potts, and Milton Sublette.  This was the first party of American trappers to cross the [[continental divide]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/johnweber.html\n|title= John  Weber\n|publisher=Utah History Encyclopedia\n|authors= S. Matthew Despain and Fred R. Gowans  \n|accessdate= December 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon reaching the mouth of the [[Yellowstone River]], the company divided into two independent brigades, with Weber serving in a leadership position.  During the summer of 1824, Weber's brigade crossed South Pass and the Green River Valley and descended into the Bear River region in time for a fall hunt.  As winter approached, the company journeyed to [[Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah)|Bear Lake]], then to the Bear River's northern bend and finally south into what is today Utah's [[Cache Valley]].  The brigade spent the winter of 1824&ndash;25 on Cub Creek near present-day [[Cove, Utah]].  While in Cache Valley, the group discussed the possible course and ultimate outlet of the Bear River.  According to his own account, the young Bridger was selected to settle the question by floating down the river.  For many years Bridger was credited for the discovery of the [[Great Salt Lake]].  More recent evidence suggests, that Canadian-American [[Etienne Provost]] and his trapping party, working out of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] in Mexican territory, visited the southern edge of the inland sea earlier in the same winter.\n\nThe following spring, Weber's brigade traveled throughout extreme southeastern Idaho and northern Utah.  A portion of the brigade, under the leadership of Johnson Gardner, confronted [[Peter Skene Ogden]], the leader of [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) Snake Country Expedition near present-day [[Mountain Green, Utah]].  Gardner insisted that they were in United States territory. Ogden countered that the area in contention was under joint occupation.  During the incident, Gardner was able to lure a number of men, many of them Canadian [[Iroquois]], away from their British employer by offering higher prices for their furs.  The reduction in force led Ogden to retrace his steps back to the HBC  \"Flathead House\" near [[Flathead Lake]] in modern Montana. That summer, Weber and his brigade were at the first [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|rendezvous]] held in  [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming]], near present McKinnon, just north of the Utah border.\n\nWeber's remaining mountain years are less well documented; however, he spent the winter of 1825-26 in the Salt Lake Valley after Ashley's men were forced by severe winter weather to move their winter quarters from Cache Valley. It appears that Utah's [[Weber River]] was [[Name|christened]], during this winter camp.  This Weber place-naming gave rise to the present names of Utah's [[Weber Canyon]], [[Weber County, Utah|Weber County]] and [[Weber State University]].\n\nWeber attended the rendezvous of 1826, in Cache Valley and left the fur trade, and the [[Western United States|West]], shortly thereafter. However, some accounts confuse John Henry Weber with a trapper named John Weber, who was killed by Indians in the winter of 1828-29.\n\n==Later years and death==\nWeber spent the remainder of his life in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]], first returning to [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri]] and his former position, as recorder with the U.S. government, lead mines.  In 1833, Weber was the assistant superintendent of U.S. government lead mines in [[Galena, Illinois]], and served briefly, as superintendent, until his retirement in 1840.  Weber moved to [[Bellevue, Iowa|Bellevue]], [[Jackson County, Iowa]], where he died by suicide in February, 1859.\n<ref>{{cite www\n|url=http://iagenweb.org/boards/jackson/biographies/index.cgi?read=203430\n|title= Capt.

The long vowel pronunciation is used in all Utah place names. Weber's own family descendants use the traditional Midwest pronunciation of Webber.

2013, ''British Lion'' holds a score of 56 at the aggregate review site [[Metacritic]], indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> ''[[Record Collector]]'' awarded the album 3/5 and stated that \"though it's not entirely a chore to listen to, it is probably not memorable enough to appeal far outside of that circle [of Iron Maiden fans]\".<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref name=\"Revolver\"/> [[AllMusic]] gave it a score of 2.5/5, deeming it \"a serviceable slab of unpretentious yet utterly forgettable '80s retro-metal that adheres to every clich\u00e9 in the book\".<ref name= \"AM\"/> Although they called it \"a solid \u201870s style hard rock effort\", [[About.com]] criticised some songs for being \"nothing but filler.\"<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n''[[Kerrang!]]'' deemed it \"a brilliant album\", describing it as \"the sound of an incredibly talented songwriter stepping outside of what he'd normally do and indulging himself in something a bit different with a group of excellent musicians.\"<ref name=\"Kerrang!\"/> ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' were also very positive towards the release, praising the \"infectious re-imaginings of the [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] albums that inspired their creator as a kid,\" concluding that \"This is a big hearted and ferocious triumph.\"<ref name=\"MHreview\"/> Although they criticised the album's lyrics, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' complimented vocalist Richard Taylor and guitarist Graham Leslie, concluding that \"''British Lion'' is an album that is both exactly what you'd expect, and far better than that.\"<ref name=\"CR review\"/> [[Artistdirect]] awarded it full marks, stating that \"As far as songwriters go, [Harris is] on the level with [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Tony Iommi]], and his new album, ''British Lion'', proves that tenfold\".<ref name=\"artistdirect\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs are written by [[Steve Harris
