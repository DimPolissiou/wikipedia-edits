Similar to the Coastal and C-Star class airships, one gun was mounted on a platform on top of the envelope which was reached through a climbing shaft.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\n===Crew===\nThe normal crew comprised two watches of five \u2013 necessary for extended patrols \u2013 and consisted of a Captain and Second Officer, a [[Coxswain]] and Second coxswain, two W/T Operators, two Engineers and two Air Gunners. The Captain was in overall command of the vessel, and was assisted by the Second Officer in navigating, maintaining height, and regulating gas pressure. The Coxswain was responsible for the rest of the crew, and for the care and maintenance of the ship whilst on the ground. He or the Second Coxswain steered the vessel in flight from a position at the very front of the control car. During patrols, the Air Gunners took on the duties of look-outs and also acted as cooks.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Testing and problems===\nThe first example, ''N.S.1'', carried out initial flight trials on 1 February 1917. Preliminary trials were regarded as being satisfactory; the ship achieving a speed of {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and proving easy to handle. Two further flights were carried out in March, the second of which was a longer cross-country round trip from Kingsnorth to [[Maidenhead]], [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Guildford]], and back to Kingsnorth again. Following the success of this flight, ''N.S.1'' transferred to [[RNAS Pulham]], [[Norfolk]], on 18 April 1917 for more extensive trials. Minor snags encountered during flights over the next few weeks were ironed out, and it was then decided to carry out a full-scale endurance test taking place on 5 June. However, just over 16 hours into the flight, the [[universal joint]] on one of the propeller driveshafts broke and the ship returned to Pulham. Then, on 26 June, she again took to the air at 06:00 and remained aloft until 07:22 on 28 June \u2013 a flight duration of {{nowrap|49 h 22 min}} during which she covered {{convert|1536|mi|km}} and encountered only minor technical problems. At that time, this was a record for a British airship of any type.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.2'''s early trials at Kingsnorth were also satisfactory, but during an endurance trial on 27 June similar to that of ''N.S.1'', she became unmanageable when she lost gas and was wrecked in an attempted landing near [[Stowmarket]], [[Suffolk]].<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.3'' made an 11-hour non-stop flight on 22 July 1917 to her operational base at RNAS [[East Fortune]] following trials in June at Kingsnorth. She was joined there on 6 September by ''N.S.1'', and by ''N.S.4'' from Kingsnorth on 15 October. ''N.S.5'' set off for East Fortune on 12 December, but both engines failed within sight of her destination, and she drifted with the wind for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} before they could be restarted. However, since both engines continued to be troublesome it was decided to make a \"free balloon\" landing, but she was damaged beyond repair during the attempt.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n===Modifications===\nThe Rolls-Royce engines together with their method of installation and complex transmission continually presented problems. They were connected to the propellers via long, heavy driveshafts that were only lightly supported, thus placing undue strain on the transmission system and invariably causing the universal joint nearest the propeller to fracture.<ref name=NS3/><ref name=W68/>\n\nThe Kingsnorth design team hastily set about redesigning the power car and transmission gear, and at the same time, staff at East Fortune were also looking into ways of improving the design. Kingsnorth considered the idea of replacing the Rolls-Royce engines with {{convert|240|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Fiat]] units having a direct drive to the propellers; while East Fortune's Engineering Officer, Lt.Cdr. A. S. Abell, [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]], together with Flt.Cdr. J. S. Wheelwright, [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] (Captain of ''N.S.3''), came up with the idea of raising the control car to the same level as the engineers' car; form them into a single fully enclosed unit that measured {{convert|85|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and tapered to the stern,<ref name=W68/> and fit the propellers directly onto the engine crankshafts. These and other minor measures provided the crew with more room and improved their comfort; increased top speed through reduced air resistance (the redesigned car was more aerodynamic and positioned closer to the envelope); resulted in a reduction in weight; and improved reliability due to the abolition of the troublesome transmission shafts.<ref name=W69/> In January 1918, the [[Admiralty]] granted permission for these modifications to be undertaken at both Kingsnorth, and at East Fortune where the work was completed by the beginning of March.<ref name=NS3/>\n\nMainly due to the lack of a suitable alternative, official interest continued in the NS class despite the early reliability problems and the loss of two examples during their first months of service, and a further six were subsequently ordered in November 1917. Production continued until the end of the war and for a short time after.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===''N.S.3''===\nUnder the continuing command of Captain Wheelwright and with Admiralty officials on board, ''N.S.3'' successfully completed test flights on 11 March 1918, and the following day she undertook an eight-hour trial whilst maintaining a speed in excess of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Subsequently, numerous requests to start operational duties were submitted to the Admiralty, and on 3 April permission was granted for a three-quarters power duration flight over land. ''N.S.3'' flew from Longside to Kingsnorth and back to East Fortune; a journey of {{convert|816|mi|km}} in 22&nbsp;hours which at the time constituted a record for British airships. During the flight both engines ran perfectly \u2013 the starboard engine ran continuously, while the other was only stopped for about five&nbsp;minutes to replace a broken dynamo drivebelt.\n\nOn 17 April ''N.S.3'' performed her first convoy escort, and from 20\u201322 April she completed a flight of 55&nbsp;hours with various convoys \u2013 the longest flight to that date of any non-rigid airship. During May 1918, she flew over 130 hours \u2013 one patrol lasted for 33&nbsp;hours, and another for 20&nbsp;hours which was curtailed only by orders to return to base due to increasing winds. During a flight on the night of 31 May / 1 June whilst participating in the testing of the anti-aircraft capabilities of the Grand Fleet and shore batteries near [[Rosyth]], ''N.S.3'' achieved a height of {{convert|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}} \u2013 another record for the type. In early June 1918, she commenced towing trials with the destroyer {{HMS|Vectis|D51|6}} to examine the possibility of towing an airship at speed should it break down or run short of fuel. The tests were initially successful reaching speeds of almost {{convert|20|kn|km/h}}, and on the final run ''N.S.3'' touched down on the sea to exchange two officers from HMS Vectis for two of NS3's crew.<ref name=\"NS3\" />\n\n''N.S.3'''s final patrol commenced on 21 June 1918 with orders to proceed from East Fortune to escort a south-bound Scandinavian convoy. She joined the convoy off [[Aberdeen]] around 7&nbsp;pm; however, later that night increasing winds prompted the decision to return to base at full speed, but severe turbulence and loss of gas caused the ship to crash into the sea early on {{nowrap|22 June 1918}} with the loss of five lives. The survivors were picked up from the floating wreckage some time later by the destroyer [[HMS Moy (1904)|HMS ''Moy'']].<ref name=NS3/>\n\n===Other ships===\nIn its modified form the type contributed much valuable war service, and at the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]] on 11 November 1918 six examples were still in service at operational stations \u2013 ''N.S.7'' and ''8'' were based at East Fortune and escorted the surrendered German High Seas fleet back to Rosyth, while ''N.S.4'', ''6'', ''11'' and ''12'' operated from Longside.<ref name=NS3/> Two further ships, ''N.S.14'' and ''16'', were under construction at Kingsnorth, and were flown after the war.<ref name=AHT/><ref name=NSClass/>\n\n[[File:Our wonderful navy; the story of the sure shield in peace and war (1919) (14762399491).jpg|alt=|thumb|N.S.8 of the NS class portrayed in 1919.]]\n\nUnder the command of Captain W. K. Warnford ''N.S.11'' set an early endurance record of {{nowrap|61 h 30 min}}, and accompanied by ''N.S.12'' made the first airship journey to Norway. ''N.S.11'' then went on to set a further flight endurance record of 101&nbsp;hours during a [[Naval mine|mine]]-hunting patrol on 9\u201313 February 1919 having covered some {{convert|4000|mi|km}}. Rigid airship [[R33 class airship|''R34'']] then broke this record when she completed a voyage from East Fortune to [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]], [[Long Island]], United States in 108&nbsp;hours, and while subsequently attempting (unofficially) to regain this record<ref>''N.S.11'' had a reduced crew, and it was later suggested she was carrying \"ample fuel\" for an endurance attempt. (''from: Loss of N.S.11.'' Warmsley, N.)</ref> ''N.S.11'' was [[Airship NS11 crash|lost]]. In the early hours of 15 July on what was officially supposed to be a mine-hunting patrol, she was seen to fly beneath a long \"greasy black cloud\" off [[Cley next the Sea]] on the Norfolk coast and a massive explosion was heard shortly after. A vivid glare lasted for a few minutes as the burning airship descended, and finally plunged into the sea after a second explosion. There were no survivors, and the findings of the official Court of Enquiry were inconclusive, but amongst other possibilities it was thought that a lightning strike may have caused the explosion.<ref name=11loss>[http://www.ns11.org/loss-of-ns11-%E2%80%93-a-local-view ''Loss of N.S.11.''] Retrieved on 5 March 2013.</ref>\n\nFollowing the loss of ''N.S.11'', only ''N.S.7'' and ''8'' remained in service \u2013 ''N.S.14'' had been sold to the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] and the rest had either been wrecked, deleted or deflated. ''N.S.8'' was deleted in October 1919, while the final flight of the last of the type, ''N.S.7'', took place on 25 October 1921.<ref name=NSClass/> N.S.14 was transferred to the US Navy on 8 November 1918.

Preliminary trials were regarded as being satisfactory; the ship achieving a speed of {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and proving easy to handle. Two further flights were carried out in March, the second of which was a longer cross-country round trip from Kingsnorth to [[Maidenhead]], [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Guildford]], and back to Kingsnorth again. Following the success of this flight, ''N.S.1'' transferred to [[RNAS Pulham]], [[Norfolk]], on 18 April 1917 for more extensive trials. Minor snags encountered during flights over the next few weeks were ironed out, and it was then decided to carry out a full-scale endurance test taking place on 5 June. However, just over 16 hours into the flight, the [[universal joint]] on one of the propeller driveshafts broke and the ship returned to Pulham. Then, on 26 June, she again took to the air at 06:00 and remained aloft until 07:22 on 28 June \u2013 a flight duration of {{nowrap|49 h 22 min}} during which she covered {{convert|1536|mi|km}} and encountered only minor technical problems. At that time, this was a record for a British airship of any type.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.2'''s early trials at Kingsnorth were also satisfactory, but during an endurance trial on 27 June similar to that of ''N.S.1'', she became unmanageable when she lost gas and was wrecked in an attempted landing near [[Stowmarket]], [[Suffolk]].<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.3'' made an 11-hour non-stop flight on 22 July 1917 to her operational base at RNAS [[East Fortune]] following trials in June at Kingsnorth. She was joined there on 6 September by ''N.S.1'', and by ''N.S.4'' from Kingsnorth on 15 October. ''N.S.5'' set off for East Fortune on 12 December, but both engines failed within sight of her destination, and she drifted with the wind for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} before they could be restarted. However, since both engines continued to be troublesome it was decided to make a \"free balloon\" landing, but she was damaged beyond repair during the attempt.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n===Modifications===\nThe Rolls-Royce engines together with their method of installation and complex transmission continually presented problems. They were connected to the propellers via long, heavy driveshafts that were only lightly supported, thus placing undue strain on the transmission system and invariably causing the universal joint nearest the propeller to fracture.<ref name=NS3/><ref name=W68/>\n\nThe Kingsnorth design team hastily set about redesigning the power car and transmission gear, and at the same time, staff at East Fortune were also looking into ways of improving the design. Kingsnorth considered the idea of replacing the Rolls-Royce engines with {{convert|240|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Fiat]] units having a direct drive to the propellers; while East Fortune's Engineering Officer, Lt.Cdr. A. S. Abell, [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]], together with Flt.Cdr. J. S. Wheelwright, [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] (Captain of ''N.S.3''), came up with the idea of raising the control car to the same level as the engineers' car; form them into a single fully enclosed unit that measured {{convert|85|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and tapered to the stern,<ref name=W68/> and fit the propellers directly onto the engine crankshafts. These and other minor measures provided the crew with more room and improved their comfort; increased top speed through reduced air resistance (the redesigned car was more aerodynamic and positioned closer to the envelope); resulted in a reduction in weight; and improved reliability due to the abolition of the troublesome transmission shafts.<ref name=W69/> In January 1918, the [[Admiralty]] granted permission for these modifications to be undertaken at both Kingsnorth, and at East Fortune where the work was completed by the beginning of March.<ref name=NS3/>\n\nMainly due to the lack of a suitable alternative, official interest continued in the NS class despite the early reliability problems and the loss of two examples during their first months of service, and a further six were subsequently ordered in November 1917. Production continued until the end of the war and for a short time after.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===''N.S.3''===\nUnder the continuing command of Captain Wheelwright and with Admiralty officials on board, ''N.S.3'' successfully completed test flights on 11 March 1918, and the following day she undertook an eight-hour trial whilst maintaining a speed in excess of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Subsequently, numerous requests to start operational duties were submitted to the Admiralty, and on 3 April permission was granted for a three-quarters power duration flight over land. ''N.S.3'' flew from Longside to Kingsnorth and back to East Fortune; a journey of {{convert|816|mi|km}} in 22&nbsp;hours which at the time constituted a record for British airships. During the flight both engines ran perfectly \u2013 the starboard engine ran continuously, while the other was only stopped for about five&nbsp;minutes to replace a broken dynamo drivebelt.\n\nOn 17 April ''N.S.3'' performed her first convoy escort, and from 20\u201322 April she completed a flight of 55&nbsp;hours with various convoys \u2013 the longest flight to that date of any non-rigid airship. During May 1918, she flew over 130 hours \u2013 one patrol lasted for 33&nbsp;hours, and another for 20&nbsp;hours which was curtailed only by orders to return to base due to increasing winds. During a flight on the night of 31 May / 1 June whilst participating in the testing of the anti-aircraft capabilities of the Grand Fleet and shore batteries near [[Rosyth]], ''N.S.3'' achieved a height of {{convert|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}} \u2013 another record for the type. In early June 1918, she commenced towing trials with the destroyer {{HMS|Vectis|D51|6}} to examine the possibility of towing an airship at speed should it break down or run short of fuel. The tests were initially successful reaching speeds of almost {{convert|20|kn|km/h}}, and on the final run ''N.S.3'' touched down on the sea to exchange two officers from HMS Vectis for two of NS3's crew.<ref name=\"NS3\" />\n\n''N.S.3'''s final patrol commenced on 21 June 1918 with orders to proceed from East Fortune to escort a south-bound Scandinavian convoy. She joined the convoy off [[Aberdeen]] around 7&nbsp;pm; however, later that night increasing winds prompted the decision to return to base at full speed, but severe turbulence and loss of gas caused the ship to crash into the sea early on {{nowrap|22 June 1918}} with the loss of five lives. The survivors were picked up from the floating wreckage some time later by the destroyer [[HMS Moy (1904)|HMS ''Moy'']].<ref name=NS3/>\n\n===Other ships===\nIn its modified form the type contributed much valuable war service, and at the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]] on 11 November 1918 six examples were still in service at operational stations \u2013 ''N.S.7'' and ''8'' were based at East Fortune and escorted the surrendered German High Seas fleet back to Rosyth, while ''N.S.4'', ''6'', ''11'' and ''12'' operated from Longside.<ref name=NS3/> Two further ships, ''N.S.14'' and ''16'', were under construction at Kingsnorth, and were flown after the war.<ref name=AHT/><ref name=NSClass/>\n\nUnder the command of Captain W. K. Warnford ''N.S.11'' set an early endurance record of {{nowrap|61 h 30 min}}, and accompanied by ''N.S.12'' made the first airship journey to Norway. ''N.S.11'' then went on to set a further flight endurance record of 101&nbsp;hours during a [[Naval mine|mine]]-hunting patrol on 9\u201313 February 1919 having covered some {{convert|4000|mi|km}}. Rigid airship [[R33 class airship|''R34'']] then broke this record when she completed a voyage from East Fortune to [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]], [[Long Island]], United States in 108&nbsp;hours, and while subsequently attempting (unofficially) to regain this record<ref>''N.S.11'' had a reduced crew, and it was later suggested she was carrying \"ample fuel\" for an endurance attempt. (''from: Loss of N.S.11.'' Warmsley, N.)</ref> ''N.S.11'' was [[Airship NS11 crash|lost]]. In the early hours of 15 July on what was officially supposed to be a mine-hunting patrol, she was seen to fly beneath a long \"greasy black cloud\" off [[Cley next the Sea]] on the Norfolk coast and a massive explosion was heard shortly after. A vivid glare lasted for a few minutes as the burning airship descended, and finally plunged into the sea after a second explosion. There were no survivors, and the findings of the official Court of Enquiry were inconclusive, but amongst other possibilities it was thought that a lightning strike may have caused the explosion.<ref name=11loss>[http://www.ns11.org/loss-of-ns11-%E2%80%93-a-local-view ''Loss of N.S.11.''] Retrieved on 5 March 2013.</ref>\n\nFollowing the loss of ''N.S.11'', only ''N.S.7'' and ''8'' remained in service \u2013 ''N.S.14'' had been sold to the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] and the rest had either been wrecked, deleted or deflated. ''N.S.8'' was deleted in October 1919, while the final flight of the last of the type, ''N.S.7'', took place on 25 October 1921.<ref name=NSClass/> N.S.14 was transferred to the US Navy on 8 November 1918. N.S.14 was shipped to Wingfoot lake, then to Hampton Roads, arriving on 30 January 1920, There currently are no records of N.S.14 operating with the US Navy.<ref>Shock, James R., U.S. Navy Airships 1915-1962, 2001, Atlantis Productions, Edgewater Florida, {{ISBN|0-9639743-8-6}}, page 46</ref>\n\n[[File:Our wonderful navy; the story of the sure shield in peace and war (1919) (14762399491).jpg|alt=|thumb|N.S.8 of the NS class portrayed in 1919.]]\n\nIn total 14 NS class blimps were constructed.<ref>[http://aht.ndirect.co.uk/airships/northsea/North_sea_logs.htm NS class logs.] Airship Heritage Trust.

It is encoded in the range U+1F100&ndash;U+1F1FF in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]].\n\nThe block is mostly an extension of the [[Enclosed Alphanumerics]] block, containing further enclosed alphanumeric characters which are not included in that block or [[Enclosed CJK Letters and Months]]. Most of the characters are single alphanumerics in boxes or circles, or with trailing commas. Two of the symbols are identified as [[dingbat]]s. A number of multiple-letter enclosed abbreviations are also included, mostly to provide compatibility with [[Broadcast Markup Language]] standards (see [[ARIB STD B24 character set]]) and Japanese telecommunications networks' [[emoji]] sets.

His eyes, though prosthetic, often bulge comically when he is alarmed. He frequently jokes with Motoko, [[Togusa]], the [[Tachikomas]], and practically everyone else who crosses his path. His serious side becomes much more pronounced in a chapter of the manga where Yano, a trainee of Batou's, is murdered by a cybercriminal named Koil Krasnov.

It also means \"eight-headed\" in Mandarin Chinese, which is significant since \"Kusanagi\" was the name of a sword that was taken from Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed mountain dragon in Japanese mythology.\n\n===Relationships===\nOf all Section 9 characters, Batou is closest with the Major professionally and in civilian life. Even on missions, he is known to disregard her rank or authority to \"speak freely\" without permission.\n\n==Appearances in media==\n[[File:Richard Epcar Headshot.jpg|thumb|Richard Epcar is his most iconic English voice actor.]]\n[[File:David Kaye at an autograph session at Botcon 2008 in Cincinnati, Ohio.jpg |thumb|David Kaye voices Batou in the Ocean dubs of GitS.]]\n[[File:Christopher Sabat by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Chris Sabat voices Batou in Arise and The New Movie.]]\n\n===In literature===\nBatou originally appeared in the manga authored by [[Masamune Shirow]], serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''\"Young Magazine Pirate Edition\"'' from 1989 to 1991. Unlike ''S.A.C.'', where in a similar situation Batou spares the life of an ex-[[C.I.A.]] operative, Batou makes good on his threat and personally terminates Koil. His appearance and style of dress vary considerably over the series' run.\n\nIn ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface]]'', Botou's head is shaved, and he is dressed in a simple black outfit, though his sense of humor remains intact. During a psychic monitoring of the virtual contact between the main character of the manga and another entity on the net, the psychic states, \"Something of substance, something fruitful has passed between them,\" to which Batou remarks, \"A [[persimmon]] maybe?\" This prompts Chief Aramaki to issue an [[ultimatum]]: \"If you can't be serious you can leave the room.\" He also asks to link with the psychic when she suffers a similar experience to Motoko's contact with the [[Project 2501|Puppet Master]], but his request is denied.\n\n===In films===\n====Animated film====\nThe portrayal of Batou in Mamoru Oshii's films is very different from the depiction in the anime series. ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence|Innocence]]'' depict a Batou who is much more subdued, even to the point of brusqueness. His appearance consists of a white crew-cut (similar to the manga) in the first film, while in the second film he has a short ponytail. Batou is voiced by [[Akio \u014ctsuka]] in Japanese and [[Richard Epcar]] in English in all ''Ghost in the Shell'' media with the exception of ''The Laughing Man'' and ''Individual Eleven'' OVAs where he is voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in English, and ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Arise|Arise]]'', where he is voiced by Kenichirou Matsuda and [[Christopher Sabat]] respectively.\n\nBatou is the central character of ''Innocence'', which centers around his personal life after the disappearance of Major Motoko Kusanagi at the end of the first film. Oshii has commented that the investigation is really secondary to the plot. What is most notable about Batou's emotion in ''Innocence'' is his lack thereof; for the most part he expresses nothing whatsoever. The commentary on the ''Innocence'' DVD touches on the fact that it is Batou's lone companion, a [[Basset Hound]] named Gabriel, that express almost all of the emotion in the entire film. When Batou is required to leave in order to continue his investigation, Gabriel is left in the care of [[Togusa]] and his family. [[Ishikawa (Ghost in the Shell)|Ishikawa]], Batou's senior, chides him for keeping such a high-maintenance dog since he is a single man in a dangerous line of work. The film strongly suggests that Batou harbors romantic feelings for the Major; however, no definitive statement of his feelings is ever made.\n\nAfter shooting his own right arm as a result of brain-hacking, Batou is fitted with a new DNA-matched prosthetic arm with a shotgun hidden inside. He is depicted as being tougher than in the other ''Ghost in the Shell'' incarnations, when he is seen to shoot two live grenades and survive the blast, and withstand a substantial leap down the shaft of the Locus Solus factory ship. In both films, Batou carries a gun dubbed a \"Jericho 942,\" based on the real [[Jericho 941]] made by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]] but chambered for [[.50AE]]. In ''Innocence'', he is also seen with a compact S&W pistol and a small semiautomatic shotgun. The ''Innocence'' prequel novel, \"[[After the Long Goodbye]],\" notes that Batou's S&W pistol is chambered for the [[.40 S&W]] cartridge.\n\n====Live action film====\n[[Pilou Asb\u00e6k]] portrays Batou in the 2017 live action film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/pilou-asbaek-scarlett-johansson-ghost-in-the-shell-1201637556/|title=Pilou Asb\u00e6k to Co-Star with Scarlett Johansson in 'Ghost in the Shell' (Exclusive)|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref> \"The manga is very philosophical, very weird, very spiritual,\" said Asb\u00e6k. \"So I knew that my job with Batou was to bring in a little bit of heart and soul into this futuristic sci-fi world.\" Asb\u00e6k had a hard time understanding his character until he looked back at the ''Ghost in the Shell'' source material. \"I didn\u2019t have any idea what to do with the character and then I looked at the manga again, and I saw two things. I saw he likes beer, and he likes pizza. And if you know me for five minutes, that\u2019s 80 percent of my personality!\" he said.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/01/ghost-in-the-shell-meet-the-section-9-team</ref> The novelization of the film describes Batou as a Scandinavian.\n\n===In television===\n====''Stand Alone Complex'' series====\nIn ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', Batou's personality closely resembles his manga counterpart. He is depicted as an outgoing jokester, but with a quick temper. Unlike the Major, Batou often expresses his anger at injustice and cruelty quite openly. He is sometimes shown to be impatient with Section 9's rookies, such as [[Togusa]]. At times, Batou acts as a voice of reason and displays great concern for the Major, and she in turn admits that she can confide in him. Like Oshii's films, the series suggests romantic tension between the Major and Batou. The film ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society|Solid State Society]]'' more openly addresses this tension, when Batou admits that he'd been covering up the Major's involvement in any cases prior to the Puppeteer case. The movie closes with Batou putting his arm around the Major, although whether or not this is foretelling of any relationship between the two is left ambiguous.\n\nBatou had served in a military [[special forces]] unit and often states that he was a [[Ranger Courses (Japan Ground Self-Defense Force)|Ranger-trained soldier]] with the [[Japanese Ground Self Defense Force]] (JGSDF) before entering Section 9. Despite the fact that his prosthetic body has little to gain from [[exercise]], Batou often lifts weights and [[jogging|jogs]]. He is shown to have an affinity for martial arts and is widely regarded as nearly the best hand-to-hand combatant in Section 9, second only to the Major. He once idolized a famous boxer, Zaitsev, with whom he later spars while on an undercover mission.\n\nBatou is the favorite superior of the [[Tachikoma]]s because he regularly showers them with care and affection; in episode 2.15, it also is apparent that he shares a physical resemblance with their chief programmer. He has even dubbed one unit as his \"personal\" Tachikoma, refusing to operate any other and treating it with [[organic material|organic]] [[oil]], both habits which culminate in problems. Later in the series, the [[Tachikoma]]s' [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] starts to develop rapidly, which is attributed to a mutation in a protein chip caused by Batou's oil. Also, since Batou treats them as individuals as opposed to interchangeable units, they begin to view themselves as such, which contributes to the development of their AI.\n\nBatou is often seen driving a yellow [[Lancia Stratos]] coupe, a rare Italian car from the 1970s. He is shown to be very protective of the car and is hesitant to allow others to drive it. Togusa refers to Batou's love of the car as a comeback after Batou chides him for using a revolver instead of a more modern weapon. In ''Solid State Society'', Batou drives a yellow [[Ford GT]] with black racing stripes. When the Major notices the new vehicle, she comments to Batou that \"his tastes had changed.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|author= [[Masamune Shirow|Shirow, Masamume]] & [[Kodansha]]|title=Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Official Log 1|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|year= 2003|isbn= 1-59409-571-X}}\n\n{{Ghost in the Shell}}\n\n[[Category:Ghost in the Shell characters]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga martial artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Kant\u014d]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn invisible]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japan Ground Self-Defense Force personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese police detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional military sergeants]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War IV veterans]]\n[[Category:Male characters in anime and manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional character}}\n{{For|the historical founder of the Shaolin Temple|Batuo}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}\n{{Infobox animanga character\n| name = Batou\n| series = [[Ghost in the Shell]]\n| image = [[File:Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Batou.png|230px]]\n| caption = Batou of Section 9, as portrayed in the anime series\n| first = [[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|''Ghost in the Shell'' (manga)]]\n| creator = [[Masamune Shirow]]\n| voiced by = '''Japanese'''<br>[[Akio \u014ctsuka]] (most media)<br>[[Shinji Ogawa]] ([[Ghost in the Shell (video game)|1997 video game]])<br>Kenichirou Matsuda (''[[Ghost in the Shell: Arise|Arise]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie|The New Movie]]'')<br>'''English'''<br>[[Richard Epcar]] (most media)<br>[[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] (''S.A.C.''

It also means \"eight-headed\" in Mandarin Chinese, which is significant since \"Kusanagi\" was the name of a sword that was taken from Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed mountain dragon in Japanese mythology.\n\n===Relationships===\nOf all Section 9 characters, Batou is closest with the Major professionally and in civilian life. Even on missions, he is known to disregard her rank or authority to \"speak freely\" without permission.\n\n==Appearances in media==\n[[File:Richard Epcar Headshot.jpg|thumb|Richard Epcar is his most iconic English voice actor.]]\n[[File:David Kaye at an autograph session at Botcon 2008 in Cincinnati, Ohio.jpg |thumb|David Kaye voices Batou in the Ocean dubs of GitS.]]\n[[File:Christopher Sabat by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Chris Sabat voices Batou in Arise and The New Movie.]]\n\n===In literature===\nBatou originally appeared in the manga authored by [[Masamune Shirow]], serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''\"Young Magazine Pirate Edition\"'' from 1989 to 1991. Unlike ''S.A.C.'', where in a similar situation Batou spares the life of an ex-[[C.I.A.]] operative, Batou makes good on his threat and personally terminates Koil. His appearance and style of dress vary considerably over the series' run.\n\nIn ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface]]'', Batou makes only a cameo appearance and is hardly recognizable. His head is shaved, and he is dressed in a simple black outfit, though his sense of humor remains intact. During a psychic monitoring of the virtual contact between the main character of the manga and another entity on the net, the psychic states, \"Something of substance, something fruitful has passed between them,\" to which Batou remarks, \"A [[persimmon]] maybe?\" This prompts Chief Aramaki to issue an [[ultimatum]]: \"If you can't be serious you can leave the room.\" He also asks to link with the psychic when she suffers a similar experience to Motoko's contact with the [[Project 2501|Puppet Master]], but his request is denied.\n\n===In films===\n====Animated film====\nThe portrayal of Batou in Mamoru Oshii's films is very different from the depiction in the anime series. ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence|Innocence]]'' depict a Batou who is much more subdued, even to the point of brusqueness. His appearance consists of a white crew-cut (similar to the manga) in the first film, while in the second film he has a short ponytail. Batou is voiced by [[Akio \u014ctsuka]] in Japanese and [[Richard Epcar]] in English in all ''Ghost in the Shell'' media with the exception of ''The Laughing Man'' and ''Individual Eleven'' OVAs where he is voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in English, and ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Arise|Arise]]'', where he is voiced by Kenichirou Matsuda and [[Christopher Sabat]] respectively.\n\nBatou is the central character of ''Innocence'', which centers around his personal life after the disappearance of Major Motoko Kusanagi at the end of the first film. Oshii has commented that the investigation is really secondary to the plot. What is most notable about Batou's emotion in ''Innocence'' is his lack thereof; for the most part he expresses nothing whatsoever. The commentary on the ''Innocence'' DVD touches on the fact that it is Batou's lone companion, a [[Basset Hound]] named Gabriel, that express almost all of the emotion in the entire film. When Batou is required to leave in order to continue his investigation, Gabriel is left in the care of [[Togusa]] and his family. [[Ishikawa (Ghost in the Shell)|Ishikawa]], Batou's senior, chides him for keeping such a high-maintenance dog since he is a single man in a dangerous line of work. The film strongly suggests that Batou harbors romantic feelings for the Major; however, no definitive statement of his feelings is ever made.\n\nAfter shooting his own right arm as a result of brain-hacking, Batou is fitted with a new DNA-matched prosthetic arm with a shotgun hidden inside. He is depicted as being tougher than in the other ''Ghost in the Shell'' incarnations, when he is seen to shoot two live grenades and survive the blast, and withstand a substantial leap down the shaft of the Locus Solus factory ship. In both films, Batou carries a gun dubbed a \"Jericho 942,\" based on the real [[Jericho 941]] made by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]] but chambered for [[.50AE]]. In ''Innocence'', he is also seen with a compact S&W pistol and a small semiautomatic shotgun. The ''Innocence'' prequel novel, \"[[After the Long Goodbye]],\" notes that Batou's S&W pistol is chambered for the [[.40 S&W]] cartridge.\n\n====Live action film====\n[[Pilou Asb\u00e6k]] portrays Batou in the 2017 live action film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/pilou-asbaek-scarlett-johansson-ghost-in-the-shell-1201637556/|title=Pilou Asb\u00e6k to Co-Star with Scarlett Johansson in 'Ghost in the Shell' (Exclusive)|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref> \"The manga is very philosophical, very weird, very spiritual,\" said Asb\u00e6k. \"So I knew that my job with Batou was to bring in a little bit of heart and soul into this futuristic sci-fi world.\" Asb\u00e6k had a hard time understanding his character until he looked back at the ''Ghost in the Shell'' source material. \"I didn\u2019t have any idea what to do with the character and then I looked at the manga again, and I saw two things. I saw he likes beer, and he likes pizza. And if you know me for five minutes, that\u2019s 80 percent of my personality!\" he said.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/01/ghost-in-the-shell-meet-the-section-9-team</ref> The novelization of the film describes Batou as a Scandinavian.\n\n===In television===\n====''Stand Alone Complex'' series====\nIn ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', Batou's personality closely resembles his manga counterpart. He is depicted as an outgoing jokester, but with a quick temper. Unlike the Major, Batou often expresses his anger at injustice and cruelty quite openly. He is sometimes shown to be impatient with Section 9's rookies, such as [[Togusa]]. At times, Batou acts as a voice of reason and displays great concern for the Major, and she in turn admits that she can confide in him. Like Oshii's films, the series suggests romantic tension between the Major and Batou. The film ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society|Solid State Society]]'' more openly addresses this tension, when Batou admits that he'd been covering up the Major's involvement in any cases prior to the Puppeteer case. The movie closes with Batou putting his arm around the Major, although whether or not this is foretelling of any relationship between the two is left ambiguous.\n\nBatou had served in a military [[special forces]] unit and often states that he was a [[Ranger Courses (Japan Ground Self-Defense Force)|Ranger-trained soldier]] with the [[Japanese Ground Self Defense Force]] (JGSDF) before entering Section 9. Despite the fact that his prosthetic body has little to gain from [[exercise]], Batou often lifts weights and [[jogging|jogs]]. He is shown to have an affinity for martial arts and is widely regarded as nearly the best hand-to-hand combatant in Section 9, second only to the Major. He once idolized a famous boxer, Zaitsev, with whom he later spars while on an undercover mission.\n\nBatou is the favorite superior of the [[Tachikoma]]s because he regularly showers them with care and affection; in episode 2.15, it also is apparent that he shares a physical resemblance with their chief programmer. He has even dubbed one unit as his \"personal\" Tachikoma, refusing to operate any other and treating it with [[organic material|organic]] [[oil]], both habits which culminate in problems. Later in the series, the [[Tachikoma]]s' [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] starts to develop rapidly, which is attributed to a mutation in a protein chip caused by Batou's oil. Also, since Batou treats them as individuals as opposed to interchangeable units, they begin to view themselves as such, which contributes to the development of their AI.\n\nBatou is often seen driving a yellow [[Lancia Stratos]] coupe, a rare Italian car from the 1970s. He is shown to be very protective of the car and is hesitant to allow others to drive it. Togusa refers to Batou's love of the car as a comeback after Batou chides him for using a revolver instead of a more modern weapon. In ''Solid State Society'', Batou drives a yellow [[Ford GT]] with black racing stripes. When the Major notices the new vehicle, she comments to Batou that \"his tastes had changed.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|author= [[Masamune Shirow|Shirow, Masamume]] & [[Kodansha]]|title=Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Official Log 1|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|year= 2003|isbn= 1-59409-571-X}}\n\n{{Ghost in the Shell}}\n\n[[Category:Ghost in the Shell characters]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga martial artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Kant\u014d]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn invisible]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japan Ground Self-Defense Force personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese police detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional military sergeants]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War IV veterans]]\n[[Category:Male characters in anime and manga]]\n", "name_user": "PatrynXX", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn literature:edited  - removed the line -  Batou makes only a cameo appearance and is hardly recognizable.

Rajaram pretends to be wealthy in order to marry his sweetheart, Nisha Sharma, much to the chagrin of her dad, who wants her to marry a boxer, Ranjeet Gupta.\n\n<nowiki>The story opens at college, where an impoverished student named Raja (Rajesh Khanna) dreams of making it big and winning his true love Nisha (Sulakshana Pandit). His rival for her affections, Ranjit (Ranjeet) is the class bully and a cheat; but Ranjit's father and Nisha's father are close friends and want their children to marry when they graduate. Raja's roommate and best friend Gopal (Asrani)\u2014also poor\u2014knows the truth of his circumstances, but Raja has fooled everyone else into believing he has a rich father. After Rajaram gets a degree in Arts he returns home and finds out about the debt, he attempts to find work, ends up working as a laborer with Sukhi, but is beaten-up when he is found slacking. Rajaram returns to Bombay, meets with Suleiman, and takes up collecting waste material (Dabha Batli) from households for a fee. When he returns to his village, he discovers that his sister Malti (Farida Jalal) and his aunt (Lalita Pawar) are being harassed by the local moneylender to repay the money lent to them for Raja's education, or he will force Malti to marry him. Raja is overwhelmed at their sacrifices. He returns to Bombay to find work so he can send money home, and is befriended by Sulaiman (Johnny Walker), who buys bottles and boxes for recycling, and teaches Raja the trade. Raja begins earning money and sends some home to his village. He also meets Gopal again, but doesn't contact Nisha since he is too poor to court her. When he does run into her, she is going into a New Year's Eve masquerade party, and thinks that his bottle vendor outfit is his costume. She drags him in with her, where he is tormented again by Ranjit, and further realizes the gulf between himself and Nisha. He slips out and returns home, sad and heartbroken. One day, he comes across a sack of bottles, throws it against the door; one broken bottle rolls outside where a big puff of pink smoke materializes from it. Out pops a 20000 year old Genie with magical powers. He takes his sack of bottles and as the smoke clears, a genie (Shammi Kapoor) appears. The genie was imprisoned in the bottle 20,000 years ago by an uncle fed up with his naughtiness. He has sworn an oath to serve his rescuer for a full year, and is going to fulfill this oath whether Raja likes it or not. Chaos ensues! No matter how hard he tries, the genie causes problems for poor Raja. Rajaram does not want anything to do with this Genie, who insists on helping him for one year, regardless. With his help, Rajaram and Suleiman improve their lifestyle, albeit with a lot of problems, and also improve Rajaram's chances of marrying Nisha. Sulaiman tells the genie about Nisha, and he tries to help bring them together, but Nisha's father is determined to marry her to Ranjit. Raja's aunt sends Malti to him from the village to get her out of the moneylender's way. He marries her off to Gopal. Meanwhile, Nisha and her father fight about Ranjit. Nisha wants to marry Raja no matter how poor he is. When Ranjit and some of his friends try to run down Raja (literally), he is rescued by the genie in a flying car. Pleased with himself, the genie gives Raja a ring to protect him from Ranjit. The ring, when twisted on the finger, calls up a demon from the underworld who spouts fire and chants \"Zum Zum Bah!\" I find him much more funny than scary{{</nowiki>[[Template:Citation needed|Citation needed]]<nowiki>}}. Raja can't handle one genie, let alone two, and he throws the ring away. Ranjit, watching, retrieves it after they go. Ranjit owes money to a bunch of goondas, who come to get their money. His plan is to marry Nisha and then repay them. He enlists the help of the demon by asking him to change him to look like Raja, and vice versa. Nisha isn't fooled, since Ranjit hasn't changed his voice or his manners. Raja and the genie rescue her when he assaults her. They celebrate by flying with the genie over Bombay. He transports them to a magical place where they sing another pretty song. I'm reminded of Kashmir Ki Kali with a genie thrown in{{</nowiki>[[Template:Citation needed|Citation needed]]<nowiki>}}. By now, Nisha's father has discovered what a scoundrel Ranjit is, and told Nisha that she can marry Raja. So Ranjit will have to resort to drastic measures! He and the demon go to Nisha's house and kidnap her and her father. They are taken away to the underworld. The genie and Raja follow, although the genie's power doesn't work in the underworld.
