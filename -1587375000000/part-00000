As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden's public music-education program, and once said he had \"public music education to thank for everything\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moser |first=Whet |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/swedish-pop-mafia-music-world-influence-73966 |title=Swedish Pop Mafia \u2013 Pacific Standard: The Science of Society |publisher=Psmag.com |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Other alumni of the program include [[Andreas Carlsson]], [[Rami Yacoub]], and [[Anders Bagge]].\n\nAs a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a [[Glam metal|glam-style]] metal band called [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It's Alive was formed by ex-LAZY members [[Per Aldeheim]] and Kim Bj\u00f6rkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname \"Martin White\". In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in [[Cyprus]]. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of [[Megarock Records]] offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the ''[[Metal Forces]]'' magazine.\n\nThe decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer [[Denniz PoP]]'s label [[Cheiron Studios|Cheiron Records]], a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] affiliate. After recording their second album ''[[Earthquake Visions]]'', they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]]. ''Earthquake Visions'' eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Max Martin and eventually became Martin's mentor.\n\n===Working with Cheiron and Denniz PoP===\n\"I didn't even know what a producer did, I spent two years\u2013day and night\u2013in that studio trying to learn what the hell was going on\". \u2013 Max Martin, 19 March 2001.<ref>Chu, Jeff (19 March 2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064227/http://maxmartinfansite.com/Time-Top%20of%20the%20Pops.htm \"Top of the Pops\"]. ''Time'', vol. 157 no. 11</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Martin was hired by [[Cheiron Studios]] and spent some time learning the basics, before the first production collaboration between PoP and Martin: the [[Rednex]] song \"[[Wish You Were Here (Rednex Song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" in 1994. They both worked on [[Ace of Base]]'s second album, ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]'' (1995), shortly thereafter, as well as on albums by [[3T]], [[Army of Lovers]] and [[Leila K]]. To date, ''The Bridge'' has sold more than six million copies worldwide, including one million in the United States.<ref name=\"Ace of Base's USA Certifications\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold & Platinum Search Results: Ace of Base|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=1 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151657/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> When Martin eventually left his band [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in late 1995, he was replaced by [[Anders Hansson (songwriter)|Anders Hansson]].\n\nIn 1995, the Cheiron Studios was hired by [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] to work on Backstreet Boys' self-titled debut album ''[[Backstreet Boys (1996 album)|Backstreet Boys]]'' (1996). [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] became the main working partner since the success in 1995. Martin took part in the production of \"[[Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)]]\" (1996), co-written with [[Herbie Crichlow]], a single which quickly went [[Platinum single|platinum]] and climbed to No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the singles \"[[As Long as You Love Me (Backstreet Boys song)|As Long As You Love Me]]\" (1997) and \"[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]\" (1997). The album was not released in the U.S. until 1997, but was released overseas and caught on all across Europe, eventually selling around 8 million copies worldwide. This led to the Backstreet Boys being relaunched in their home country later on, this time more successfully.<ref>As of late May 2016, Martin was not known to have possessed any knowledge of the illegal activities of [[Lou Pearlman]], who then managed the Backstreet Boys.</ref> Later that year, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Robyn]]'s hits \"[[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|Show Me Love]]\" and \"[[Do You Know (What It Takes)]]\" which ended up on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top 10.<ref name=Ostroff/>\n\nIn 1998, [[Cheiron Productions]] worked on albums by [[Five (band)|Five]] and [[Jessica Folcker]]. Jessica Folcker had first been hired as a backing singer for tracks with Ace of Base and [[Dr. Alban]], and her debut album ''Jessica'' became an instant hit with singles like \"Tell Me What You Like\" and \"How Will I Know Who You Are\" which both sold [[Platinum record|platinum]]. After Denniz PoP died of cancer that same summer, Martin took over as director of Cheiron Studios. He soon started working with writer/producer [[Rami Yacoub]], who continued to be his partner for many years. Martin also wrote two songs with [[Bryan Adams]] during this time, \"Cloud Number Nine\" and \"Before The Night Is Over\".\n\n===Backstreet Boys===\nMartin wrote, co-wrote, and co-produced 7 out of the 12 songs on the Backstreet Boys' third album ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'' (1999), including all the singles. \"[[I Want It That Way]]\", a hit song Martin co-wrote with [[Andreas Carlsson]] and co-produced with [[Kristian Lundin]], became the group's biggest single to date and it is still popular today. (\"I Want It That Way\" was voted No. 10 in the [[MTV]]/[[Rolling Stone]] list of the \"100 Greatest Pop Songs\".<ref name=\"mtvrollinstones100best\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2000/nov/19/mtv_rolling_stone/\n |title        = MTV, Rolling Stone list top 100 pop songs\n |accessdate   = 20 February 2007\n |archive-url  = https://www.webcitation.org/66fZB4WXF?url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2000/nov/19/mtv_rolling_stone/\n |archive-date = 4 April 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>)\nA VH1 special, 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s, ranked the song at number 3, making it the highest ranked boy-band single and pop song. ''Millennium'' sold over 1.1 million units in its first week in the United States, setting a record for most albums sold in its debut week (that record was later beaten by [[NSYNC|NSYNC's]] 2000 album ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]''), and was the best-selling album in the world. When working on her own solo album, to be released in 2001 on [[Stockholm Records]], [[Lisa Miskovsky]] wrote the lyrics for the Backstreet Boys' hit single \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" with Max Martin and Rami. The song, originally written for Miskovsky's own album, was passed on to the Backstreet Boys by Max Martin when Miskovsky decided that it did not fit her style. The song became the first single off the group's third album ''[[Black & Blue (Backstreet Boys album)|Black & Blue]]'' (2000). In the first week of release, \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" immediately jumped into the Top Five in Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany and another 15 countries. ''Black & Blue'', containing several songs produced and written by Martin, sold 1.6 million units in its first week in America. Martin again received [[ASCAP]]'s award \"Songwriter of the Year\" both in 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title=Songwriters Behind 'NSYNC, Backstreet Boys Hits Win Big At ASCAP Pop Awards | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443980/20010523/backstreet_boys.jhtml |date=23 May 2001 | author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric | publisher=MTV | accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> In April 2013 the Backstreet Boys member [[Brian Littrell]] invited Martin to collaborate on their single \"[[In A World Like This]]\". The single peaked at ''No.6'' in the ''[[Oricon Singles Chart|Oricon]]'' chart and performed well in the rest of the world. Martin collaborated on the ''Never Gone'' songs \"Climbing the Walls\", \"[[Just Want You to Know]]\", \"Siberia\" and \"[[I Still...]]\". Martin wanted the album to be more of a contemporary, alternative pop album with a little R&B. The resulting album had a more organic music style with more live instruments, and was a departure from the Backstreet Boys' earlier work.\n\n===Westlife===\nMartin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub wrote [[Westlife]]'s song \"I Need You\" for the first Westlife album ''[[Westlife (album)|Westlife]]'' (1999). Martin, Nick Jarl, Steve Mac, and Patric Jonsson wrote Westlife's song \"[[You Make Me Feel (Westlife song)|You Make Me Feel]]\" for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000). Max Martin, [[Rami Yacoub]], and Andreas Carlsson also wrote one of Westlife's hits, \"[[When You're Looking Like That]]\", for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000).\n\n===Britney Spears===\nIn 1998, Martin wrote and co-produced [[Britney Spears|Spears]]' hit \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" for her debut album of the [[...Baby One More Time (album)|same title]].<ref>Fully titled \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\", the selection was so titled because Martin, in one of his by-then rare failures in command of English, had mistaken \"hit\" for American slang that supposedly meant \"ring\" or \"call\", both references to [[telephone]] conversations.</ref> (The single had originally been offered to both the [[Backstreet Boys]], who had turned it down, and [[TLC (music)|TLC]], who had passed because they were \"taking time off\".)<ref name=\"tlcindependent\">{{cite news| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023| title = Rock&Pop: Story of the song '...Baby One More Time'| accessdate = 19 May 2007| publisher = Findarticles.com|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021053000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 October 2007}}</ref> The single remained Spears's best-selling single to date, and on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the '90s\", it was ranked at number 7. That same year, Martin also co-wrote and co-produced the third single \"[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]\". By 1999, the album ''...Baby One More Time'' had sold over 15 million copies in the U.S., certifying [[Music recording sales certification|Diamond Status]]. Also, within a year of its release, ''...Baby One More Time'' had become the best-selling [[Compact disc|LP]] by a teenager in history, selling over 30 million copies. Martin was the first non-American citizen ever to win ASCAP's prestigious award \"Songwriter of the Year\" in 1999, an award he also won in 2000 and 2001.\n\nMartin worked on Spears's first three studio albums\u20141999's ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]],'' mentioned above, 2000's ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]],'' and 2001's ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]''\u2014all three of which were made in the style of [[Teen pop|teen-oriented pop]]. In this period he co-wrote and co-produced the singles \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" (2000), \"[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]\" (2000), \"[[Stronger (Britney Spears song)|Stronger]]\" (2000), \"[[Overprotected]]\" (2001), and \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\" (2002). However, when Spears recorded her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), she decided to move away from that genre. The duo ended up parting ways, and Martin had no input on that album nor on her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007). At the request of Spears, Martin produced and wrote for Spears' sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote and produced the provocatively titled, \"If U Seek Amy\", which was chosen by fans to be the third single of the album. Different from Martin's previous tracks for Spears, \"[[If U Seek Amy]]\" is an electro-pop dance song, in which even the lyrics shows a different, more dance-oriented direction from Spears's and Martin's previous work.\n\nIn July 2009, Spears stated, on her Twitter account, that she was in the recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden with Martin.<ref>[http://www.britneyspears.com/2009/07/a-tweet-from-britney-15.phpp A Tweet from Britney]{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. britneyspears.com (12 July 2009)</ref> Later, on 29 September 2009, it was announced that Martin had worked with Spears on her upcoming compilation album. Martin produced \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", the song debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nMartin was the executive producer (along with [[Dr. Luke]]) of Spears's seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011). During a 2011 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' Spears stated that Martin \"gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don't want musically. His melodies are incredible and he is always coming up with weird sounds, which I love\". She added: \"There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Britney Spears On Her New Album, Her Favorite Music and Working With will.i.am|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-on-her-new-album-her-favorite-music-and-working-with-will-i-am-20110317|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011|magazine=RollingStone.com}}</ref> In January 2011, \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\" was released as the lead single of Spears's new album; the song later debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming Spears's second single to debut at No. 1 and her fourth overall. Martin also co-produced the album's second single, \"[[Till the World Ends]]\", which peaked at No. 3. As well as co-producing \"Hold It Against Me\" and \"Till the World Ends\", Martin co-produced the songs \"Inside Out\", \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", \"Seal It with a Kiss\", \"[[Criminal (Britney Spears song)|Criminal]]\", and \"Up n' Down\". In May 2011, it was announced that \"I Wanna Go\" would serve as the third single from ''Femme Fatale.''<ref name=confirm>{{cite web|url=http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |title=Britney Confirms 'I Wanna Go' As Next Single |publisher=Britney.com |author=BRITannica |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517204859/http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |archivedate=17 May 2011 }}</ref> On 5 August 2011, Spears launched a poll on her [[Facebook]] page asking fans whether her next single should be \"Criminal\", \"[[Inside Out (Britney Spears song)|Inside Out]]\" or \"[[(Drop Dead) Beautiful]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1668729/will-drop-dead-beautiful-be-britney-spears-next-single.jhtml|title=Will '(Drop Dead) Beautiful' Be Britney Spears' Next Single?|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=MTV. MTV Networks}}</ref> After the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]], she revealed to MTV News that \"Criminal\" was chosen as the fourth single, marking the first time Martin had produced four singles of a Spears album; he had produced the first three singles from ''Oops!... I Did It Again.''\n\nMartin did not contribute to Spears's eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]''.\n\n===C\u00e9line Dion===\nIn late 1999 [[C\u00e9line Dion]] released \"[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]\", a song co-written by Max Martin to promote her [[greatest hits]] album ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]].'' The song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada, and reaching top 10 all over the world. Since the song was released in November 1999, it has cycled 500,000 times on almost 1400 radio stations across Canada and the U.S.\nIn 2003 Martin co-wrote and produced three songs for Dion's album ''[[One Heart]].'' One of them, called \"[[Faith (Celine Dion song)|Faith]]\", was released in 2003 as a promotional single in Canada and reached number 4 on the Quebec Airplay Chart and number 37 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\n===Producer role for Cheiron===\nThe traditional division of work in the record industry often has the artist or songwriter writing the songs and then hiring a producer to help shape the sound. But at Cheiron, it was the other way around; the producers wrote the songs, played the instruments, and engineered and mixed the recordings, and the artist was only brought in near the end of the process to do the vocals. For example, on Britney Spears's second album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!\u2026 I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Cheiron had already written seven songs and had proceeded to record the layers of music before Britney even arrived at the studios in early November 1999. It took her only one week to do the vocals. Martin and his team worked more like a band that alternated singers. Martin explained his working method:\n{{cquote|I want to be part of every note, every single moment going on in the studio. I want nothing forgotten, I want nothing missed. I'm a perfectionist. The producer should decide what kind of music is being made, what it's going to sound like\u2013all of it, the why, when and how.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |title=Practicing the Fine Art of Production |publisher=maxmartinfansite.com |accessdate=4 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064309/http://maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |archivedate=2 March 2016 }}</ref> \u2013 LA Times, 6/05/00}}\n\n===Startup of Maratone===\nDespite the success, [[Cheiron Studios]] was closed down in 2000. The reason behind the decision to close it down was, according to the press release on their homepage, that the heart and soul of the studio had been lost with the death of [[Denniz PoP]]. Another reason for closing the studio down was for the people at Cheiron Studios to be able to do more experimental music work without the weight of the now famous name Cheiron upon their shoulders.\n\nMax Martin and Tom Talomaa started a new production company together named [[Maratone]] in January 2001 and moved into the famous [[Cosmos Studios]] that had housed the production team Kai Erixon and [[Kent (Gillstr\u00f6m) Isaacs]] whom had been very successful at the Swedish pop/hiphop-arena with numerous gold/platinum-selling artists. Also, [[David Kreuger]] and [[Per Magnusson]] started A Side Productions and [[Kristian Lundin]] started the production company [[The Location]] and the publishing company [[Location Songs]] together with Jake Schulze and [[Andreas Carlsson]] (both also members of Cheiron's production team) at the same location as Cheiron Studios. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for [[Britney Spears]]'s third album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001). The Maratone production crew initially consisted of producers/songwriters Max Martin, Rami, Alexandra, [[Arn\u00fe\u00f3r Birgisson|Arnthor]] and young sensation [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], but Rami, Alexandra and Arnthor have all moved on since then. Following the work with [[Celine Dion]] on the album ''[[One Heart]]'' in 2003, few new hits appeared from Maratone until 2005. More recently 2009 has seen a string of hits from the studio including the hits \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" from Kelly Clarkson and \"3\" from Britney Spears.\n\n===Kelly Clarkson===\nIn 2004, former [[American Idol]] winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] traveled to Sweden to collaborate with Martin and [[Luke Gottwald|Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald]] on songs for her second studio album ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]].'' They decided to create songs that were rockier than had been anticipated by the fans, as can be heard on the hit singles \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\" (2004) and \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\" (2005). \"Since U Been Gone\" became a huge hit, and it remained one of the biggest hits of Clarkson's career, and one of the biggest hits of 2005. The next single, \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 while the single \"Since U Been Gone\" was still on the charts. In 2009, he also co-wrote Clarkson's single \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\", which established the record for the highest ''Billboard'' Hot 100 jump to No. 1, jumping from No. 97 in its second week on the chart.\n\n===Marion Raven===\nIn 2005, Martin collaborated with the Norwegian singer [[Marion Raven]] for the release of her debut album, titled ''[[Here I Am (Marion Raven album)|Here I Am]],'' on what might be his first mainstream Rock work, writing the song \"[[Break You]]\" and co-writing with Raven many songs, including \"[[End of Me (Marion Raven song)|End of Me]]\", \"Here I Am\", \"Little By Little\", \"In Spite of Me\", and \"Six Feet Under\". \"End of Me\" and \"Break You\" were big hits in [[Asia]] and Norway. In 2007 \"Break You\" was included again in Raven's North American and European debut album called ''[[Set Me Free (Marion Raven album)|Set Me Free]].'' The American singer Megan McCauley also recorded \"Break You\" in 2006, but the song was not included on any of McCauley's albums.\n\n===The Veronicas===\nIn 2005, Max Martin wrote the first single-song for [[pop punk]] duo [[The Veronicas]], \"[[4ever (The Veronicas song)|4ever]]\", with Lukasz \"[[Dr. Luke]]\" Gottwald for their debut studio album ''[[The Secret Life Of... (album)|The Secret Life Of...]]'' (2005). Also he wrote \"[[Everything I'm Not]]\", the second single-song of The Veronicas, the same year, again with Gottwald, [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], [[Jessica Origliasso]] and [[Lisa Origliasso]] for the same album ''The Secret Life Of....''\n\n===Pink===\nMartin co-wrote and produced three songs on [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s platinum-selling fourth album ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'', including two of its most successful singles, \"[[U + Ur Hand]]\" (2006) and \"[[Who Knew]]\" (2006). \"[['Cuz I Can (Pink song)|Cuz I Can]]\" (2007) was released as the seventh single in the Australian market. Martin also collaborated with Pink for her fifth studio album, ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote the first smash hit single, \"[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]\" (2008), plus the tracks \"[[Please Don't Leave Me]]\" (2009), \"[[I Don't Believe You]]\" (2009), \"It's All Your Fault\" and \"Boring\". Martin and Pink wrote \"[[Whataya Want From Me]]\" during sessions for ''Funhouse'', but ultimately the song was recorded and released as a single by [[Adam Lambert]] to success. Pink's version would appear on her next effort, ''[[Greatest Hits... So Far!!! (Pink album)|Greatest Hits... So Far!!!]]'' (2010). Martin also co-wrote the hits \"[[Raise Your Glass]]\" and \"[[Fuckin' Perfect]]\" for the collection. For her sixth studio album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' (2012), he co-wrote the song \"Slut Like You\". Martin again collaborated with Pink with \"[[Just like Fire]]\" (2016) from the ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' movie soundtrack. For her seventh studio album, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017), he co-wrote \"[[Revenge (Pink song)|Revenge]]\", \"[[Whatever You Want (Pink song)|Whatever You Want]]\", \"For Now\", and \"Secrets\". In 2019 for her eighth studio album, ''[[Hurts 2B Human]]'' (2019), he co-wrote \"(Hey Why) Miss You Sometime\".\n\n===Usher===\nIn 2010, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Usher (singer)|Usher]]'s song \"[[DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love]]\" that went number-one on the US [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts and top-ten on the main Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/430708/Usher/chart?f=378|title=Usher \u2013 Chart history|website=www.billboard.com|access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref> Working together again, Martin co-wrote and co-produced on Usher's seventh studio album \"[[Looking 4 Myself]]\" in 2012 making the [[dance-pop]] song \"[[Scream (Usher song)|Scream]]\" that went number-one on the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart and number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Alongside the aforementioned trio and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]], Max Martin co-wrote the track and the song lived up to its hoped-for success becoming her major breakthrough into the US market, charting at number 6, whilst also topping the charts in the United Kingdom for two weeks.

As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden's public music-education program, and once said he had \"public music education to thank for everything\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moser |first=Whet |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/swedish-pop-mafia-music-world-influence-73966 |title=Swedish Pop Mafia \u2013 Pacific Standard: The Science of Society |publisher=Psmag.com |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Other alumni of the program include [[Andreas Carlsson]], [[Rami Yacoub]], and [[Anders Bagge]].\n\nAs a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a [[Glam metal|glam-style]] metal band called [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It's Alive was formed by ex-LAZY members [[Per Aldeheim]] and Kim Bj\u00f6rkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname \"Martin White\". In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in [[Cyprus]]. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of [[Megarock Records]] offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the ''[[Metal Forces]]'' magazine.\n\nThe decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer [[Denniz PoP]]'s label [[Cheiron Studios|Cheiron Records]], a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] affiliate. After recording their second album ''[[Earthquake Visions]]'', they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]]. ''Earthquake Visions'' eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Max Martin and eventually became Martin's mentor.\n\n===Working with Cheiron and Denniz PoP===\n\"I didn't even know what a producer did, I spent two years\u2013day and night\u2013in that studio trying to learn what the hell was going on\". \u2013 Max Martin, 19 March 2001.<ref>Chu, Jeff (19 March 2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064227/http://maxmartinfansite.com/Time-Top%20of%20the%20Pops.htm \"Top of the Pops\"]. ''Time'', vol. 157 no. 11</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Martin was hired by [[Cheiron Studios]] and spent some time learning the basics, before the first production collaboration between PoP and Martin: the [[Rednex]] song \"[[Wish You Were Here (Rednex Song)|Wish You Were Here]]\" in 1994. They both worked on [[Ace of Base]]'s second album, ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]'' (1995), shortly thereafter, as well as on albums by [[3T]], [[Army of Lovers]] and [[Leila K]]. To date, ''The Bridge'' has sold more than six million copies worldwide, including one million in the United States.<ref name=\"Ace of Base's USA Certifications\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold & Platinum Search Results: Ace of Base|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=1 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151657/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> When Martin eventually left his band [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in late 1995, he was replaced by [[Anders Hansson (songwriter)|Anders Hansson]].\n\nIn 1995, the Cheiron Studios was hired by [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] to work on Backstreet Boys' self-titled debut album ''[[Backstreet Boys (1996 album)|Backstreet Boys]]'' (1996). [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] became the main working partner since the success in 1995. Martin took part in the production of \"[[Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)]]\" (1996), co-written with [[Herbie Crichlow]], a single which quickly went [[Platinum single|platinum]] and climbed to No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the singles \"[[As Long as You Love Me (Backstreet Boys song)|As Long As You Love Me]]\" (1997) and \"[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]\" (1997). The album was not released in the U.S. until 1997, but was released overseas and caught on all across Europe, eventually selling around 8 million copies worldwide. This led to the Backstreet Boys being relaunched in their home country later on, this time more successfully.<ref>As of late May 2016, Martin was not known to have possessed any knowledge of the illegal activities of [[Lou Pearlman]], who then managed the Backstreet Boys.</ref> Later that year, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Robyn]]'s hits \"[[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|Show Me Love]]\" and \"[[Do You Know (What It Takes)]]\" which ended up on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top 10.<ref name=Ostroff/>\n\nIn 1998, [[Cheiron Productions]] worked on albums by [[Five (band)|Five]] and [[Jessica Folcker]]. Jessica Folcker had first been hired as a backing singer for tracks with Ace of Base and [[Dr. Alban]], and her debut album ''Jessica'' became an instant hit with singles like \"Tell Me What You Like\" and \"How Will I Know Who You Are\" which both sold [[Platinum record|platinum]]. After Denniz PoP died of cancer that same summer, Martin took over as director of Cheiron Studios. He soon started working with writer/producer [[Rami Yacoub]], who continued to be his partner for many years. Martin also wrote two songs with [[Bryan Adams]] during this time, \"Cloud Number Nine\" and \"Before The Night Is Over\".\n\n===Backstreet Boys===\nMartin wrote, co-wrote, and co-produced 7 out of the 12 songs on the Backstreet Boys' third album ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'' (1999), including all the singles. \"[[I Want It That Way]]\", a hit song Martin co-wrote with [[Andreas Carlsson]] and co-produced with [[Kristian Lundin]], became the group's biggest single to date and it is still popular today.

''Millennium'' sold over 1.1 million units in its first week in the United States, setting a record for most albums sold in its debut week (that record was later beaten by [[NSYNC|NSYNC's]] 2000 album ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]''), and was the best-selling album in the world. When working on her own solo album, to be released in 2001 on [[Stockholm Records]], [[Lisa Miskovsky]] wrote the lyrics for the Backstreet Boys' hit single \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" with Max Martin and Rami. The song, originally written for Miskovsky's own album, was passed on to the Backstreet Boys by Max Martin when Miskovsky decided that it did not fit her style. The song became the first single off the group's third album ''[[Black & Blue (Backstreet Boys album)|Black & Blue]]'' (2000). In the first week of release, \"[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]\" immediately jumped into the Top Five in Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany and another 15 countries. ''Black & Blue'', containing several songs produced and written by Martin, sold 1.6 million units in its first week in America. Martin again received [[ASCAP]]'s award \"Songwriter of the Year\" both in 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title=Songwriters Behind 'NSYNC, Backstreet Boys Hits Win Big At ASCAP Pop Awards | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443980/20010523/backstreet_boys.jhtml |date=23 May 2001 | author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric | publisher=MTV | accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> In April 2013 the Backstreet Boys member [[Brian Littrell]] invited Martin to collaborate on their single \"[[In A World Like This]]\". The single peaked at ''No.6'' in the ''[[Oricon Singles Chart|Oricon]]'' chart and performed well in the rest of the world. Martin collaborated on the ''Never Gone'' songs \"Climbing the Walls\", \"[[Just Want You to Know]]\", \"Siberia\" and \"[[I Still...]]\". Martin wanted the album to be more of a contemporary, alternative pop album with a little R&B. The resulting album had a more organic music style with more live instruments, and was a departure from the Backstreet Boys' earlier work.\n\n===Westlife===\nMartin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub wrote [[Westlife]]'s song \"I Need You\" for the first Westlife album ''[[Westlife (album)|Westlife]]'' (1999). Martin, Nick Jarl, Steve Mac, and Patric Jonsson wrote Westlife's song \"[[You Make Me Feel (Westlife song)|You Make Me Feel]]\" for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000). Max Martin, [[Rami Yacoub]], and Andreas Carlsson also wrote one of Westlife's hits, \"[[When You're Looking Like That]]\", for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000).\n\n===Britney Spears===\nIn 1998, Martin wrote and co-produced [[Britney Spears|Spears]]' hit \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" for her debut album of the [[...Baby One More Time (album)|same title]].<ref>Fully titled \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\", the selection was so titled because Martin, in one of his by-then rare failures in command of English, had mistaken \"hit\" for American slang that supposedly meant \"ring\" or \"call\", both references to [[telephone]] conversations.</ref> (The single had originally been offered to both the [[Backstreet Boys]], who had turned it down, and [[TLC (music)|TLC]], who had passed because they were \"taking time off\".)<ref name=\"tlcindependent\">{{cite news| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023| title = Rock&Pop: Story of the song '...Baby One More Time'| accessdate = 19 May 2007| publisher = Findarticles.com|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021053000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 October 2007}}</ref> The single remained Spears's best-selling single to date, and on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the '90s\", it was ranked at number 7. That same year, Martin also co-wrote and co-produced the third single \"[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]\". By 1999, the album ''...Baby One More Time'' had sold over 15 million copies in the U.S., certifying [[Music recording sales certification|Diamond Status]]. Also, within a year of its release, ''...Baby One More Time'' had become the best-selling [[Compact disc|LP]] by a teenager in history, selling over 30 million copies. Martin was the first non-American citizen ever to win ASCAP's prestigious award \"Songwriter of the Year\" in 1999, an award he also won in 2000 and 2001.\n\nMartin worked on Spears's first three studio albums\u20141999's ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]],'' mentioned above, 2000's ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]],'' and 2001's ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]''\u2014all three of which were made in the style of [[Teen pop|teen-oriented pop]]. In this period he co-wrote and co-produced the singles \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" (2000), \"[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]\" (2000), \"[[Stronger (Britney Spears song)|Stronger]]\" (2000), \"[[Overprotected]]\" (2001), and \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\" (2002). However, when Spears recorded her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), she decided to move away from that genre. The duo ended up parting ways, and Martin had no input on that album nor on her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007). At the request of Spears, Martin produced and wrote for Spears' sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote and produced the provocatively titled, \"If U Seek Amy\", which was chosen by fans to be the third single of the album. Different from Martin's previous tracks for Spears, \"[[If U Seek Amy]]\" is an electro-pop dance song, in which even the lyrics shows a different, more dance-oriented direction from Spears's and Martin's previous work.\n\nIn July 2009, Spears stated, on her Twitter account, that she was in the recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden with Martin.<ref>[http://www.britneyspears.com/2009/07/a-tweet-from-britney-15.phpp A Tweet from Britney]{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. britneyspears.com (12 July 2009)</ref> Later, on 29 September 2009, it was announced that Martin had worked with Spears on her upcoming compilation album. Martin produced \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", the song debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nMartin was the executive producer (along with [[Dr. Luke]]) of Spears's seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011). During a 2011 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' Spears stated that Martin \"gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don't want musically. His melodies are incredible and he is always coming up with weird sounds, which I love\". She added: \"There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Britney Spears On Her New Album, Her Favorite Music and Working With will.i.am|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-on-her-new-album-her-favorite-music-and-working-with-will-i-am-20110317|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011|magazine=RollingStone.com}}</ref> In January 2011, \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\" was released as the lead single of Spears's new album; the song later debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming Spears's second single to debut at No. 1 and her fourth overall. Martin also co-produced the album's second single, \"[[Till the World Ends]]\", which peaked at No. 3. As well as co-producing \"Hold It Against Me\" and \"Till the World Ends\", Martin co-produced the songs \"Inside Out\", \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", \"Seal It with a Kiss\", \"[[Criminal (Britney Spears song)|Criminal]]\", and \"Up n' Down\". In May 2011, it was announced that \"I Wanna Go\" would serve as the third single from ''Femme Fatale.''<ref name=confirm>{{cite web|url=http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |title=Britney Confirms 'I Wanna Go' As Next Single |publisher=Britney.com |author=BRITannica |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517204859/http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |archivedate=17 May 2011 }}</ref> On 5 August 2011, Spears launched a poll on her [[Facebook]] page asking fans whether her next single should be \"Criminal\", \"[[Inside Out (Britney Spears song)|Inside Out]]\" or \"[[(Drop Dead) Beautiful]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1668729/will-drop-dead-beautiful-be-britney-spears-next-single.jhtml|title=Will '(Drop Dead) Beautiful' Be Britney Spears' Next Single?|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=MTV. MTV Networks}}</ref> After the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]], she revealed to MTV News that \"Criminal\" was chosen as the fourth single, marking the first time Martin had produced four singles of a Spears album; he had produced the first three singles from ''Oops!... I Did It Again.''\n\nMartin did not contribute to Spears's eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]''.\n\n===C\u00e9line Dion===\nIn late 1999 [[C\u00e9line Dion]] released \"[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]\", a song co-written by Max Martin to promote her [[greatest hits]] album ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]].'' The song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada, and reaching top 10 all over the world. Since the song was released in November 1999, it has cycled 500,000 times on almost 1400 radio stations across Canada and the U.S.\nIn 2003 Martin co-wrote and produced three songs for Dion's album ''[[One Heart]].'' One of them, called \"[[Faith (Celine Dion song)|Faith]]\", was released in 2003 as a promotional single in Canada and reached number 4 on the Quebec Airplay Chart and number 37 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\n===Producer role for Cheiron===\nThe traditional division of work in the record industry often has the artist or songwriter writing the songs and then hiring a producer to help shape the sound. But at Cheiron, it was the other way around; the producers wrote the songs, played the instruments, and engineered and mixed the recordings, and the artist was only brought in near the end of the process to do the vocals. For example, on Britney Spears's second album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!\u2026 I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Cheiron had already written seven songs and had proceeded to record the layers of music before Britney even arrived at the studios in early November 1999. It took her only one week to do the vocals. Martin and his team worked more like a band that alternated singers. Martin explained his working method:\n{{cquote|I want to be part of every note, every single moment going on in the studio. I want nothing forgotten, I want nothing missed. I'm a perfectionist. The producer should decide what kind of music is being made, what it's going to sound like\u2013all of it, the why, when and how.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |title=Practicing the Fine Art of Production |publisher=maxmartinfansite.com |accessdate=4 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064309/http://maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |archivedate=2 March 2016 }}</ref> \u2013 LA Times, 6/05/00}}\n\n===Startup of Maratone===\nDespite the success, [[Cheiron Studios]] was closed down in 2000. The reason behind the decision to close it down was, according to the press release on their homepage, that the heart and soul of the studio had been lost with the death of [[Denniz PoP]]. Another reason for closing the studio down was for the people at Cheiron Studios to be able to do more experimental music work without the weight of the now famous name Cheiron upon their shoulders.\n\nMax Martin and Tom Talomaa started a new production company together named [[Maratone]] in January 2001 and moved into the famous [[Cosmos Studios]] that had housed the production team Kai Erixon and [[Kent (Gillstr\u00f6m) Isaacs]] whom had been very successful at the Swedish pop/hiphop-arena with numerous gold/platinum-selling artists. Also, [[David Kreuger]] and [[Per Magnusson]] started A Side Productions and [[Kristian Lundin]] started the production company [[The Location]] and the publishing company [[Location Songs]] together with Jake Schulze and [[Andreas Carlsson]] (both also members of Cheiron's production team) at the same location as Cheiron Studios. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for [[Britney Spears]]'s third album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001). The Maratone production crew initially consisted of producers/songwriters Max Martin, Rami, Alexandra, [[Arn\u00fe\u00f3r Birgisson|Arnthor]] and young sensation [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], but Rami, Alexandra and Arnthor have all moved on since then. Following the work with [[Celine Dion]] on the album ''[[One Heart]]'' in 2003, few new hits appeared from Maratone until 2005. More recently 2009 has seen a string of hits from the studio including the hits \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" from Kelly Clarkson and \"3\" from Britney Spears.\n\n===Kelly Clarkson===\nIn 2004, former [[American Idol]] winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] traveled to Sweden to collaborate with Martin and [[Luke Gottwald|Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald]] on songs for her second studio album ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]].'' They decided to create songs that were rockier than had been anticipated by the fans, as can be heard on the hit singles \"[[Since U Been Gone]]\" (2004) and \"[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]\" (2005). \"Since U Been Gone\" became a huge hit, and it remained one of the biggest hits of Clarkson's career, and one of the biggest hits of 2005. The next single, \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 while the single \"Since U Been Gone\" was still on the charts. In 2009, he also co-wrote Clarkson's single \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\", which established the record for the highest ''Billboard'' Hot 100 jump to No. 1, jumping from No. 97 in its second week on the chart.\n\n===Marion Raven===\nIn 2005, Martin collaborated with the Norwegian singer [[Marion Raven]] for the release of her debut album, titled ''[[Here I Am (Marion Raven album)|Here I Am]],'' on what might be his first mainstream Rock work, writing the song \"[[Break You]]\" and co-writing with Raven many songs, including \"[[End of Me (Marion Raven song)|End of Me]]\", \"Here I Am\", \"Little By Little\", \"In Spite of Me\", and \"Six Feet Under\". \"End of Me\" and \"Break You\" were big hits in [[Asia]] and Norway. In 2007 \"Break You\" was included again in Raven's North American and European debut album called ''[[Set Me Free (Marion Raven album)|Set Me Free]].'' The American singer Megan McCauley also recorded \"Break You\" in 2006, but the song was not included on any of McCauley's albums.\n\n===The Veronicas===\nIn 2005, Max Martin wrote the first single-song for [[pop punk]] duo [[The Veronicas]], \"[[4ever (The Veronicas song)|4ever]]\", with Lukasz \"[[Dr. Luke]]\" Gottwald for their debut studio album ''[[The Secret Life Of... (album)|The Secret Life Of...]]'' (2005). Also he wrote \"[[Everything I'm Not]]\", the second single-song of The Veronicas, the same year, again with Gottwald, [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], [[Jessica Origliasso]] and [[Lisa Origliasso]] for the same album ''The Secret Life Of....''\n\n===Pink===\nMartin co-wrote and produced three songs on [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s platinum-selling fourth album ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'', including two of its most successful singles, \"[[U + Ur Hand]]\" (2006) and \"[[Who Knew]]\" (2006). \"[['Cuz I Can (Pink song)|Cuz I Can]]\" (2007) was released as the seventh single in the Australian market. Martin also collaborated with Pink for her fifth studio album, ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote the first smash hit single, \"[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]\" (2008), plus the tracks \"[[Please Don't Leave Me]]\" (2009), \"[[I Don't Believe You]]\" (2009), \"It's All Your Fault\" and \"Boring\". Martin and Pink wrote \"[[Whataya Want From Me]]\" during sessions for ''Funhouse'', but ultimately the song was recorded and released as a single by [[Adam Lambert]] to success. Pink's version would appear on her next effort, ''[[Greatest Hits... So Far!!! (Pink album)|Greatest Hits... So Far!!!]]'' (2010). Martin also co-wrote the hits \"[[Raise Your Glass]]\" and \"[[Fuckin' Perfect]]\" for the collection. For her sixth studio album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' (2012), he co-wrote the song \"Slut Like You\". Martin again collaborated with Pink with \"[[Just like Fire]]\" (2016) from the ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' movie soundtrack. For her seventh studio album, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017), he co-wrote \"[[Revenge (Pink song)|Revenge]]\", \"[[Whatever You Want (Pink song)|Whatever You Want]]\", \"For Now\", and \"Secrets\". In 2019 for her eighth studio album, ''[[Hurts 2B Human]]'' (2019), he co-wrote \"(Hey Why) Miss You Sometime\".\n\n===Usher===\nIn 2010, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Usher (singer)|Usher]]'s song \"[[DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love]]\" that went number-one on the US [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts and top-ten on the main Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/430708/Usher/chart?f=378|title=Usher \u2013 Chart history|website=www.billboard.com|access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref> Working together again, Martin co-wrote and co-produced on Usher's seventh studio album \"[[Looking 4 Myself]]\" in 2012 making the [[dance-pop]] song \"[[Scream (Usher song)|Scream]]\" that went number-one on the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart and number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Alongside the aforementioned trio and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]], Max Martin co-wrote the track and the song lived up to its hoped-for success becoming her major breakthrough into the US market, charting at number 6, whilst also topping the charts in the United Kingdom for two weeks. It charted in the top 50 most bought tracks in the US for 2012 and was the 8th best selling song in the same year within the United Kingdom with a sales figure of 749,000 in that year alone.<ref>Lane, Dan.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.
