He sought to overthrow the government that depended on foreigners and advocated for protecting the nation. His nationalists ideologies and political activism was greatly influenced by [[Jam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b|Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] and [[Muhammad Abduh|Muhammed Abduh]]. Al-Nadeem considers himself a self-taught scholar as he mentioned in his book \u201cKan wa yakoon\u201d; (''Was and Is being).''\n\n== Early life ==\nAbdullah al-Nadeem (born Abdullah Bin Mesbah) was born in [[Alexandria]] in 1843 to a poor Egyptian family. His father Mesbah Bin Ibrahim el-Hosni was a baker. Al-Nadeem grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Alexandria called El-Gomrok district, which is close to the main port of Alexandria.\n\nHis Father sent him to the district\u2019s \u201ckottab\u201d which was a simple form of schooling at that period of time. He learned how to read and write and was able to learn the [[Quran|Qur\u2019an]] by heart when he was only nine years old. In 1855, when he was a bit older the poor conditions of his family deprived him from studying at [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] so his father sent him to \u201cEl Noor\u201d mosque which was close to his home. He excelled at [[Fiqh|fiquh]], logic, religious studies, and Arabic grammar.<ref name=\":0\" /> He studied under the like of Ibrahim El Sersi, Ibrahim El Shaf\u2019ai, and Mohammed Al-\u2018Ashry.\n\nHowever, al-Nadeem was not thrilled by the education he was receiving at the mosque and decided to drop out. Instead, he decided to roam the streets and towns in Alexandria in search for intellectual seminars, poetry recitals, and lectures at local cafes and ventures. During this time he excelled in writing and speech. He became famous for his style and was considered a local celebrity in Alexandria. When word reached his father, he refused to support him financially unless he returned to the mosque. Nadim decided to leave Alexandria and headed south.\n\nWhen he was 17, al-Nadeem learned the telegraph and got a job as an operator in [[Benha|Banha]] and was later transferred to [[Qasar al-Ali]] in Cairo, which was the residential palace of [[Hoshiyar Hanim]], mother of the [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]].\n\n=== Before political activism ===\nAl-Nadeem settled in Cairo for a while. He attended many seminars of literature, poetry, and culture. He befriended Al-Azhar writers and scholars along with well-known figures such as [[Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi]] (who later on became the 5th prime minister of Egypt), Abdullah Fekry Pasha, Sheikh Abou Al- Nasr, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Rizkani, Mohammed Said Bey, and Mahmoud Safwat. Through their company al-Nadeem was exposed to Al-Azhar education and thought. At the same time [[Jam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b|Jamal al Din al-Afghani]] came to Cairo and began to lecture about the reformation of Islam. When he heard about him, he attended his lectures and was deeply impacted by his bold ideas. He became a recurring member of al-Afghani\u2019s councils and engaged in his seminars and learned from him reformation of religion, freedom of research, criticism and boldness in defending the right.\n\nAl Afghani was quick to recognise al-Nadeem\u2019s capabilities so he began to privately tutor him, which influenced al-Nadeem\u2019s political and nationalist ideologies greatly. His recurrent visits to al-Afghani led to his termination from his job at the palace.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u062e\u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629|last=\u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0642|first=\u0646\u062c\u064a\u0628|publisher=\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0647\u0631\u064a\u0629|year=1970|isbn=|location=Cairo|pages=}}</ref> Once again he was on the road. He resided at [[Mansoura, Egypt|Mansoura]] where he found residence at the \u201cOmada\u201d of a small village and took a job as a private tutor for the Omda\u2019s children teaching them writing, reading, and religious studies. At that time he managed to learn more about the peasants living in Mansoura and the poor conditions that they suffered from. He didn\u2019t last long at this job, which led to his departure from Mansoura. When he finally found a job again as a government employee he head back to Cairo where he was reunited with al-Afghani who began to take a more nationalist approach in his teachings and lessons. And since then al-Nadeem\u2019s political life began.\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the period of Khedive Ismail Egypt was on the verge of modernisation and connections with Europe increased specifically after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. Many Europeans came to Egypt to take advantage of the problematic fiscal situation that emerged during that time hoping to make huge fortunes from loaning the government money. Foreigners began to take part in the cultural and economic life in Egypt. At the same time, the prominent Islamic ideologist and political activists [[Jam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b|Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] came to Egypt. His teachings included religious reform and opposing foreign intervention promoting nationalists ideologies. Concurrently, reform and nationalist ideologies were spreading in many parts in Egypt. Al-Afghani had a major impact on nationalists and helped spread national political thought along with religious reformation.\n\nThe spread of national ideologies and religious reform played an important role in the emergence of political newspapers. Many newspapers emerged during that period due to al-Afghani\u2019s advocacy. [[Yaqub Sanu]] founded the satirical newspaper \u201cAbu Naddara Zarqqa\u201d. It is considered the first satirical political newspaper that appeared in Egypt. Sanu\u2019s use of colloquial language and cartoons made it very popular in Egyptian culture. Using this newspaper, Sanu criticized the Khedive\u2019s polices and his entourage. He also criticized the government and the people for not calling for their rights. His emerging popularity irritated the Khedive who recognized the danger of  Sanu and confiscated the newspaper and banished him. Sanu resided in Paris and managed to publish his newspaper and send many copies to Egypt. In that period from 1876 \u2013 1879, al-Afghani supported the emergence of more newspapers and journalists such as [[Mekhail Abdel Sayyid]] who founded the \u201cWatan\u201d (nation) newspaper, Adeeb Isaiah the founder of \u201cMisr\u201d (Egypt) newspaper, also [[Selim Al Naqqash]] who founded the newspaper \u201cAl Tejara\u201d (commerce), brothers Selim and Beshara Tuqla who founded \u201c[[Al-Ahram]]\u201d, and [[Selim Anhory]] \u201cMira\u2019at Al Shark\u201d (mirror of the East). More newspapers appeared such as \u201cAl Mahrousa\u201d, \u201cAl Asr Al Jadeed\u201d.\n\nThese newspapers arose from popular culture using language and anecdotes that Egyptians were able to relate to. They called for reform of government, and also opposed foreign intervention not just in politics but also social life. Journalists wrote from the empowerment of al-Afghani.\n\nThe situation in Egypt was unstable due financial problems because the Khedive\u2019s expenditures that were on efforts to modernize Egypt in a European way. Money was spent on projects, luxury goods, and tributes to the Ottoman Sultan. More money was spent on the Suez Canal project and opening. The end of the [[American Civil War]] attributed to the decrease in cotton prices, which was Egypt\u2019s major revenue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Political life ==\nAl-Nadeem returned to Alexandria, which was full of nationalists associations and Arabic newspapers. He wrote in the newspapers \"Misr\" ''Egypt'' and \"Al-Tejara\" ''Commerce'' many articles in the voice and principles of Al-Afghani. Al-Nadeem began to search for more political involvement so he searched for secret political movements in Alexandria, and in 1879 he joined the movement \u201cMisr Al- Fatah\u201d. It was a political organization working in secret and planning to overthrow the Khedive Ismail. They handed out political publications spreading nationalist ideologies and thought. They also wrote about the critical economic and political situation that was the result of the corrupt Khedive. Due to the secrecy, the organization\u2019s capabilities were limited and ineffective, but al-Nadeem was able to learn more about the discourse of patriotism and began to mingle more with people on the streets teaching and spreading nationalists\u2019 and patriotic ideologies and lecturing people about the importance of democracy and a constitution. During that time, al-Nadeem founded his first newspaper \"Al-Tankeet w Al-Tabkeet\", which was a weekly newspaper with satirical content projecting hidden political messages. He then replaced it with \"al-Tayef\" (\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0626\u0641) newspaper which was more serious paper with a nationalist tone.\n\nOn 26 June 1979, the European governments were able to pressure and convince the Ottoman [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdel Hamid II]] to depose Ismail Pasha and appoint his son [[Tewfik Pasha]] instead with [[Riyad Pasha]] serving as prime minister.\n\nMany were optimistic with this decision including al-Nadeem, the military officers, and al-Afghani. Tewfik Pasha was one of many students of al-Afghani and had many times attended seminars and lectures with national figures and writers including al-Nadeem. Tewfik\u2019s era did not improve Egypt\u2019s situation. On the contrary, there was more British and French intervention in domestic affairs.\n\n=== Urabi Revolt ===\nMilitary officers under the leadership of [[Ahmed \u02bbUrabi|Ahmed Urabi]] began to form secret movements spreading awareness of the foreign intervention in Egyptian affairs. They persuaded al-Nadeem to join them. Al-Nadeem found that the officers were targeting reformation and independency from foreign influence. He participated with his writings and speeches. With his style and articulation, al-Nadeem was able to summon people to the Urabi movement and he spoke of the importance of political activism and social reformation. Urabi appointed al-Nadeem as his personal advisor and through his writings and speeches, al-Nadeem enforced many people to join the military movement. In 1879 they formed the Egyptian Nationalist Party in the hopes of fostering a stronger national identity.\n\nAfter years of discrimination, the military officers under the leadership of Urabi sent a petition to Riyad Pasha in January 1881. It was a demand to depose all discriminatory acts against Egyptians. Urabi asked al-Nadeem to write a charter to the Egyptian people requesting authorization to represent them. The movement had two public demands; the deposition of Riyad Pasha\u2019s government, and the formation of a council of representatives. Al-Nadeem was a major component of a demonstration led by Urabi consisting of military officers and Egyptian civilians that headed to [[Abdeen Palace]] where the Khedive resided. The demands were met and Riyad\u2019s government was dissolved. [[Mohamed Sherif Pasha]] was appointed as prime minister and head of government. He saw great danger from al-Nadeem and his writings as someone who was able to shape public opinion and sway people to the officers\u2019 movement. Al-Nadeem mentioned in an article entitled \u201cBashing idiots\u201d that it was the time in which laws protected citizens from the oppressors.\n\nAl-Nadeem kept writing about nationalism and the role of a nation in his articles. He supported the development of political associations specifically in Alexandria. However, his paper \"al-Tayef\" had became very popular and according to Ahmed Samir who was one of his students and who wrote a biography of al-Nadeem, the newspaper was used by the military officers to spread their political movement and ideologies without the al-Nadeem's consent; something that al-Nadeem was not very fond of.\n\n=== British Occupation ===\nThe British were especially concerned that Urabi would default on Egypt's massive debt and that he might try to regain control of the [[Suez Canal]]. So they placed their warships on the shore of Alexandria. Meanwhile, Tewfik fled to their protection, moving his court to [[Alexandria]]. The strong naval presence spurred fears of an imminent invasion. The French fleet was recalled to France. The British warships in the harbor opened fire on the city's gun emplacements after the Egyptians ignored an ultimatum from Admiral Seymour to remove them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Report of the British naval and military operations in Egypt, 1882|last=Goodrich|first=Casper F.|publisher=Washington, Govt.

Another army, led by [[Sir Garnet Wolseley]], landed in the Canal Zone and on 13 September 1882 they defeated Urabi's army at the [[Battle of Tell El Kebir]]. From there, the British cavalry advanced on Cairo which surrendered without a shot being fired and the [[British occupation of Egypt|British occupation]] would start in Egypt.\n\n== Later life ==\nAccording to Samir al-Nadeem was with Urabi at the Battle of Tell El Kebir, and he returned with Urabi to Cairo after the defeat where Samir met him at Urabi's house. Al-Nadeem sneaked out during the night and left for Kafr Al-Dawar with his father. Urabi had considered to go Alexandria and surrender to Tewfik Pasha in hope for pardon.

He was inspired by Al-Afgani's reformation ideologies and relied on journalism and speech to deliver his thoughts and opinions. His student Ahmed Samir and writers who have mentioned him have all claimed that his vocal abilities and linguistic capacities were immense.<ref>''\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0645'' \u0628\u0642\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0630\u0647 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0633\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u0635\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0645\u060c \u0661\u0668\u0669\u0667</ref> He was able to gather people and criticize them while they were standing listening to him very attentively. His publications and writing styles were popular. He was still effective and inspiring after he disappeared ten years and returned from exile when he founded his final newspaper. Many state that Ahmed Urabi himself was impacted by al-Nadeem's nationalist views and ideologies. He believed in economic and religious reforms. He was a strong opposer to foreign intervention and colonization believing that the Arabs should not be subject to foreign rule.\n\n== Death ==\nAl-Nadeem died in October 1896  at the age of 54.

Al-Nadeem considers himself a self-taught scholar as he mentioned in his book \u201cKan wa yakoon\u201d; (''Was and Is being).''\n\n== Early Life ==\nAbdullah al-Nadeem (born Abdullah Bin Mesbah) was born in [[Alexandria]] in 1843 to a poor Egyptian family. His father Mesbah Bin Ibrahim el-Hosni was a baker. Al-Nadeem grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Alexandria called El-Gomrok district, which is close to the main port of Alexandria.\n\nHis Father sent him to the district\u2019s \u201ckottab\u201d which was a simple form of schooling at that period of time. He learned how to read and write and was able to learn the [[Quran|Qur\u2019an]] by heart when he was only nine years old. In 1855, when he was a bit older the poor conditions of his family deprived him from studying at [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] so his father sent him to \u201cEl Noor\u201d mosque which was close to his home. He excelled at [[Fiqh|fiquh]], logic, religious studies, and Arabic grammar.<ref name=\":0\" /> He studied under the like of Ibrahim El Sersi, Ibrahim El Shaf\u2019ai, and Mohammed Al-\u2018Ashry.\n\nHowever, al-Nadeem was not thrilled by the education he was receiving at the mosque and decided to drop out. Instead, he decided to roam the streets and towns in Alexandria in search for intellectual seminars, poetry recitals, and lectures at local cafes and ventures. During this time he excelled in writing and speech. He became famous for his style and was considered a local celebrity in Alexandria. When word reached his father, he refused to support him financially unless he returned to the mosque. Nadim decided to leave Alexandria and headed south.\n\nWhen he was 17, al-Nadeem learned the telegraph and got a job as an operator in [[Benha|Banha]] and was later transferred to [[Qasar al-Ali]] in Cairo, which was the residential palace of [[Hoshiyar Hanim]], mother of the [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]]. \n\n=== Before political activism ===\nAl-Nadeem settled in Cairo for a while. He attended many seminars of literature, poetry, and culture. He befriended Al-Azhar writers and scholars along with well-known figures such as [[Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi]] (who later on became the 5<sup>th</sup> prime minister of Egypt), Abdullah Fekry Pasha, Sheikh Abou Al- Nasr, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Rizkani, Mohammed Said Bey, and Mahmoud Safwat. Through their company al-Nadeem was exposed to Al-Azhar education and thought. At the same time [[Jam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b|Jamal al Din al-Afghani]] came to Cairo and began to lecture about the reformation of Islam. When he heard about him, he attended his lectures and was deeply impacted by his bold ideas. He became a recurring member of al-Afghani\u2019s councils and engaged in his seminars and learned from him reformation of religion, freedom of research, criticism and boldness in defending the right.  \n\nAl Afghani was quick to recognise al-Nadeem\u2019s capabilities so he began to privately tutor him, which influenced al-Nadeem\u2019s political and nationalist ideologies greatly. His recurrent visits to al-Afghani led to his termination from his job at the palace.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0645 \u062e\u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629|last=\u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0642|first=\u0646\u062c\u064a\u0628|publisher=\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0647\u0631\u064a\u0629|year=1970|isbn=|location=Cairo|pages=}}</ref> Once again he was on the road. He resided at [[Mansoura, Egypt|Mansoura]] where he found residence at the \u201cOmada\u201d of a small village and took a job as a private tutor for the Omda\u2019s children teaching them writing, reading, and religious studies. At that time he managed to learn more about the peasants living in Mansoura and the poor conditions that they suffered from. He didn\u2019t last long at this job, which led to his departure from Mansoura. When he finally found a job again as a government employee he head back to Cairo where he was reunited with al-Afghani who began to take a more nationalist approach in his teachings and lessons. And since then al-Nadeem\u2019s political life began.\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the period of Khedive Ismail Egypt was on the verge of modernisation and connections with Europe increased specifically after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. Many Europeans came to Egypt to take advantage of the problematic fiscal situation that emerged during that time hoping to make huge fortunes from loaning the government money. Foreigners began to take part in the cultural and economic life in Egypt. At the same time, the prominent Islamic ideologist and political activists [[Jam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b|Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] came to Egypt. His teachings included religious reform and opposing foreign intervention promoting nationalists ideologies. Concurrently, reform and nationalist ideologies were spreading in many parts in Egypt. Al-Afghani had a major impact on nationalists and helped spread national political thought along with religious reformation. \n\nThe spread of national ideologies and religious reform played an important role in the emergence of political newspapers. Many newspapers emerged during that period due to al-Afghani\u2019s advocacy. [[Yaqub Sanu]] founded the satirical newspaper \u201cAbu Naddara Zarqqa\u201d. It is considered the first satirical political newspaper that appeared in Egypt. Sanu\u2019s use of colloquial language and cartoons made it very popular in Egyptian culture. Using this newspaper, Sanu criticized the Khedive\u2019s polices and his entourage. He also criticized the government and the people for not calling for their rights. His emerging popularity irritated the Khedive who recognized the danger of  Sanu and confiscated the newspaper and banished him. Sanu resided in Paris and managed to publish his newspaper and send many copies to Egypt. In that period from 1876 \u2013 1879, al-Afghani supported the emergence of more newspapers and journalists such as [[Mekhail Abdel Sayyid]] who founded the \u201cWatan\u201d (nation) newspaper, Adeeb Isaiah the founder of \u201cMisr\u201d (Egypt) newspaper, also [[Selim Al Naqqash]] who founded the newspaper \u201cAl Tejara\u201d (commerce), brothers Selim and Beshara Tuqla who founded \u201c[[Al-Ahram]]\u201d, and [[Selim Anhory]] \u201cMira\u2019at Al Shark\u201d (mirror of the East). More newspapers appeared such as \u201cAl Mahrousa\u201d, \u201cAl Asr Al Jadeed\u201d.\n\nThese newspapers arose from popular culture using language and anecdotes that Egyptians were able to relate to. They called for reform of government, and also opposed foreign intervention not just in politics but also social life. Journalists wrote from the empowerment of al-Afghani.\n\nThe situation in Egypt was unstable due financial problems because the Khedive\u2019s expenditures that were on efforts to modernize Egypt in a European way. Money was spent on projects, luxury goods, and tributes to the Ottoman Sultan. More money was spent on the Suez Canal project and opening. The end of the [[American Civil War]] attributed to the decrease in cotton prices, which was Egypt\u2019s major revenue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Political life ==\nAl-Nadeem returned to Alexandria, which was full of nationalists associations and Arabic newspapers. He wrote in the newspapers \"Misr\" ''Egypt'' and \"Al-Tejara\" ''Commerce'' many articles in the voice and principles of Al-Afghani. Al-Nadeem began to search for more political involvement so he searched for secret political movements in Alexandria, and in 1879 he joined the movement \u201cMisr Al- Fatah\u201d. It was a political organization working in secret and planning to overthrow the Khedive Ismail. They handed out political publications spreading nationalist ideologies and thought. They also wrote about the critical economic and political situation that was the result of the corrupt Khedive. Due to the secrecy, the organization\u2019s capabilities were limited and ineffective, but al-Nadeem was able to learn more about the discourse of patriotism and began to mingle more with people on the streets teaching and spreading nationalists\u2019 and patriotic ideologies and lecturing people about the importance of democracy and a constitution. During that time, al-Nadeem founded his first newspaper \"Al-Tankeet w Al-Tabkeet\", which was a weekly newspaper with satirical content projecting hidden political messages. He then replaced it with \"al-Tayef\" (\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0626\u0641) newspaper which was more serious paper with a nationalist tone. \n\nOn 26<sup>th</sup> of June 1979, the European governments were able to pressure and convince the Ottoman [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdel Hamid II]] to depose Ismail Pasha and appoint his son [[Tewfik Pasha]] instead with [[Riyad Pasha]] serving as prime minister.\n\nMany were optimistic with this decision including al-Nadeem, the military officers, and al-Afghani. Tewfik Pasha was one of many students of al-Afghani and had many times attended seminars and lectures with national figures and writers including al-Nadeem. Tewfik\u2019s era did not improve Egypt\u2019s situation. On the contrary, there was more British and French intervention in domestic affairs.\n\n=== Urabi Revolt ===\nMilitary officers under the leadership of [[Ahmed \u02bbUrabi|Ahmed Urabi]] began to form secret movements spreading awareness of the foreign intervention in Egyptian affairs. They persuaded al-Nadeem to join them. Al-Nadeem found that the officers were targeting reformation and independency from foreign influence. He participated with his writings and speeches. With his style and articulation, al-Nadeem was able to summon people to the Urabi movement and he spoke of the importance of political activism and social reformation. Urabi appointed al-Nadeem as his personal advisor and through his writings and speeches, al-Nadeem enforced many people to join the military movement. In 1879 they formed the Egyptian Nationalist Party in the hopes of fostering a stronger national identity.\n\nAfter years of discrimination, the military officers under the leadership of Urabi sent a petition to Riyad Pasha in January 1881. It was a demand to depose all discriminatory acts against Egyptians. Urabi asked al-Nadeem to write a charter to the Egyptian people requesting authorization to represent them. The movement had two public demands; the deposition of Riyad Pasha\u2019s government, and the formation of a council of representatives. Al-Nadeem was a major component of a demonstration led by Urabi consisting of military officers and Egyptian civilians that headed to [[Abdeen Palace]] where the Khedive resided. The demands were met and Riyad\u2019s government was dissolved. [[Mohamed Sherif Pasha]] was appointed as prime minister and head of government. He saw great danger from al-Nadeem and his writings as someone who was able to shape public opinion and sway people to the officers\u2019 movement. Al-Nadeem mentioned in an article entitled \u201cBashing idiots\u201d that it was the time in which laws protected citizens from the oppressors.  \n\nAl-Nadeem kept writing about nationalism and the role of a nation in his articles. He supported the development of political associations specifically in Alexandria. However, his paper \"al-Tayef\" had became very popular and according to Ahmed Samir who was one of his students and who wrote a biography of al-Nadeem, the newspaper was used by the military officers to spread their political movement and ideologies without the al-Nadeem's consent; something that al-Nadeem was not very fond of. \n\n=== British Occupation ===\nThe British were especially concerned that Urabi would default on Egypt's massive debt and that he might try to regain control of the [[Suez Canal]]. So they placed their warships on the shore of Alexandria. Meanwhile, Tewfik fled to their protection, moving his court to [[Alexandria]]. The strong naval presence spurred fears of an imminent invasion. The French fleet was recalled to France. The British warships in the harbor opened fire on the city's gun emplacements after the Egyptians ignored an ultimatum from Admiral Seymour to remove them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Report of the British naval and military operations in Egypt, 1882|last=Goodrich|first=Casper F.|publisher=Washington, Govt.

Another army, led by [[Sir Garnet Wolseley]], landed in the Canal Zone and on 13 September 1882 they defeated Urabi's army at the [[Battle of Tell El Kebir]]. From there, the British cavalry advanced on Cairo which surrendered without a shot being fired and the [[British occupation of Egypt|British occupation]] would start in Egypt.\n\n== Later Life ==\nAccording to Samir al-Nadeem was with Urabi at the Battle of Tell El Kebir, and he returned with Urabi to Cairo after the defeat where Samir met him at Urabi's house. Al-Nadeem sneaked out during the night and left for Kafr Al-Dawar with his father. Urabi had considered to go Alexandria and surrender to Tewfik Pasha in hope for pardon. Samir says in his biography that it was the last time he saw al-Nadeem for ten years. Al-Nadeem disappeared growing his beard and wearing large turbans so that no one could recogonize him.

It was founded in 1898 by the seminal [[Russia]]n [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], together with the playwright and director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]. It was conceived as a venue for [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] theatre, in contrast to the [[melodrama]]s that were Russia's dominant form of theatre at the time. The theatre, the first to regularly put on shows implementing [[Stanislavski's system]], proved hugely influential in the acting world and in the development of modern American theatre and drama.\n\n==Beginnings==\nAt the end of the 19th-century, Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko both wanted to reform Russian theatre to high-quality art that was available to the general public. They set about creating a private theatre over which they had total control (as opposed to trying to reform the government-operated [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]], a move which would have given them far less artistic freedom). On 22 June 1897, the two men met for the first time at the Slavyanski Bazar for a lunch that started at 2 PM and did not end until 8 AM the next morning.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref> While Stanislavski\u2019s approach to theatre revolved around the acting process, Nemirovich was far more concerned with the literary, intellectual angle.\n\nTheir differences proved to be complementary, and they agreed to initially divide power over the theatre, with Nemirovich in charge of the literary decisions and Stanislavski in charge of all production decisions. Stanislavski interviewed all his actors, making sure they were hard working and devoted as well as talented. He made them live together in common housing for months at a time to foster community and trust, which he believed would raise the quality of their performances. Stanislavski's system, in which he trained actors via the acting studios he founded as part of the theatre, became central to every production the theatre put on.<ref>Gauss (1999)</ref> The system played a huge influence in the development of [[method acting]].\n\nStanislavski and Danchenko\u2019s initial goal of having an \u201copen theatre,\u201d one that anyone could afford to attend, was quickly destroyed when they could neither obtain adequate funding from private investors, nor from the Moscow City Council.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Theatre's first season included works by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|Aleksey Tolstoy]] (''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]''), [[Henrik Ibsen]], and [[William Shakespeare]], but it wasn\u2019t until it staged [[Anton Chekhov]]'s four major works, beginning with [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|its production of ''The Seagull'' in 1898]], with Stanislavski in the role of Trigorin, that the theatre achieved fame. This production was so successful that the theatre adopted the [[seagull]] as its [[emblem]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAfter Chekhov\u2019s death in 1904, the theatre experienced a huge changeover; Chekhov had envisioned fellow playwright and friend [[Maxim Gorki]] as his successor as the Theatre\u2019s leading dramatist, but Nemirovich and Stanislavski\u2019s reaction to his play ''[[Summerfolk]]'' was unenthusiastic, causing Gorki to leave. He took with him [[Savva Morozov]], one of the theatre\u2019s main investors at the time.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref>\n\nNow in dire straits, the theatre decided to accept invitations to go on an international tour in 1906, which started in Berlin and included Dresden, Frankfurt, Prague, and Vienna. The tour was a huge success, gaining the theatre international acclaim. However, the sudden change in fortune did not completely quell the company's internal strife; Stanislavski appointed friends to the theatre\u2019s management without consulting Nemirovich and opened studios attached to the theatre where he began to implement his acting system, cementing Nemirovich\u2019s fears that the theatre was becoming a mere extension of Stanislavski\u2019s own ideas and work. The tension between the two led Stanislavski to abandon his duties as a board member and to relinquish all his power over policy decisions.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref>\n\nThe theatre continued to thrive after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 and was one of the foremost state-supported theatres of the [[Soviet Union]], with an extensive repertoire of leading Russian and Western playwrights. Although several revolutionary groups saw it as an irrelevant marker of pre-revolutionary culture, the theatre was initially granted support by [[Vladimir Lenin]], a frequent patron of the Art Theatre himself. [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] wrote several plays for the MAT and satirised the organisation mercilessly in his ''[[Theatrical Novel]]''. [[Isaac Babel]]'s ''[[Sunset (play)|Sunset]]'' was also performed there during the 1920s. A significant number of Moscow Art Theatre's actors were awarded the prestigious title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]]. Many actors became nationally known and admired thanks to their film roles. However, the Civil War saw many of the theatre\u2019s actors being cut off from Moscow, and the support it received from the government diminished under Lenin\u2019s [[New Economic Policy]]. The subsidies it had come to rely on were withdrawn and the theatre was forced to survive on its own profits. By 1923, the MAT was in $25,000 debt.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe theatre experienced further blows through the end of the 1930s. Stanislavski's heart attack onstage during a production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' in 1928 led to his almost complete withdrawal from the theatre, while the Stalinist climate began to suppress artistic expression and controlled more and more what could be performed. A \"red director\" was appointed to the management by the government to ensure that the MAT\u2019s activities were not counter-revolutionary and that they served the Communist cause. As Russia began a period of rapid industrialization, so too was the MAT encouraged to increase production at the expense of quality, with more and more hastily produced plays going up each season. Plays had to be officially approved, and the Theatre\u2019s artistic integrity started to decline.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe theatre was officially renamed The Gorky Moscow Art Theatre in 1932.<ref>Magarshack (1950, 383).</ref> Desperate not to lose support, Stanislavski tried to appease Stalin by accepting his political limitations on what could be performed while retaining his devotion to naturalistic theatre. As a result, the mid-20th century incarnation of the Moscow Art Theatre took a stylistic turn towards [[Socialist Realism]], which would affect its productions for decades.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIt was not until autumn of 1970 that [[Oleg Yefremov]], an actor, producer, and former student of the Moscow Art Theatre Studios who wanted Russia to once again be a major contender in the theatre world, took over control of the theatre and began to reform it. By the time he arrived to save it, the company was made up of only 150 actors, many of whom were out of practice. Yefremov began to reinstate Stanislavski\u2019s traditions, including emphasizing the importance of the studio and of the system, as well as interviewing every single candidate with special emphasis and attention placed on work ethic.<ref>Smeliansky (1999)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the theatre split into two troupes: the Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre (artistic director [[Oleg Yefremov]]) and the Gorky Moscow Art Theatre (artistic director [[Tatiana Doronina]]). [[Oleg Tabakov]] was the Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre's artistic director from 2000 until his death in 2018. The Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre is located just off [[Tverskaya Street]], within walking distance of [[Red Square]].\n[[File:Maurice de Maeterlinck.jpg|thumb|upright|Playwright Maurice Maeterlinck, whose play [[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]], made its worldwide debut at the theatre]]\n\n==List of productions==\n{{See also|List of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski}}\nWhat follows is a full chronological list of MAT productions<ref>\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440, \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0418\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 - 1955</ref>\n\n\n===1898===\n*[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]], by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]]\n*[[The Sunken Bell]], by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n*[[The Merchant of Venice]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n*[[The Seagull]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n\n===1899===\n*[[Antigone]], by [[Sophocles]]\n*[[Hedda Gabler]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*[[The Death of Ivan the Terrible]], by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]]\n*[[Twelfth Night]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n*[[Drayman Henschel]], by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n*[[Uncle Vanya]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n*Lonely People, by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n[[File:The Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol.jpg|thumb|upright|A Russian Stamp depicting [[The Government Inspector]], by [[Nikolai Gogol]], which played at MAT]]\n\n===1900===\n*[[The Snow Maiden (play)|The Snow Maiden]], by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]]\n*[[An Enemy of the People]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*[[When We Dead Awaken]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n\n===1901===\n*[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n*[[The Wild Duck]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*Michael Kramer, by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n*In my Dreams, by [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]\n\n===1902===\n*[[The Philistines]], by [[Maxim Gorky]]\n*[[The Power of Darkness]], by [[Leo Tolstoy]]\n*[[The Lower Depths]], by [[Maxim Gorky]]\n\n===1903===\n*[[The Pillars of Society]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n\n===1904===\n*[[The Cherry Orchard]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n*[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n\n===1905===\n*[[Children of the Sun (play)|Children of the Sun]], [[Maxim Gorky]]\n[[File:The Cherry Orchard MAT.jpg|thumb|upright|A scene from [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]s The Cherry Orchard]]\n\n===1906===\n*[[Woe from Wit]], by [[Aleksander Griboyedov]] (reproduced in 1914)\n*[[Brand (play)|Brand]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n\n===1907===\n*[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]], by [[Alexander Pushkin]]\n\n===1908===\n*[[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]], by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]\n*[[The Government Inspector]], [[Nikolai Gogol]]\n\n===1909===\n*At the Gate of the Kingdom, by [[Knut Hamsun]]\n*[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]], by [[Ivan Turgenev]]\n\n===1910===\n*[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man]], by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]]\n*[[The Brothers Karamazov]], by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]\n\n===1911===\n*[[The Living Corpse]], by [[Leo Tolstoy]]\n*[[Hamlet]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n\n===1912===\n*[[Fortune's Fool]], [[A Provincial Lady]] and It Tears Where It is Thin, by [[Ivan Turgenev]]\n*[[Peer Gynt]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n\n===1913===\n*The Forced Marriage and [[The Imaginary Invalid]] by [[Moli\u00e8re]]\n\n===1914===\n*[[The Mistress of the Inn]], by [[Carlo Goldoni]]\n*Pasukhin's Death, by [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]]\n\n===1915===\n*[[The Stone Guest (play)|The Stone Guest]], [[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]] and A Feast in Time of Plague, by  [[Alexander Pushkin]]\n\n===1916-17===\n*[[The Village of Stepanchikovo]], by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]\n\nNote: When more than one play is listed on the same line, it means that they were produced and performed together.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|MAT production of ''The Seagull'' (1898)]]\n* [[Moscow Art Theatre production of Hamlet|MAT production of ''Hamlet'' (1911\u201312)]]\n* [[Studio Six Theater Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.

It was founded in 1898 by the seminal [[Russia]]n [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], together with the playwright and director [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]. It was conceived as a venue for [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] theatre, in contrast to the [[melodrama]]s that were Russia's dominant form of theatre at the time. The theatre, the first to regularly put on shows implementing [[Stanislavski's system]], proved hugely influential in the acting world and in the development of modern American theatre and drama.\n\n==Beginnings==\nAt the end of the 19th-century, Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko both wanted to reform Russian theatre to high-quality art that was available to the general public. They set about creating a private theatre over which they had total control (as opposed to trying to reform the government-operated [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]], a move which would have given them far less artistic freedom). On 22 June 1897, the two men met for the first time at the Slavyanski Bazar for a lunch that started at 2 PM and did not end until 8 AM the next morning.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref> While Stanislavski\u2019s approach to theatre revolved around the acting process, Nemirovich was far more concerned with the literary, intellectual angle.\n\nTheir differences proved to be complementary, and they agreed to initially divide power over the theatre, with Nemirovich in charge of the literary decisions and Stanislavski in charge of all production decisions. Stanislavski interviewed all his actors, making sure they were hard working and devoted as well as talented. He made them live together in common housing for months at a time to foster community and trust, which he believed would raise the quality of their performances. Stanislavski's system, in which he trained actors via the acting studios he founded as part of the theatre, became central to every production the theatre put on.<ref>Gauss (1999)</ref> The system played a huge influence in the development of [[method acting]].\n\nStanislavski and Danchenko\u2019s initial goal of having an \u201copen theatre,\u201d one that anyone could afford to attend, was quickly destroyed when they could neither obtain adequate funding from private investors, nor from the Moscow City Council.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Theatre's first season included works by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|Aleksey Tolstoy]] (''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]''), [[Henrik Ibsen]], and [[William Shakespeare]], but it wasn\u2019t until it staged [[Anton Chekhov]]'s four major works, beginning with [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|its production of ''The Seagull'' in 1898]], with Stanislavski in the role of Trigorin, that the theatre achieved fame. This production was so successful that the theatre adopted the [[seagull]] as its [[emblem]].\n\nAfter Chekhov\u2019s death in 1904, the theatre experienced a huge changeover; Chekhov had envisioned fellow playwright and friend [[Maxim Gorki]] as his successor as the Theatre\u2019s leading dramatist, but Nemirovich and Stanislavski\u2019s reaction to his play ''[[Summerfolk]]'' was unenthusiastic, causing Gorki to leave. He took with him [[Savva Morozov]], one of the theatre\u2019s main investors at the time.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref>\n\nNow in dire straits, the theatre decided to accept invitations to go on an international tour in 1906, which started in Berlin and included Dresden, Frankfurt, Prague, and Vienna. The tour was a huge success, gaining the theatre international acclaim. However, the sudden change in fortune did not completely quell the company's internal strife; Stanislavski appointed friends to the theatre\u2019s management without consulting Nemirovich and opened studios attached to the theatre where he began to implement his acting system, cementing Nemirovich\u2019s fears that the theatre was becoming a mere extension of Stanislavski\u2019s own ideas and work. The tension between the two led Stanislavski to abandon his duties as a board member and to relinquish all his power over policy decisions.<ref>Benedetti (1991)</ref>\n\nThe theatre continued to thrive after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 and was one of the foremost state-supported theatres of the [[Soviet Union]], with an extensive repertoire of leading Russian and Western playwrights. Although several revolutionary groups saw it as an irrelevant marker of pre-revolutionary culture, the theatre was initially granted support by [[Vladimir Lenin]], a frequent patron of the Art Theatre himself. [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] wrote several plays for the MAT and satirised the organisation mercilessly in his ''[[Theatrical Novel]]''. [[Isaac Babel]]'s ''[[Sunset (play)|Sunset]]'' was also performed there during the 1920s. A significant number of Moscow Art Theatre's actors were awarded the prestigious title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]]. Many actors became nationally known and admired thanks to their film roles. However, the Civil War saw many of the theatre\u2019s actors being cut off from Moscow, and the support it received from the government diminished under Lenin\u2019s [[New Economic Policy]]. The subsidies it had come to rely on were withdrawn and the theatre was forced to survive on its own profits. By 1923, the MAT was in $25,000 debt.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe theatre experienced further blows through the end of the 1930s. Stanislavski's heart attack onstage during a production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' in 1928 led to his almost complete withdrawal from the theatre, while the Stalinist climate began to suppress artistic expression and controlled more and more what could be performed. A \"red director\" was appointed to the management by the government to ensure that the MAT\u2019s activities were not counter-revolutionary and that they served the Communist cause. As Russia began a period of rapid industrialization, so too was the MAT encouraged to increase production at the expense of quality, with more and more hastily produced plays going up each season. Plays had to be officially approved, and the Theatre\u2019s artistic integrity started to decline.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe theatre was officially renamed The Gorky Moscow Art Theatre in 1932.<ref>Magarshack (1950, 383).</ref> Desperate not to lose support, Stanislavski tried to appease Stalin by accepting his political limitations on what could be performed while retaining his devotion to naturalistic theatre. As a result, the mid-20th century incarnation of the Moscow Art Theatre took a stylistic turn towards [[Socialist Realism]], which would affect its productions for decades.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIt was not until autumn of 1970 that [[Oleg Yefremov]], an actor, producer, and former student of the Moscow Art Theatre Studios who wanted Russia to once again be a major contender in the theatre world, took over control of the theatre and began to reform it. By the time he arrived to save it, the company was made up of only 150 actors, many of whom were out of practice. Yefremov began to reinstate Stanislavski\u2019s traditions, including emphasizing the importance of the studio and of the system, as well as interviewing every single candidate with special emphasis and attention placed on work ethic.<ref>Smeliansky (1999)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the theatre split into two troupes: the Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre (artistic director [[Oleg Yefremov]]) and the Gorky Moscow Art Theatre (artistic director [[Tatiana Doronina]]). [[Oleg Tabakov]] was the Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre's artistic director from 2000 until his death in 2018. The Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre is located just off [[Tverskaya Street]], within walking distance of [[Red Square]].\n[[File:Maurice de Maeterlinck.jpg|thumb|upright|Playwright Maurice Maeterlinck, whose play [[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]], made its worldwide debut at the theatre]]\n\n==List of productions==\n{{See also|List of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski}}\nWhat follows is a full chronological list of MAT productions<ref>\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440, \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0418\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 - 1955</ref>\n\n\n===1898===\n*[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]], by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]]\n*[[The Sunken Bell]], by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n*[[The Merchant of Venice]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n*[[The Seagull]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n\n===1899===\n*[[Antigone]], by [[Sophocles]]\n*[[Hedda Gabler]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*[[The Death of Ivan the Terrible]], by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]]\n*[[Twelfth Night]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n*[[Drayman Henschel]], by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n*[[Uncle Vanya]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n*Lonely People, by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n[[File:The Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol.jpg|thumb|upright|A Russian Stamp depicting [[The Government Inspector]], by [[Nikolai Gogol]], which played at MAT]]\n\n===1900===\n*[[The Snow Maiden (play)|The Snow Maiden]], by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]]\n*[[An Enemy of the People]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*[[When We Dead Awaken]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n\n===1901===\n*[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n*[[The Wild Duck]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*Michael Kramer, by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]\n*In my Dreams, by [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]\n\n===1902===\n*[[The Philistines]], by [[Maxim Gorky]]\n*[[The Power of Darkness]], by [[Leo Tolstoy]]\n*[[The Lower Depths]], by [[Maxim Gorky]]\n\n===1903===\n*[[The Pillars of Society]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n*[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n\n===1904===\n*[[The Cherry Orchard]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n*[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]], by [[Anton Chekhov]]\n\n===1905===\n*[[Children of the Sun (play)|Children of the Sun]], [[Maxim Gorky]]\n[[File:The Cherry Orchard MAT.jpg|thumb|upright|A scene from [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]s The Cherry Orchard]]\n\n===1906===\n*[[Woe from Wit]], by [[Aleksander Griboyedov]] (reproduced in 1914)\n*[[Brand (play)|Brand]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n\n===1907===\n*[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]], by [[Alexander Pushkin]]\n\n===1908===\n*[[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]], by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]\n*[[The Government Inspector]], [[Nikolai Gogol]]\n\n===1909===\n*At the Gate of the Kingdom, by [[Knut Hamsun]]\n*[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]], by [[Ivan Turgenev]]\n\n===1910===\n*[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man]], by [[Alexander Ostrovsky]]\n*[[The Brothers Karamazov]], by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]\n\n===1911===\n*[[The Living Corpse]], by [[Leo Tolstoy]]\n*[[Hamlet]], by [[William Shakespeare]]\n\n===1912===\n*[[Fortune's Fool]], [[A Provincial Lady]] and It Tears Where It is Thin, by [[Ivan Turgenev]]\n*[[Peer Gynt]], by [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n\n===1913===\n*The Forced Marriage and [[The Imaginary Invalid]] by [[Moli\u00e8re]]\n\n===1914===\n*[[The Mistress of the Inn]], by [[Carlo Goldoni]]\n*Pasukhin's Death, by [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]]\n\n===1915===\n*[[The Stone Guest (play)|The Stone Guest]], [[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]] and A Feast in Time of Plague, by  [[Alexander Pushkin]]\n\n===1916-17===\n*[[The Village of Stepanchikovo]], by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]\n\nNote: When more than one play is listed on the same line, it means that they were produced and performed together.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|MAT production of ''The Seagull'' (1898)]]\n* [[Moscow Art Theatre production of Hamlet|MAT production of ''Hamlet'' (1911\u201312)]]\n* [[Studio Six Theater Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.
