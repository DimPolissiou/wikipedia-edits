Traditionally, it formed part of [[Lower Brittany]]. It now covers an area of 7,029&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,714 square miles) and contains a population of 852,685, of whom 750,000 (88%) are [[Catholic]].\n\nThe diocese is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Rennes|Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo]].

His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137.

The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268.</ref>\n\nThere were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Tr\u00e9meur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.<ref>Besse, VIII, p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperl\u00e9 (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalao\u00fcen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).<ref>''Pouille of 1648'', pp. 8-9 (436-437).

Albert Le Grand wrote the \"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\" (1636) and published a [[Breton language|Breton]] dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton. Today he is considered by some{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} to be the founder of Breton philology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  There was already a grammar school in Quimper in 1348, but never a university.

Jean, p. 433, reports that there were 173 parishes.</ref>\n\n===The Revolution===\n\nDuring the French revolution the Diocese of Quimper was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, coterminous with the new 'Departement de Finist\u00e8re', which was made a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of the 'Metropole du Nord-Ouest' with its seat at Rennes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405114534/http://sourcebook.fsc.edu/history/civilconstitution.html Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English)] Retrieved: 2016-09-02.</ref> The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the department.  This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791. Expilly then assisted [[Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel|Jean-Baptiste Gobel]], a legitimate bishop consecrated in 1772, who had apostasized and was then Constitutional Bishop of Paris, in the consecration of additional Constitutional bishops on 27 February and 6 March.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=R\u00e9pertoire biographique de l'\u00e9piscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A.

The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes', did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.

In 1853, the name was changed from the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) to the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) and L\u00e9on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/quim0.htm|title=Diocese of Quimper, France}}</ref>\n\nOriginally established in the 5th century, the diocese was dismantled during the anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]]. It was restored by the [[Concordat of 1801]], as the combination of the Dioceses of Quimper, [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]] and [[Tr\u00e9guier]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. Traditionally, it formed part of [[Lower Brittany]]. It now covers an area of 7,029&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,714 square miles) and contains a population of 852,685, of whom 750,000 (88%) are [[Catholic]].\n\nThe diocese is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Rennes|Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo]]. The current bishop is Laurent Marie Bernard Dognin.\n\n==History==\n\n===Diocese of Quimper: early history===\nTwo versions of the catalogue of the Bishops of Quimper are known: one is from the twelfth century and is held by the Cartulary of Quimperl\u00e9; the other is preserved in a Quimper Cartulary of the fifteenth century.<ref>Duchesne, ''Fasti'' II, p. 372.</ref> Both mention a [[St Corentinus|St. Chorentius]] as first Bishop of Quimper. His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 17 Mar. 2013]</ref> The earliest historical reference dates from 453. An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137. Duchesne, II, p. 247.</ref>\n\n====Diocese of Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on====\n[[File:Kathedrale von Saint Pol de L\u00e8on.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Cathedral St.-Paul-Aurelian, Saint-Pol]]\nThere is evidence that Christianity was preached in L\u00e9on twenty years before the evangelization of [[Cornouaille]], but ancient Breton chronology is very uncertain. The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268.</ref>\n\nThere were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Tr\u00e9meur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.<ref>Besse, VIII, p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperl\u00e9 (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalao\u00fcen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).<ref>''Pouille of 1648'', pp. 8-9 (436-437). Besse, pp. 270-275.</ref>\n\n====Other churches====\nThe Cathedral of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, which is now in the Diocese of Quimper, was built between the 13th and 16th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Malo Th\u00e9ophile Peyron|title=La cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Pol et le minihy L\u00e9on|url=https://archive.org/details/lacathdraledesa00peyrgoog|year=1901|publisher=A. de Kerangal|location=Quimper|language=French|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lacathdraledesa00peyrgoog/page/n36 28]\u201332}}  A list of the Bishops of Saint-Pol de L\u00e9on is given at pp. 6-11.</ref> The Church of Notre Dame de Creisker, in the same town, restored in the fourteenth century, has a [[Bell tower|belfry]] which the Bretons claim to be the handsomest in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Formerly Quimperl\u00e9 had an important Benedictine abbey, Sainte Croix, founded in 1029 and where the [[Benedictine]]s of St. Maur took up their residence in 1665. Along with all abbeys, convents, and monasteries, it was suppressed by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Monastic vows were abolished.

Albert Le Grand wrote the \"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\" (1636) and published a [[Breton language|Breton]] dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton.

This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791.

The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes', did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.

{"title_page": "Film-out", "text_new": "{{expert needed|date=December 2009}}\n'''Film-out''' is the process in the [[computer graphics]], [[video production]] and [[filmmaking]] disciplines of transferring images or [[animation]] from [[videotape]] or digital files to a traditional [[film print]]. \"Film-out\" is a broad term that encompasses the conversion of frame rates, color correction, as well as the actual printing, also called scanning or [[film recorder|recording]].\n\nThe film-out process is different depending on the regional standard of the master videotape in question \u2013 [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]] \u2013 or likewise on the several emerging region-independent formats of [[High-definition video|high definition]] video (HD video); thus each type is covered separately, taking into account regional film-out industries, methods and technical considerations.\n\n==Film-out of live action video==\nMany modern [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and low-budget films are shot on videotape or other  [[digital video]] media, instead of [[film stock]], and completed as digital video.  [[Video production]] means substantially lower costs than [[16 mm]] or [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] film production on all levels. Until recently, the relatively low cost of video ended when the issue of a theatrical presentation was raised, which required a print for [[Movie projector|film projection]]. With the growing presence of digital projection, this is becoming less of a factor.\n\n===Standard definition (SD) video===\nFilm-out of [[SD video|standard-definition video]] \u2013 or any source that has an incompatible frame rate \u2013 is the up-conversion of video media to film for theatrical viewing. The video-to-film conversion process consists of two major steps: first, the conversion of video into digital \"film frames\" which are then stored on a computer or on HD videotape; and secondly, the printing of these digital \"film frames\" onto actual film. To understand these two steps, it is important to understand how video and film differ.\n\nFilm (sound film, at least) has remained unchanged for almost a century and creates the illusion of moving images through the rapid projection of still images, \"frames\", upon a screen, typically 24 per second. Traditional [[interlaced]] [[SD video]] has no real frame rate, (though the term \"frame\" is applied to video, it has a different meaning). Instead, video consists of a very fast succession of horizontal lines that continually cascade down the television screen \u2013 streaming top to bottom, before jumping back to the top and then streaming down to the bottom again, repeatedly, almost 60 alternating screen-fulls every second for NTSC, or exactly 50 such screen-fulls per second for PAL and SECAM. Since visual movement in video is infused in this continuous cascade of scans lines, there is no discrete image or real \"frame\" that can be identified at any one time. Therefore, when transferring video to film, it is necessary to \"invent\" individual film frames, 24 for every second of elapsed time. The bulk of the work done by a film-out company is this first step, creating film frames out of the stream of interlaced video.\n\nEach company employs its own (often proprietary) technology for turning interlaced video into high-resolution digital video files of 24 discrete images every second, called 24 progressive video or 24p. The technology must filter out all the visually unappealing artifacting that results from the inherent mismatch between video and film movement. Moreover, the conversion process usually requires human intervention at every edit point of a video program, so that each type of scene can be calibrated for maximum visual quality. The use of archival footage in video especially calls for extra attention.\n\nStep two, the scanning to film, is the rote part of the process. This is the mechanical step where lasers print each of the newly created frames of the 24p video, stored on computer files or HD videotape, onto rolls of film.\n\nMost companies that do film-out, do all the stages of the process themselves for a lump sum. The job includes converting interlaced video into 24p and often a color correction session \u2013 ([[color grading|calibrating the image for theatrical projection]]), before scanning to physical film, (possibly followed by color correction of the film print made from the [[Digital intermediate|digital intermediary]]) \u2013 is offered. At the very least, film-out can be understood as the process of converting interlaced video to 24p and then scanning it to film.\n\n====NTSC video====\n[[NTSC]] is the most challenging of the formats when it comes to standards conversion and, specifically, converting to film prints.  NTSC runs at the approximate rate of 29.97 video \"frames\" (consisting of two interlaced screen-fulls of scan lines, called fields, per frame) per second.  In this way, NTSC resolves actual [[live action]] movement at almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 60 alternating half-resolution images every second.  Because of this 29.97 rate, no direct correlation to film frames at 24 [[frame rate|frames per second]] can be achieved.  NTSC is hardest to reconcile with film, thus motivates [[Three-two pull down|its own unique processes]].\n\n====PAL and SECAM video====\n[[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] run at 25 interlaced video \"frames\" per second, which can be slowed down or frame-dropped, then [[deinterlace]]d, to correlate \"frame\" for frame with film running at 24 actual frames per second.  PAL and SECAM are less complex and demanding than NTSC for film-out.  PAL and SECAM conversions do agitate, though, with the unpleasant choice between slowing down video (and audio pitch, noticeably) by four percent, from 25 to 24 frames per second, in order to maintain a 1:1 frame match, slightly changing the rhythm and feel of the program; or maintaining original speed by periodically dropping frames, thereby creating jerkiness and possible loss of vital detail in fast-moving action or precise edits.\n\n===High definition (HD) digital video===\n[[High-definition video|High definition]] digital video can be shot at a variety of frame rates, including 29.97 [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d (like NTSC) or [[progressive video|progressive]]; or 25 interlaced (like PAL) or progressive; or even 24-progressive (just like film). HD, if shot in 24-progressive, scans nearly perfectly to film without the need of a frame or field conversion process. Other issues remain though, based on the different resolutions, [[color space]]s, and compression schemes that exist in the high-definition video world.\n\n==Film-out of computer graphics and animation==\n\nArtists working with CGI-[[Computer-generated imagery]] [[animation]] [[computer]]s create pictures frame by frame. Once the finished product is done, the frames are outputted, normally in a [[DPX]] file. These picture data files can then be put on to [[film]] using a [[film recorder]] for film out. [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] computers started the high-end CGI-[[Computer-generated imagery]] animation systems, but with faster computers and the growth of [[Linux]]-based systems, many others are on the market now. ''[[Toy Story]]'', and ''[[Tarzan]]'' are two samples of movies which were made in CGI and then film-out. The most CGI work is done in 2K [[Display resolution]] files (about the size of [[QXGA]]), but 4K [[Display resolution]] is on the rise. A 2K movie requires a [[Storage Area Network]] storage several [[terabytes]] in size to be properly stored and played out.\n\nComputer graphics files are handled the same way but in single frames and may use [[DPX]], [[TIFF]] or other [[file format]]s.\n\n==Film-out of digital intermediate==\n\nFilm-out-[[film recorder|recording]] is the last step of [[digital intermediate]] work flow. [[DPX]] files that were scanned on a [[motion picture film scanner]] are stored on a [[storage area network]] (often abbreviated as \"SAN\"). The scanned DPX footage is edited and composited-[[special effect|FX]] on [[workstation]]s, then mastered back on film. [[Film restoration]] is also done this way.\n\n==Film-out of images for the graphic design and print industries==\n\nThe days of [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]] shooting [[35mm movie film|35mm]] [[film]] are almost gone.  [[Digital camera]]s can now shoot all the images needed, storing them as files (e.g. [[JPG|JPEG]], [[DPX]] or another [[Image file formats|format]]) that are readily [[Editing#Print media|edited]] prior to use.  Once the final [[Copy (written)|copy]] is approved, it can be filmed out for [[publishing]].  Digital stills are not the only way to  get pictures used in the graphic design and print industries.  [[Motion picture film scanner|Film scanners]] and [[computer-generated imagery|computer graphics programs]] are also common sources for graphic design and print industries.\n\n==Types of Film Out Devices==\n*[[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] recorder. Camera and a special [[TV]] display\n**[[Kinescope]] \u2013 early type\n*[[Electronic Video Recording]] or EVR \u2013 early type\n*[[Film recorder#History|EBR]] [[Electron Beam Film Recorder]] 16&nbsp;mm by 3M\n* Laser film recorder, like [[Kodak]]'s high-end Lightning II recorder and [[Arri]]'s [[Arrilaser]].\n* [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] Film recorder, like Cinevation's real-time [[Cinevator]].\n\n==History==\nLately it has become possible to transfer video images, including films scanned at high resolution, back to film stocks by making a [[digital intermediate]], which can then be recorded out to fine-grain film intermediate with a laser film printer. The first major live-action film to use this process entirely was ''[[O Brother Where Art Thou]]'', done by Kodak's Cinesite division in Hollywood in the spring of 2000. Prior to this, the video master was transferred from tape to film through one of several methods: CRT recorder, laser film printer, [[Kinescope]], or [[electron beam recorder]] (EBR). Theater performances have been preserved with Kinescope for many years \u2013 the 1964 [[New York, New York|New York]] production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' with [[Richard Burton]], for example, was shot on video and printed as a film that was released in [[movie theater]]s using this process. [[Fernando Arrabal]] was the first to use the technique of video-to-film for aesthetic purposes, for the 1971 film ''[[Viva la muerte (film)|Viva la muerte]]'', which used heavily color-adjusted video footage only for the fantasy sequences.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081115004204/http://www.arrabal.org/emuert.html arrabal.org's compilation of reviews of the film ''Viva la muerte''].</ref>  Experimental filmmaker [[Scott Bartlett]] also utilized video footage and effects for portions of his 1972 film ''[[OffOn]]'', by filming such with a 16&nbsp;mm film camera off of a video monitor.\n\n[[Technicolor]] also experimented in the early 1970s with using video gear & videotape to make feature-length motion pictures with, by transferring the videotape to film for final release and distribution.  Films made with this process were the 1973 film ''[[Why (film)|Why]]'', the 1971 film ''The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler'', and the most famous film using this process, [[Frank Zappa]]'s 1971 film ''[[200 Motels]]'', which was originally shot on [[2 inch Quadruplex videotape]], and then transferred to film by Technicolor, being the first independent film originally to be shot on videotape and distributed theatrically in 35&nbsp;mm.\n\nAlso, countless educational, medical, industrial, and promotional videotapes produced from the late 1950s up to the mid-1980s were also transferred to film stock (usually 16&nbsp;mm film) for widespread distribution, using either an EBR or CRT recorder.  This was done due to [[VCR]]s and [[VTR]]s then not being commonplace in most schools, hospitals, boardrooms, and other institutional settings, due to their high cost and the multitudes of proprietary (and incompatible) open-reel, cartridge, & cassette videotape formats in the early years of industrial-market videotape recorders starting in the mid-to-late 1960s.  But 16&nbsp;mm projectors were widely available at the time in such settings, making distribution of such video productions on 16&nbsp;mm film more practical.  One company that specialized in the transfer of videotape-originated programming to 16mm film in the 1970s and 1980s was [[Image Transform]], a company that specialized in and developed its own technologies for video-to-film transfer.  Such transfers were the case until the mid-1980s, when the VCR became affordable enough (and much more standardized in the form of [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]]) to be adopted in such institutional settings on a widespread basis.\n\n[[Digital video]] equipment has made this approach easier; theatrical-release documentaries and features originated on video are now being produced this way. [[High-definition video|High Definition]] video became popular in the early 2000s by pioneering filmmakers like [[George Lucas]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]], who used HD video cameras (such as the [[Sony]] [[HDW-F900]]) to capture images for popular movies like ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''Spy Kids 2'', respectively, both released in 2002.\n\n[[Independent film]]makers, especially those participating in the [[Dogme]] movement of filmmaking, have also shot their films on [[MiniDV]] videotape, to be transferred to 35&nbsp;mm film stock for theatrical release.  Some examples of independent movies being shot on videotape are [[Lone Scherfig]]'s ''[[Italian For Beginners]]'' (a Dogme film), [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Full Frontal (film)|Full Frontal]]'' (which was shot on [[PAL]]-standard MiniDV gear in the normally [[NTSC]]-prevalent [[United States|US]], due to its higher resolution of 625 lines and frame rate of 25 frame/s (as opposed to NTSC's 525 line resolution and 30 frame/s frame rate), more closely matching film's 24 frame/s), and [[Mike Figgis]]' ''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]''.  Initially due to budgetary concerns, Filmmaker [[Rob Nilsson]] shot his feature drama \"Signal 7\" in 1984 using Sony portable [[U-matic]] format videocassette decks paired with [[Ikegami Tsushinki|Ikegami]] HL-79 3-tube broadcast video cameras (a setup comparable to [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG]] systems used by broadcast television stations at the time).   The video hardware & taped footage took the place of the traditional cinema camera and it's negatives, which were edited in post-production and transferred to 35mm film for theatrical release & exhibition.  Nilsson liked the visual look of video-to-film transfer, and shot several other of his films the same way.\n\n[[Arrilaser]] [[film recorder]]s are also used for film-out.\n\n[[Image:Arrilaser film recorder.jpg|thumb|Arrilaser Film Recorder]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[3D LUT]]\n*[[digital intermediate]]\n*[[Film recorder]]\n*[[Film scanner]]\n*[[Hard disk recorder]]\n*[[post production]]\n*[[Tape-out]]\n*[[Telecine]]\n*[[Virtual telecine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://bboptics.com/ BB Optics]\n*[http://www.efilm.com/ Efilm]\n*[http://www.swisseffects.ch Swiss Effects]\n*[http://www.filmout.com Filmout Express]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060214133437/http://www.ascentmedia.com/ Ascent Media]\n*[http://www.lasergraphics.com Motion picture film scanning and recording systems]\n*[http://www.cinevation.net Cinevation]\n\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Film and video terminology]]\n[[Category:Computer graphics]]\n", "text_old": "{{expert-subject|date=December 2009}}\n'''Film-out''' is the process in the [[computer graphics]], [[video production]] and [[filmmaking]] disciplines of transferring images or [[animation]] from [[videotape]] or digital files to a traditional [[film print]]. \"Film-out\" is a broad term that encompasses the conversion of frame rates, color correction, as well as the actual printing, also called scanning or [[film recorder|recording]].\n\nThe film-out process is different depending on the regional standard of the master videotape in question \u2013 [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]] \u2013 or likewise on the several emerging region-independent formats of [[High-definition video|high definition]] video (HD video); thus each type is covered separately, taking into account regional film-out industries, methods and technical considerations.\n\n==Film-out of live action video==\nMany modern [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and low-budget films are shot on videotape or other  [[digital video]] media, instead of [[film stock]], and completed as digital video.  [[Video production]] means substantially lower costs than [[16 mm]] or [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] film production on all levels. Until recently, the relatively low cost of video ended when the issue of a theatrical presentation was raised, which required a print for [[Movie projector|film projection]]. With the growing presence of digital projection, this is becoming less of a factor.\n\n===Standard definition (SD) video===\nFilm-out of [[SD video|standard-definition video]] \u2013 or any source that has an incompatible frame rate \u2013 is the up-conversion of video media to film for theatrical viewing. The video-to-film conversion process consists of two major steps: first, the conversion of video into digital \"film frames\" which are then stored on a computer or on HD videotape; and secondly, the printing of these digital \"film frames\" onto actual film. To understand these two steps, it is important to understand how video and film differ.\n\nFilm (sound film, at least) has remained unchanged for almost a century and creates the illusion of moving images through the rapid projection of still images, \"frames\", upon a screen, typically 24 per second. Traditional [[interlaced]] [[SD video]] has no real frame rate, (though the term \"frame\" is applied to video, it has a different meaning). Instead, video consists of a very fast succession of horizontal lines that continually cascade down the television screen \u2013 streaming top to bottom, before jumping back to the top and then streaming down to the bottom again, repeatedly, almost 60 alternating screen-fulls every second for NTSC, or exactly 50 such screen-fulls per second for PAL and SECAM. Since visual movement in video is infused in this continuous cascade of scans lines, there is no discrete image or real \"frame\" that can be identified at any one time. Therefore, when transferring video to film, it is necessary to \"invent\" individual film frames, 24 for every second of elapsed time. The bulk of the work done by a film-out company is this first step, creating film frames out of the stream of interlaced video.\n\nEach company employs its own (often proprietary) technology for turning interlaced video into high-resolution digital video files of 24 discrete images every second, called 24 progressive video or 24p. The technology must filter out all the visually unappealing artifacting that results from the inherent mismatch between video and film movement. Moreover, the conversion process usually requires human intervention at every edit point of a video program, so that each type of scene can be calibrated for maximum visual quality. The use of archival footage in video especially calls for extra attention.\n\nStep two, the scanning to film, is the rote part of the process. This is the mechanical step where lasers print each of the newly created frames of the 24p video, stored on computer files or HD videotape, onto rolls of film.\n\nMost companies that do film-out, do all the stages of the process themselves for a lump sum.

West of the Moselle, in a dale, lies Kaimt, as does Barl, whose elevation is 100&nbsp;m higher.\n\n==History==\nZell was founded by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] sometime later than AD&nbsp;70. The outlying centre of Kaimt had its first documentary mention in 732 or 733. In 1222, Zell was granted town rights. Beginning in 1332, it was an [[Electorate of Trier|Electoral-Trier]] town and until 1794 the seat of an Electoral-Trier ''Ober[[Amt (country subdivision)|amt]]''. With the occupation of the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank by [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] troops in 1794, the town became [[France|French]]. In 1814 Zell was assigned to the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Fires in 1848 and 1857 destroyed a great deal of the Old Town. Since 1946, the town has been part of the then newly founded [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In 1950 came the amalgamation of Kaimt. Until 1969, Zell was the district seat of the now abolished district of the same name. In the course of administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], this was merged with the neighbouring district to form the district of Cochem-Zell, whose seat is at Cochem. Along with the loss of the district seat also came the loss of many other centres of authority and various other institutions. On 7 June 1969 came the amalgamation of Merl. The town has also distinguished itself with the establishment of many businesses, particularly in the outlying centre of Barl up in the heights.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Town council===\nThe local council has 20 members .The elections in May 2014 showed the following results.\n<ref>[http://www.wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2014/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/1350509200.html Der Landeswahlleiter Rheinland-Pfalz: Kommunalwahl 2014, Stadt- und Gemeinderatswahlen]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"300\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n!

The keys are [[Saint Peter]]\u2019s attribute, thus representing the town\u2019s and the church\u2019s patron saint. Also, there once stood on the Petersberg (mountain, now called Marienburg) a church consecrated to Saint Peter.<ref>Alfons Friderichs: ''Wappenbuch des Landkreises Cochem-Zell'', Zell/Mosel, Selbstverlag, 2001 {{ISBN|3-00-008064-3}}</ref>\n\n===Town partnerships===\nZell fosters partnerships with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Cr\u00e9py-en-Valois]], [[Oise]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|BEL}} [[Antoing]], [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Belgium]]\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Triptis]], [[Saale-Orla-Kreis]], [[Thuringia]]\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n=== Theatre ===\nTheatre group ''K\u00e4tz''\n\n===Museums===\nThe town hall houses a local history museum with many exhibits from the town\u2019s history, [[winegrowing]] and traditional crafts.\n\n===Buildings===\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:\n\n====Zell (main centre)====\n[[File:Zell01.jpg|thumb|Zell (Mosel), Balduinstra\u00dfe: Katholische Kirche St. Peter und Paul]]\n* [[Saint Peter]]\u2019s and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul\u2019s]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Church (''Kirche St. Peter und Paul''), Balduinstra\u00dfe \u2013 [[aisleless church]], 1786-1792\n* Town Wall \u2013 six-floor \"Bachturm\" (tower), converted to a gate tower in 1899, inside the tower a ''Heiligenh\u00e4uschen'' (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints), [[piet\u00e0]], 18th century; before the tower a graveyard: [[wayside cross]] marked 1741, three grave crosses marked 1632, 1643 and 1805 as well as three-floor \"Pulverturm\" (tower), \"tail cupola\" after 1689; on Hauptstra\u00dfe remnants of a gateway arch\n* Am Bahnhof 1 \u2013 old [[railway station]]; building with half-hipped roof, partly [[Timber framing|timber-frame]], one-floor timber-frame additions, tower, about 1900\n* At Balduinstra\u00dfe 23 \u2013 richly sculpted portal walls, about 1910\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 32 \u2013 three-floor plastered building, 1849, with nine [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] [[tracery]] windows\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 44 \u2013 Town Hall (''Rathaus''); two-winged brick building, corner tower, 1881\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 69 \u2013 three-floor [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] plastered building, about 1900\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 105 \u2013 three-floor [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicist]] plastered building, [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] and [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque Revival]], about 1910\n* Brandenburg 32 \u2013 brick villa with hipped roof, [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]], 1896\u20131897\n* At Corray 4 \u2013 headsman's cross, marked 1782\n* Before Corray 13 \u2013 Johannesbrunnen (fountain)\n* Corray 20 \u2013 Late Historicist brick building, partly timber-frame, [[mansard roof]], about 1900\n* Corray 51 \u2013 plastered building, about 1910/20\n* Cuxborn 8 \u2013 three-floor timber-frame house, partly solid, plastered, marked 1770; [[piet\u00e0]]\n* Jakobstra\u00dfe \u2013 Old Graveyard (''Alter Friedhof''): cross, 19th century; whole complex\n* Marktstra\u00dfe/corner of Balduinstra\u00dfe \u2013 ''Schwarze Katz'' (\"Black Cat\") fountain; [[basalt]], 1936\n* Between Moselpromenade 29 and 33 \u2013 gatelike linking bridge; Baroque Revival plastered building, marked 1904/08\n* Moselpromenade 34 \u2013 Electoral-Trier castle house; three-floor timber-frame and solid building, staircases, marked 1532, on the Moselle side three-floor solid building, 16th century\n* At R\u00f6merstra\u00dfe 48 \u2013 hearth heating plate, 15th century\n* R\u00f6merstra\u00dfe 64 \u2013 three-floor Late Historicist timber-frame house, partly solid, half-hipped roof, [[staircase tower]], early 20th century\n* Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe 8/10 \u2013 former palatial residence; Late Gothic two-winged building with polygonal corner turrets 1530-1542, architect possibly F.

The Madonna figure in the left side altar comes from the 15th century. The baptismal font on the right side in the quire bears the year 1576. Saint Peter's has a High Altar and a [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] group. A further point of note is an impressive [[baldachin]] much like the one at the Church of Our Lady (''Liebfrauenkirche'') in Trier.\n\nIn the outlying centre of Kaimt, the new parish church, Saint James's, was built about 1968; the old churchtower was preserved. It was the Palatine chapel of the former Electoral-Trier archiepiscopal estate in Kaimt. Inside is a stone endowment document, the oldest ecclesiastical attestation of the town of Zell, from about 1200, with the oldest depiction of a winemaker. There are a side altar and a tabernacle with a Christ torso from the 13th or 14th century, the time of transition from Romanesque to Gothic, probably of the Riemenschneider school.\n\nIn the outlying centre of Merl stands Saint Michael's Parish Church, until 1805 the [[Franciscan]] monastery church. The church on the thoroughfare near the Moselle has on the High Altar an \"Antwerp retable\" from about 1520. The sacristy was built with one support to a nearly square floor plan. In the parish hall, remnants of [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] wall paintings have been preserved, and the old dormitory's roof frame in the monastery wing, which is not open to the public, is said to be one of the few mediaeval roof constructions still preserved in Germany.\n\nThe old Romanesque Saint Michael's Parish Church, a [[hall church]], was torn down in 1823 after the monastery church was taken over. The old Romanesque tower stood preserved on today's graveyard in Merl.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zell-Mosel, kerk foto1 2009-08-04 11.31.JPG|Zell-Mosel, church\nFile:Zell-Mosel, kerktoren 2009-08-04 11.37.JPG|Zell-Mosel, churchtower\n</gallery>\n\n===Religion===\nThe greater part of the population is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].

Traditionally, it is mostly [[Riesling]] that is grown here. Known far beyond the local area is the ''Zeller Schwarze Katz'' (a winemaking appellation \u2013 ''Gro\u00dflage''). Winegrowing furthermore also furnishes the groundwork for another industry, [[tourism]], which is also of great economic importance. Zell is, among other things, the seat of the winemaker Zimmermann-Graeff & M\u00fcller.\n\n===Industry===\nZell is home to Zeller Plastik (ZP), an important employer. ZP's importance lies in [[Injection molding|injection moulding]] of plastic closures and packaging components; it is a member of the group [[Global Closure Systems]], a worldwide network of businesses that work in plastics. The daughter company Zeller Engineering makes injection moulding equipment.\n\n===Trade and crafts===\nIn the outlying centre of Barl, many [[Retailing|retail]] businesses with large floor areas have set up shop. Among them, the main one is the Globus Handelshof with an adjoining building centre. Besides this, many midsize [[wholesale]] and retail businesses, as well as craft businesses, are located here.\n\n===Transport===\nThe town's link to the [[Deutsche Bahn]] railway network with [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] service is through the station in the neighbouring municipality of [[Bullay]] on the [[Koblenz\u2013Trier railway|Koblenz\u2014Trier line]], about 7&nbsp;km away. The station lies on the [[Koblenz]]\u2014 [[Trier]]/[[Saarbr\u00fccken]]/[[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] IC line. There are ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' connections, too, both north-south (B&nbsp;421) and east-west (B&nbsp;53). There are landing stages for international water transport on the Moselle, and [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] is roughly a half hour's drive away.\n\n===Public institutions===\n\n====Offices====\n* ''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Zell administration\n* Simmern-Zell Financial Office\n\n===Education===\n* Boos-von-Waldeck Grundschule ([[primary school]])\n* [[Hauptschule]]\n* [[Realschule]]\n* Mosel-Hamm-Schule (special school for those with learning difficulties)\n* IGS Zell ([[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level, currently under construction)\n\n==Famous people==\n\n===Honorary citizens===\n* Georg Weimer\n* Randy Zeller\n\n===Sons and daughters of the town===\n* [[Karl Hammes]] (1896-1939), opera singer and fighter pilot\n* Klaus Bremm (1923-2008), winemaker and politician\n* Peter-Erwin Jansen (born 1957), publicist\n* [[Bernd Irlenborn]] (born 1963), German philosopher and professor of philosophy\n* [[Mirko Casper]] (born 1982), professional [[Association football|footballer]]\n* Mumford Sondheimer (1882-1935), winemaker and socialite\n\n===Famous people associated with the town===\n* [[Maria Reese]] (1889\u20131958), writer, journalist and Member of the Reichstag; died in Zell\n* [[Moritz Seider]], [[Ice hockey]] player\n\n==Further reading==\n* Alfons Friderichs, Karl Josef Gilles: ''Zell an der Mosel mit Kaimt und Merl''.

Zell has roughly 4,300 inhabitants and is the seat of the [[Zell (Verbandsgemeinde)|like-named ''Verbandsgemeinde'']].\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nZell is an hour's drive from both [[Koblenz]] and [[Trier]], more or less halfway between these two cities. The nearest town going towards Koblenz is [[Cochem]], and the nearest two going towards Trier are [[Traben-Trarbach]] and [[Bernkastel-Kues]]. To both [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] on the [[Hunsr\u00fcck]] and the spa town of [[Bad Bertrich]] in the [[Voreifel]] it is half an hour's drive. The parts of town lying on the river, the Old Town, Kaimt and Merl, are at an elevation of roughly 100&nbsp;m above [[sea level]] on a remarkable bow in the river [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], known as the ''Zeller Hamm''.\n\n===Constituent communities===\nOn the Moselle's right bank lie the Old Town (''Altstadt'') and the ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteil]]'' of Merl. Up in the Hunsr\u00fcck lies the smallest ''Stadtteil'', Althaus, which is right at the town limit, next to [[Tellig]]. West of the Moselle, in a dale, lies Kaimt, as does Barl, whose elevation is 100&nbsp;m higher.\n\n==History==\nZell was founded by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] sometime later than AD&nbsp;70. The outlying centre of Kaimt had its first documentary mention in 732 or 733. In 1222, Zell was granted town rights. Beginning in 1332, it was an [[Electorate of Trier|Electoral-Trier]] town and until 1794 the seat of an Electoral-Trier ''Ober[[Amt (country subdivision)|amt]]''. With the occupation of the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank by [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] troops in 1794, the town became [[France|French]]. In 1814 Zell was assigned to the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Fires in 1848 and 1857 destroyed a great deal of the Old Town. Since 1946, the town has been part of the then newly founded [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In 1950 came the amalgamation of Kaimt. Until 1969, Zell was the district seat of the now abolished district of the same name. In the course of administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], this was merged with the neighbouring district to form the district of Cochem-Zell, whose seat is at Cochem. Along with the loss of the district seat also came the loss of many other centres of authority and various other institutions. On 7 June 1969 came the amalgamation of Merl. The town has also distinguished itself with the establishment of many businesses, particularly in the outlying centre of Barl up in the heights.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Town council===\nThe local council has 20 members .The elections in May 2014 showed the following results.\n<ref>[http://www.wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2014/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/1350509200.html Der Landeswahlleiter Rheinland-Pfalz: Kommunalwahl 2014, Stadt- und Gemeinderatswahlen]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"300\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n!

The keys are [[Saint Peter]]\u2019s attribute, thus representing the town\u2019s and the church\u2019s patron saint. Also, there once stood on the Petersberg (mountain, now called Marienburg) a church consecrated to Saint Peter.<ref>Alfons Friderichs: ''Wappenbuch des Landkreises Cochem-Zell'', Zell/Mosel, Selbstverlag, 2001 {{ISBN|3-00-008064-3}}</ref>\n\n===Town partnerships===\nZell fosters partnerships with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Cr\u00e9py-en-Valois]], [[Oise]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|BEL}} [[Antoing]], [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Belgium]]\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Triptis]], [[Saale-Orla-Kreis]], [[Thuringia]]\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n=== Theatre ===\nTheatre group ''K\u00e4tz''\n\n===Museums===\nThe town hall houses a local history museum with many exhibits from the town\u2019s history, [[winegrowing]] and traditional crafts.\n\n===Buildings===\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:\n\n====Zell (main centre)====\n[[File:Zell01.jpg|thumb|Zell (Mosel), Balduinstra\u00dfe: Katholische Kirche St. Peter und Paul]]\n* [[Saint Peter]]\u2019s and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul\u2019s]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Church (''Kirche St. Peter und Paul''), Balduinstra\u00dfe \u2013 [[aisleless church]], 1786-1792\n* Town Wall \u2013 six-floor \"Bachturm\" (tower), converted to a gate tower in 1899, inside the tower a ''Heiligenh\u00e4uschen'' (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints), [[piet\u00e0]], 18th century; before the tower a graveyard: [[wayside cross]] marked 1741, three grave crosses marked 1632, 1643 and 1805 as well as three-floor \"Pulverturm\" (tower), \"tail cupola\" after 1689; on Hauptstra\u00dfe remnants of a gateway arch\n* Am Bahnhof 1 \u2013 old [[railway station]]; building with half-hipped roof, partly [[Timber framing|timber-frame]], one-floor timber-frame additions, tower, about 1900\n* At Balduinstra\u00dfe 23 \u2013 richly sculpted portal walls, about 1910\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 32 \u2013 three-floor plastered building, 1849, with nine [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] [[tracery]] windows\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 44 \u2013 Town Hall (''Rathaus''); two-winged brick building, corner tower, 1881\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 69 \u2013 three-floor [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] plastered building, about 1900\n* Balduinstra\u00dfe 105 \u2013 three-floor [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicist]] plastered building, [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] and [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque Revival]], about 1910\n* Brandenburg 32 \u2013 brick villa with hipped roof, [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]], 1896\u20131897\n* At Corray 4 \u2013 headsman's cross, marked 1782\n* Before Corray 13 \u2013 Johannesbrunnen (fountain)\n* Corray 20 \u2013 Late Historicist brick building, partly timber-frame, [[mansard roof]], about 1900\n* Corray 51 \u2013 plastered building, about 1910/20\n* Cuxborn 8 \u2013 three-floor timber-frame house, partly solid, plastered, marked 1770; [[piet\u00e0]]\n* Jakobstra\u00dfe \u2013 Old Graveyard (''Alter Friedhof''): cross, 19th century; whole complex\n* Marktstra\u00dfe/corner of Balduinstra\u00dfe \u2013 ''Schwarze Katz'' (\"Black Cat\") fountain; [[basalt]], 1936\n* Between Moselpromenade 29 and 33 \u2013 gatelike linking bridge; Baroque Revival plastered building, marked 1904/08\n* Moselpromenade 34 \u2013 Electoral-Trier castle house; three-floor timber-frame and solid building, staircases, marked 1532, on the Moselle side three-floor solid building, 16th century\n* At R\u00f6merstra\u00dfe 48 \u2013 hearth heating plate, 15th century\n* R\u00f6merstra\u00dfe 64 \u2013 three-floor Late Historicist timber-frame house, partly solid, half-hipped roof, [[staircase tower]], early 20th century\n* Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe 8/10 \u2013 former palatial residence; Late Gothic two-winged building with polygonal corner turrets 1530-1542, architect possibly F.

The Madonna figure in the left side altar comes from the 15th century. The baptismal font on the right side in the quire bears the year 1576. Saint Peter's has a High Altar and a [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] group. A further point of note is an impressive [[baldachin]] much like the one at the Church of Our Lady (''Liebfrauenkirche'') in Trier.\n\nIn the outlying centre of Kaimt, the new parish church, Saint James's, was built about 1968; the old churchtower was preserved. It was the Palatine chapel of the former Electoral-Trier archiepiscopal estate in Kaimt. Inside is a stone endowment document, the oldest ecclesiastical attestation of the town of Zell, from about 1200, with the oldest depiction of a winemaker. There are a side altar and a tabernacle with a Christ torso from the 13th or 14th century, the time of transition from Romanesque to Gothic, probably of the Riemenschneider school.\n\nIn the outlying centre of Merl stands Saint Michael's Parish Church, until 1805 the [[Franciscan]] monastery church. The church on the thoroughfare near the Moselle has on the High Altar an \"Antwerp retable\" from about 1520. The sacristy was built with one support to a nearly square floor plan. In the parish hall, remnants of [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] wall paintings have been preserved, and the old dormitory's roof frame in the monastery wing, which is not open to the public, is said to be one of the few mediaeval roof constructions still preserved in Germany.\n\nThe old Romanesque Saint Michael's Parish Church, a [[hall church]], was torn down in 1823 after the monastery church was taken over. The old Romanesque tower stood preserved on today's graveyard in Merl.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zell-Mosel, kerk foto1 2009-08-04 11.31.JPG|Zell-Mosel, church\nFile:Zell-Mosel, kerktoren 2009-08-04 11.37.JPG|Zell-Mosel, churchtower\n</gallery>\n\n===Religion===\nThe greater part of the population is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].

Traditionally, it is mostly [[Riesling]] that is grown here. Known far beyond the local area is the ''Zeller Schwarze Katz'' (a winemaking appellation \u2013 ''Gro\u00dflage''). Winegrowing furthermore also furnishes the groundwork for another industry, [[tourism]], which is also of great economic importance. Zell is, among other things, the seat of the winemaker Zimmermann-Graeff & M\u00fcller.\n\n===Industry===\nZell is home to Zeller Plastik (ZP), an important employer. ZP's importance lies in [[Injection molding|injection moulding]] of plastic closures and packaging components; it is a member of the group [[Global Closure Systems]], a worldwide network of businesses that work in plastics. The daughter company Zeller Engineering makes injection moulding equipment.\n\n===Trade and crafts===\nIn the outlying centre of Barl, many [[Retailing|retail]] businesses with large floor areas have set up shop. Among them, the main one is the Globus Handelshof with an adjoining building centre. Besides this, many midsize [[wholesale]] and retail businesses, as well as craft businesses, are located here.\n\n===Transport===\nThe town's link to the [[Deutsche Bahn]] railway network with [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] service is through the station in the neighbouring municipality of [[Bullay]] on the [[Koblenz\u2013Trier railway|Koblenz\u2014Trier line]], about 7&nbsp;km away. The station lies on the [[Koblenz]]\u2014 [[Trier]]/[[Saarbr\u00fccken]]/[[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] IC line. There are ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' connections, too, both north-south (B&nbsp;421) and east-west (B&nbsp;53). There are landing stages for international water transport on the Moselle, and [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] is roughly a half hour's drive away.\n\n===Public institutions===\n\n====Offices====\n* ''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Zell administration\n* Simmern-Zell Financial Office\n\n===Education===\n* Boos-von-Waldeck Grundschule ([[primary school]])\n* [[Hauptschule]]\n* [[Realschule]]\n* Mosel-Hamm-Schule (special school for those with learning difficulties)\n* IGS Zell ([[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level, currently under construction)\n\n==Famous people==\n\n===Honorary citizens===\n* Georg Weimer\n* Randy Zeller\n\n===Sons and daughters of the town===\n* [[Karl Hammes]] (1896-1939), opera singer and fighter pilot\n* Klaus Bremm (1923-2008), winemaker and politician\n* Peter-Erwin Jansen (born 1957), publicist\n* [[Bernd Irlenborn]] (born 1963), German philosopher and professor of philosophy\n* [[Mirko Casper]] (born 1982), professional [[Association football|footballer]]\n* Mumford Sondheimer (1882-1935), winemaker and socialite\n\n===Famous people associated with the town===\n* [[Maria Reese]] (1889\u20131958), writer, journalist and Member of the Reichstag; died in Zell\n* [[Moritz Seider]], [[Ice hockey]] player\n\n==Further reading==\n* Alfons Friderichs, Karl Josef Gilles: ''Zell an der Mosel mit Kaimt und Merl''.
