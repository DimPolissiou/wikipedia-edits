{"title_page": "William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon", "text_new": "{{other uses|William of Montferrat (disambiguation){{!}}William of Montferrat}}\n{{no footnotes|date=November 2018}}\n'''William of Montferrat''' (early 1140s \u2013 1177), also called '''William Longsword''' (modern [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Guglielmo Lungaspada''; original [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''Guilhem Longa-Espia''), was the [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]], the eldest son of [[William V of Montferrat|William V]], [[List of rulers of Montferrat|Marquess of Montferrat]] and [[Judith of Babenberg]]. He was the older brother of [[Conrad of Montferrat|Conrad]], [[Boniface of Montferrat|Boniface]], [[Azala\u00efs of Montferrat|Azala\u00efs]], and [[Renier of Montferrat|Renier]], and a cousin of both [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Louis VII of France]]. \n\nThe earliest surviving mention of William's epithet, ''Longsword'', said to refer to his military abilities, and differentiating him from his father, known as \"William the Elder\", is in the song ''En abril, quan vei verdeyar'', composed in late 1176-early 1177 by the troubadour [[Peire Bremon lo Tort]]:\n\n:''Chanzos, tu.t n'iras outra mar,<br> e, per Deu, vai a midons dir<br> qu'en gran dolor et en cossir<br> me fai la nuoit e.l jorn estar.<br> di.m a'n Guilhelm Longa-Espia,<br> bona chanzos, qu'el li.t dia<br> e que i an per lieis confortar.'' \n\nIt was rendered into Latin as \"''Longaspata''\" by [[William of Tyre]] in his ''Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum'' (written in the early 1180s), whence it has been taken up by historians. \n\nDespite his eligibility as the eldest son of one of the greatest magnates in northern Italy, with many royal and imperial connections and the fair good looks of his family, he did not marry until he was well into his thirties. In 1167, his father had tried to arrange marriages for him and Conrad to daughters of [[Henry II of England]] or sisters of [[William I of Scotland]] - but these failed, the English match probably because of consanguinity (the boy's mother Judith was related to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]), the Scottish match because the princesses were already married.\n\nIn 1176 William was chosen by [[Raymond III of Tripoli|Raymond III]], [[county of Tripoli|count of Tripoli]], and [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], [[kingdom of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]], to marry Baldwin's sister [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]]. William also gained the [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon]] in the marriage. William of Tyre describes him as tall, blond, and handsome; brave, frank and unpretentious, but inclined to eat and drink copiously, though not to the impairment of his judgment.\n\nWith the King's consent, William and [[Reynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] gave a grant of land to the new [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] [[Military order (society)|military order]], the [[Order of Montjoie]], commanded by Count Rodrigo Alvarez de Sarria. However, William's activities in Outremer were cut short. He fell ill, probably from malaria, at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] in April 1177, and died there in June, leaving Sibylla pregnant with the future king [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]]. His body was taken to Jerusalem and buried at the Hospital of St John.\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://centri.univr.it/RM/biblioteca/scaffale/volumi.htm#Walter%20Haberstumpf Haberstumpf, Walter.

Wolfe + 988 Sr.''',<ref name=\"borgmann\" /> '''Hubert Blaine Wolfe+585 Sr.''',<ref name=\"g85\" /> and '''Hubert Blaine Wolfe+590 Sr.''',<ref name=\"lutz\" /> among others) is the abbreviated name of a German-born American [[typesetting|typesetter]] who has held the record for the longest personal name ever used. Hubert's name is made up from 27 names. Each of his 26 [[given name]]s starts with a different letter of the [[English alphabet]] in alphabetical order; these are followed by an enormously long single-word surname.  The exact length and spelling of his name has been a subject of considerable confusion due in part to its various renderings over the years, many of which are plagued by typographical errors.

One of the longest and most reliable published versions, with a 988-letter surname, is as follows:\n\n{{quote|Adolph Blaine Charles David Earl Frederick Gerald Hubert Irvin John Kenneth Lloyd Martin Nero Oliver Paul Quincy Randolph Sherman Thomas Uncas Victor William Xerxes Yancy Zeus Wolfe&shy;schlegel&shy;stein&shy;hausen&shy;berger&shy;dorff&shy;welche&shy;vor&shy;altern&shy;waren&shy;gewissen&shy;haft&shy;schafers&shy;wessen&shy;schafe&shy;waren&shy;wohl&shy;gepflege&shy;und&shy;sorg&shy;faltig&shy;keit&shy;be&shy;schutzen&shy;vor&shy;an&shy;greifen&shy;durch&shy;ihr&shy;raub&shy;gierig&shy;feinde&shy;welche&shy;vor&shy;altern&shy;zwolf&shy;hundert&shy;tausend&shy;jahres&shy;voran&shy;die&shy;er&shy;scheinen&shy;von&shy;der&shy;erste&shy;erde&shy;mensch&shy;der&shy;raum&shy;schiff&shy;genacht&shy;mit&shy;tung&shy;stein&shy;und&shy;sieben&shy;iridium&shy;elek&shy;trisch&shy;motors&shy;ge&shy;brauch&shy;licht&shy;als&shy;sein&shy;ur&shy;sprung&shy;von&shy;kraft&shy;ge&shy;start&shy;sein&shy;lange&shy;fahrt&shy;hin&shy;zwischen&shy;stern&shy;artig&shy;raum&shy;auf&shy;der&shy;suchen&shy;nach&shy;bar&shy;schaft&shy;der&shy;stern&shy;welche&shy;ge&shy;habt&shy;be&shy;wohn&shy;bar&shy;planeten&shy;kreise&shy;drehen&shy;sich&shy;und&shy;wo&shy;hin&shy;der&shy;neue&shy;rasse&shy;von&shy;ver&shy;stand&shy;ig&shy;mensch&shy;lich&shy;keit&shy;konnte&shy;fort&shy;pflanzen&shy;und&shy;sicher&shy;freuen&shy;an&shy;lebens&shy;lang&shy;lich&shy;freude&shy;und&shy;ru&shy;he&shy;mit&shy;nicht&shy;ein&shy;furcht&shy;vor&shy;an&shy;greifen&shy;vor&shy;anderer&shy;intelligent&shy;ge&shy;schopfs&shy;von&shy;hin&shy;zwischen&shy;stern&shy;art&shy;ig&shy;raum Sr.<ref name=\"borgmann\" />}}\n\n==Biography==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|En-Wolfe+585, Senior2.ogg|{{Start date|2013|10|12}}}}\nWolfe&shy;schlegel&shy;stein&shy;hausen&shy;berger&shy;dorff was born in [[Bergedorf (quarter)|Bergedorf]] (now part of [[Hamburg]]), Germany, and later emigrated to the United States, settling in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"g85\" /> His birthdate has been given as February 29, 1904,<ref name=\"g85\" /><ref name=\"hook\" /> but he was also reported to be age 47 in a 1964 wire story,<ref name=\"goldstein\" /> and Philadelphia County death records list a birthdate of August 4, 1914.<ref name=\"death\" /> He became a typesetter according to [[Bennett Cerf]].<ref name=\"cerf\" />\n\nHis name first attracted attention when it appeared in the 1938 Philadelphia telephone directory on page 1292, column 3, line 17,<ref name=\"shingle\" />{{rp|140}} and in a court order of judge John Boyle of May 25, 1938: \"Wolfe&shy;schlegel&shy;stein&shy;hausen&shy;berger&shy;dorff, Jr., etc., vs. [[Yellow Cab Company|Yellow Cab]] Co., petition for compromise settlement granted\"\u2014with speculation that the case was settled because \"they couldn't pronounce it\".<ref name=\"shingle\" />{{rp|150}}\n\nA son, Hubert Blaine Wolfe&shy;schlegel&shy;stein&shy;hausen&shy;berger&shy;dorff Jr., was born in Philadelphia in 1952, and was able to pronounce his surname by age three.<ref name=\"gettysburg\" /> Family letterhead used the form \"Hubert Blaine Wolfe&shy;schlegel&shy;stein&shy;hausen&shy;berger&shy;dorff\".<ref name=\"hook\" />\n\nWhen ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer|Inquirer]]'' journalist [[Frank Brookhouser]] omitted the letter \"u\" in reporting a 1952 Philadelphia voter registration under the 35-letter version of the surname, Wolfe&shy;schlegel&shy;stein&shy;hausen&shy;berger&shy;dorff's prompt correction was carried by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref name=\"time\" /> and passed on to other outlets.<ref name=\"vaughn\" /> Philadelphia's business computers used an abbreviated form on the city's voting registration books; the utility company, however, when told he would not pay his bill unless his name was right, began spelling it properly, on three lines.<ref name=\"aj\" /> Brookhouser later responded by tributing the correctly spelled Wolfe&shy;schlegel&shy;stein&shy;hausen&shy;berger&shy;dorff as the exemplar Philadelphian named in the first sentence of his ''Our Philadelphia'', comparing him to another local typesetter, [[Benjamin Franklin]]:\n\n{{quote|Philadelphia, home of Hubert B.

Sometimes time limits are agreed on by the participants before the battle. For 1 on 1 and 2 on 2, time limits are generally 1 minute to 3 minutes (with 30 second increments) and 5 minutes respectively. Odd number of judges are selected to judge the battle to prevent draws. Early iteration of rules allowed judges to vote for overtime. In early years, majority of judges voted for overtime or if no definite winner emerged from judges' votes.\n\nHowever recently, the judges are not allowed to vote for overtime, they should pick a winner. The first turn is determined by a coin toss or prearranged agreement between two emcees who will took the first turn before the battle start. Written or non-written lines are allowed. Both sides can also bring props for the event. [[Filipino language]] is the primary medium although other languages or dialects can be used. [[Choke (sports)|Choking]] in any rounds increase the chance of losing the battle. The winner is determined by the decision of the judges.\n\nThe criteria for judging are the usage of words, content, performance, audience impact, delivery, and rapping style depending on judge's perspective.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news5.com.ph/top/D6951240FA74434/1001/fliptop-rap-battles-paano-pinaghahandaan|title=News5 Everywhere - 'FLIPTOP RAP BATTLES,' PAANO PINAGHAHANDAAN?|website=News5 Everywhere|access-date=2017-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThere are different conferences in FlipTop such as the Filipino Conference, Bisaya Conference, and English Conference among others.\n\nThe league has an annual tournament called \"''Isabuhay\"''. A series of matches consists of undercard, non-tournament matches and tournament matches running for a year where the finals occurred every month of December. The emcees appearances on the matches depends on their availability.\n\n== Format ==\nFlipTop has three different battle formats which sometimes combined with Freestyle:\n\n*'''Written''' - This format allows use of written lyrics along with freestyle and is now the standard format used in battles.\n*'''Freestyle''' - At first the most common in all FlipTop tournaments, this format is now rarely done and has generally been replaced by the written format. Lyrics must be thought of during the battle.\n*'''Old School''' - Is essentially the freestyle format but is accompanied with an instrumental, and is commonly used on tryouts. \nThere are also different variations of rap battle within the FlipTop tournament:\n* '''Dos por Dos''' - Tag-team freestyle rap battle. It can be Emcee or Femcee, Freestyle or Written.\n* '''Five on Five''' - Five-member team freestyle rap battle. It can be Emcee or Femcee, Freestyle or Written.\n* '''Femcee Battle''' - All-female rap battle. It can be Freestyle or Written.\n* '''Intergender Battle''' - Male vs. Female battle.\n* '''Royal Rumble''' - A rap battle consists of more than two emcees randomly attack or bash each other.\n* '''Secret Battle''' - Same as the other battles but with limited audience. Sometimes it surprisingly appeared in the day of the tournament unannounced.\n* '''Won Minutes''' - Strictly one-minute per round format.\n*'''Promo Battle''' - A rap battle without any judging occurred. For theatrical performance and entertainment purpose only.\n\n== List of events ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders mw-datatable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Event Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault\n| February 6, 2010\n| Quantum Cafe, Makati City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second Sight\n| March 20, 2010\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon\n| May 15, 2010\n| Guerrilla Radio, Pasig City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Process of Illumination\n| June 25, 2010\n| Freedom Bar, Anonas, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bwelta Balentong\n| July 17, 2010\n| Freedom Bar, Anonas, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Down N South\n| September 25, 2010\n| Friday's Super Club, Las Pinas City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 on 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| October 16, 2010\n| Tanza, Cavite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gapo de Gulat\n| October 29, 2010\n| Music Jam, Olongapo City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sabong Sumulong\n| November 12, 2010\n| Texas Cockpit Arena, Marikina City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tectonics\n| December 4, 2010\n| Katips Bar and Grillery, Katipunan Extension, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault 2\n| February 5, 2011\n| Quantum Cafe, Bagtikan corner Kamagong St. Makati City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Different Ways\n| May 28, 2011\n| Durian Bar, Madrazo Compound, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| July 1\u20132, 2011\n| Hades Bar, 99 Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | FlipTop @ Dutdutan\n| August 27, 2011\n| World Trade Center, Pasay City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields\n| September 23, 2011\n| Quimpo Boulevard, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 082 Magnitude\n| September 24, 2011\n| Quimpo Boulevard, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zoning\n| October 22, 2011\n| Quantum Cafe, Bagtikan Corner Kamagong, Makati City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gapo de Gulat 2\n| November 5, 2011\n| Jax Comedy Bar, Magsaysay Drive, Olongapo City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon 3\n| December 10, 2011\n| Katip's Bar, Katipunan Extension, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bara Ko Barako\n| December 17, 2011\n| Naic Covered Court, Naic, Cavite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | FlipTop @ Ilocos Norte\n| December 28, 2011\n| Centennial Arena, Laoag, Ilocos Norte\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 2\n| February 16, 2012\n| Club Z, Sucat Para\u00f1aque\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault 3{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| February 25, 2012\n| Feron Bldg., Kamagong Corner Bagtigkan\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 3\n| March 1, 2012\n| Teno2 Bar, Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hukuman{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| March 17, 2012\n| Orani Gym, Orani, Bataan\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 4\n| March 30, 2012\n| Teno2 Bar, Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 5\n| April 21, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 6\n| April 26, 2012\n| Skarlet Jazz Kticher Bar, Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zoning 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| May 5,13, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields Mindanao\n| May 17\u201318, 2012\n| Tagum City, Davao del Norte\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Different Ways 2\n| May 19, 2012\n| GSP Gym, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Boom Bap Friday{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| July 6, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Dagitay\n| July 28, 2012\n| Hayahay Treehouse Bar & Grill, Flores Avenue, Piapi Beach, 6200 Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Unibersikulo{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| August 31, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kataga\n| September 8, 2012\n| Kamalig Bar, Rosario, Cavite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Aspakan\n| October 6, 2012\n| Party Piknikan, Lazatin Blvd., Villa Victoria, San Fernando City, Pampanga\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon 4\n| November 9\u201310, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 7\n| December 7, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault 4{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| February 8, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Pakusganay\n| March 2, 2013\n| GSP Gym, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tectonics 2\n| April 27, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zoning 3{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| May 17, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tournament Round 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| July 19\u201320, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tournament Semis{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| September 27, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 082 Magnitude Ikaduha\n| November 9, 2013\n| Brgy.

However, in an undercard match between Sinio and [[Shehyee]] during the Ahon 7 event on December 16, 2016, Shehyee threw disrespectful lines against Sinio's wife, Bie Sarmiento, during the battle that made Sinio rebut hard by dissing the girlfriend of Shehyee, internet sensation Ann Mateo, that lead Sinio to victory. Their match was uploaded on FlipTop's YouTube channel on February 2, 2017 and went viral with over five million views within four days. Some parts of the clip were also uploaded and shared on Facebook. Sinio's harsh words on Ann Mateo received mixed reactions and it became a hot topic in social media. There was controversy when Ann Mateo's mother saw the video and threatened Sinio with a lawsuit. Because of the situation, many [[netizens]] bashed Shehyee for being unprofessional, he was also blamed for not explaining to his girlfriend's mother the mechanics of league. Sinio felt that Shehyee was not to blame and that he understood Ann Mateo's mother's point-of-view. Shehyee tried to help Sinio in addressing the issue with Ann Mateo's mother. Ann Mateo did not share her reaction about the topic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/214513/ann-mateos-mom-wants-sue-fliptops-sinio-offensive-rap-battle-lines|title=Ann Mateo\u2019s mom wants to sue Fliptop\u2019s Sinio over offensive rap battle lines|last=Abanilla|first=Clarizel|website=entertainment.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2017-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://manila.coconuts.co/2017/02/07/fliptop-star-sinio-might-get-legal-trouble-because-offensive-lines-rap-battle|title=Fliptop star Sinio might get into legal trouble because of offensive lines in rap battle|date=2017-02-07|website=Manila|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/trending/02/07/17/models-mom-plans-to-sue-fliptop-star-over-rap-battle|title=Model's mom plans to sue FlipTop star over rap battle|last=News|first=Rhys Buccat, ABS-CBN|newspaper=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==== Pistolero vs. Luxuria ====\nWhen their battle was uploaded to FlipTop Youtube Channel.

Sometimes time limits are agreed on by the participants before the battle. For 1 on 1 and 2 on 2, time limits are generally 1 minute to 3 minutes (with 30 second increments) and 5 minutes respectively. Odd number of judges are selected to judge the battle to prevent draws. Early iteration of rules allowed judges to vote for overtime. In early years, majority of judges voted for overtime or if no definite winner emerged from judges' votes.\n\nHowever recently, the judges are not allowed to vote for overtime, they should pick a winner. The first turn is determined by a coin toss or prearranged agreement between two emcees who will took the first turn before the battle start. Written or non-written lines are allowed. Both sides can also bring props for the event. [[Filipino language]] is the primary medium although other languages or dialects can be used. [[Choke (sports)|Choking]] in any rounds increase the chance of losing the battle. The winner is determined by the decision of the judges.\n\nThe criteria for judging are the usage of words, content, performance, audience impact, delivery, and rapping style depending on judge's perspective.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news5.com.ph/top/D6951240FA74434/1001/fliptop-rap-battles-paano-pinaghahandaan|title=News5 Everywhere - 'FLIPTOP RAP BATTLES,' PAANO PINAGHAHANDAAN?|website=News5 Everywhere|access-date=2017-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThere are different conferences in FlipTop such as the Filipino Conference, Bisaya Conference, and English Conference among others.\n\nThe league has an annual tournament called \"''Isabuhay\"''. A series of matches consists of undercard, non-tournament matches and tournament matches running for a year where the finals occurred every month of December. The emcees appearances on the matches depends on their availability.\n\n== Format ==\nFlipTop has three different battle formats which sometimes combined with Freestyle:\n\n*'''Written''' - This format allows use of written lyrics along with freestyle and is now the standard format used in battles.\n*'''Freestyle''' - At first the most common in all FlipTop tournaments, this format is now rarely done and has generally been replaced by the written format. Lyrics must be thought of during the battle.\n*'''Old School''' - Is essentially the freestyle format but is accompanied with an instrumental, and is commonly used on tryouts. \nThere are also different variations of rap battle within the FlipTop tournament:\n* '''Dos por Dos''' - Tag-team freestyle rap battle. It can be Emcee or Femcee, Freestyle or Written.\n* '''Five on Five''' - Five-member team freestyle rap battle. It can be Emcee or Femcee, Freestyle or Written.\n* '''Femcee Battle''' - All-female rap battle. It can be Freestyle or Written.\n* '''Intergender Battle''' - Male vs. Female battle.\n* '''Royal Rumble''' - A rap battle consists of more than two emcees randomly attack or bash each other.\n* '''Secret Battle''' - Same as the other battles but with limited audience. Sometimes it surprisingly appeared in the day of the tournament unannounced.\n* '''Won Minutes''' - Strictly one-minute per round format.\n*'''Promo Battle''' - A rap battle without any judging occurred. For theatrical performance and entertainment purpose only.\n\n== List of events ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders mw-datatable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Event Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault\n| February 6, 2010\n| Quantum Cafe, Makati City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second Sight\n| March 20, 2010\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon\n| May 15, 2010\n| Guerrilla Radio, Pasig City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Process of Illumination\n| June 25, 2010\n| Freedom Bar, Anonas, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bwelta Balentong\n| July 17, 2010\n| Freedom Bar, Anonas, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Down N South\n| September 25, 2010\n| Friday's Super Club, Las Pinas City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 on 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| October 16, 2010\n| Tanza, Cavite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gapo de Gulat\n| October 29, 2010\n| Music Jam, Olongapo City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sabong Sumulong\n| November 12, 2010\n| Texas Cockpit Arena, Marikina City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tectonics\n| December 4, 2010\n| Katips Bar and Grillery, Katipunan Extension, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault 2\n| February 5, 2011\n| Quantum Cafe, Bagtikan corner Kamagong St. Makati City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Different Ways\n| May 28, 2011\n| Durian Bar, Madrazo Compound, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| July 1\u20132, 2011\n| Hades Bar, 99 Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | FlipTop @ Dutdutan\n| August 27, 2011\n| World Trade Center, Pasay City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields\n| September 23, 2011\n| Quimpo Boulevard, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 082 Magnitude\n| September 24, 2011\n| Quimpo Boulevard, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zoning\n| October 22, 2011\n| Quantum Cafe, Bagtikan Corner Kamagong, Makati City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gapo de Gulat 2\n| November 5, 2011\n| Jax Comedy Bar, Magsaysay Drive, Olongapo City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon 3\n| December 10, 2011\n| Katip's Bar, Katipunan Extension, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bara Ko Barako\n| December 17, 2011\n| Naic Covered Court, Naic, Cavite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | FlipTop @ Ilocos Norte\n| December 28, 2011\n| Centennial Arena, Laoag, Ilocos Norte\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 2\n| February 16, 2012\n| Club Z, Sucat Para\u00f1aque\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault 3{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| February 25, 2012\n| Feron Bldg., Kamagong Corner Bagtigkan\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 3\n| March 1, 2012\n| Teno2 Bar, Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hukuman{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| March 17, 2012\n| Orani Gym, Orani, Bataan\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 4\n| March 30, 2012\n| Teno2 Bar, Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 5\n| April 21, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 6\n| April 26, 2012\n| Skarlet Jazz Kticher Bar, Timog Avenue, Quezon City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zoning 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| May 5,13, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields Mindanao\n| May 17\u201318, 2012\n| Tagum City, Davao del Norte\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Different Ways 2\n| May 19, 2012\n| GSP Gym, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Boom Bap Friday{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| July 6, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Dagitay\n| July 28, 2012\n| Hayahay Treehouse Bar & Grill, Flores Avenue, Piapi Beach, 6200 Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Unibersikulo{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| August 31, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kataga\n| September 8, 2012\n| Kamalig Bar, Rosario, Cavite\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Aspakan\n| October 6, 2012\n| Party Piknikan, Lazatin Blvd., Villa Victoria, San Fernando City, Pampanga\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ahon 4\n| November 9\u201310, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mindfields 7\n| December 7, 2012\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grain Assault 4{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| February 8, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Pakusganay\n| March 2, 2013\n| GSP Gym, Davao City\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tectonics 2\n| April 27, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Zoning 3{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| May 17, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tournament Round 2{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| July 19\u201320, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tournament Semis{{efn|name=fn2}}\n| September 27, 2013\n| B-Side, Malugay Street, Makati City, Metro Manila\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 082 Magnitude Ikaduha\n| November 9, 2013\n| Brgy.

However, in an undercard match between Sinio and [[Shehyee]] during the Ahon 7 event on December 16, 2016, Shehyee threw disrespectful lines against Sinio's wife, Bie Sarmiento, during the battle that made Sinio rebut hard by dissing the girlfriend of Shehyee, internet sensation Ann Mateo, that lead Sinio to victory. Their match was uploaded on FlipTop's YouTube channel on February 2, 2017 and went viral with over five million views within four days. Some parts of the clip were also uploaded and shared on Facebook. Sinio's harsh words on Ann Mateo received mixed reactions and it became a hot topic in social media. There was controversy when Ann Mateo's mother saw the video and threatened Sinio with a lawsuit. Because of the situation, many [[netizens]] bashed Shehyee for being unprofessional, he was also blamed for not explaining to his girlfriend's mother the mechanics of league. Sinio felt that Shehyee was not to blame and that he understood Ann Mateo's mother's point-of-view. Shehyee tried to help Sinio in addressing the issue with Ann Mateo's mother.

{"title_page": "Oval track racing", "text_new": "{{for|the variant of cycling|Track cycling}}\n{{short description|Form of auto racing where competitors duel on an oval shaped track}}\n\n'''Oval track racing''' is a form of closed-circuit [[motorsport|automobile racing]] that is contested on an oval-shaped track. An oval track differs from a [[Road racing|road course]] in that the layout resembles an [[oval]] with turns in only one direction, and the direction of traffic is almost universally counter-clockwise. Oval tracks are dedicated motorsport circuits, used predominantly in the United States. They often have [[banked turn]]s and some, despite the name, are not precisely oval, and the shape of the track can vary.\n[[Image:Martinsville Backstretch.JPG|right|thumb|350px|[[Martinsville Speedway]], a symmetrical oval, following a race.]]\n\nMajor forms of oval track racing include [[stock car racing]], [[open-wheel|open-wheel racing]], [[sprint car racing]], [[modified car racing]], [[midget car racing]] and [[Track racing|dirt track motorcycles]].\n\nOval track racing is the predominant form of auto racing in the United States. According to the 2013 National Speedway Directory, the total number of oval tracks, drag strips and road courses in the United States is 1,262, with 901 of those being oval tracks and 683 of those being dirt tracks. Among the most famous oval tracks in North America are the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway]].\n\nNotable ovals in other countries include [[Aut\u00f3dromo Ciudad de Rafaela|Rafaela]] in Argentina, [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez|Mexico City]] in Mexico, [[Twin Ring Motegi|Motegi]] in Japan, [[EuroSpeedway Lausitz|Lausitzring]] in Germany, the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in Australia, [[Brooklands]] and [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]] in the United Kingdom, [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in Italy, and [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]] in France.\n\n== Oval racing ==\n\n===Pack racing===\n[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Pack racing at [[Daytona International Speedway]].]]\nPack racing is a phenomenon found on fast, high-banked superspeedways. It occurs when the vehicles racing are cornering at their limit of [[aerodynamic drag]], but within their limit of [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. This allows drivers to race around the track constantly at [[wide open throttle]]. Since the vehicles are within their limit of traction, [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]] through corners will not hinder a vehicle's performance. As cars running together are faster than cars running individually, all cars in the field will draft each other simultaneously in one large pack. In [[stock car racing]] this is often referred to as \"[[restrictor plate racing]]\" because [[NASCAR]] mandates that each car on its two longest high-banked ovals, [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] and [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], use an [[air restrictor]] to reduce [[horsepower]].\n\nThe results of pack racing may vary. As drivers are forced to race in a confined space, [[overtaking]] is very common as vehicles may travel two and three abreast. This forces drivers to use strong mental discipline in negotiating traffic. There are drawbacks, however. Should an accident occur at the front of the pack, the results could block the track in a short amount of time. This leaves drivers at the back of the pack with little time to react and little room to maneuver. The results are often catastrophic as numerous cars may be destroyed in a single accident. This type of accident is often called \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\".<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/04/20/strategy_fish/ CNNSI]\"Hangin' Back\" retrieved November 17, 2007</ref>\n\n===Comparison with road racing===\nOval track racing requires different tactics than road racing. While the driver doesn't have to shift gears nearly as frequently, brake as heavily or as often, or deal with turns of various radii in both directions as in road racing, drivers are still challenged by negotiating the track. Where there is generally one preferred line around a road course, there are many different lines which can work on an oval track. The preferred line depends on many factors including track conditions, car set-up, and traffic. The oval track driver must choose which line to use each time he approaches a corner. On a short track in a 25 lap feature race, a driver might not run any two laps with the same line. Both types of racing place physical demands on the driver. A driver in an [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] race at [[Richmond International Raceway]] may be subject to as many lateral [[g-force]]s (albeit in only one direction) as a [[Formula One]] driver at [[Istanbul Park]].\n\nWeather also plays a different role in each discipline. Road racing offers a variety of fast and slow corners that allow the use of [[rain tire]]s. Paved oval tracks generally don't run with a wet track surface. Dirt ovals will sometimes support a light rain. Some tracks (e.g., Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, WA) have \"rain or shine\" rules requiring races to be run in rain.\n\nSafety has also been a point of difference between the two. While a road course usually has abundant [[run-off area]]s, gravel traps, and tire barriers, oval tracks usually have a concrete retaining wall separating the track from the fans. Innovations have been made to change this, however. The [[SAFER barrier]] was created to provide a less dangerous alternative to a traditional concrete wall. The barrier can be retrofitted onto an existing wall or may take the place of a concrete wall completely.\n\n==Track classification (size)==\n[[Image:West row stadium.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A dirt oval track]]\nOval tracks are classified based upon their size, surface, banking, and shape.  Their size can range from only a few hundred feet to over two and a half miles.  Track surfaces can be [[Dirt track racing|dirt]], concrete, asphalt, or a combination of concrete and asphalt. Some ovals in the early twentieth century had [[board track racing|wood]] surfaces.\n\nThe definitions used to differentiate track sizes have changed over the years. While some tracks use terms such as \"speedway\" or \"superspeedway\" in their name, they may not meet the specific definitions used in this article.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Short track}}===\n[[File:Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Bristol Motor Speedway]], a short oval]]\nA short track is an oval track less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long, with the majority being 0.5 miles (0.8&nbsp;km) or shorter. Drivers seeking careers in oval track racing generally serve their apprenticeship on short tracks before moving up to series which compete on larger tracks. Due to their short length and fast action, these tracks are often nicknamed \"[[bullring]]s\". Professional-level NASCAR races on short tracks usually use a 500-lap or 400-lap distance. Short tracks in many cases have lights installed and routinely host night races. The short ovals still form the backbone of NASCAR in the feeder series. Three race tracks of this type are also represented in the Cup: Bristol, Martinsville and Richmond. At the request of some fans on social media, there are plans to hold more races on this oval type in the future. Tracks with potential for future cup races are the Iowa Speedway built in 2006, the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway used until 1984 in the Cup, and the Memphis Motorsports Park, which had races of the Busch Series back then until the 2000s.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Mile oval}}===\nSynonymous with the name, a 1-mile (1.61&nbsp;km) oval is a popular and common length for oval track racing. The exact measurements, however, can vary by as much as a tenth of a mile and still fall into this category. Most mile ovals are relatively flat-banked, with [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] being a notable exception. In NASCAR, the 1-mile oval tracks are among the intermediate tracks. IndyCar rated this tracks as short ovals, since they usually do not run on ovals shorter than 3/4 of a mile. The one-mile ovals have lost a great deal of their former importance for oval racing. Most of the racetracks abandoned by NASCAR or IndyCar in the 2000s were of this type. These include the Chicago Motor Speedway and the Walt Disney World Speedway, which were build during the 1990th construction boom but only used for 4 years. The historic Nazareth Speedway, which was paved in 1986, was completely abandoned after the 2004 season. Physically, the Milwaukee Mile, the oldest oval race track in the world, as well as the Rockingham Speedway and the Pikes Peak Raceway still exist. However, these racetracks have not been used by nationally important motorsports events for years. There are only three one milers left in the NASCAR racing calendar: Phoenix, Loudon and Dover. IndyCar has not been driving an oval of this length since 2018.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Intermediate}}===\n[[File:Nascarvegas03.jpg|thumb|[[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]]\nAlso referred to with the general term of \"speedway\", these courses are 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2&nbsp;km) in length, but the term is particularly reserved for 1.5-mile (2.4&nbsp;km) tracks. At the beginning of the history of NASCAR and IndyCar, this oval size was not very common. Until 1990 there were only five examples: Two of these, the Marchbanks Speedway (1.4 miles) and the Trenton Speedway (1.5 miles), were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Only three of them, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Darlington Raceway have survived to this day. All other ovals of this type were built after 1994. During the race track construction boom of the late 1990s, these tracks began to be labeled with the rather derogatory term \"cookie cutter\" tracks, as their differences were perceived to be minimal. \nIn 1992, [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] became the first intermediate track to install lights and allow for night racing. It is now commonplace for these types of tracks to host night races. Intermediate tracks usually have moderate to steep banking. Almost all modern race tracks that are still used in NASCAR and IndyCar today are of this type. Since their size allows them to compromise high speeds with sightlines, especially tri- and quad-ovals of 1.5 mile length have become commonplace in major racing series that use oval tracks.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Superspeedway}}===\nA superspeedway is at least 2.0 miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in length.  There are seven superspeedways in the United States, the most famous being [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]], both {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long.  These tracks were built in 1909 and 1959 respectively.

Michigan Speeway was part of the series from 2002 to 2007, AutoClub Speedway from 2002 to 2005 and a second time from 2012 to 2015, Pocono was used by IndyCar between 2014 and 2019. In NASCAR they are still an essential part of the racing calendar.\n\nThe seventh superspeedway is [[Texas World Speedway]], which is the original \"sister track\" to Michigan. The two-mile oval, with its 22-degree banking, was the site of Mario Andretti's closed-course record of {{convert|214.158|mph|km/h|3|abbr=on}} which stood for 12 years. No major professional series have raced at TWS since the 1990s, however, the track's 1.8, 2.9 and 3.1-mile road courses are very popular with amateur racing clubs.\n\n== Track classification (shape) ==\nA typical oval track consists of two parallel straights, connected by two 180\u00b0 turns. Although most ovals generally have only two radii curves, they are usually advertised and labeled as four 90\u00b0 turns. While many oval tracks conform to the traditional symmetrical design, asymmetrical tracks are not uncommon.\n\n=== Classical geometric shapes ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" |Shape !! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50%\" |Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Paper clip oval || One sub-classification of the traditional oval shape is the \"paper clip\" oval. The layout consists of two long straights, connected by two sharp, tight-radius turns, giving the track a shape resembling a [[paper clip]]. The courses are usually very challenging, and usually offer little banking, making the turns very slow and tight to maneuver. This is the classic layout of short tracks or mile ovals. Most short tracks are paper clips. But there exist some tracks about 1 mile length with this shape, too. || [[File:Martinsville_Speedway_track_map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Martinsville Speedway]]]]|| [[File:Chicago Motor Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Chicago Motor Speedway]]]]||[[File:Ovalo Miguel E.

In contrast to the paperclip, the straight lines are relatively short compared with the curves. It is the form closest to a circle. The curves usually shows a high banking. || [[File:Bristol_Motor_Speedway_map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Bristol Motor Speedway]]]] || [[File:Dover International Speedway.PNG|left|thumb|100px|[[Dover International Speedway]]]]||[[File:Homestead-Miami Speedway track map--Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead (altered design)]]]]\n|-\n| Rounded-off rectangle or square || One prominent, but now uncommon shape is the \"rounded-off rectangle\". Pursuant to its name, the track shape resembles a rectangle, with two long straights and two short straights, connected by four separate turns. The primary characteristic of a rounded-off rectangle that differentiates it from a traditional oval shape, is the presence of two \"short chutes\", one between turns one and two, and one between turns three and four. While most traditional ovals have two continuous 180\u00b0 radii (advertised as four 90\u00b0 turns), this shape actually has four distinct 90\u00b0 curves.  When it was first constructed, the Homestead-Miami Speedway was designed to this layout and touted as a \"mini-Indy.\" However, at only 1.5 miles (one mile shorter than Indy), the track proved to be uncompetitive, owing largely to the sharp corners, and was soon reconfigured as a traditional oval. Indianapolis remains as the only major track to this specification. Tracks of this shape have been avoided due to grandstand sight line issues, slow corners, and dangerous impact angles. However, numerous private manufacturers' test tracks use this type of layout. The only major short track with a rectangular layout has the shape of a rounded-off square with four nearly identical straights and turns. || [[File:FlemingtonSpeedwayMap.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Flemington Speedway]], a square]] || - ||[[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway<br />(original design)]]||[[File:Indianapolis Oval.svg|thumb|100px|left|[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\n|-\n| Rounded-off trapezoid || A very rare layout is a trapezoid oval course. The difference to rounded-off rectangle is the shorter back straight and longer front straight. So, the Turns 1 and 4 are tighter than the Turns 2 and 3.  || - || - || [[File:Jacarepagu\u00e1-oval.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Emerson Fittipaldi Speedway]]]] || -\n|-\n| Rounded-off triangle || The classic triangular layout is rare in oval courses, too.

In the strict sense, the modern oval tracks are called tri-oval, which rather are similar to a '''D'''. <small>See next section.</small> The Pocono Raceway is a triangular course with three distinct, widely varying turns. Due to its layout the \"Pocono Raceway\" is often described with the words: \"It is an oval course, which drives like a road course.\" The triangle is a popular oval shape outside the United States. There are some triangular oval tracks in Canada, Germany and Mexico. || [[File:Sanair_Super_Speedway_map.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Sanair Super Speedway]], an equilateral triangle]] || - || [[File:Marchbanks_Speedway_(Hanford_Motor_Speedway)_map.svg|left|thumb|75px|[[Marchbanks Speedway]]]] || [[File:Pocono_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Pocono Raceway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:EvergreenSpeedway.svg|[[Evergreen Speedway]]\nFile:NashvilleSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Fairgrounds Speedway]]\nFile:IndianapolisRacewayParkMap.svg|[[Indianapolis Raceway Park|Indianapolis Raceway]]\nFile:MesaMarinSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Mesa Marin Raceway|Mesa Marin Speedway]]\nFile:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|[[North Wilkesboro Speedway]]\nFile:SalemSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Salem Speedway]]\nFile:ThompsonInternationalSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park|Thompson International Speedway]]\nFile:USA International Speedway - Lakeland Fl.svg|[[USA International Speedway]]\nFile:Milmilelayout.PNG|[[Milwaukee Mile]]\nFile:New Hampshire Motor Speedway.PNG|[[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]]\nFile:Atlanta International Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Speedway]]\nFile:Rockingham Motor Speedway.png|[[Rockingham Motor Speedway]]\nFile:EuroSpeedway Lausitz tri-oval diagram.svg|[[EuroSpeedway Lausitz]]\nFile:Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n.png|[[Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tri-ovals ===\n{{main|Tri-oval}}\n\nThe tri-oval is the common shape of the ovals from the construction booms of the 1960s and 1990s. The use of the tri-oval shape for automobile racing was conceived by [[Bill France, Sr.]] during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]]) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans to look back and forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to \"lean\" to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines. The modern tri-ovals were often called as ''cookie cutters'' because of their (nearly) identical shape and identical kind of races.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" |Shape !! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50%\" |Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Tri-oval || A tri-oval resembles an isosceles triangle with rounded-off corners. The circuits typically have a straight backstretch, while the main straightaway where the pit area and most grandstands are located, has a \"tri-oval\" curve (sometimes characterized as a fifth curve) that makes the mainstretch skewed. Tri-ovals have become preferable to track builders as they offer superior sightlines. Generally on tri-ovals the start-finish line is located on the apex of the tri-oval curve. Two exceptions are Talladega and Walt Disney World Speedway, where the start-finish line are located on the straight between the curve and turn one.  || - || [[File:Walt_Disney_World_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Walt Disney World Speedway]]]] ||[[File:Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|The [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]] || [[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Daytona International Speedway]]]]\n|-\n| Quad-oval || A tri-oval with a \"double dogleg\" is often called a \"quad-oval\". A quad-oval is very similar to a tri-oval in sightlines and layout. One specific feature is that the start-finish line segment actually falls on a straight section, rather than along a curve. The shape has become a signature for [[Speedway Motorsports]], which owns all major quad-ovals in the United States. The [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, is also an example of a quad-oval speedway, though since its opening in 1987 it has generally been referred to as a tri-oval. The Rockingham Speedway is a special case because it can be interpreted as a D-oval as well as a tri-oval or quad-oval. The front line is laid out as an asymmetrical curve, which contains two faint kinks with start-finish-line is next to second kink. || [[File:Birmingham_Interational_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|50px|[[Birmingham International Raceway]]]] || [[File:Rockingham Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Rockingham Speedway]]]] || [[File:Charlotte_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]]] || -\n|-\n| D-shaped oval || A variation of tri-oval is the \"D-shaped oval\". Similar to a tri-oval, a D-shaped oval has a straight backstretch, but a long, sweeping frontstretch, giving the circuit a layout resembling the letter ''D''. The shape originated with a pair of sister tracks built in the 1960s: Michigan International Speedway and Texas World Speedway. Initially, this design has been used only for superspeedways. But there are now some short tracks with this shape, too. For example the Richmond Raceway was rebuilt in 1986 from a 0.542 mi stadium oval to an 0.750 mi D-shaped oval. The most famous short track, which was explicitly designed as a D-oval from the scratch, was the Iowa Speedway, which opened in 2006. ||[[File:Iowa Speedway track map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Iowa Speedway]]]] || [[File:Pikes Peak International Raceway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Pikes Peak International Raceway]]]] || - || <br />[[File:Michigan International Speedway track map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Michigan International Speedway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:Chicagoland Speedway diagram.svg|[[Chicagoland Speedway]]\nFile:Kansas Speedway diagram.svg|[[Kansas Speedway]]\nFile:Kentucky Speedway.svg|[[Kentucky Speedway]]\nFile:Nashville Superspeedway diagram.svg|[[Nashville Superspeedway]]\nFile:Phakisa Freeway - Speedway.svg|[[Phakisa Freeway]]\nFile:Atlanta Motor Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]\nFile:TexasMotorSpeedway.svg|[[Texas Motor Speedway]]\nFile:Calder Park (Australia) track map--Thunderdome Speedway.svg|[[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park Thunderdome Superspeedway]]\nFile:Ovalo de Chiapas.png|[[Aut\u00f3dromo Chiapas|Autodromo Chiapas]]\nFile:Ovalo Aguascalientes.png|[[Ovalo Aguascalientes M\u00e9xico|Ovalo Aguascalientes]]\nFile:Richmond International Speedway.png|[[Richmond Raceway|Richmond Raceway (altered design)]]\nFile:Memphis International Raceway diagram.svg|[[Memphis International Raceway]]\nFile:MyrtleBeachSpeedwayMap.png|[[Myrtle Beach Speedway]]\nFile:Auto Club Speedway (formerly California Speedway) - Speedway.svg|[[Auto Club Speedway]]\nFile:Texas World Speedway-Superspeedway.svg|[[Texas World Speedway]]\nFile:Talladega Superspeedway.svg|[[Talladega Superspeedway]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Unique shapes ===\nThere are a lot of oval tracks, which neither have a classical geometric shape nor still represent a modern tri-oval in the strict sense. <!--The term \"Roval\" has been used to loosely describe an oval track with an asymmetrical, unusual, or [[rectangle|oblong]] shape, or atypical features {{cn|no google results|date=July 2016}}. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of \"road course\" and \"oval.\" --> While these courses still technically fall under the category of ovals, their unique shape, flat corners, hard braking zones, or increased difficulty, often produces driving characteristics similar to those of a road course.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=20%| Shape !! width=60%| Description !! colspan=\"3\"| Examples\n|-\n| Egg-shape || There are some tracks, which were planned as a classic ovals, but had to be built for reasons of space in egg shape.

A \"dogleg\" is a defined as a soft curve down one of the straights, either inward or outward, which skews the oval into a non-symmetric or non-traditional shape. While the extra curve would seemingly give the oval five turns, the dogleg is normally omitted from identification, and the ovals are still labeled with four turns. ||[[File:I70SpeedwayMap.svg|thumb|left|100px|[[I-70 Speedway]]]]||[[File:Nazareth Speedway Trackmap.png|thumb|100px|[[Nazareth Speedway]]|center]]\n||[[File:Phoenix-international-raceway-2011.svg|thumb|100px|[[Phoenix Raceway]]|center]]\n|-\n| Kidney-bean-shape || A Kidney-bean-shape had a unique right-hand dogleg.

The now defunct [[Ascot Speedway]] featured 1/2 mile and 1/4 mile dirt oval tracks, and [[Irwindale Speedway]] features 1/2 mile and 1/3 mile concentric paved oval tracks. Pocono Raceway once had a 3/4 mile oval which connected to the main stretch, and circled around the garage area.\n\nIn 1991, Charlotte Motor Speedway connected the quad oval start-finish straight to the pit lane with two 180 degree turns, resulting in a concentric 1/4-mile oval layout. The 1/4-mile layout became a popular venue for [[legends car racing]]. The name \"legends oval\" was derived from this use. They have also seen use with go-karts, short track stock cars, and other lower disciplines. This idea was adopted by numerous tracks including Texas Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, [[Kentucky Speedway]], [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]], and [[Iowa Speedway]] which has a 1/8 mile version.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual concentric oval facility is Dover Speedway-[[Dover Downs]]. The one-mile oval track encompasses a 0.625-mile [[Horse racing|harness racing]] track inside.\n\n==Track classification (banking)==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F003014-0010, Berlin, Autorennen auf der Avus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|41\u00b0 banking of [[AVUS]], Germany]]\n[[File:Monza banking 2003.JPG|thumb|right|300px|38.69\u00b0 banking of [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], Italy]]\nOval tracks usually have slope in both straight and in curves, but the slope on the straights is less, circuits without any slope are rare to find, low-slope are usually old or small tracks, high gradient are more common in new circuits.\n\nCircuits like [[Milwaukee Mile]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] are approximately 9\u00b0 tilt in curves are considered low slope, superspeedways like [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] have up to 33\u00b0 of tilt in curves, [[Daytona International Raceway|Daytona]] has up to 32\u00b0, both are considered high inclination. [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] and [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] are the intermediate with the highest bank, 24\u00b0 tilt.

It\u2019s a ROVAL, and it\u2019s in Charlotte. |author= C Jackson Cowart |date= 23 May 2017 |publisher= Charlotte Observer }}</ref>) is an oval track racing facility that features a road course in the infield (or outfield), that is usually linked to the oval circuit. This type of course makes for a multi-purpose track, and allows the facility to be used for both oval and road racing. A typical combined road course consists of the oval portion of the track, using the same start/finish line, and same pit area, but a mid-course diversion to a winding road circuit in the infield (or outfield). At some point, the circuit leads back to the main oval, and completes the rest of the lap. On some of the faster ovals, a [[chicane]] is present on long back-straights, to keep speeds down, and create additional braking/passing zones. Some more complex facilities feature a stand-alone road course layout(s) in the infield not directly linked to the oval layout, or otherwise using only a short portion of the oval.\n\nCombined road courses combine the high speed characteristics of ovals with the technical precision of [[road racing|road courses]]. It allows road racing disciplines the unique experience of being held in the stadium style atmosphere of an oval superspeedway. Numerous combined road courses saw widespread use with sports cars in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, their use has since diminished considerably, since most layouts lacked the desirable topography and competitive challenges of natural road courses. In addition, most combined road course circuits offer poor sightlines for fans sitting in the grandstands. Oftentimes the challenging infield portion is obscured or not visible at all from the grandstands that line the circumference of the oval track, so many fans choose to view from the ground level inside the infield - leaving the grandstands mostly empty and unsightly.\n\nMany combined road course layouts have been abandoned, or are only used for testing and [[Sports Car Club of America|amateur race meets]]. Since 1962, the most famous race continuously held on a combined road course has been the [[24 Hours of Daytona]].\n\nIn 2018 [[NASCAR]] held the [[Bank of America Roval 400]] on a combined course at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]].\n\nIn some rare examples, the combined road course layout is run in the opposite direction to the oval circuit. For instance, at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] the oval is run counter-clockwise, but the combined road course used during the [[IndyCar Series]] [[Grand Prix of Indianapolis]] is run clockwise. However the  [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Moto GP]]  races were run counter-clockwise, with some reconfigured corners to fix corner apex problems. [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] was also an example of a clockwise combined road course. Another example is the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] in [[Australia]] which combines a 2.41&nbsp;km (1.50&nbsp;mi) road course with an 0.805&nbsp;km (0.500&nbsp;mi) speedway bowl. The Bowl forms a permanent part of the road course and also runs clockwise. At many tracks, multiple configurations are available for the combined road course layout(s).\n\nAn example of an outfield combined road course can be seen at the [[Calder Park Raceway]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The Calder Park complex has a 1.119&nbsp;mi (1.801&nbsp;km) high-banked oval speedway called the Thunderdome as well as a separate road course. The road course and the oval can be linked via two short roads that connect the front straight of the road course to the back straight of the oval. As they are separate tracks, this creates a unique situation where different races can actually be run on both the oval and the full road course at the same time. Also unique is that unlike most combined circuits which use the oval track's start/finish line and pits, in the case of Calder Park it is the road course start/finish line and pits that are used. Unfortunately this configuration was only used twice (both in 1987) and has not been used for major motor racing since hosting [[1987 Bob Jane T-Marts 500|Round 9]] of the [[1987 World Touring Car Championship season|1987 World Touring Car Championship]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Oval track construction booms==\nThere have been two distinct oval race track construction [[Economic boom|\"booms\"]] in the United States. The first took place in the 1960s, and the second took place in the mid-to-late 1990s. The majority of tracks from the 1960s boom and the 1990s boom have survived, but some tracks failed to achieve long term financial success. Incidentally, these two booms loosely coincided with the similar construction boom of the baseball/football [[Multi-purpose stadium|cookie-cutter stadiums]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the subsequent sport-specific stadium construction boom that began in the 1990s.\n\n===Tracks built during the 1960s boom===\n*[[Daytona International Speedway]] (1959)\n*[[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] (1960)\n*[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] (1960; substantially reconstructed in 1997)\n*[[Rockingham Speedway|North Carolina Motor Speedway]] (1965; demoted to primarily a test facility since 2005)\n*[[Dover International Speedway]] (1966)\n*[[Michigan International Speedway]] (1968)\n*[[Texas World Speedway]] (1969; primarily amateur racing and testing from 1981-2016; closed 2017)\n*[[Talladega Superspeedway]] (1969)\n*[[Ontario Motor Speedway]] (1970; demolished 1980)\n*[[Pocono Raceway]] (1971)\n\n===Tracks built during the 1990s boom===\n*[[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] (1995)\n*[[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] (1996)\n*[[Texas Motor Speedway]] (1996)\n*[[Gateway Motorsports Park|Gateway International Raceway]] (1997)\n*[[Pikes Peak International Raceway]] (1997; hosting only non-major events since 2008)\n*[[Auto Club Speedway]] (1997)\n*[[Memphis Motorsports Park|Memphis International Raceway]] (1998)\n*[[Kentucky Speedway]] (2000)\n*[[Kansas Speedway]] (2001)\n*[[Chicagoland Speedway]] (2001)\n\n===Track built during the 1990s that have been closed or demolished===\n*[[Walt Disney World Speedway]] (1996; demolished 2015\u20132016)\n*[[Chicago Motor Speedway]] (1999; demolished in 2009)\n*[[Nashville Superspeedway]] (2001; closed 2011)\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Board track racing]]\n*[[Dirt track racing]]\n*[[Dragstrip]]\n*[[Road racing]]\n*[[Track racing]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in Canada#Paved ovals|List of paved ovals in Canada]]\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in Mexico#Ovals|List of paved ovals in Mexico]]\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in the United States#Paved ovals|List of paved ovals in US]]\n*[http://f1stockcars.com/ UK Formula 1 Stockcars]\n{{Col-break}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Auto racing in North America}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Auto racing by type]]\n[[Category:Stock car racing]]\n[[Category:Open wheel racing]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the variant of cycling|Track cycling}}\n{{short description|Form of auto racing where competitors duel on an oval shaped track}}\n\n'''Oval track racing''' is a form of closed-circuit [[motorsport|automobile racing]] that is contested on an oval-shaped track. An oval track differs from a [[Road racing|road course]] in that the layout resembles an [[oval]] with turns in only one direction, and the direction of traffic is almost universally counter-clockwise. Oval tracks are dedicated motorsport circuits, used predominantly in the United States. They often have [[banked turn]]s and some, despite the name, are not precisely oval, and the shape of the track can vary.\n[[Image:Martinsville Backstretch.JPG|right|thumb|350px|[[Martinsville Speedway]], a symmetrical oval, following a race.]]\n\nMajor forms of oval track racing include [[stock car racing]], [[open-wheel|open-wheel racing]], [[sprint car racing]], [[modified car racing]], [[midget car racing]] and [[Track racing|dirt track motorcycles]].\n\nOval track racing is the predominant form of auto racing in the United States. According to the 2013 National Speedway Directory, the total number of oval tracks, drag strips and road courses in the United States is 1,262, with 901 of those being oval tracks and 683 of those being dirt tracks. Among the most famous oval tracks in North America are the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway]].\n\nNotable ovals in other countries include [[Aut\u00f3dromo Ciudad de Rafaela|Rafaela]] in Argentina, [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez|Mexico City]] in Mexico, [[Twin Ring Motegi|Motegi]] in Japan, [[EuroSpeedway Lausitz|Lausitzring]] in Germany, the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in Australia, [[Brooklands]] and [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]] in the United Kingdom, [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in Italy, and [[Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry|Montlh\u00e9ry]] in France.\n\n== Oval racing ==\n\n===Pack racing===\n[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Pack racing at [[Daytona International Speedway]].]]\nPack racing is a phenomenon found on fast, high-banked superspeedways. It occurs when the vehicles racing are cornering at their limit of [[aerodynamic drag]], but within their limit of [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. This allows drivers to race around the track constantly at [[wide open throttle]]. Since the vehicles are within their limit of traction, [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]] through corners will not hinder a vehicle's performance. As cars running together are faster than cars running individually, all cars in the field will draft each other simultaneously in one large pack. In [[stock car racing]] this is often referred to as \"[[restrictor plate racing]]\" because [[NASCAR]] mandates that each car on its two longest high-banked ovals, [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] and [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], use an [[air restrictor]] to reduce [[horsepower]].\n\nThe results of pack racing may vary. As drivers are forced to race in a confined space, [[overtaking]] is very common as vehicles may travel two and three abreast. This forces drivers to use strong mental discipline in negotiating traffic. There are drawbacks, however. Should an accident occur at the front of the pack, the results could block the track in a short amount of time. This leaves drivers at the back of the pack with little time to react and little room to maneuver. The results are often catastrophic as numerous cars may be destroyed in a single accident. This type of accident is often called \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\".<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/04/20/strategy_fish/ CNNSI]\"Hangin' Back\" retrieved November 17, 2007</ref>\n\n===Comparison with road racing===\nOval track racing requires different tactics than road racing. While the driver doesn't have to shift gears nearly as frequently, brake as heavily or as often, or deal with turns of various radii in both directions as in road racing, drivers are still challenged by negotiating the track. Where there is generally one preferred line around a road course, there are many different lines which can work on an oval track. The preferred line depends on many factors including track conditions, car set-up, and traffic. The oval track driver must choose which line to use each time he approaches a corner. On a short track in a 25 lap feature race, a driver might not run any two laps with the same line. Both types of racing place physical demands on the driver. A driver in an [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] race at [[Richmond International Raceway]] may be subject to as many lateral [[g-force]]s (albeit in only one direction) as a [[Formula One]] driver at [[Istanbul Park]].\n\nWeather also plays a different role in each discipline. Road racing offers a variety of fast and slow corners that allow the use of [[rain tire]]s. Paved oval tracks generally don't run with a wet track surface. Dirt ovals will sometimes support a light rain. Some tracks (e.g., Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, WA) have \"rain or shine\" rules requiring races to be run in rain.\n\nSafety has also been a point of difference between the two. While a road course usually has abundant [[run-off area]]s, gravel traps, and tire barriers, oval tracks usually have a concrete retaining wall separating the track from the fans. Innovations have been made to change this, however. The [[SAFER barrier]] was created to provide a less dangerous alternative to a traditional concrete wall. The barrier can be retrofitted onto an existing wall or may take the place of a concrete wall completely.\n\n==Track classification (size)==\n[[Image:West row stadium.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A dirt oval track]]\nOval tracks are classified based upon their size, surface, banking, and shape.  Their size can range from only a few hundred feet to over two and a half miles.  Track surfaces can be [[Dirt track racing|dirt]], concrete, asphalt, or a combination of concrete and asphalt. Some ovals in the early twentieth century had [[board track racing|wood]] surfaces.\n\nThe definitions used to differentiate track sizes have changed over the years. While some tracks use terms such as \"speedway\" or \"superspeedway\" in their name, they may not meet the specific definitions used in this article.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Short track}}===\n[[File:Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Bristol Motor Speedway]], a short oval]]\nA short track is an oval track less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long, with the majority being 0.5 miles (0.8&nbsp;km) or shorter. Drivers seeking careers in oval track racing generally serve their apprenticeship on short tracks before moving up to series which compete on larger tracks. Due to their short length and fast action, these tracks are often nicknamed \"[[bullring]]s\". Professional-level NASCAR races on short tracks usually use a 500-lap or 400-lap distance. Short tracks in many cases have lights installed and routinely host night races. The short ovals still form the backbone of NASCAR in the feeder series. Three race tracks of this type are also represented in the Cup: Bristol, Martinsville and Richmond. At the request of some fans on social media, there are plans to hold more races on this oval type in the future. Tracks with potential for future cup races are the Iowa Speedway built in 2006, the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway used until 1984 in the Cup, and the Memphis Motorsports Park, which had races of the Busch Series back then until the 2000s.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Mile oval}}===\nSynonymous with the name, a 1-mile (1.61&nbsp;km) oval is a popular and common length for oval track racing. The exact measurements, however, can vary by as much as a tenth of a mile and still fall into this category. Most mile ovals are relatively flat-banked, with [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] being a notable exception. In NASCAR, the 1-mile oval tracks are among the intermediate tracks. IndyCar rated this tracks as short ovals, since they usually do not run on ovals shorter than 3/4 of a mile. The one-mile ovals have lost a great deal of their former importance for oval racing. Most of the racetracks abandoned by NASCAR or IndyCar in the 2000s were of this type. These include the Chicago Motor Speedway and the Walt Disney World Speedway, which were build during the 1990th construction boom but only used for 4 years. The historic Nazareth Speedway, which was paved in 1986, was completely abandoned after the 2004 season. Physically, the Milwaukee Mile, the oldest oval race track in the world, as well as the Rockingham Speedway and the Pikes Peak Raceway still exist. However, these racetracks have not been used by nationally important motorsports events for years. There are only three one milers left in the NASCAR racing calendar: Phoenix, Loudon and Dover. IndyCar has not been driving an oval of this length since 2018.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Intermediate}}===\n[[File:Nascarvegas03.jpg|thumb|[[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]]\nAlso referred to with the general term of \"speedway\", these courses are 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2&nbsp;km) in length, but the term is particularly reserved for 1.5-mile (2.4&nbsp;km) tracks. At the beginning of the history of NASCAR and IndyCar, this oval size was not very common. Until 1990 there were only five examples: Two of these, the Marchbanks Speedway (1.4 miles) and the Trenton Speedway (1.5 miles), were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Only three of them, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Darlington Raceway have survived to this day. All other ovals of this type were built after 1994. During the race track construction boom of the late 1990s, these tracks began to be labeled with the rather derogatory term \"cookie cutter\" tracks, as their differences were perceived to be minimal. \nIn 1992, [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] became the first intermediate track to install lights and allow for night racing. It is now commonplace for these types of tracks to host night races. Intermediate tracks usually have moderate to steep banking. Almost all modern race tracks that are still used in NASCAR and IndyCar today are of this type. Since their size allows them to compromise high speeds with sightlines, especially tri- and quad-ovals of 1.5 mile length have become commonplace in major racing series that use oval tracks.\n\n==={{Visible anchor|Superspeedway}}===\nA superspeedway is at least 2.0 miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in length.  There are seven superspeedways in the United States, the most famous being [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]], both {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long.  These tracks were built in 1909 and 1959 respectively.  Indianapolis Motor Speedway was built as a facility for the automotive industry to conduct research and development.<ref>[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/sports/autoracing/indy500.html Indystar.com]\"History of the Indianapolis 500\" Retrieved November 19, 2007</ref>  Daytona International Speedway was built as a replacement for the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]], which combined the town's main street and its famous beach. Daytona hosts the [[Daytona 500]], NASCAR's most prestigious race, while the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is home to the [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[Brickyard 400]].\n[[Image:Ims aerial.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\n\nThe longest superspeedway is the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in [[Talladega, Alabama]].  Built in 1969, it is {{convert|2.66|mi|km|2|abbr=off|sp=us}} long, and holds the current record for fastest speed in a stock car, lapping at an average of {{convert|216.309|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} and reaching {{convert|228|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at the end of the backstretch.<ref>[http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/cup/06/10/rwallace_talladega/index.html NASCAR.com&nbsp;\u2013 Rusty Wallace hits {{convert|228|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in Talladega trial&nbsp;\u2013 June 10, 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Daytona and Talladega are the pinnacle of stock car superspeedway racing, where [[restrictor plate]]s are mandated by the sport's ruling body to reduce the high speeds accommodated by their steep banking since 1988.\n\nOther superspeedways used by NASCAR include the [[Michigan International Speedway]] (2.0 miles), [[Auto Club Speedway]] (known as California Speedway prior to February 2008) (2.0 miles), and [[Pocono Raceway]] (2.5 miles). Auto Club Speedway and Michigan are often considered intermediate tracks by NASCAR due to their similarities with 1.5-mile tracks, while Pocono and Indianapolis are sometimes classified separately, as they are the only long, flat tracks on the schedule.

Michigan Speeway was part of the series from 2002 to 2007, AutoClub Speedway from 2002 to 2005 and a second time from 2012 to 2015, Pocono was used by IndyCar between 2014 and 2019. In NASCAR they are still an essential part of the racing calendar.\n\nThe seventh superspeedway is [[Texas World Speedway]], which is the original \"sister track\" to Michigan. The two-mile oval, with its 22-degree banking, was the site of Mario Andretti's closed-course record of {{convert|214.158|mph|km/h|3|abbr=on}} which stood for 12 years. No major professional series have raced at TWS since the 1990s, however, the track's 1.8, 2.9 and 3.1-mile road courses are very popular with amateur racing clubs.\n\n== Track classification (shape) ==\nA typical oval track consists of two parallel straights, connected by two 180\u00b0 turns. Although most ovals generally have only two radii curves, they are usually advertised and labeled as four 90\u00b0 turns. While many oval tracks conform to the traditional symmetrical design, asymmetrical tracks are not uncommon.\n\n=== Classical geometric shapes ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" |Shape !! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50%\" |Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Paper clip oval || One sub-classification of the traditional oval shape is the \"paper clip\" oval. The layout consists of two long straights, connected by two sharp, tight-radius turns, giving the track a shape resembling a [[paper clip]]. The courses are usually very challenging, and usually offer little banking, making the turns very slow and tight to maneuver. This is the classic layout of short tracks or mile ovals. Most short tracks are paper clips. But there exist some tracks about 1 mile length with this shape, too. || [[File:Martinsville_Speedway_track_map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Martinsville Speedway]]]]|| [[File:Chicago Motor Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Chicago Motor Speedway]]]]||[[File:Ovalo Miguel E.

Pursuant to its name, the track shape resembles a rectangle, with two long straights and two short straights, connected by four separate turns. The primary characteristic of a rounded-off rectangle that differentiates it from a traditional oval shape, is the presence of two \"short chutes\", one between turns one and two, and one between turns three and four. While most traditional ovals have two continuous 180\u00b0 radii (advertised as four 90\u00b0 turns), this shape actually has four distinct 90\u00b0 curves.  When it was first constructed, the Homestead-Miami Speedway was designed to this layout and touted as a \"mini-Indy.\" However, at only 1.5 miles (one mile shorter than Indy), the track proved to be uncompetitive, owing largely to the sharp corners, and was soon reconfigured as a traditional oval. Indianapolis remains as the only major track to this specification. Tracks of this shape have been avoided due to grandstand sight line issues, slow corners, and dangerous impact angles. However, numerous private manufacturers' test tracks use this type of layout. The only major short track with a rectangular layout has the shape of a rounded-off square with four nearly identical straights and turns. || [[File:FlemingtonSpeedwayMap.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Flemington Speedway]], a square]] || - ||[[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway<br />(original design)]]||[[File:Indianapolis Oval.svg|thumb|100px|left|[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\n|-\n| Rounded-off trapezoid || A very rare layout is a trapezoid oval course.

In the strict sense, the modern oval tracks are called tri-oval, which rather are similar to a '''D'''. <small>See next section.</small> The Pocono Raceway is a triangular course with three distinct, widely varying turns. Due to its layout the \"Pocono Raceway\" is often described with the words: \"It is an oval course, which drives like a road course.\" The triangle is a popular oval shape outside the United States. There are some triangular oval tracks in Canada, Germany and Mexico. || [[File:Sanair_Super_Speedway_map.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Sanair Super Speedway]], an equilateral triangle]] || - || [[File:Marchbanks_Speedway_(Hanford_Motor_Speedway)_map.svg|left|thumb|75px|[[Marchbanks Speedway]]]] || [[File:Pocono_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Pocono Raceway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:EvergreenSpeedway.svg|[[Evergreen Speedway]]\nFile:NashvilleSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Fairgrounds Speedway]]\nFile:IndianapolisRacewayParkMap.svg|[[Indianapolis Raceway Park|Indianapolis Raceway]]\nFile:MesaMarinSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Mesa Marin Raceway|Mesa Marin Speedway]]\nFile:NorthWilkesboroSpeedwayMap.svg|[[North Wilkesboro Speedway]]\nFile:SalemSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Salem Speedway]]\nFile:ThompsonInternationalSpeedwayMap.svg|[[Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park|Thompson International Speedway]]\nFile:USA International Speedway - Lakeland Fl.svg|[[USA International Speedway]]\nFile:Milmilelayout.PNG|[[Milwaukee Mile]]\nFile:New Hampshire Motor Speedway.PNG|[[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]]\nFile:Atlanta International Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Speedway]]\nFile:Rockingham Motor Speedway.png|[[Rockingham Motor Speedway]]\nFile:EuroSpeedway Lausitz tri-oval diagram.svg|[[EuroSpeedway Lausitz]]\nFile:Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n.png|[[Tri\u00f3valo Bernardo Obreg\u00f3n]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tri-ovals ===\n{{main|Tri-oval}}\n\nThe tri-oval is the common shape of the ovals from the construction booms of the 1960s and 1990s. The use of the tri-oval shape for automobile racing was conceived by [[Bill France, Sr.]] during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]]) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans to look back and forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to \"lean\" to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines. The modern tri-ovals were often called as ''cookie cutters'' because of their (nearly) identical shape and identical kind of races.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" |Shape !! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50%\" |Description !! width=40% colspan=\"4\"|Examples\n|-\n! Short Track !! Mile Oval !! Intermediate !! Superspeedway\n|-\n| Tri-oval || A tri-oval resembles an isosceles triangle with rounded-off corners. The circuits typically have a straight backstretch, while the main straightaway where the pit area and most grandstands are located, has a \"tri-oval\" curve (sometimes characterized as a fifth curve) that makes the mainstretch skewed. Tri-ovals have become preferable to track builders as they offer superior sightlines. Generally on tri-ovals the start-finish line is located on the apex of the tri-oval curve. Two exceptions are Talladega and Walt Disney World Speedway, where the start-finish line are located on the straight between the curve and turn one.  || - || [[File:Walt_Disney_World_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Walt Disney World Speedway]]]] ||[[File:Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|The [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]]] || [[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Daytona International Speedway]]]]\n|-\n| Quad-oval || A tri-oval with a \"double dogleg\" is often called a \"quad-oval\". A quad-oval is very similar to a tri-oval in sightlines and layout. One specific feature is that the start-finish line segment actually falls on a straight section, rather than along a curve. The shape has become a signature for [[Speedway Motorsports]], which owns all major quad-ovals in the United States. The [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, is also an example of a quad-oval speedway, though since its opening in 1987 it has generally been referred to as a tri-oval. The Rockingham Speedway is a special case because it can be interpreted as a D-oval as well as a tri-oval or quad-oval. The front line is laid out as an asymmetrical curve, which contains two faint kinks with start-finish-line is next to second kink. || [[File:Birmingham_Interational_Raceway.svg|left|thumb|50px|[[Birmingham International Raceway]]]] || [[File:Rockingham Speedway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Rockingham Speedway]]]] || [[File:Charlotte_Motor_Speedway_diagram.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]]] || -\n|-\n| D-shaped oval || A variation of tri-oval is the \"D-shaped oval\". Similar to a tri-oval, a D-shaped oval has a straight backstretch, but a long, sweeping frontstretch, giving the circuit a layout resembling the letter ''D''. The shape originated with a pair of sister tracks built in the 1960s: Michigan International Speedway and Texas World Speedway. Initially, this design has been used only for superspeedways. But there are now some short tracks with this shape, too. For example the Richmond Raceway was rebuilt in 1986 from a 0.542 mi stadium oval to an 0.750 mi D-shaped oval. The most famous short track, which was explicitly designed as a D-oval from the scratch, was the Iowa Speedway, which opened in 2006. ||[[File:Iowa Speedway track map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Iowa Speedway]]]] || [[File:Pikes Peak International Raceway.svg|left|thumb|100px|[[Pikes Peak International Raceway]]]] || - || <br />[[File:Michigan International Speedway track map.png|left|thumb|100px|[[Michigan International Speedway]]]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional prominent examples:<gallery>\nFile:Chicagoland Speedway diagram.svg|[[Chicagoland Speedway]]\nFile:Kansas Speedway diagram.svg|[[Kansas Speedway]]\nFile:Kentucky Speedway.svg|[[Kentucky Speedway]]\nFile:Nashville Superspeedway diagram.svg|[[Nashville Superspeedway]]\nFile:Phakisa Freeway - Speedway.svg|[[Phakisa Freeway]]\nFile:Atlanta Motor Speedway.svg|[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]\nFile:TexasMotorSpeedway.svg|[[Texas Motor Speedway]]\nFile:Calder Park (Australia) track map--Thunderdome Speedway.svg|[[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park Thunderdome Superspeedway]]\nFile:Ovalo de Chiapas.png|[[Aut\u00f3dromo Chiapas|Autodromo Chiapas]]\nFile:Ovalo Aguascalientes.png|[[Ovalo Aguascalientes M\u00e9xico|Ovalo Aguascalientes]]\nFile:Richmond International Speedway.png|[[Richmond Raceway|Richmond Raceway (altered design)]]\nFile:Memphis International Raceway diagram.svg|[[Memphis International Raceway]]\nFile:MyrtleBeachSpeedwayMap.png|[[Myrtle Beach Speedway]]\nFile:Auto Club Speedway (formerly California Speedway) - Speedway.svg|[[Auto Club Speedway]]\nFile:Texas World Speedway-Superspeedway.svg|[[Texas World Speedway]]\nFile:Talladega Superspeedway.svg|[[Talladega Superspeedway]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Unique shapes ===\nThere are a lot of oval tracks, which neither have a classical geometric shape nor still represent a modern tri-oval in the strict sense. <!--The term \"Roval\" has been used to loosely describe an oval track with an asymmetrical, unusual, or [[rectangle|oblong]] shape, or atypical features {{cn|no google results|date=July 2016}}. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of \"road course\" and \"oval.\" --> While these courses still technically fall under the category of ovals, their unique shape, flat corners, hard braking zones, or increased difficulty, often produces driving characteristics similar to those of a road course.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=20%| Shape !! width=60%| Description !! colspan=\"3\"| Examples\n|-\n| Egg-shape || There are some tracks, which were planned as a classic ovals, but had to be built for reasons of space in egg shape. An egg-shaped oval substantially corresponds to the classical form, however, the two straights are non-parallel arranged. A straight line is slightly longer than the other and the two curves have different radii. ||[[File:Gateway Motorsports Park diagram.svg|thumb|100px|[[World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway|Gateway Motorsports Park]]|center]]\n||[[File:Darlington_raceway.svg|thumb|100px| [[Darlington Raceway]]|alt=|center]]||[[File:Twin Ring Motegi oval map.svg|thumb|100px|[[Twin Ring Motegi]]|center]]|-\n| Dogleg || Some oval tracks have minor variations, such as kinks or doglegs. A \"dogleg\" is a defined as a soft curve down one of the straights, either inward or outward, which skews the oval into a non-symmetric or non-traditional shape. While the extra curve would seemingly give the oval five turns, the dogleg is normally omitted from identification, and the ovals are still labeled with four turns. ||[[File:I70SpeedwayMap.svg|thumb|left|100px|[[I-70 Speedway]]]]||[[File:Nazareth Speedway Trackmap.png|thumb|100px|[[Nazareth Speedway]]|center]]\n||[[File:Phoenix-international-raceway-2011.svg|thumb|100px|[[Phoenix Raceway]]|center]]\n|-\n| Kidney-bean-shape || A Kidney-bean-shape had a unique right-hand dogleg.

The now defunct [[Ascot Speedway]] featured 1/2 mile and 1/4 mile dirt oval tracks, and [[Irwindale Speedway]] features 1/2 mile and 1/3 mile concentric paved oval tracks. Pocono Raceway once had a 3/4 mile oval which connected to the main stretch, and circled around the garage area.\n\nIn 1991, Charlotte Motor Speedway connected the quad oval start-finish straight to the pit lane with two 180 degree turns, resulting in a concentric 1/4-mile oval layout. The 1/4-mile layout became a popular venue for [[legends car racing]]. The name \"legends oval\" was derived from this use. They have also seen use with go-karts, short track stock cars, and other lower disciplines. This idea was adopted by numerous tracks including Texas Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, [[Kentucky Speedway]], [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]], and [[Iowa Speedway]] which has a 1/8 mile version.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual concentric oval facility is Dover Speedway-[[Dover Downs]]. The one-mile oval track encompasses a 0.625-mile [[Horse racing|harness racing]] track inside.\n\n==Track classification (banking)==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F003014-0010, Berlin, Autorennen auf der Avus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|41\u00b0 banking of [[AVUS]], Germany]]\n[[File:Monza banking 2003.JPG|thumb|right|300px|38.69\u00b0 banking of [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], Italy]]\nOval tracks usually have slope in both straight and in curves, but the slope on the straights is less, circuits without any slope are rare to find, low-slope are usually old or small tracks, high gradient are more common in new circuits.\n\nCircuits like [[Milwaukee Mile]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] are approximately 9\u00b0 tilt in curves are considered low slope, superspeedways like [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] have up to 33\u00b0 of tilt in curves, [[Daytona International Raceway|Daytona]] has up to 32\u00b0, both are considered high inclination. [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] and [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]] are the intermediate with the highest bank, 24\u00b0 tilt. [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] is the short oval with up to 36\u00b0 (later cut to 26\u00b0 to 28\u00b0).\n\n=== Comparison banking and size ===\n<!--paved tracks; maximum banking of corners-->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  !!

It\u2019s a ROVAL, and it\u2019s in Charlotte. |author= C Jackson Cowart |date= 23 May 2017 |publisher= Charlotte Observer }}</ref>) is an oval track racing facility that features a road course in the infield (or outfield), that is usually linked to the oval circuit. This type of course makes for a multi-purpose track, and allows the facility to be used for both oval and road racing. A typical combined road course consists of the oval portion of the track, using the same start/finish line, and same pit area, but a mid-course diversion to a winding road circuit in the infield (or outfield). At some point, the circuit leads back to the main oval, and completes the rest of the lap. On some of the faster ovals, a [[chicane]] is present on long back-straights, to keep speeds down, and create additional braking/passing zones. Some more complex facilities feature a stand-alone road course layout(s) in the infield not directly linked to the oval layout, or otherwise using only a short portion of the oval.\n\nCombined road courses combine the high speed characteristics of ovals with the technical precision of [[road racing|road courses]]. It allows road racing disciplines the unique experience of being held in the stadium style atmosphere of an oval superspeedway. Numerous combined road courses saw widespread use with sports cars in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, their use has since diminished considerably, since most layouts lacked the desirable topography and competitive challenges of natural road courses. In addition, most combined road course circuits offer poor sightlines for fans sitting in the grandstands. Oftentimes the challenging infield portion is obscured or not visible at all from the grandstands that line the circumference of the oval track, so many fans choose to view from the ground level inside the infield - leaving the grandstands mostly empty and unsightly.\n\nMany combined road course layouts have been abandoned, or are only used for testing and [[Sports Car Club of America|amateur race meets]]. Since 1962, the most famous race continuously held on a combined road course has been the [[24 Hours of Daytona]].\n\nIn 2018 [[NASCAR]] held the [[Bank of America Roval 400]] on a combined course at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]].\n\nIn some rare examples, the combined road course layout is run in the opposite direction to the oval circuit. For instance, at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] the oval is run counter-clockwise, but the combined road course used during the [[IndyCar Series]] [[Grand Prix of Indianapolis]] is run clockwise. However the  [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Moto GP]]  races were run counter-clockwise, with some reconfigured corners to fix corner apex problems. [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] was also an example of a clockwise combined road course. Another example is the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] in [[Australia]] which combines a 2.41&nbsp;km (1.50&nbsp;mi) road course with an 0.805&nbsp;km (0.500&nbsp;mi) speedway bowl. The Bowl forms a permanent part of the road course and also runs clockwise. At many tracks, multiple configurations are available for the combined road course layout(s).\n\nAn example of an outfield combined road course can be seen at the [[Calder Park Raceway]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The Calder Park complex has a 1.119&nbsp;mi (1.801&nbsp;km) high-banked oval speedway called the Thunderdome as well as a separate road course. The road course and the oval can be linked via two short roads that connect the front straight of the road course to the back straight of the oval. As they are separate tracks, this creates a unique situation where different races can actually be run on both the oval and the full road course at the same time. Also unique is that unlike most combined circuits which use the oval track's start/finish line and pits, in the case of Calder Park it is the road course start/finish line and pits that are used. Unfortunately this configuration was only used twice (both in 1987) and has not been used for major motor racing since hosting [[1987 Bob Jane T-Marts 500|Round 9]] of the [[1987 World Touring Car Championship season|1987 World Touring Car Championship]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Oval track construction booms==\nThere have been two distinct oval race track construction [[Economic boom|\"booms\"]] in the United States. The first took place in the 1960s, and the second took place in the mid-to-late 1990s. The majority of tracks from the 1960s boom and the 1990s boom have survived, but some tracks failed to achieve long term financial success. Incidentally, these two booms loosely coincided with the similar construction boom of the baseball/football [[Multi-purpose stadium|cookie-cutter stadiums]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the subsequent sport-specific stadium construction boom that began in the 1990s.\n\n===Tracks built during the 1960s boom===\n*[[Daytona International Speedway]] (1959)\n*[[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] (1960)\n*[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] (1960; substantially reconstructed in 1997)\n*[[Rockingham Speedway|North Carolina Motor Speedway]] (1965; demoted to primarily a test facility since 2005)\n*[[Dover International Speedway]] (1966)\n*[[Michigan International Speedway]] (1968)\n*[[Texas World Speedway]] (1969; primarily amateur racing and testing from 1981-2016; closed 2017)\n*[[Talladega Superspeedway]] (1969)\n*[[Ontario Motor Speedway]] (1970; demolished 1980)\n*[[Pocono Raceway]] (1971)\n\n===Tracks built during the 1990s boom===\n*[[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] (1995)\n*[[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] (1996)\n*[[Texas Motor Speedway]] (1996)\n*[[Gateway Motorsports Park|Gateway International Raceway]] (1997)\n*[[Pikes Peak International Raceway]] (1997; hosting only non-major events since 2008)\n*[[Auto Club Speedway]] (1997)\n*[[Memphis Motorsports Park|Memphis International Raceway]] (1998)\n*[[Kentucky Speedway]] (2000)\n*[[Kansas Speedway]] (2001)\n*[[Chicagoland Speedway]] (2001)\n\n===Track built during the 1990s that have been closed or demolished===\n*[[Walt Disney World Speedway]] (1996; demolished 2015\u20132016)\n*[[Chicago Motor Speedway]] (1999; demolished in 2009)\n*[[Nashville Superspeedway]] (2001; closed 2011)\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Board track racing]]\n*[[Dirt track racing]]\n*[[Dragstrip]]\n*[[Road racing]]\n*[[Track racing]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in Canada#Paved ovals|List of paved ovals in Canada]]\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in Mexico#Ovals|List of paved ovals in Mexico]]\n*[[List of auto racing tracks in the United States#Paved ovals|List of paved ovals in US]]\n*[http://f1stockcars.com/ UK Formula 1 Stockcars]\n{{Col-break}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Auto racing in North America}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Auto racing by type]]\n[[Category:Stock car racing]]\n[[Category:Open wheel racing]]\n", "name_user": "Mark McWire", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnique shapes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_track_racing"}
