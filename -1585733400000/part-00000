Guignon, D. Pereboom. ''Existentialism: Basic Writings, 2nd ed.'', Hackett, 2001. pp. 101\u201313</ref> Nietzsche himself considered ''Zarathustra'' to be his magnum opus.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Nietzsche-Stein 01.jpg|thumb|right|Nietzsche wrote in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that the central idea of ''Zarathustra'' occurred to him by a \"pyramidal block of stone\" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]].]]\n''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' was conceived while Nietzsche was writing ''[[The Gay Science]]''; he made a small note, reading \"6,000 feet beyond man and time\", as evidence of this.<ref>Gutmann, James. \"The \"Tremendous Moment\" of Nietzsche's Vision\". ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 51, No. 25. American Philosophical Association Eastern Division: Papers to be presented at the Fifty-First Annual Meeting, [[Goucher College]], December 28\u201330, 1954. pp. 837\u201342.</ref> More specifically, this note related to the concept of the [[Eternal Return|eternal recurrence]], which is, by Nietzsche's admission, the central idea of ''Zarathustra''; this idea occurred to him by a \"pyramidal block of stone\" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]] in the [[Engadin|Upper Engadine]], a high alpine region whose valley floor is at {{convert|6000|ft|m}}. Nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years. He wrote that the ideas for ''Zarathustra'' first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding [[Rapallo]], according to [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] in the introduction of [[Thomas Common]]'s early translation of the book.\n\nAlthough Part Three was originally planned to be the end of the book, and ends with a strong [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Nietzsche subsequently decided to write an additional three parts; ultimately, however, he composed only the fourth part, which is viewed to constitute an ''[[intermezzo]]''.\n\nNietzsche commented in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that for the completion of each part: \"Ten days sufficed; in no case, neither for the first nor for the third and last, did I require more\" (trans. Kaufmann). The first three parts were first published separately, and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887. The fourth part remained private after Nietzsche wrote it in 1885; a scant forty copies were all that were printed, apart from seven others that were distributed to Nietzsche's close friends. In March 1892, the four parts were finally reprinted as a single volume. Since then, the version most commonly produced has included all four parts.\n\nThe original text contains a great deal of word-play. An example of this is the use of words beginning ''[[\u00fcber]]'' (\"over\" or \"above\") and ''unter'' (\"down\" or \"below\"), often paired to emphasise the contrast, which is not always possible to bring out in translation, except by coinages. An example is ''Untergang'', literally \"down-going\" but used in German to mean \"setting\" (as of the sun) but also \"sinking\", \"demise\", \"downfall\" or \"doom\"; which Nietzsche pairs with its opposite ''\u00dcbergang'' (meaning \"transition\", literally \"over-going\"). Another example is ''\u00dcbermensch'' (overman or superman), discussed later in this article.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra's namesake was the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], usually known in English as [[Zoroaster]] ({{lang-ae|Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra}}). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a \"new\" or \"different\" Zarathustra, one who [[Transvaluation of values|turns traditional morality on its head]]. He goes on to characterize \"what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist:\"\n\n{{Quotation|For what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is ''his'' work. [...] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. [...] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the \"idealist\u201d who flees from reality [...]\u2014Am I understood?\u2014The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite\u2014into me\u2014that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.|Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', \"Why I Am a Destiny\", \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\n''Zarathustra'' has a simple characterisation and plot,<ref>Pippin, Robert. \"Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". ''Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy'', [[University of Chicago]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-521-60261-0}}. p. ix.</ref> narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented \"[[dithyramb]]s\" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]'' was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra's \"abundance\".\n\nSome speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a ''finale'' to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.\n\n''Zarathustra'' also contains the famous dictum \"[[God is dead]]\", which had appeared earlier in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. \"How One Becomes What One Is: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs\". (Edition) [[Random House]], 1974. p. xii.</ref> In his autobiographical work ''Ecce Homo'', [[Nietzsche]] states that the book's underlying concept is discussed within \"the penultimate section of the fourth book\" of 'The Gay Science' (''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Kaufmann). It is the [[eternal return|eternal recurrence of the same events]].\n\nThis concept first occurred to Nietzsche while he was walking in [[Switzerland]] through the woods along the lake of [[Silvaplana]] (close to [[Surlej]]); he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic, towering, pyramidal rock. Before ''Zarathustra'', Nietzsche had mentioned the concept in the fourth book of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (e.g., sect. 341); this was the first public proclamation of the notion by him. Apart from its salient presence in ''Zarathustra'', it is also echoed throughout Nietzsche's work. At any rate, it is by Zarathustra's transfiguration that he embraces eternity, that he at last ascertains \"the supreme will to power\".<ref>''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', sect. 617; trans. Kaufmann</ref> This inspiration finds its expression with [[Zarathustra's roundelay]], featured twice in the book, once near the story's close:\n{{cquote|O man, take care!<br>What does the deep midnight declare?<br>\"I was asleep\u2014<br>From a deep dream I woke and swear:\u2014<br>The world is deep,<br>Deeper than day had been aware.<br>Deep is its woe\u2014<br>Joy\u2014deeper yet than agony:<br>Woe implores: Go!<br>But all joy wants eternity\u2014<br>Wants deep, wants deep eternity.\"}}\n\nAnother singular feature of ''Zarathustra'', first presented in the prologue, is the designation of human beings as a transition between apes and the \"''[[\u00dcbermensch]]''\" (in English, either the \"overman\" or \"superman\"; or, ''superhuman'' or ''overhuman''. English translators Thomas Common and R. J. Hollingdale use ''superman'', while Kaufmann uses ''overman'', and Parkes uses ''overhuman''. Martin has opted to leave the nearly universally understood term as ''\u00dcbermensch'' in his new translation). The ''\u00dcbermensch'' is one of the many interconnecting, interdependent themes of the story, and is represented through several different metaphors. Examples include: the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud; or the sun's rise and culmination at its midday zenith; or a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss, moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the ''\u00dcbermensch''.\n\nThe symbol of the ''\u00dcbermensch'' also alludes to Nietzsche's notions of \"self-mastery\", \"self-cultivation\", \"self-direction\", and \"self-overcoming\". Expounding these concepts, Zarathustra declares:\n\n{{Quotation|\n\"''I teach you the overman''.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?\"\n<br /><br />\"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape.\"\n<br /><br />\n\"Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?\"\n<br /><br />\"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman ''shall be'' the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, ''remain faithful to the earth'', and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!\"|''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', Prologue, \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nThe book embodies a number of innovative poetical and rhetorical methods of expression. It serves as a parallel and supplement to the various philosophical ideas present in Nietzsche's body of work. He has, however, said that \"among my writings my '''Zarathustra''' stands to my mind by itself\" (''Ecce Homo'', Preface, sec. 4, Kaufmann). Emphasizing its centrality and its status as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', Nietzsche stated that:\n\n{{Quotation|With [''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''] I have given mankind the greatest present that has ever been made to it so far. This book, with a voice bridging centuries, is not only the highest book there is, the book that is truly characterized by the air of the heights\u2014the whole fact of man lies ''beneath'' it at a tremendous distance\u2014it is also the ''deepest'', born out of the innermost wealth of truth, an inexhaustible well to which no pail descends without coming up again filled with gold and goodness.|''Ecce Homo'', Preface, \u00a74, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nSince many of the book's ideas are also present in his other works, ''Zarathustra'' is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought. With the book, Nietzsche embraced a distinct [[aesthetic]] assiduity. He later reformulated many of his ideas in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and various other writings that he composed thereafter. He continued to emphasize his philosophical concerns; generally, his intention was to show an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert \"[[nihilism]]\" in all of its varied forms.\n\nOther aspects of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' relate to Nietzsche's proposed \"[[Transvaluation of values|Transvaluation of All Values]]\". This incomplete project began with ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.\n\n==Themes==\nWhile Nietzsche injects myriad ideas into the book, a few recurring themes stand out.  The overman (\u00dcbermensch), a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power, is an almost omnipresent idea in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.  Man as a race is merely a bridge between animals and the overman.\n\nThe [[eternal recurrence]], found elsewhere in Nietzsche's writing, is also mentioned.  \"Eternal recurrence\" is the possibility that all events in one's life will happen again and again, infinitely.  The embrace of all of life's horrors and pleasures alike shows a deference and acceptance of fate, or ''Amor Fati''.  The love and acceptance of one's path in life is a defining characteristic of the overman.  Faced with the knowledge that he would repeat every action that he has taken, an overman would be elated as he has no regrets and loves life.  Opting to change any decision or event in one's life would indicate the presence of resentment or fear; contradistinctly the overman is characterized by courage and a Dionysian spirit.\n\nThe [[will to power]] is the fundamental component of the human identity.  Everything we do is an expression of self-realization that can sometimes take a form of a will to power.  The will to power is a psychological analysis of all human action and is accentuated by self-overcoming and self-enhancement.  Contrasted with living for procreation, pleasure, or happiness, the will to power is the summary of all man's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it.\n\nMany [[criticisms of Christianity]] can be found in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', in particular Christian values of good and evil and its belief in an afterlife.  The basis for his critique of Christianity lies in the perceived squandering of our earthly lives in pursuit of a perfect afterlife, of which there is no evidence.  This empiricist view (denial of afterlife) is not fully examined in a rational argument in the text, but taken as a simple fact in Nietzsche's aphoristic writing style.  Judeo-Christian values are more thoroughly examined in ''On the Genealogy of Morals'' as a product of what he calls \"slave morality\".\n\n==Style==\nNoteworthy for its format, the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the [[New Testament]] and of the Platonic dialogues, at times resembling [[pre-Socratic]] works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices. It also features frequent references to the Western literary and philosophical traditions, implicitly offering an interpretation of these traditions and of their problems. Nietzsche achieves all of this through the character of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (referring to the traditional prophet of [[Zoroastrianism]]), who makes speeches on philosophic topics as he moves along a loose plotline marking his development and the reception of his ideas. This characteristic (following the genre of the ''[[Bildungsroman]]'') can be seen as an inline commentary on Zarathustra's (and Nietzsche's) philosophy. All this, along with the book's ambiguity and paradoxical nature, has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public, but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis (as Nietzsche may have intended). ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' remained unpopular as a topic for scholars (especially those in the Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]]) until the second half of the twentieth century brought widespread interest in Nietzsche and his unconventional style that does not distinguish between philosophy and literature.<ref>\nBehler, Ernst, ''Nietzsche in the Twentieth Century'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'', Magnus and Higgins (ed), Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 281\u2013319</ref> It offers formulations of eternal recurrence, and Nietzsche for the first time speaks of the ''\u00dcbermensch'': themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards.\n\nThe critic [[Harold Bloom]] criticized ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' in ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'' (1994), calling the book \"a gorgeous disaster\" and \"unreadable\".<ref name=\"Webster\">{{cite book |author=Bloom, Harold |title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages |publisher=Riverhead Books |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 196, 422] |isbn=1-57322-514-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 }}</ref> Other commentators have suggested that Nietzsche's style is intentionally [[Irony|ironic]] for much of the book.

Even the notion of eternal recurrence is treated playfully in a number of ambiguous references to the confusion of times. That a play upon the tropes should end with irony makes the fact of play itself unavoidable but it does not leave much standing in the way of straightforward doctrines or teachings\u2014just as the higher men must surrender their desperately gleaned fragments of doctrine for Zarathustra's dances.|jstor=302845}}</ref>\n\n==Translations==\n\n* Alexander Tille, 1896\n* [[wikisource:Thus_Spake_Zarathustra|Thomas Common, 1909]]\n* Walter Kaufmann, 1954<ref name=\"portable\">{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans.

Kaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German \"most evil\" and rendered it \"baddest\", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term \"baddest\", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of ''[[The Genealogy of Morals]]'' to the difference between \"bad\" and \"evil\".<ref name=wk /> This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common \"had little German and less English\".<ref name=wk /> The translations of Kaufmann and Hollingdale render the text in a far more familiar, less archaic, style of language, than that of Common.\n\nThomas Wayne, an English Professor at Edison State College in Fort Myers, Florida, published a translation in 2003.

''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 51, No. 25. American Philosophical Association Eastern Division: Papers to be presented at the Fifty-First Annual Meeting, [[Goucher College]], December 28\u201330, 1954. pp. 837\u201342.</ref> More specifically, this note related to the concept of the [[Eternal Return|eternal recurrence]], which is, by Nietzsche's admission, the central idea of ''Zarathustra''; this idea occurred to him by a \"pyramidal block of stone\" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]] in the [[Engadin|Upper Engadine]], a high alpine region whose valley floor is at {{convert|6000|ft|m}}. Nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years. He wrote that the ideas for ''Zarathustra'' first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding [[Rapallo]], according to [[Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche]] in the introduction of [[Thomas Common]]'s early translation of the book.\n\nAlthough Part Three was originally planned to be the end of the book, and ends with a strong [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Nietzsche subsequently decided to write an additional three parts; ultimately, however, he composed only the fourth part, which is viewed to constitute an ''[[intermezzo]]''.\n\nNietzsche commented in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that for the completion of each part: \"Ten days sufficed; in no case, neither for the first nor for the third and last, did I require more\" (trans. Kaufmann). The first three parts were first published separately, and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887. The fourth part remained private after Nietzsche wrote it in 1885; a scant forty copies were all that were printed, apart from seven others that were distributed to Nietzsche's close friends. In March 1892, the four parts were finally reprinted as a single volume. Since then, the version most commonly produced has included all four parts.\n\nThe original text contains a great deal of word-play. An example of this is the use of words beginning ''[[\u00fcber]]'' (\"over\" or \"above\") and ''unter'' (\"down\" or \"below\"), often paired to emphasise the contrast, which is not always possible to bring out in translation, except by coinages. An example is ''Untergang'', literally \"down-going\" but used in German to mean \"setting\" (as of the sun) but also \"sinking\", \"demise\", \"downfall\" or \"doom\"; which Nietzsche pairs with its opposite ''\u00dcbergang'' (meaning \"transition\", literally \"over-going\"). Another example is ''\u00dcbermensch'' (overman or superman), discussed later in this article.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra's namesake was the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], usually known in English as [[Zoroaster]] ({{lang-ae|Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra}}). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a \"new\" or \"different\" Zarathustra, one who [[Transvaluation of values|turns traditional morality on its head]]. He goes on to characterize \"what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist:\"\n\n{{Quotation|For what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is ''his'' work. [...] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. [...] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the \"idealist\u201d who flees from reality [...]\u2014Am I understood?\u2014The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite\u2014into me\u2014that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.|Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', \"Why I Am a Destiny\", \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\n''Zarathustra'' has a simple characterisation and plot,<ref>Pippin, Robert. \"Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". ''Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy'', [[University of Chicago]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-521-60261-0}}. p. ix.</ref> narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented \"[[dithyramb]]s\" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]'' was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra's \"abundance\".\n\nSome speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a ''finale'' to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.\n\n''Zarathustra'' also contains the famous dictum \"[[God is dead]]\", which had appeared earlier in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. \"How One Becomes What One Is: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs\". (Edition) [[Random House]], 1974. p. xii.</ref> In his autobiographical work ''Ecce Homo'', [[Nietzsche]] states that the book's underlying concept is discussed within \"the penultimate section of the fourth book\" of 'The Gay Science' (''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Kaufmann). It is the [[eternal return|eternal recurrence of the same events]].\n\nThis concept first occurred to Nietzsche while he was walking in [[Switzerland]] through the woods along the lake of [[Silvaplana]] (close to [[Surlej]]); he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic, towering, pyramidal rock. Before ''Zarathustra'', Nietzsche had mentioned the concept in the fourth book of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (e.g., sect. 341); this was the first public proclamation of the notion by him. Apart from its salient presence in ''Zarathustra'', it is also echoed throughout Nietzsche's work. At any rate, it is by Zarathustra's transfiguration that he embraces eternity, that he at last ascertains \"the supreme will to power\".<ref>''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', sect. 617; trans. Kaufmann</ref> This inspiration finds its expression with [[Zarathustra's roundelay]], featured twice in the book, once near the story's close:\n{{cquote|O man, take care!<br>What does the deep midnight declare?<br>\"I was asleep\u2014<br>From a deep dream I woke and swear:\u2014<br>The world is deep,<br>Deeper than day had been aware.<br>Deep is its woe\u2014<br>Joy\u2014deeper yet than agony:<br>Woe implores: Go!<br>But all joy wants eternity\u2014<br>Wants deep, wants deep eternity.\"}}\n\nAnother singular feature of ''Zarathustra'', first presented in the prologue, is the designation of human beings as a transition between apes and the \"''[[\u00dcbermensch]]''\" (in English, either the \"overman\" or \"superman\"; or, ''superhuman'' or ''overhuman''. English translators Thomas Common and R. J. Hollingdale use ''superman'', while Kaufmann uses ''overman'', and Parkes uses ''overhuman''. Martin has opted to leave the nearly universally understood term as ''\u00dcbermensch'' in his new translation). The ''\u00dcbermensch'' is one of the many interconnecting, interdependent themes of the story, and is represented through several different metaphors. Examples include: the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud; or the sun's rise and culmination at its midday zenith; or a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss, moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the ''\u00dcbermensch''.\n\nThe symbol of the ''\u00dcbermensch'' also alludes to Nietzsche's notions of \"self-mastery\", \"self-cultivation\", \"self-direction\", and \"self-overcoming\". Expounding these concepts, Zarathustra declares:\n\n{{Quotation|\n\"''I teach you the overman''.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?\"\n<br /><br />\"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape.\"\n<br /><br />\n\"Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?\"\n<br /><br />\"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman ''shall be'' the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, ''remain faithful to the earth'', and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!\"|''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', Prologue, \u00a73, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nThe book embodies a number of innovative poetical and rhetorical methods of expression. It serves as a parallel and supplement to the various philosophical ideas present in Nietzsche's body of work. He has, however, said that \"among my writings my '''Zarathustra''' stands to my mind by itself\" (''Ecce Homo'', Preface, sec. 4, Kaufmann). Emphasizing its centrality and its status as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', Nietzsche stated that:\n\n{{Quotation|With [''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''] I have given mankind the greatest present that has ever been made to it so far. This book, with a voice bridging centuries, is not only the highest book there is, the book that is truly characterized by the air of the heights\u2014the whole fact of man lies ''beneath'' it at a tremendous distance\u2014it is also the ''deepest'', born out of the innermost wealth of truth, an inexhaustible well to which no pail descends without coming up again filled with gold and goodness.|''Ecce Homo'', Preface, \u00a74, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}\n\nSince many of the book's ideas are also present in his other works, ''Zarathustra'' is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought. With the book, Nietzsche embraced a distinct [[aesthetic]] assiduity. He later reformulated many of his ideas in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and various other writings that he composed thereafter. He continued to emphasize his philosophical concerns; generally, his intention was to show an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert \"[[nihilism]]\" in all of its varied forms.\n\nOther aspects of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' relate to Nietzsche's proposed \"[[Transvaluation of values|Transvaluation of All Values]]\". This incomplete project began with ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.\n\n==Themes==\nWhile Nietzsche injects myriad ideas into the book, a few recurring themes stand out.  The overman (\u00dcbermensch), a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power, is an almost omnipresent idea in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.  Man as a race is merely a bridge between animals and the overman.\n\nThe [[eternal recurrence]], found elsewhere in Nietzsche's writing, is also mentioned.  \"Eternal recurrence\" is the possibility that all events in one's life will happen again and again, infinitely.  The embrace of all of life's horrors and pleasures alike shows a deference and acceptance of fate, or ''Amor Fati''.  The love and acceptance of one's path in life is a defining characteristic of the overman.  Faced with the knowledge that he would repeat every action that he has taken, an overman would be elated as he has no regrets and loves life.  Opting to change any decision or event in one's life would indicate the presence of resentment or fear; contradistinctly the overman is characterized by courage and a Dionysian spirit.\n\nThe [[will to power]] is the fundamental component of the human identity.  Everything we do is an expression of self-realization that can sometimes take a form of a will to power.  The will to power is a psychological analysis of all human action and is accentuated by self-overcoming and self-enhancement.  Contrasted with living for procreation, pleasure, or happiness, the will to power is the summary of all man's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it.\n\nMany [[criticisms of Christianity]] can be found in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', in particular Christian values of good and evil and its belief in an afterlife.  The basis for his critique of Christianity lies in the perceived squandering of our earthly lives in pursuit of a perfect afterlife, of which there is no evidence.  This empiricist view (denial of afterlife) is not fully examined in a rational argument in the text, but taken as a simple fact in Nietzsche's aphoristic writing style.  Judeo-Christian values are more thoroughly examined in ''On the Genealogy of Morals'' as a product of what he calls \"slave morality\".\n\n==Style==\nNoteworthy for its format, the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the [[New Testament]] and of the Platonic dialogues, at times resembling [[pre-Socratic]] works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices. It also features frequent references to the Western literary and philosophical traditions, implicitly offering an interpretation of these traditions and of their problems. Nietzsche achieves all of this through the character of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (referring to the traditional prophet of [[Zoroastrianism]]), who makes speeches on philosophic topics as he moves along a loose plotline marking his development and the reception of his ideas. This characteristic (following the genre of the ''[[Bildungsroman]]'') can be seen as an inline commentary on Zarathustra's (and Nietzsche's) philosophy. All this, along with the book's ambiguity and paradoxical nature, has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public, but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis (as Nietzsche may have intended). ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' remained unpopular as a topic for scholars (especially those in the Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]]) until the second half of the twentieth century brought widespread interest in Nietzsche and his unconventional style that does not distinguish between philosophy and literature.<ref>\nBehler, Ernst, ''Nietzsche in the Twentieth Century'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'', Magnus and Higgins (ed), Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 281\u2013319</ref> It offers formulations of eternal recurrence, and Nietzsche for the first time speaks of the ''\u00dcbermensch'': themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards.\n\nThe critic [[Harold Bloom]] criticized ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' in ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'' (1994), calling the book \"a gorgeous disaster\" and \"unreadable\".<ref name=\"Webster\">{{cite book |author=Bloom, Harold |title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages |publisher=Riverhead Books |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 196, 422] |isbn=1-57322-514-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo/page/196 }}</ref> Other commentators have suggested that Nietzsche's style is intentionally [[Irony|ironic]] for much of the book.

Even the notion of eternal recurrence is treated playfully in a number of ambiguous references to the confusion of times. That a play upon the tropes should end with irony makes the fact of play itself unavoidable but it does not leave much standing in the way of straightforward doctrines or teachings\u2014just as the higher men must surrender their desperately gleaned fragments of doctrine for Zarathustra's dances.|jstor=302845}}</ref>\n\n==Translations==\n\n* Alexander Tille, 1896\n* [[wikisource:Thus_Spake_Zarathustra|Thomas Common, 1909]]\n* Walter Kaufmann, 1954<ref name=\"portable\">{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans.

Kaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German \"most evil\" and rendered it \"baddest\", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term \"baddest\", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of ''[[The Genealogy of Morals]]'' to the difference between \"bad\" and \"evil\".<ref name=wk /> This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common \"had little German and less English\".<ref name=wk /> The translations of Kaufmann and Hollingdale render the text in a far more familiar, less archaic, style of language, than that of Common.\n\nThomas Wayne, an English Professor at Edison State College in Fort Myers, Florida, published a translation in 2003.

BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, [[Maurice Gamelin]], also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it \"never favoured large operations\".{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=32}} With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}\n\nThe initial plan for the German [[battle of France|invasion of France]] called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=140}} [[Erich von Manstein]], then Chief of Staff of the German [[Army Group A]], prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the [[OKH]] (German High Command) via his superior, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].{{sfn|Lemay|2010|pp=98\u2013102}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}} Manstein's plan suggested that panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish [[bridgehead]]s on the [[Meuse River]] and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] in Belgium.

Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=124}}\n\nOn 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in coordination with the French First Army under General [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard|Georges Blanchard]] to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=65}} This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General [[Maxime Weygand]], appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=57}} On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces, behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at [[Gravelines]].{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=84}} Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n===Battle of Dunkirk===\n{{Main|Battle of Dunkirk}}\n[[File:Dunkirksoldier1.JPG|left|thumb|Soldiers were [[strafe]]d and bombed by German aircraft while awaiting transport.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}]]\nBy 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of [[Boulogne]] and surrounded [[Calais]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}} The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Rudolf Veiel]] built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=152}} On 23 May, at the suggestion of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] commander ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=167}}{{sfn|Army Group A War Diary}}{{sfn|OKW Jodl Diary}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}} He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30\u201350 per cent).{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=120}} Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}}\n\nAir Marshal [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] urged Hitler to let the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (aided by Army Group B{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=150}}) finish off the British, to the consternation of General [[Franz Halder]], who noted in his diary that the ''Luftwaffe'' was dependent upon the weather and aircrews were worn out after two weeks of battle.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|pp=167\u201368}} Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded.

They included speedboats, [[Thames]] vessels, car ferries, [[pleasure craft]], and many other types of small craft.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=234}} The most useful proved to be the motor [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]], which had a reasonably good capacity and speed.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=234}} Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the [[Minister of Shipping|Ministry of Shipping]], accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to [[Sheerness]], where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=198}}\n\nThe first of the \"little ships\" arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=225}} In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=199}} In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=167\u201368}} In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at [[De Panne]] and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=214\u201315}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" align=right style=\"text-align: right; margin-left: 2px;\"\n|+ Troops landed from Dunkirk<br>27 May \u2013 4 June{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Beaches\n! scope=\"col\" | Harbour\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 27 May\n| \u2014\n| 7,669\n| 7,669\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 28 May\n| 5,930\n| 11,874\n| 17,804\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 29 May\n| 13,752\n| 33,558\n| 47,310\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 30 May\n| 29,512\n| 24,311\n| 53,823\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31 May\n| 22,942\n| 45,072\n| 68,014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 June\n| 17,348\n| 47,081\n| 64,429\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 June\n| 6,695\n| 19,561\n| 26,256\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 June\n| 1,870\n| 24,876\n| 26,746\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 June\n| 622\n| 25,553\n| 26,175\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''Totals'''\n| '''98,671'''\n| '''239,555'''\n| '''338,226'''\n|}\n{{See also|Battle of Abbeville|Operation Cycle|Operation Ariel}}\nBefore the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 May to expect \"hard and heavy tidings\".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=99}} Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a miracle, and the British press presented the evacuation as a \"disaster turned to triumph\" so successfully that Churchill had to remind the country in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] comments that the confusion over the Dunkirk evacuation is illustrated by two of the best books on it being called \"Strange Defeat\" and \"Strange Victory\".{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=37}} \n\nThree British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German \"race to the sea\". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]]. The majority of the [[51st (Highland) Division]] was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15\u201325 June under the codename [[Operation Ariel]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=296\u2013305}} The Germans marched into [[Paris]] on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=232\u201334}}\n\nThe more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.{{sfn|Looseley|2005|p=}} British ships ferried French troops to [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], and other ports in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]], although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.{{sfn|Mordal|1968|p=496}} Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French]] army in Britain.{{sfn|Nadeau|Barlow|2003|p=89}}\n\nIn France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory.

The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this \"a colossal military disaster\", saying \"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}\n\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, [[Maurice Gamelin]], also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it \"never favoured large operations\".{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=32}} With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}\n\nThe initial plan for the German [[battle of France|invasion of France]] called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=140}} [[Erich von Manstein]], then Chief of Staff of the German [[Army Group A]], prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the [[OKH]] (German High Command) via his superior, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].{{sfn|Lemay|2010|pp=98\u2013102}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}} Manstein's plan suggested that panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish [[bridgehead]]s on the [[Meuse River]] and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the ''Sichelschnitt'' (\"sickle cut\").{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}}{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=145}} [[Adolf Hitler]] approved a modified version of Manstein's ideas, today known as the [[Manstein Plan]], after meeting with him on 17 February.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=132}}\n\n[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|Situation on 21 May 1940; German forces occupy the area shaded in pink]]\n\nOn 10 May, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] and [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=713}} [[Army Group B]], under ''Generaloberst'' [[Fedor von Bock]], attacked into Belgium, while the three panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=37}} The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the [[River Dyle]] within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|loc=Map, p. 33}} They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the [[Scheldt River]] on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=74\u201375}} During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=47}} On 19 May, Gort met with French General [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea.

But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=167\u201368}} In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at [[De Panne]] and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=214\u201315}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" align=right style=\"text-align: right; margin-left: 2px;\"\n|+ Troops landed from Dunkirk<br>27 May \u2013 4 June{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Beaches\n! scope=\"col\" | Harbour\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 27 May\n| \u2014\n| 7,669\n| 7,669\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 28 May\n| 5,930\n| 11,874\n| 17,804\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 29 May\n| 13,752\n| 33,558\n| 47,310\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 30 May\n| 29,512\n| 24,311\n| 53,823\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31 May\n| 22,942\n| 45,072\n| 68,014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 June\n| 17,348\n| 47,081\n| 64,429\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 June\n| 6,695\n| 19,561\n| 26,256\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 June\n| 1,870\n| 24,876\n| 26,746\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 June\n| 622\n| 25,553\n| 26,175\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''Totals'''\n| '''98,671'''\n| '''239,555'''\n| '''338,226'''\n|}\n{{See also|Battle of Abbeville|Operation Cycle|Operation Ariel}}\nBefore the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 May to expect \"hard and heavy tidings\".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=99}} Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a miracle, and the British press presented the evacuation as a \"disaster turned to triumph\" so successfully that Churchill had to remind the country in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] comments that the confusion over the Dunkirk evacuation is illustrated by two of the best books on it being called \"Strange Defeat\" and \"Strange Victory\".{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=37}} \n\nThree British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German \"race to the sea\". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]]. The majority of the [[51st (Highland) Division]] was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15\u201325 June under the codename [[Operation Ariel]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=296\u2013305}} The Germans marched into [[Paris]] on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=232\u201334}}\n\nThe more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.{{sfn|Looseley|2005|p=}} British ships ferried French troops to [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], and other ports in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]], although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.{{sfn|Mordal|1968|p=496}} Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French]] army in Britain.{{sfn|Nadeau|Barlow|2003|p=89}}\n\nIn France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated \"Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of materiel have been captured.

Plant fossils found in neighboring states such as Delaware and Maryland have revealed that ''[[fern]]s'', ''[[gymnosperm]]s'', and ''[[Flowering plant|angiosperms]]'' did indeed inhabit the area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lauginiger |first1=Edward M. |title=Cretaceous Fossils from the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |journal=Delaware Geological Survey |date=September 1988 |pages=61 |url=https://www.dgs.udel.edu/sites/default/files/publications/SP18.pdf}}</ref> Angiosperm fossils were unearthed in the Dakota Formation in Nebraska.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lidgard |first1=Scott |last2=Crane |first2=Peter R. |title=Angiosperm Diversification and Cretaceous Floristic Trends: A Comparison of Palynofloras and Leaf Macrofloras |journal=Paleobiology |date=Winter 1990 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201393 |jstor=2400934 |doi=10.1017/S009483730000974X }}</ref> As mentioned earlier, Georgia has a rich fossil record of plant life dating back to the Cretaceous.

In the following days, several local cases were reported to be caused by contact with two infected [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] women who attended a wedding ceremony in Zambales.\n\nThe 10-year-old arrived at the country on May 18 and was hospitalized the day after at the [[Research Institute for Tropical Medicine]] in [[Muntinlupa]]. On May 21, Department of Health (DOH) secretary [[Francisco Duque]] confirmed the case being the first Philippine swine flu case. The first confirmed case in the Philippines was publicly announced on May 22, 2009.\n\nSince the outbreak of A(H1N1) in the Americas, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] urged the Department of Health, the [[Bureau of Immigration (Philippines)|Bureau of Immigration]], the [[Bureau of Quarantine (Philippines)|Bureau of Quarantine]] and other concerned agencies to control monitor airport and seaport arrivals for possible flu infection.
