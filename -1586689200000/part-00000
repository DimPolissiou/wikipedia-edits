Hypoxia first causes a [[greyout (medical)|greyout]] (a dimming of the vision), also called brownout, followed by [[tunnel vision]] and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g there is a period of disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.\nA g-suit does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue.  The resting g-tolerance of a typical person is anywhere from 3\u20135 g depending on the person.  A g-suit will typically add 1&nbsp;g of tolerance to that limit.  Pilots still need to practice the 'g-straining maneuver' that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body.  High g is not comfortable, even with a g-suit.  In older [[fighter aircraft]], 6&nbsp;g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9&nbsp;g or more can be sustained structurally{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close [[dogfight|aerial combat]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Design ==\nA g-suit is a special garment and generally takes the form of tightly-fitting [[trousers]], which fit either under or over (depending on the design) the [[flight suit]] worn by the aviator or astronaut. The trousers are fitted with inflatable bladders which, when pressurized through a g-sensitive [[valve]] in the aircraft or spacecraft, press firmly on the abdomen and legs, thus restricting the draining of blood away from the brain during periods of high acceleration. In addition, in some modern very high-g aircraft, the Anti-g suit effect is augmented by a small amount of pressure applied to the lungs ([[partial pressure]] breathing), which also enhances resistance to high G. The effects of anti-g suits and partial pressure breathing are straightforward to replicate in a simulator, although only continuous g  can be produced artificially in devices such as [[centrifuge]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nVarious designs of g-suit have been developed. They first used water-filled bladders around the lower body and legs. Later designs used air under pressure to inflate the bladders. These g-suits were lighter than the liquid-filled versions and are still in extensive use. However, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[Life Support Systems AG]] and the German [[:de:Autoflug|Autoflug]] collaborated to design the new Libelle suit for use with the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft, which reverts to liquid as the medium and improves on performance. The Libelle suit is under consideration for adoption by the [[United States Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofluglibelle.de/|title=Informationsseite \u2013 DENIC eG|website=www.autofluglibelle.de}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAs early as 1917, there were documented cases of pilots' [[g-LOC|loss of consciousness due to g]] (G-LOC) that were referred to as \"fainting in the air\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Head, Henry |title=The sense of stability and balance in the air. |journal=In: Milford H, ed.

The sacs automatically inflated when G forces increased during flying. The suit was developed at the Sydney Medical School. Cotton constructed the first human centrifuge in the Anderson Stuart Building at Sydney University under tight wartime security. The volunteers, young airmen, were strapped by their legs to the centrifuge and subjected to high g-force and monitored until black-out occurred. All lost consciousness. On February 19, 1942, the day of the major Japanese\nair attack on [[Bombing of Darwin|Darwin]], Cotton's suit was approved by the Allied war chiefs. The Americans soon issued orders for manufacture of a suit based on Cotton's design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/news/pubs/radiuscontents/2010/March/2010_1_cotton.pdf|title=Champion athlete, inventor of the Cotton anti-g suit and pioneer of sports science|website=sydney.edu.au}}</ref>\nThe Cotton suit was later flight-tested in a Hurricane, Kittyhawks, and Spitfires and provided about 2G protection.

This suit used inflation like the Cotton suit. While Professor Cotton's design was intriguing, he was more focused on center of gravity than on blood flow.

Hypoxia first causes a [[greyout (medical)|greyout]] (a dimming of the vision), also called brownout, followed by [[tunnel vision]] and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g there is a period of disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.\nA g-suit does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue.  The resting g-tolerance of a typical person is anywhere from 3\u20135 g depending on the person.  A g-suit will typically add 1&nbsp;g of tolerance to that limit.  Pilots still need to practice the 'g-straining maneuver' that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body.  High g is not comfortable, even with a g-suit.  In older [[fighter aircraft]], 6&nbsp;g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9&nbsp;g or more can be sustained structurally{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close [[dogfight|aerial combat]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Design ==\nA g-suit is a special garment and generally takes the form of tightly-fitting [[trousers]], which fit either under or over (depending on the design) the [[flight suit]] worn by the aviator or astronaut. The trousers are fitted with inflatable bladders which, when pressurized through a g-sensitive [[valve]] in the aircraft or spacecraft, press firmly on the abdomen and legs, thus restricting the draining of blood away from the brain during periods of high acceleration. In addition, in some modern very high-g aircraft, the Anti-g suit effect is augmented by a small amount of pressure applied to the lungs ([[partial pressure]] breathing), which also enhances resistance to high G. The effects of anti-g suits and partial pressure breathing are straightforward to replicate in a simulator, although only continuous g  can be produced artificially in devices such as [[centrifuge]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nVarious designs of g-suit have been developed. They first used water-filled bladders around the lower body and legs. Later designs used air under pressure to inflate the bladders. These g-suits were lighter than the liquid-filled versions and are still in extensive use. However, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[Life Support Systems AG]] and the German [[:de:Autoflug|Autoflug]] collaborated to design the new Libelle suit for use with the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft, which reverts to liquid as the medium and improves on performance. The Libelle suit is under consideration for adoption by the [[United States Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofluglibelle.de/|title=Informationsseite \u2013 DENIC eG|website=www.autofluglibelle.de}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAs early as 1917, there were documented cases of pilots' [[g-LOC|loss of consciousness due to g]] (G-LOC) that were referred to as \"fainting in the air\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Head, Henry |title=The sense of stability and balance in the air. |journal=In: Milford H, ed.

The sacs automatically inflated when G forces increased during flying. The suit was developed at the Sydney Medical School.

The volunteers, young airmen, were strapped by their legs to the centrifuge and subjected to high g-force and monitored until black-out occurred. All lost consciousness. On February 19, 1942, the day of the major Japanese\nair attack on [[Bombing of Darwin|Darwin]], Cotton's suit was approved by the Allied war chiefs.

Based upon their new understanding of the physiologic effects of high G-forces, they developed a more practical G-suit derived from the work of Cotton and Franks. This suit used inflation like the Cotton suit. While Professor Cotton's design was intriguing, he was more focused on center of gravity than on blood flow.

The US, a country based on a free-market capitalist ideology, has done many horrible things: the enslavement of millions of Africans, the genocidal eradication of the Native Americans, the brutal military actions taken to support pro-Western dictatorships, just to name a few. The British Empire likewise had a great deal of blood on its hands: we might merely mention the internment camps during the second Boer War and the Bengal famine. This is not mere \u2018whataboutism\u2019, because the same intermediate premise necessary to make their anti-communist argument now works against capitalism: Historical point: the US and the UK were based on a capitalist ideology, and did many horrible things.
