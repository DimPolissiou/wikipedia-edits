Sweating is a major way that the body controls its temperature; as sweat evaporates from the skin, it cools the body. An inability to sweat can lead to a dangerously high body temperature ([[hyperthermia]]) particularly in hot weather. In some cases, hyperthermia can cause life-threatening medical problems.\n\nAffected individuals tend to have sparse scalp and body hair ([[hypotrichosis]]). The hair is often light-coloured, brittle, and slow-growing. This condition is also characterized by absent teeth ([[hypodontia]]) or teeth that are malformed. The teeth that are present are frequently small and pointed.\n\nHypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is associated with distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, thick lips, and a flattened bridge of the nose. Additional features of this condition include thin, wrinkled, and dark-colored skin around the eyes; chronic skin problems such as [[eczema]]; and a bad-smelling discharge from the nose ([[ozena]]).\n\nHypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is the most common form of ectodermal dysplasia in humans. It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 17,000 people worldwide.\n\n== Genetics ==\nMutations in the ''[[EDA (gene)|EDA]]'', ''[[EDAR]]'', and ''[[EDARADD]]'' genes cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. The ''EDA'', ''EDAR'', and ''EDARADD'' genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together during embryonic development. These proteins form part of a signaling pathway that is critical for the interaction between two cell layers, the ectoderm and the mesoderm. In the early embryo, these cell layers form the basis for many of the body's organs and tissues. Ectoderm-mesoderm interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.\n\nHypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia has several different inheritance patterns.\n\n=== EDA (X-linked) ===\nMost cases are caused by mutations in the EDA gene, which are inherited in an [[X-linked recessive]] pattern, called x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED). A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\n\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. Since females operate on only one of their two X chromosomes (X inactivation) a female carrier may or may not manifest symptoms of the disease. If a female carrier is operating on her normal X she will not show symptoms. If a female is operating on her carrier X she will show symptoms. In about 70 percent of cases, carriers of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia experience some features of the condition. These signs and symptoms are usually mild and include a few missing or abnormal teeth, sparse hair, and some problems with sweat gland function. Some carriers, however, have more severe features of this disorder.\n\n==== Treatments ====\nIn January 2013, [http://www.edimerpharma.com Edimer Pharmaceuticals] a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, MA, USA initiated a Phase I, open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01564225 clinical study] of [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203120127/http://edimerpharma.com/information-for-patients/treatment-for-x-linked-hypohidrotic-ectodermal-dysplasia/ EDI200], a drug aimed at the treatment of XLHED.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01775462?cond=Hypohidrotic+Ectodermal+Dysplasia&rank=3|title=Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Immunogenicity and Pharmacodynamics/Efficacy of EDI200 in Male Infants With X-Linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}</ref> During development in mice and dogs EDI200 has been shown to substitute for the altered or missing protein resulting from the EDA mutation which causes XLHED.

Nausea and vomiting may also occur.  An obstruction that occurs at the urethra or bladder outlet can cause pain and pressure resulting from distension of the bladder.  Blocking the flow of urine will commonly result in urinary tract infections which can lead to the development of stones, fever, and blood or pus in the urine.  If complete obstruction occurs, kidney failure may follow.<ref name=\"merck\" />\n\nBlood tests may show impaired kidney function (elevated [[urea]] or [[creatinine]]) or electrolyte imbalances such as [[hyponatremia]] or [[Hyperchloremic acidosis|hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis]].  Urinalysis may indicate an elevated pH due to the secondary destruction of [[Nephron|nephrons]] within the affected kidney. Physical examination may detect a palpable abdominal or flank mass caused by the enlarged kidney.\n\n==Causes==\n\nHydronephrosis is the result of any of several abnormal pathophysiological occurrences.  Structural abnormalities of the junctions between the kidney, ureter, and bladder that lead to hydronephrosis can occur during fetal development.

These include [[vesicoureteral reflux]], [[urethral stricture]], and [[stenosis]]. The most common cause of hydronephrosis in young adults is kidney stones, or [[Kidney stone disease|renal calculi.]] In older adults, the most common cause of hydronephrosis is BPH, [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|benign prostate hyperplasia]], or pelvic cancers. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Capriotti, Theresa,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900626405|title=Pathophysiology : introductory concepts and clinical perspectives|others=Frizzell, Joan Parker,|isbn=978-0-8036-1571-7|location=Philadelphia|oclc=900626405}}</ref>\n\nCompression of one or both ureters can also be caused by other developmental defects not completely occurring during the fetal stage such as an abnormally placed vein, artery, or tumor.  Bilateral compression of the ureters can occur during pregnancy due to enlargement of the uterus.

Whilst ultrasound allows for visualisation of the ureters and kidneys (and determine the presence of hydronephrosis and / or hydroureter), an IVU is useful for assessing the anatomical location of the obstruction.

One way to do this is to test the [[kidney function]]. This can be done by, for instance, a [[diuretic]] [[Pyelogram|intravenous pyelogram]], in which the urinary system is observed radiographically after administration of a [[diuretic]], such as 5% mannitol, and an intravenous iodine contrast.<ref>Dr. Asmita Parikh LCEH (Bom)., \"Intravenous Pyelography\"; ''Indian Journal of Homeopathic Medicine'', Vol 31, No 2; available at homeoint.org</ref> The location of obstruction can be determined with a Whittaker (or pressure perfusion) test, wherein the collecting system of the kidney is accessed [[percutaneous]]ly, and the liquid is introduced at high pressure and constant rate of 10ml/min while measuring the pressure within the [[renal pelvis]]. A rise in pressure above 22&nbsp;cm H<small>2</small>O suggests that the urinary collection system is obstructed. When arriving at this pressure measurement, bladder pressure is subtracted from the initial reading of internal pressure. (The test was first described by Whittaker in 1973 to test the [[hypothesis]] that patients whose hydronephrosis persists after the [[posterior urethral valve]]s have been [[ablation|ablated]] usually have ureters that are not obstructed, even though they may be [[Dilation (morphology)|dilated]].)<ref name=Kay/>\n\nKay recommends that a [[neonate]] born with untreated [[in utero]] hydronephrosis receive a renal ultrasound within two days of birth.  A [[renal pelvis]] greater than 12mm in a neonate is considered abnormal and suggests significant dilation and possible abnormalities such as obstruction or morphological abnormalities in the urinary tract.<ref name=Kay/>\n\nThe choice of imaging depends on the clinical presentation (history, symptoms and examination findings).  In the case of [[renal colic]] (one sided loin pain usually accompanied by a trace of blood in the urine) the initial investigation is usually a spiral or helical CT scan.  This has the advantage of showing whether there is any obstruction of flow of urine causing hydronephrosis as well as demonstrating the function of the other kidney.  Many stones are not visible on plain [[X-ray]] or IVU but 99% of stones are visible on CT and therefore CT is becoming a common choice of initial investigation.  CT is not used however, when there is a reason to avoid radiation exposure, e.g. in pregnancy.\n\nFor incidentally detected prenatal hydronephrosis, the first study to obtain is a postnatal renal ultrasound, since as noted, many cases of prenatal hydronephrosis resolve spontaneously.  This is generally done within the first few days after birth, although there is some risk that obtaining an imaging study this early may miss some cases of mild hydronephrosis due to the relative oliguria of a newborn.  Thus, some experts recommend obtaining a follow up ultrasound at 4\u20136 weeks to reduce the false-negative rate of the initial ultrasound.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aksu|first=N|title=Postnatal management of infants with antenatally detected hydronephrosis|journal=Pediatr Nephrol|date=September 2005|volume=20|issue=9|pages=1253\u20139|pmid=16025288|doi=10.1007/s00467-005-1989-3|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is also typically obtained to exclude the possibility of vesicoureteral reflux or anatomical abnormalities such as posterior urethral valves.

Chronic upper urinary tract obstruction is treated by the insertion of a [[ureteric stent]] or a [[pyeloplasty]].\n\nLower urinary tract obstruction (such as that caused by bladder outflow obstruction secondary to prostatic hypertrophy) is usually treated by insertion of a [[urinary catheter]] or a [[suprapubic catheter]].

Hydronephrosis that occurs acutely with sudden onset (as caused by a [[kidney stone]]) can cause intense pain in the flank area (between the hips and ribs).

Conversely, hydronephrosis that develops gradually will generally cause either a dull discomfort or no pain.  Nausea and vomiting may also occur.  An obstruction that occurs at the urethra or bladder outlet can cause pain and pressure resulting from distension of the bladder.  Blocking the flow of urine will commonly result in urinary tract infections which can lead to the development of stones, fever, and blood or pus in the urine.  If complete obstruction occurs, kidney failure may follow.<ref name=\"merck\" />\n\nBlood tests may show impaired kidney function (elevated [[urea]] or [[creatinine]]) or electrolyte imbalances such as [[hyponatremia]] or [[Hyperchloremic acidosis|hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis]].  Urinalysis may indicate an elevated pH due to the secondary destruction of [[Nephron|nephrons]] within the affected kidney. Physical examination may detect a palpable abdominal or flank mass caused by the enlarged kidney.\n\n==Causes==\n\nHydronephrosis is the result of any of several abnormal pathophysiological occurrences.  Structural abnormalities of the junctions between the kidney, ureter, and bladder that lead to hydronephrosis can occur during fetal development.  Some of these congenital defects have been identified as inherited conditions, however the benefits of linking genetic testing to early diagnosis have not been determined. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20807610/|title=Congenital Anomalies of Kidney and Urinary Tract|last=Hr|first=Toka|last2=O|first2=Toka|date=July 2010|website=Seminars in nephrology|language=en|pmid=20807610|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=A|first3=Hariri|last4=Ht|first4=Nguyen}}</ref> Other structural abnormalities could be caused by injury, surgery, or radiation therapy.\n\nThe most common causes of hydronephrosis in children are anatomical abnormalities. These include [[vesicoureteral reflux]], [[urethral stricture]], and [[stenosis]]. The most common cause of hydronephrosis in young adults is kidney stones, or [[Kidney stone disease|renal calculi.]] In older adults, the most common cause of hydronephrosis is BPH, [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|benign prostate hyperplasia]], or pelvic cancers. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Capriotti, Theresa,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900626405|title=Pathophysiology : introductory concepts and clinical perspectives|others=Frizzell, Joan Parker,|isbn=978-0-8036-1571-7|location=Philadelphia|oclc=900626405}}</ref>\n\nCompression of one or both ureters can also be caused by other developmental defects not completely occurring during the fetal stage such as an abnormally placed vein, artery, or tumor.

When arriving at this pressure measurement, bladder pressure is subtracted from the initial reading of internal pressure. (The test was first described by Whittaker in 1973 to test the [[hypothesis]] that patients whose hydronephrosis persists after the [[posterior urethral valve]]s have been [[ablation|ablated]] usually have ureters that are not obstructed, even though they may be [[Dilation (morphology)|dilated]].)<ref name=Kay/>\n\nKay recommends that a [[neonate]] born with untreated [[in utero]] hydronephrosis receive a renal ultrasound within two days of birth.  A [[renal pelvis]] greater than 12mm in a neonate is considered abnormal and suggests significant dilation and possible abnormalities such as obstruction or morphological abnormalities in the urinary tract.<ref name=Kay/>\n\nThe choice of imaging depends on the clinical presentation (history, symptoms and examination findings).  In the case of [[renal colic]] (one sided loin pain usually accompanied by a trace of blood in the urine) the initial investigation is usually a spiral or helical CT scan.  This has the advantage of showing whether there is any obstruction of flow of urine causing hydronephrosis as well as demonstrating the function of the other kidney.  Many stones are not visible on plain [[X-ray]] or IVU but 99% of stones are visible on CT and therefore CT is becoming a common choice of initial investigation.  CT is not used however, when there is a reason to avoid radiation exposure, e.g. in pregnancy.\n\nFor incidentally detected prenatal hydronephrosis, the first study to obtain is a postnatal renal ultrasound, since as noted, many cases of prenatal hydronephrosis resolve spontaneously.  This is generally done within the first few days after birth, although there is some risk that obtaining an imaging study this early may miss some cases of mild hydronephrosis due to the relative oliguria of a newborn.  Thus, some experts recommend obtaining a follow up ultrasound at 4\u20136 weeks to reduce the false-negative rate of the initial ultrasound.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aksu|first=N|title=Postnatal management of infants with antenatally detected hydronephrosis|journal=Pediatr Nephrol|date=September 2005|volume=20|issue=9|pages=1253\u20139|pmid=16025288|doi=10.1007/s00467-005-1989-3|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is also typically obtained to exclude the possibility of vesicoureteral reflux or anatomical abnormalities such as posterior urethral valves.  Finally, if hydronephrosis is significant and obstruction is suspected, such as a ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) or ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction, a nuclear imaging study such as a MAG-3 scan is warranted.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:BilateralHydroMark.png|[[CT scan]] of bilateral hydronephrosis due to a bladder cancer\nFile:Hydronephrosis.png|Massive hydronephrosis as marked by the arrow.\nFile:UOTW 10 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|[[Renal ultrasonography]] of hydronephrosis<ref name=UOTW10/>\nFile:UOTW 10 - Ultrasound of the Week 3.webm|Stone causing hydronephrosis<ref name=UOTW10/>\nFile:UOTW 10 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Stone causing hydronephrosis<ref name=UOTW10/>\nFile:UOTW 10 - Ultrasound of the Week 4.webm|Urine jets<ref name=UOTW10>{{cite web|title=UOTW #10 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-10/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=22 July 2014}}</ref>\nFile:CT of peripelvic cysts with non-contrast and urography.jpg|Peripelvic [[renal cyst]]s may look like hydronephrosis on non-contrast CT (left image).

These observed spectral lines are due to the [[electron]] making [[atomic electron transition|transitions]] between two [[energy level]]s in an atom. The classification of the series by the Rydberg formula was important in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. The spectral series are important in [[astronomical spectroscopy]] for detecting the presence of hydrogen and calculating [[red shift]]s.\n\n==Physics==\n{{Further|Hydrogen atom }}\n[[File:Hydrogen transitions.svg|thumb|right|400px|Electron transitions and their resulting wavelengths for hydrogen. Energy levels are not to scale.]]\nA hydrogen atom consists of an electron orbiting its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. The [[electromagnetic force]] between the electron and the nuclear [[proton]] leads to a set of [[quantum state]]s for the electron, each with its own energy. These states were visualized by the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom as being distinct orbits around the nucleus. Each energy state, or orbit, is designated by an integer, {{mvar|n}} as shown in the figure. The Bohr model was later replaced by quantum mechanics in which the electron occupies an [[atomic orbital]] rather than an orbit, but the allowed energy levels of the hydrogen atom remained the same as in the earlier theory.\n\nSpectral emission occurs when an electron transitions, or jumps, from a higher energy state to a lower energy state. To distinguish the two states, the lower energy state is commonly designated as {{mvar|n\u2032}}, and the higher energy state is designated as {{mvar|n}}. The energy of an emitted [[photon]] corresponds to the energy difference between the two states. Because the energy of each state is fixed, the energy difference between them is fixed, and the transition will always produce a photon with the same energy.\n\nThe spectral lines are grouped into series according to {{mvar|n\u2032}}. Lines are named sequentially starting from the longest wavelength/lowest frequency of the series, using Greek letters within each series. For example, the {{nowrap|2 \u2192 1}} line is called \"Lyman-alpha\" (Ly-\u03b1), while the {{nowrap|7 \u2192 3}} line is called \"Paschen-delta\u201d (Pa-\u03b4).\n[[File:05-07-2015 Problem 7.64.jpg|thumb|Energy level diagram of electrons in hydrogen atom]]\nThere are emission lines from hydrogen that fall outside of these series, such as the [[Hydrogen line|21 cm line]].

These observed spectral lines are due to the [[electron]] making [[atomic electron transition|transitions]] between two [[energy level]]s in an atom. The classification of the series by the Rydberg formula was important in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. The spectral series are important in [[astronomical spectroscopy]] for detecting the presence of hydrogen and calculating [[red shift]]s.\n\n==Physics==\n{{Further|Hydrogen atom }}\n[[File:Hydrogen transitions.svg|thumb|right|400px|Electron transitions and their resulting wavelengths for hydrogen. Energy levels are not to scale.]]\nA hydrogen atom consists of an electron orbiting its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. The [[electromagnetic force]] between the electron and the nuclear [[proton]] leads to a set of [[quantum state]]s for the electron, each with its own energy. These states were visualized by the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom as being distinct orbits around the nucleus. Each energy state, or orbit, is designated by an integer, {{mvar|n}} as shown in the figure. The Bohr model was later replaced by quantum mechanics in which the electron occupies an [[atomic orbital]] rather than an orbit, but the allowed energy levels of the hydrogen atom remained the same as in the earlier theory.\n\nSpectral emission occurs when an electron transitions, or jumps, from a higher energy state to a lower energy state. To distinguish the two states, the lower energy state is commonly designated as {{mvar|n\u2032}}, and the higher energy state is designated as {{mvar|n}}. The energy of an emitted [[photon]] corresponds to the energy difference between the two states. Because the energy of each state is fixed, the energy difference between them is fixed, and the transition will always produce a photon with the same energy.\n\nThe spectral lines are grouped into series according to {{mvar|n\u2032}}. Lines are named sequentially starting from the longest wavelength/lowest frequency of the series, using Greek letters within each series. For example, the {{nowrap|2 \u2192 1}} line is called \"Lyman-alpha\" (Ly-\u03b1), while the {{nowrap|7 \u2192 3}} line is called \"Paschen-delta\u201d (Pa-\u03b4).\n[[File:05-07-2015 Problem 7.64.jpg|thumb|Energy level diagram of electrons in hydrogen atom]]\nThere are emission lines from hydrogen that fall outside of these series, such as the [[Hydrogen line|21 cm line]].

These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were [[Nalanda]] (in modern-day [[Bihar]]) and [[Manassa]] in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as [[Buddhist P\u00e1li literature]], logic, [[p\u00e1li grammar]], etc. [[Chanakya]], a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of [[Mauryan Empire]].\n\nSammanas and [[Brahmin|Brahmin gurus]] historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the ''[[Sammana]]s'', were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the ''[[Kshatriya]]'', were trained in the various aspects of warfare.

Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.\n* [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located at New Delhi, Capital City of India. It makes the curriculum related matters for school education across India.<ref name=\"I09RA-233\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 233</ref> The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies.<ref name=\"I09RA-230-234\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 230\u2013234</ref> There are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level.\n* State Government Boards of Education: Most of the state governments have at least one \"State board of secondary school education\". However, some states like Andhra Pradesh have more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English - often considered less rigorous than central curriculums such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some even at the 5th, 6th and 8th level.\n* [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th standards that are called board exams. Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12. Examinations are offered in Hindi and English.\n* [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations]] (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE - Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC - Class/Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE - Class/Grade 12). CISCE English level has been compared to UK's A-Levels; this board offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have often been compared with CICSE and ISC examinations. CICSE is generally considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination. The CBSE and ISC are recognised internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of CBSE and ISC exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school.\n*[[National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS): The NIOS conducts two examinations, namely, Secondary Examination and Senior Secondary Examination (All India) and also some courses in Vocational Education. National Board of education is run by Government of India's HRD Ministry to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode. A pilot project started by CBSE to provide high class affordable education, provides education up to 12th standard. Choice of subjects is highly customisable and equivalent to CBSE.

On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to the primary stage but pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India, pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages. But in cities and big towns, there are many established players in the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still, only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.\n* '''Play group (pre-nursery)''': At playschools, children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves, dressing up, and maintaining cleanliness.

Enrollment has been enhanced, but the levels of quality remain low.\n\n====Secondary education====\n[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|Secondary school girls in [[Delhi]].]]\n[[File:Indian school children at Hnahthial.jpg|thumb|School children in Hnahthial.]]\n''See also'': [[Gender inequality in India]]\n\nSecondary education covers children aged 14 to 18, a group comprising 8.85 [[crore]] children according to the [[2001 Census of India]]. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the \"+2\" stage. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.\n\nUGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as [[Engineering]], [[Medicine|Medical]], and [[Business administration|Business Administration]].\n\nSecondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11-12) with a standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to as \"board exams\"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11\u201312 at a secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India.\n\nMost schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different \"streams\"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.\n\n===== 10th (Matriculation or Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 10 examination usually take six subjects: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, one language, and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers at different schools. \"Elective\" or optional subjects often include Computer Applications, Economics, Physical Education, Commerce, and Environmental Science.\n\n===== 12th (Senior Secondary or Higher Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 12 examination usually take four or five subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing a \"core stream\" in addition to English or the local language: Science (Mathematics/Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), Commerce (Accounts, Business Studies, and Economics), or Humanities (any three of History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Geography depending on school). Students study Mathematics up to single-variable Calculus in grade 12.\n\n===Types of schools===\n====Government schools====\nThe majority of students study in government schools where poor and vulnerable students study for free until the age of 14. An Education Ministry data, 65.2% (113 million,) of all school students in 20 states go to government schools (c. 2017).<ref name=study1>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/in-5-years-private-schools-gain-17-million-students-government-schools-lose-13-million/story-6FV1ic7RLttmWc0ZkhBQBM.html In 5 years, private schools gain 17 million students, government schools lose 13 million], [[Hindustan Times]], 17 April 2017.</ref> These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the centre government.

This welfare thrust raised primary enrollment between 1951 and 1981. In 1986 the National Policy on Education decided to restructure education in tune with the social framework of each state, and with larger national goals. It emphasised that education was necessary for democracy, and central to the improvement of women's condition. The new policy aimed at social change through revised texts, curricula, increased funding for schools, expansion in the numbers of schools, and policy improvements. Emphasis was placed on expanding girls' occupational centres and primary education; secondary and higher education; and rural and urban institutions. The report tried to connect problems like low school attendance with poverty, and the dependence on girls for housework and sibling day care. The National Literacy Mission also worked through female tutors in villages. Although the minimum marriage age is now eighteen for girls, many continue to be married much earlier. Therefore, at the secondary level, female drop-out rates are high.<ref name=Raman238/>}}\n\nSita Anantha Raman also mentions that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions.<ref name=Raman238>Raman, 238</ref>\n\nThe education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, both of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/in-school/signpost/recognising-excellence-in-the-teaching-profession/article7680538.ece|title=Recognising excellence in the teaching profession|first=Ramya|last=Venkataraman|date=23 September 2015|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref> This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/framing-success-in-teaching/article7597239.ece|title=Framing success in teaching|first=Nalini|last=Haridas|date=31 August 2015|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\n===Coaching===\n[[File:Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi]]\nIncreased competition to get admission in reputed colleges has given rise to private coaching institutes in India.

Within this allocation, major share of {{Indian Rupee}} 21,000&nbsp;crore, is for the flagship programme 'Sarva Siksha Abhiyan'. However, budgetary allocation of {{Indian Rupee}} 210,000 million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of {{Indian Rupee}} 35,659&nbsp;crore for the year 2011\u201312. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation 'Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In recent times, several major announcements were made for developing the poor state of affairs in education sector in India, the most notable ones being the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The announcements are;\n(a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP.\n(b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes.\n(c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty.\n(d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6\u201314 years.\n(e) To universalise education through its flagship programmes such as [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] and [[Midday Meal Scheme]]\n\nHowever, even after five years of implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951\u201352 to 2.31% in 1970\u201371 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000\u201301. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004\u201305. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000\u20132001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget.

These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were [[Nalanda]] (in modern-day [[Bihar]]) and [[Manassa]] in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as [[Buddhist P\u00e1li literature]], logic, [[p\u00e1li grammar]], etc. [[Chanakya]], a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of [[Mauryan Empire]].\n\nSammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the ''[[Sammana]]s'', were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the ''[[Kshatriya]]'', were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the ''[[Vaishya]]'', were taught their trade and the working class of the ''[[Shudra]]s'' was generally deprived of educational advantages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Amit |title=Department of School Education & Literacy in India - MHRD |url=https://www.wiki.meramaal.com/2018/08/17/department-of-school-education/ |website=Meramaal Wiki |accessdate=2 August 2019 |date=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== School education ==\n{{see also | List of schools in India |l1 = List of schools}}\n[[File:University of Calcutta cropped.JPG|thumb|220x220px|[[University of Calcutta]], established on 1857, was the first multidisciplinary and secular Western-style institution in Asia.]]\n\nThe central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the \"[[10+2]]+3\" pattern of education.<ref name=\"ncert policy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/oth_anoun/npe86.pdf|title=National Policy on Education (with modifications undertaken in 1992)|publisher=National Council of Educational Research and Training|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>{{rp|3}} In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges,<ref name=\"ncert policy\"/>{{rp|44}} and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/10-2-3-scheme-seeks-to-divide-schooling-into-two-stages-of-education/1/203052.html|title=10+2+3: A Game of Numbers?|last=Vyas|first=Neena|work=India Today|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=30 June 2012}}</ref> The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.<ref name=\"ncert policy\"/>{{rp|5}} This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964\u201366.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1977-10+2+3+system+of+education:+The+new+class+structure/1/76361.html|title=1977-10+2+3 system of education: The new class structure\n|last=Bamzai|first=Kaveree|work=India Today|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=24 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Administration===\n====Policy====\nEducation Policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively.

Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.\n* [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located at New Delhi, Capital City of India. It makes the curriculum related matters for school education across India.<ref name=\"I09RA-233\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 233</ref> The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies.<ref name=\"I09RA-230-234\">''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 230\u2013234</ref> There are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level.\n* State Government Boards of Education: Most of the state governments have at least one \"State board of secondary school education\". However, some states like Andhra Pradesh have more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English - often considered less rigorous than central curriculums such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some even at the 5th, 6th and 8th level.\n* [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th standards that are called board exams. Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12. Examinations are offered in Hindi and English.\n* [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations]] (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE - Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC - Class/Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE - Class/Grade 12). CISCE English level has been compared to UK's A-Levels; this board offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have often been compared with CICSE and ISC examinations. CICSE is generally considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination. The CBSE and ISC are recognised internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of CBSE and ISC exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school.\n*[[National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS): The NIOS conducts two examinations, namely, Secondary Examination and Senior Secondary Examination (All India) and also some courses in Vocational Education. National Board of education is run by Government of India's HRD Ministry to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode. A pilot project started by CBSE to provide high class affordable education, provides education up to 12th standard. Choice of subjects is highly customisable and equivalent to CBSE. Home-schooled students usually take NIOS or international curriculum examinations as they are ineligible to write CBSE or ISC exams.\n* '''Islamic [[Madrasah]]''': Their boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] or [http://www.nadwatululama.org/ Darul Uloom Nadwtul Ulama].\n* '''Autonomous schools''': Such as [[Woodstock School]], [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram|Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education Puducherry]], [[Visva-Bharati University|Patha Bhavan]] and [[Ananda Marga|Ananda Marga Gurukula]].\n* [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB): These are generally private schools that have dual affiliation with one of the school education board of India as well as affiliated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) Programme and/or the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB).\n* '''International schools''', which offer 10th and 12th standard examinations under the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Senior Secondary Examination systems or under their home nations school boards (such as run by foreign embassies or the expat communities).\n* [[Special education]]: A special Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) programme was started in 1974 with a focus on primary education.<ref name=\"I09RA-233\"/> but which was converted into Inclusive Education at Secondary Stage<ref>[http://www.education.nic.in/secedu/sec_iedc.asp Secondary Education].

The Indian government lays emphasis on primary education ( Class I-VIII ) also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old.<ref name=\"Blackwell93-94\">Blackwell, 93\u201394</ref> Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions.<ref name=\"Blackwell93-94\" /> However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions.<ref name=\"Blackwell93-94\" /> 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country.<ref name=\"dise.in\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dise.in/ar2005.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231235835/http://www.dise.in/ar2005.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 December 2008 |accessdate=8 February 2016  }}</ref>\n\nHowever, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training.

Enrollment has been enhanced, but the levels of quality remain low.\n\n====Secondary education====\n[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|Secondary school girls in [[Delhi]].]]\n[[File:Indian school children at Hnahthial.jpg|thumb|School children in Hnahthial.]]\n''See also'': [[Gender inequality in India]]\n\nSecondary education covers children aged 14 to 18, a group comprising 8.85 [[crore]] children according to the [[2001 Census of India]]. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the \"+2\" stage. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.\n\nUGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as Engineering, Medical, and Business Administration.\n\nSecondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11-12) with a standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to as \"board exams\"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11\u201312 at a secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India.\n\nMost schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different \"streams\"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.\n\n===== 10th (Matriculation or Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 10 examination usually take six subjects: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, one language, and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers at different schools. \"Elective\" or optional subjects often include Computer Applications, Economics, Physical Education, Commerce, and Environmental Science.\n\n===== 12th (Senior Secondary or Higher Secondary) Exam =====\nStudents taking the grade 12 examination usually take four or five subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing a \"core stream\" in addition to English or the local language: Science (Mathematics/Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), Commerce (Accounts, Business Studies, and Economics), or Humanities (any three of History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Geography depending on school). Students study Mathematics up to single-variable Calculus in grade 12.\n\n===Types of schools===\n====Government schools====\nThe majority of students study in government schools where poor and vulnerable students study for free until the age of 14. An Education Ministry data, 65.2% (113 million,) of all school students in 20 states go to government schools (c. 2017).<ref name=study1>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/in-5-years-private-schools-gain-17-million-students-government-schools-lose-13-million/story-6FV1ic7RLttmWc0ZkhBQBM.html In 5 years, private schools gain 17 million students, government schools lose 13 million], [[Hindustan Times]], 17 April 2017.</ref> These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the centre government.

This welfare thrust raised primary enrollment between 1951 and 1981. In 1986 the National Policy on Education decided to restructure education in tune with the social framework of each state, and with larger national goals. It emphasised that education was necessary for democracy, and central to the improvement of women's condition. The new policy aimed at social change through revised texts, curricula, increased funding for schools, expansion in the numbers of schools, and policy improvements. Emphasis was placed on expanding girls' occupational centres and primary education; secondary and higher education; and rural and urban institutions. The report tried to connect problems like low school attendance with poverty, and the dependence on girls for housework and sibling day care. The National Literacy Mission also worked through female tutors in villages. Although the minimum marriage age is now eighteen for girls, many continue to be married much earlier. Therefore, at the secondary level, female drop-out rates are high.<ref name=Raman238/>}}\n\nSita Anantha Raman also mentions that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions.<ref name=Raman238>Raman, 238</ref>\n\nThe education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

It is either based on a student's success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or competencies.

However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/framing-success-in-teaching/article7597239.ece|title=Framing success in teaching|first=Nalini|last=Haridas|date=31 August 2015|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\n===Coaching===\n[[File:Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi]]\nIncreased competition to get admission in reputed colleges has given rise to private coaching institutes in India.

Within this allocation, major share of {{Indian Rupee}} 21,000&nbsp;crore, is for the flagship programme 'Sarva Siksha Abhiyan'. However, budgetary allocation of {{Indian Rupee}} 210,000 million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of {{Indian Rupee}} 35,659&nbsp;crore for the year 2011\u201312. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation 'Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In recent times, several major announcements were made for developing the poor state of affairs in education sector in India, the most notable ones being the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The announcements are;\n(a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP.\n(b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes.\n(c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty.\n(d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6\u201314 years.\n(e) To universalise education through its flagship programmes such as [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] and [[Midday Meal Scheme]]\n\nHowever, even after five years of implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951\u201352 to 2.31% in 1970\u201371 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000\u201301. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004\u201305. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000\u20132001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget.

The figure at left holds the severed head of the figure at right, who spouts blood in the form of serpents from his neck]]\nDuring the [[pre-Columbian era]], '''human sacrifice in Maya culture''' was the ritual offering of nourishment to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]]. Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of a living creature was a powerful [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood offering]]. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in [[human sacrifice]]. Generally only high status prisoners of [[Maya warfare|war]] were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 751.</ref>\n\nHuman sacrifice among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] is evident from at least the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic period]] (c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;250\u2013900) right through to the final stages of the [[Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n|Spanish conquest]] in the 17th century. Human sacrifice is depicted in Classic [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]], is mentioned in Classic period [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] and has been verified archaeologically by analysis of skeletal remains from the Classic and [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] (c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;900\u20131524) periods. Additionally, human sacrifice is described in a number of late Maya and early Spanish colonial texts, including the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]'', the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc people|K\u02bciche\u02bc]] epic ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the K\u02bciche\u02bc ''[[T\u00edtulo de Totonicap\u00e1n]]'', the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc language]] ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', the ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' and [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]''.\n\nA number of methods were employed by the Maya, the most common being decapitation and heart extraction. Additional forms of sacrifice included ritually shooting the victim with arrows, hurling sacrifices into a deep [[sinkhole]], entombing alive to accompany a noble burial, tying the sacrifice into a ball for a ritual reenactment of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] and disembowelment.\n\n==Methods==\nA variety of methods were used by the ancient Maya to perform human sacrifice, such as:\n\n===Decapitation===\n{{Maya civilization}}\nImportant rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human sacrificial offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the [[Maya maize god]] by the [[Maya death gods]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\"/> In AD 738, the vassal king [[K\u02bcak\u02bc Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] of [[Quirigu\u00e1]] captured his overlord, [[Uaxaclajuun Ub\u02bcaah K\u02bcawiil]] of [[Cop\u00e1n]] and a few days later he ritually decapitated him;<ref>Miller 1999, pp.134\u201335. Looper 2003, p.76.</ref> such royal sacrifices were often recorded in [[Maya script]] with the \"ax event\" [[glyph]]. The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame]] reenacting the victory of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] over the gods of the [[Xibalba|underworld]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\"/>\n\nSacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]].<ref name=\"MillerTaube9303p96\">Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 96.</ref> Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted on [[relief]]s at [[Chichen Itza]] in two of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] (the Great Ballcourt and the Monjas Ballcourt).<ref>Gillespie 1991, pp. 321\u2013322.</ref> The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins (the Hero Twins themselves and their father and uncle) was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.<ref name=\"Gillespie91p322-323\">Gillespie 1991, pp. 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nDecapitation has appeared using various mannerisms in pictorial codices. Some representations are depicted as heads with flowing blood, a head being held by the hair, heads hung in an upside down position or with cords passing through cheeks or nostrils, heads on poles or worn as adornment, bodies with no head and serpents or blood flowing upwards, the action of decapitation in progress or completed, or skull burials where the mandible is articulated and a few vertebrae remain. Importance of heads as a symbol may have been influenced as early as the Formative Olmec period, and was used as a way to represent and honor Gods or rulers. On hieroglyphs found in [[Monte_Alb\u00e1n|Monte Alban]], evidence is seen with depictions of severed heads hanging upside under a place glyph. These are believed to record or denote the conquering of villages by the Monte Alban rulers <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Caso |first1=Alfonso |title=Calendario y escritura de las antiguas culturas de Monte Alban, Mexico |date=1947}}</ref> or in an astrological context, the place glyph can be interpreted as the Earth, and the upside-down head as planets or constellations passing by in their rotations <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leigh |first1=Howard |title=Zapotec Glyphs |journal=Bolet\u00edn de Estudios Oaxaquenos |volume=No.2}}</ref>. During the Classic period, heads were also found in between two bowls, which demonstrates continuity and further development of practices, as well as implying efforts of veneration by use of bowls. Heads were also used for adornment. At [[Yaxchilan]], there is evidence of necklaces made with headlets (shrunken heads) hanging upside down on an important figure. This method of display was most likely useful for war imagery, or as trophies to threaten enemies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Proskouriakoff |first1=Tatiana |title=A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture |journal=Carnegie Institutuon of Washington |date=1950 |pages=593}}</ref> During the Late Classic periods we also see heads used on headdresses and belts, depicted on murals at [[Bonampak]] and Yaxchilan. Severed heads are also believed to be associated with rituals involving agriculture, birth, fertility and death. This is seen in the [[Florentine Codex]] with the Tlacaxipehualiztli rituals, where [[Chicomec\u014d\u0101tl|Xilonen]], the goddess of tender maize, was sacrificed. Her head was struck off, and her heart torn out of her chest and then offered to the sun.{{fact|date=December 2019}} The [[Codex Borgia]] depicts the greatest number of decapitations, at 33 counted <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moser |first1=Christopher |title=Human Decapitation in Ancient Mesoamerica |journal=Studies in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology |date=1973}}</ref>.\n\n===Heart removal===\nHeart extractions and sacrifice has been viewed as a \u201csupreme religious expression among the ancient Maya <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tiesler |first1=Vera |last2=Cucina |first2=Andrea |title=Procedures in Human Heart Extraction and Ritual Meaning: A Taphonomic Assessment of Anthropogenic Marks in Classic Maya Skeletons |journal=Latin American Antiquity |date=20 January 2017 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=493\u2013510 |doi=10.2307/25063069|jstor=25063069 }}</ref>\u201d. The removal of the still beating heart, or sometimes [[self-immolation]] was considered a great offering and meal for the Gods. Like any moderns religious ritual, it is believed the extraction had multiple steps for preparation and proper respect for the Gods. It began with a dispersal of blood extracted either from the mouth, nose, ears, fingers, or penis, typically with a sharp tool made from animal bone, such as a sting ray spine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moser |first1=Christopher L. |title=Human decapitation in ancient Mesoamerica |journal=Studies in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology |date=1973 |issue=11 |pages=1\u201372 |jstor=41263421 }}</ref> They then positioned the victim on a stone or wooden altar. Next, access to the heart would be achieved with a variety of procedures and techniques. Most of these techniques were proved by examination of the post-mortem injuries on bones surrounding the heart, such as the sternum, and ribs. Methods include [[Sternotomy|vertical axial sternotomy]], left transverse [[thoracotomy]], transverse bilateral sternothoracotamy, or transdiaphragmatic access. Most probably access would be access from below the diaphragm, as this allowed for easy access and not much blockage from bones. Nicks, segmenting, and fracturing of the sternum and ribs all defended this. Following access, the heart was exposed for retrieval. If accessed through the sternum, the ribs would be pulled apart, or tissue would be cut through if accessed through the diaphragm. The actual removal of the heart would then be continued by cutting any attaching ligaments with a bifacial tool. Finally, offering of the heart would take place with either special positioning, or through burning. At this time, blood would also be collected from the victim. The ritual will end with mutilation of the body, usually through dismemberment, or burned. They would then dispose of the body or reutilize it for other purposes <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blos |first1=Vera Tiesler |last2=Cuccina |first2=Andrea |title=El sacrificio humano por extracci\u00f3n de coraz\u00f3n: Una evaluaci\u00f3n osteotafon\u00f3mica de violencia ritual entre los mayas del Cl\u00e1sico |journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya |date=2007 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=57\u201378 |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/oaiart?codigo=5627742 |issn=2448-5179}}</ref>.\n\nDuring the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period]] (c. 900\u20131524) the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the [[Aztec]]s in the [[Valley of Mexico]];<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\"/> this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temple]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p752\">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.</ref> The sacrifice was stripped and [[Maya Blue|painted blue]], which was the colour representing sacrifice, and was made to wear a peaked headdress.<ref name=\"SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139\"/>\n\nFour blue-painted attendants representing the four [[Chaac]]s of the cardinal directions stretched the sacrifice out over a convex stone that pushed the victim's chest upwards;<ref name=\"SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139\">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.

Wild 2008, p. 46.</ref> The ''nacom'' then passed the heart to the officiating priest, or ''chilan'', who smeared blood upon the image of the temple's deity.\n\nDepending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the four Chaacs would throw the corpse down the pyramid steps to the courtyard below, where it would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The ''chilan'' would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolised the rebirth of life. If it was a notably courageous warrior who had been sacrificed, then the corpse would be cut into portions and parts would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|eaten]] by attending warriors and other bystanders. The hands and feet were given to the ''chilan'' who, if they had belonged to a war captive, wore the bones as a trophy.<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p752\"/> Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.<ref name=\"TieslerCucina06p493\">Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 493.</ref>\n\n===Arrow sacrifice===\nSome rituals involved the sacrifice being killed with bow and arrows. The sacrificial victim was stripped and painted blue and made to wear a peaked cap, in a similar manner to the preparation for heart sacrifice. The victim was bound to a stake during a ritual dance, and blood was drawn from the genitals and smeared onto the image of the presiding deity. A white symbol was painted over the victim's heart, which served as a target for the archers. The dancers then passed in front of the sacrificial victim, shooting arrows in turn at the target until the whole chest was filled with arrows. Sacrifice with bow and arrow is recorded as far back as the Classic Period (c. 250-900), and was depicted with graffiti upon the walls of [[Tikal Temple II]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p752\"/> The ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' are a collection of Yucatec Maya poems written down in the mid-18th century; two poems deal with arrow sacrifice and they are believed to be copies of poems dating to the 15th century, during the Postclassic period.<ref>Edmonson 1982, p. 173.</ref> The first, called ''Little Arrow'', is a song calling upon the sacrifice to be brave and take comfort.<ref>Edmonson 1982, pp. 201\u2013202.</ref> The second is entitled ''Dance of the Archer'' and is a ritual dedicated to the rising sun; it includes instructions to the archer; the archer is instructed upon how to prepare his arrows and to dance three times around the sacrifice. The archer is instructed not to shoot until the second circuit, and to be careful to make sure that the sacrifice dies slowly. On the third circuit, whilst still dancing, the archer is instructed to shoot twice.<ref>Edmonson 1982, pp. 205\u2013206.</ref> A similar scene is described in the [[Annals of the Kaqchikels]], where an important prisoner is bound to a scaffold; the Kaqchikel warriors begin a ritual \"blood dance\" and proceed to shoot him full of arrows.<ref name=\"Akkeren99p283\"/> In the Late Postclassic [[K\u02bciche\u02bc language]] drama ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', an important war captive is tied to a stake representing the mythological Maize Tree and is sacrificed by being shot with arrows; the text compares the archers to hunters and the sacrifice to game.<ref>van Akkeren 1999, p. 281.</ref>\n\n===Bloodletting===\nBlood served a very important purpose in Maya culture.

At times the sacrificial victim was dressed as a deer. The intended sacrifice may have been publicly displayed and paraded before the act of sacrifice itself. Images of human sacrifice were often sculpted into the steps of [[Maya architecture]] and such stairways may have been the site of periodic sacrifice.<ref name=\"MillerTaube9303p96\"/> Ritual decapitation is well attested from [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic texts]] throughout the Classic period.<ref>Schele and Freidel 1991, pp. 311\u2013312n6.</ref> Evidence of mass sacrifice during the Classic period has not been recovered archaeologically.<ref>Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, pp. 96\u201397.</ref> Archaeological excavations at a number of sites, including [[Palenque]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Becan]], have uncovered skeletons that bear marks to the vertebrae and ribs consistent with heart extraction at the time of death using a long-bladed flint knife.<ref>Tiesler and Cucina 2006, pp. 493, 501, 503.</ref> During the Classic period, the sacrifice of companions to accompany high-ranking burials is likely to have been widespread and performed using the heart extraction method, leaving little evidence on skeletal remains.

The skulls placed here were typically from sacrificial rituals and victims. [[Chichen Itza]] had one of the largest, most elaborate skull racks during the Late Classical period. It was four levels high, and featured representational skulls carved into stone.

This site had dozens of ballcourts, and many were associated with ritualistic decapitations due to paraphernalia used in ritual practices. These large ball courts were sites of not only the ballgame, but also for ritualistic practices related to fertility. Many religious and political aspects were incorporated into ballcourts and games, making them have diverse purposes. These ballcourts were a major part in Maya dramatic display, and were used by rulers to demonstrate power and impress societies and followers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Sarah |title=Ancient Mexico & Central America : archaeology and culture history |isbn=978-0500290651 |edition=Thirdition|year=2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Postclassic period (900\u20131524)===\nA Postclassic mass burial in [[Champot\u00f3n, Campeche|Champot\u00f3n]] in [[Campeche]], Mexico, included skeletons bearing evidence of violent blows to the sternum that have been interpreted as evidence of heart sacrifice.<ref>Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 495.</ref> The [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]], a Postclassic hieroglyphic Maya book, has an illustration of sacrifice by heart extraction, with the victim stretched over an arched stone.<ref>Vail et al.

The figure at left holds the severed head of the figure at right, who spouts blood in the form of serpents from his neck]]\nDuring the [[pre-Columbian era]], '''human sacrifice in Maya culture''' was the ritual offering of nourishment to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]]. Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of a living creature was a powerful [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood offering]]. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in [[human sacrifice]]. Generally only high status prisoners of [[Maya warfare|war]] were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 751.</ref>\n\nHuman sacrifice among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] is evident from at least the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic period]] (c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;250\u2013900) right through to the final stages of the [[Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n|Spanish conquest]] in the 17th century. Human sacrifice is depicted in Classic [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]], is mentioned in Classic period [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] and has been verified archaeologically by analysis of skeletal remains from the Classic and [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] (c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;900\u20131524) periods. Additionally, human sacrifice is described in a number of late Maya and early Spanish colonial texts, including the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]'', the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc people|K\u02bciche\u02bc]] epic ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the K\u02bciche\u02bc ''[[T\u00edtulo de Totonicap\u00e1n]]'', the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc language]] ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', the ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' and [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]''.\n\nA number of methods were employed by the Maya, the most common being decapitation and heart extraction. Additional forms of sacrifice included ritually shooting the victim with arrows, hurling sacrifices into a deep [[sinkhole]], entombing alive to accompany a noble burial, tying the sacrifice into a ball for a ritual reenactment of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] and disembowelment.\n\n==Methods==\nA variety of methods were used by the ancient Maya to perform human sacrifice, such as:\n\n===Decapitation===\n{{Maya civilization}}\nImportant rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human sacrificial offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the [[Maya maize god]] by the [[Maya death gods]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\"/> In AD 738, the vassal king [[K\u02bcak\u02bc Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] of [[Quirigu\u00e1]] captured his overlord, [[Uaxaclajuun Ub\u02bcaah K\u02bcawiil]] of [[Cop\u00e1n]] and a few days later he ritually decapitated him;<ref>Miller 1999, pp.134\u201335. Looper 2003, p.76.</ref> such royal sacrifices were often recorded in [[Maya script]] with the \"ax event\" [[glyph]]. The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame]] reenacting the victory of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] over the gods of the [[Xibalba|underworld]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\"/>\n\nSacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]].<ref name=\"MillerTaube9303p96\">Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 96.</ref> Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted on [[relief]]s at [[Chichen Itza]] in two of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] (the Great Ballcourt and the Monjas Ballcourt).<ref>Gillespie 1991, pp. 321\u2013322.</ref> The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins (the Hero Twins themselves and their father and uncle) was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.<ref name=\"Gillespie91p322-323\">Gillespie 1991, pp. 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nDecapitation has appeared using various mannerisms in pictorial codices. Some representations are depicted as heads with flowing blood, a head being held by the hair, heads hung in an upside down position or with cords passing through cheeks or nostrils, heads on poles or worn as adornment, bodies with no head and serpents or blood flowing upwards, the action of decapitation in progress or completed, or skull burials where the mandible is articulated and a few vertebrae remain. Importance of heads as a symbol may have been influenced as early as the Formative Olmec period, and was used as a way to represent and honor Gods or rulers. On hieroglyphs found in [[Monte_Alb\u00e1n|Monte Alban]], evidence is seen with depictions of severed heads hanging upside under a place glyph. These are believed to record or denote the conquering of villages by the Monte Alban rulers <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Caso |first1=Alfonso |title=Calendario y escritura de las antiguas culturas de Monte Alban, Mexico |date=1947}}</ref> or in an astrological context, the place glyph can be interpreted as the Earth, and the upside-down head as planets or constellations passing by in their rotations <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leigh |first1=Howard |title=Zapotec Glyphs |journal=Bolet\u00edn de Estudios Oaxaquenos |volume=No.2}}</ref>. During the Classic period, heads were also found in between two bowls, which demonstrates continuity and further development of practices, as well as implying efforts of veneration by use of bowls. Heads were also used for adornment. At [[Yaxchilan]], there is evidence of necklaces made with headlets (shrunken heads) hanging upside down on an important figure. This method of display was most likely useful for war imagery, or as trophies to threaten enemies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Proskouriakoff |first1=Tatiana |title=A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture |journal=Carnegie Institutuon of Washington |date=1950 |pages=593}}</ref> During the Late Classic periods we also see heads used on headdresses and belts, depicted on murals at [[Bonampak]] and Yaxchilan. Severed heads are also believed to be associated with rituals involving agriculture, birth, fertility and death. This is seen in the [[Florentine Codex]] with the Tlacaxipehualiztli rituals, where [[Chicomec\u014d\u0101tl|Xilonen]], the goddess of tender maize, was sacrificed. Her head was struck off, and her heart torn out of her chest and then offered to the sun.{{fact|date=December 2019}} The [[Codex Borgia]] depicts the greatest number of decapitations, at 33 counted <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moser |first1=Christopher |title=Human Decapitation in Ancient Mesoamerica |journal=Studies in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology |date=1973}}</ref>.\n\n===Heart removal===\nHeart extractions and sacrifice has been viewed as a \u201csupreme religious expression among the ancient Maya <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tiesler |first1=Vera |last2=Cucina |first2=Andrea |title=Procedures in Human Heart Extraction and Ritual Meaning: A Taphonomic Assessment of Anthropogenic Marks in Classic Maya Skeletons |journal=Latin American Antiquity |date=20 January 2017 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=493\u2013510 |doi=10.2307/25063069|jstor=25063069 }}</ref>\u201d. The removal of the still beating heart, or sometimes [[self-immolation]] was considered a great offering and meal for the Gods. Like any moderns religious ritual, it is believed the extraction had multiple steps for preparation and proper respect for the Gods. It began with a dispersal of blood extracted either from the mouth, nose, ears, fingers, or penis, typically with a sharp tool made from animal bone, such as a sting ray spine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moser |first1=Christopher L. |title=Human decapitation in ancient Mesoamerica |journal=Studies in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology |date=1973 |issue=11 |pages=1\u201372 |jstor=41263421 }}</ref> They then positioned the victim on a stone or wooden altar. Next, access to the heart would be achieved with a variety of procedures and techniques. Most of these techniques were proved by examination of the post-mortem injuries on bones surrounding the heart, such as the sternum, and ribs. Methods include [[Sternotomy|vertical axial sternotomy]], left transverse [[thoracotomy]], transverse bilateral sternothoracotamy, or transdiaphragmatic access. Most probably access would be access from below the diaphragm, as this allowed for easy access and not much blockage from bones. Nicks, segmenting, and fracturing of the sternum and ribs all defended this. Following access, the heart was exposed for retrieval. If accessed through the sternum, the ribs would be pulled apart, or tissue would be cut through if accessed through the diaphragm. The actual removal of the heart would then be continued by cutting any attaching ligaments with a bifacial tool. Finally, offering of the heart would take place with either special positioning, or through burning. At this time, blood would also be collected from the victim. The ritual will end with mutilation of the body, usually through dismemberment, or burned. They would then dispose of the body or reutilize it for other purposes <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blos |first1=Vera Tiesler |last2=Cuccina |first2=Andrea |title=El sacrificio humano por extracci\u00f3n de coraz\u00f3n: Una evaluaci\u00f3n osteotafon\u00f3mica de violencia ritual entre los mayas del Cl\u00e1sico |journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya |date=2007 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=57\u201378 |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/oaiart?codigo=5627742 |issn=2448-5179}}</ref>.\n\nDuring the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period]] (c. 900\u20131524) the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the [[Aztec]]s in the [[Valley of Mexico]];<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p751\"/> this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temple]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p752\">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.</ref> The sacrifice was stripped and [[Maya Blue|painted blue]], which was the colour representing sacrifice, and was made to wear a peaked headdress.<ref name=\"SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139\"/>\n\nFour blue-painted attendants representing the four [[Chaac]]s of the cardinal directions stretched the sacrifice out over a convex stone that pushed the victim's chest upwards;<ref name=\"SharerTraxler2006p752ReadGonzalex2000p139\">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.

Wild 2008, p. 46.</ref> The ''nacom'' then passed the heart to the officiating priest, or ''chilan'', who smeared blood upon the image of the temple's deity.\n\nDepending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the four Chaacs would throw the corpse down the pyramid steps to the courtyard below, where it would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The ''chilan'' would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolised the rebirth of life. If it was a notably courageous warrior who had been sacrificed, then the corpse would be cut into portions and parts would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|eaten]] by attending warriors and other bystanders. The hands and feet were given to the ''chilan'' who, if they had belonged to a war captive, wore the bones as a trophy.<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p752\"/> Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.<ref name=\"TieslerCucina06p493\">Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 493.</ref>\n\n===Arrow sacrifice===\nSome rituals involved the sacrifice being killed with bow and arrows. The sacrificial victim was stripped and painted blue and made to wear a peaked cap, in a similar manner to the preparation for heart sacrifice. The victim was bound to a stake during a ritual dance, and blood was drawn from the genitals and smeared onto the image of the presiding deity. A white symbol was painted over the victim's heart, which served as a target for the archers. The dancers then passed in front of the sacrificial victim, shooting arrows in turn at the target until the whole chest was filled with arrows. Sacrifice with bow and arrow is recorded as far back as the Classic Period (c. 250-900), and was depicted with graffiti upon the walls of [[Tikal Temple II]].<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p752\"/> The ''[[Songs of Dzitbalche]]'' are a collection of Yucatec Maya poems written down in the mid-18th century; two poems deal with arrow sacrifice and they are believed to be copies of poems dating to the 15th century, during the Postclassic period.<ref>Edmonson 1982, p. 173.</ref> The first, called ''Little Arrow'', is a song calling upon the sacrifice to be brave and take comfort.<ref>Edmonson 1982, pp. 201\u2013202.</ref> The second is entitled ''Dance of the Archer'' and is a ritual dedicated to the rising sun; it includes instructions to the archer; the archer is instructed upon how to prepare his arrows and to dance three times around the sacrifice. The archer is instructed not to shoot until the second circuit, and to be careful to make sure that the sacrifice dies slowly. On the third circuit, whilst still dancing, the archer is instructed to shoot twice.<ref>Edmonson 1982, pp. 205\u2013206.</ref> A similar scene is described in the [[Annals of the Kaqchikels]], where an important prisoner is bound to a scaffold; the Kaqchikel warriors begin a ritual \"blood dance\" and proceed to shoot him full of arrows.<ref name=\"Akkeren99p283\"/> In the Late Postclassic [[K\u02bciche\u02bc language]] drama ''[[Rabinal Achi]]'', an important war captive is tied to a stake representing the mythological Maize Tree and is sacrificed by being shot with arrows; the text compares the archers to hunters and the sacrifice to game.<ref>van Akkeren 1999, p. 281.</ref>\n\n===Bloodletting===\nBlood served a very important purpose in Maya culture.

Animals such as quail, turkeys, deer and dogs were commonly used. Quail were considered \u201cclean and pure\u201d to the Zapotec, because they drank water from dew drops, and not \u201cdirty water\u201d sources.

At times the sacrificial victim was dressed as a deer. The intended sacrifice may have been publicly displayed and paraded before the act of sacrifice itself. Images of human sacrifice were often sculpted into the steps of [[Maya architecture]] and such stairways may have been the site of periodic sacrifice.<ref name=\"MillerTaube9303p96\"/> Ritual decapitation is well attested from [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic texts]] throughout the Classic period.<ref>Schele and Freidel 1991, pp. 311\u2013312n6.</ref> Evidence of mass sacrifice during the Classic period has not been recovered archaeologically.<ref>Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, pp. 96\u201397.</ref> Archaeological excavations at a number of sites, including [[Palenque]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Becan]], have uncovered skeletons that bear marks to the vertebrae and ribs consistent with heart extraction at the time of death using a long-bladed flint knife.<ref>Tiesler and Cucina 2006, pp. 493, 501, 503.</ref> During the Classic period, the sacrifice of companions to accompany high-ranking burials is likely to have been widespread and performed using the heart extraction method, leaving little evidence on skeletal remains.

The skulls placed here were typically from sacrificial rituals and victims. [[Chichen Itza]] had one of the largest, most elaborate skull racks during the Late Classical period. It was four levels high, and featured representational skulls carved into stone. These skull racks were strongly associated with ballgames, and sacrificial decapitations<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Sarah |title=Ancient Mexico & Central America : archaeology and culture history |isbn=978-0500290651 |edition=Thirdition|year=2013 }}</ref>. In [[El Tajin]], there is a rise in ball-court associated rituals. This site had dozens of ballcourts, and many were associated with ritualistic decapitations due to paraphernalia used in ritual practices. These large ball courts were sites of not only the ballgame, but also for ritualistic practices related to fertility. Many religious and political aspects were incorporated into ballcourts and games, making them have diverse purposes. These ballcourts were a major part in Maya dramatic display, and were used by rulers to demonstrate power and impress societies and followers<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Sarah |title=Ancient Mexico & Central America : archaeology and culture history |isbn=978-0500290651 |edition=Thirdition|year=2013 }}</ref>.\n\n===Postclassic period (900\u20131524)===\nA Postclassic mass burial in [[Champot\u00f3n, Campeche|Champot\u00f3n]] in [[Campeche]], Mexico, included skeletons bearing evidence of violent blows to the sternum that have been interpreted as evidence of heart sacrifice.<ref>Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 495.</ref> The [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]], a Postclassic hieroglyphic Maya book, has an illustration of sacrifice by heart extraction, with the victim stretched over an arched stone.<ref>Vail et al.

Writing at the end of the 17th century, [[Francisco Xim\u00e9nez]] described the tradition that upon the temple of [[Tohil]], human sacrifices were tied before the representation of the deity, where the priest would open the victim's chest and cut out his heart.<ref>Carmack 2001, pp.356-357.</ref> After sacrifice, the victim's body was probably hurled down the front stairway of the temple where his head would be severed to be placed on a [[Tzompantli|skull rack]] that was located in front of the temple.<ref>Carmack 2001, p.360.</ref> In the K\u02bciche\u02bc epic [[Popol Vuh]], the god Tohil demands his right to suckle from his people, as an infant to its mother, but Tohil suckled upon human blood from the chest of the sacrificial victim.<ref>Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 170.</ref> The ''Popol Vuh'' also describes how the Hero Twin Hunahpu was sacrificed with both the removal of his heart and his head.<ref name=\"Gillespie91p322-323\"/> Human sacrifice was probably also performed to the K\u02bciche\u02bc mountain god [[Jacawitz]].<ref>Carmack 2001, pp. 369\u2013370.</ref> Human sacrifice is also mentioned in the K\u02bciche\u02bc document ''[[T\u00edtulo de Totonicap\u00e1n]]'' (\"Title of Totonicap\u00e1n\"). A long passage describing human sacrifice is difficult to interpret but features heart and arrow sacrifice, the flaying of the victim and wearing of his skin in a manner similar to the Aztec rituals associated with their god [[Xipe Totec]], and mention of the sacrificial knife of Tohil.<ref>van Akkeren 1999, pp. 284\u2013285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Madrid Codex sacrifice scene p76.jpg|thumb|right|A section of page 76 of the Madrid Codex, depicting sacrifice by heart extraction]]\nThe [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya, neighbours of the K\u02bciche\u02bc, also practised human sacrifice.

A [[codex]] is an ancient manuscript made on sheets of paper, or paper-like materials. These records usually contain information pertinent to that era and people and detail many cultural and ritualistic aspects of life. Much of what is known from Maya culture is gathered from these books. Maya codices contain glyph like imagery that is related to deities, sacrifices, rituals, moon phases, planet movements, and calendars<ref>{{cite web |title=The Maya Codices - Archaeology Magazine |url=https://www.archaeology.org/issues/44-1211/features/maya-2012/305-groiler-dresden-codex |website=www.archaeology.org}}</ref>. Three codices that are considered legitimate are the [[Codex Dresdensis|Dresden]], [[Codex Madrid (Leonardo)|Madrid]], and [[Paris Codex|Paris]] Codices. These codices all feature depictions of human sacrificial rituals such as heart extractions and decapitations.\n\n===Rock Art===\nHuman sacrifices have also been depicted on rock art at [[Chalcatzingo]] sites. One depiction includes four people, with three standing and one sitting. The sitting person is tied up, and nude. The standing figures are dressed in a manner that indicated they are the ones carrying out the ritual. They are wearing headdresses, decorative belts, and capes, and holding a club-like weapon. One of the individuals is holding a staff that was linked to agricultural fertility, possible denoting the purpose of the sacrificial ritual<ref>{{cite journal |title=Olmec Ferox: Ritual Human Sacrifice IN THE ROCK ART OF CHALCATZINGO, MORELOS}}</ref>. Other tropes include the victims wearing minimal garments, lying in prone positions to demonstrate lack of power, and sometimes are dressed in headdresses, diadems, animal-like masks, or other adornments that indicate a high-status victim. The Chalcatzingo site has also provided evidence for an uncommon type of human sacrifice, being beaten to death with clubs. Animals are also depicted in rock art related to sacrifices. One depiction includes a feline disemboweling a human with its paws.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}<!--BEGIN biblio format. -->\n* {{cite journal |author=van Akkeren, Ruud |date=July 1999 |title=Sacrifice at the Maize Tree: ''Rab\u02bcinal Achi'' in its historical and symbolic context |journal=Ancient Mesoamerica |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=281\u2013295 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |issn=0956-5361 |oclc=364022517 |location=New York, USA |doi=10.1017/s0956536199102104}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bracamonte y Sosa, Pedro |year=2001 |title=La conquista inconclusa de Yucat\u00e1n: los mayas de las monta\u00f1as, 1560-1680 |language=es |publisher=Centro de Investogaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog\u00eda Social, Universidad de Quintana Roo |location=Mexico City, Mexico |isbn=970-701-159-9 |oclc=49519206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSQxJQWPvR0C&pg=PA368}}\n* {{cite book |author=Carmack, Robert M.   |authorlink=Robert M.

He is an effective server and can hit powerfully from both his forehand and backhand. But, like many of the Tour's more powerful players, consistency is an issue.<ref name=\"realsport101.com\"/> Hurkacz plays solidly from the back of the court. He plays a low, flat and dangerous ball, while holding the ball in the court. Everyone talks about his serve and forehand, but his backhand is even better than his forehand. All in all, he is an excellent, versatile player who can attack, accelerate and defend, believes former top 10 player [[Wojciech Fibak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sportowefakty.wp.pl/tenis/809964/wojciech-fibak-pod-wrazeniem-gry-huberta-hurkacza-kroi-sie-nam-wielki-sportowiec|title=Wojciech Fibak pod wra\u017ceniem gry Huberta Hurkacza. \"Kroi si\u0119 nam wielki sportowiec\" - WP SportoweFakty|first=Wirtualna Polska|last=Media|date=13 March 2019|website=sportowefakty.wp.pl}}</ref>\n\n===Coaches===\nIn the early years (2010\u20132016), Hurkacz was coached by Filip Ka\u0144czu\u0142a. In 2017, he continued with Wroc\u0142aw coaches Alexander Charpantidis and Pawe\u0142 Stadniczenko, who shaped the tennis career of [[Micha\u0142 Przysi\u0119\u017cny]], while Przemys\u0142aw Piotrowicz was responsible for physical preparation. In 2018, \"Hubi\" decided to work with [[New Zealanders|New Zealander]] Rene Moller, who appeared at his side during the [[2018 Next Generation ATP Finals|Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan later that same year]]. Under his leadership, Hurkacz won the [[ATP Challenger Tour|Challenger]] in [[Canberra]] and strengthened himself in the top 100. At the 2019 BNP Paribas Open, Hurkacz began his coaching partnership with Craig Boynton, who worked with such players as [[Jim Courier]], [[Mardy Fish]], [[John Isner]], [[Sam Querrey]] and Steve

At the [[2020 Dubai Tennis Championships]] Hurkacz will face [[Alexander Bublik]] in the first round.\n\n===Playing style and equipment===\nHurkacz is a big-hitter, which is no surprise given that he stands 6\u20195\u201d. He is an effective server and can hit powerfully from both his forehand and backhand. But, like many of the Tour's more powerful players, consistency is an issue.<ref name=\"realsport101.com\"/> Hurkacz plays solidly from the back of the court. He plays a low, flat and dangerous ball, while holding the ball in the court. Everyone talks about his serve and forehand, but his backhand is even better than his forehand. All in all, he is an excellent, versatile player who can attack, accelerate and defend, believes former top 10 player [[Wojciech Fibak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sportowefakty.wp.pl/tenis/809964/wojciech-fibak-pod-wrazeniem-gry-huberta-hurkacza-kroi-sie-nam-wielki-sportowiec|title=Wojciech Fibak pod wra\u017ceniem gry Huberta Hurkacza. \"Kroi si\u0119 nam wielki sportowiec\" - WP SportoweFakty|first=Wirtualna Polska|last=Media|date=13 March 2019|website=sportowefakty.wp.pl}}</ref>\n\n===Coaches===\nIn the early years (2010\u20132016), Hurkacz was coached by Filip Ka\u0144czu\u0142a. In 2017, he continued with Wroc\u0142aw coaches Alexander Charpantidis and Pawe\u0142 Stadniczenko, who shaped the tennis career of [[Micha\u0142 Przysi\u0119\u017cny]], while Przemys\u0142aw Piotrowicz was responsible for physical preparation. In 2018, \"Hubi\" decided to work with [[New Zealanders|New Zealander]] Rene Moller, who appeared at his side during the [[2018 Next Generation ATP Finals|Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan later that same year]]. Under his leadership, Hurkacz won the [[ATP Challenger Tour|Challenger]] in [[Canberra]] and strengthened himself in the top 100. At the 2019 BNP Paribas Open, Hurkacz began his coaching partnership with Craig Boynton, who worked with such players as [[Jim Courier]], [[Mardy Fish]], [[John Isner]], [[Sam Querrey]] and Steve Johnson.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==ATP Tour career finals==\n\n===Singles: 1 (1 title)===\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Legend\n|- style=\"background:#f3e6d7;\"\n|Grand Slam

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up

degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but research has indicated that the [[Pharynx|pharynx]] reaches peak [[Viral load|viral load]] approximately four days after infection.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in

unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\"

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in

unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref

study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching

found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

He took his [[LLB]] at the law department of the [[University of Virginia]] at [[Charlottesville]] in 1903, was admitted to the bar in 1904 and practiced in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], he was assistant general counsel to the Federal [[Alien Property Custodian]]. From 1918 to 1922 he was [[Commonwealth's Attorney]] of Alexandria. He served as a judge 1922 to 1930 (he was often referred to as \"Judge Smith\" even while in Congress), and also engaged in [[banking]], [[farming]], and [[dairying]].\n\n==Representative==\nHe was elected in 1930 to the House of Representatives. He initially supported [[New Deal]] measures such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act and the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]]. A leader of the [[conservative coalition]], he led the opposition to the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), established by the [[Wagner Act]] of 1935. Conservatives created a special House committee to investigate the NLRB that was headed by Smith and dominated by opponents of the New Deal. The committee conducted a sensationalist investigation that undermined public support for the NLRB and, more broadly, for the New Deal. In June 1940, amendments proposed by the Smith Committee passed by a large margin in the House, partly because Smith's new alliance with [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]], president of the [[American Federation of Labor]]. The AFL was convinced the NLRB was controlled by leftists who supported the rival [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] in organizing drives. New Dealers stopped the Smith amendments, but Roosevelt replaced the CIO-oriented members on the NLRB with men acceptable to Smith and the AFL.<ref>Storrs, p. 212.</ref>\n\nSmith proposed the [[anticommunist]] Alien Registration Act of 1940 {{UnitedStatesCode|18|2385}}, which became known as the [[Smith Act]]. It required [[resident alien]]s to register. It also banned advocating the overthrow of the [[US government]] or its political subdivisions. [[American Communist Party]] chairman [[Gus Hall]] was one of many communists later convicted of violating its provisions. The [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957) that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protected much radical speech, which halted Smith Act prosecutions under the Act.\n\n===Opposition to civil rights===\nAs chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules]] starting in 1954,<ref name=\"DesMoinesRegister\">{{cite news|title=People in the News...83, Runs Again|publisher=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=March 3, 1966}}</ref> Smith controlled the flow of legislation in the House. An opponent of racial integration, Smith used his power as chairman of the Rules Committee to keep much civil rights legislation from coming to a vote on the House floor.\n\nHe was a signatory to the 1956 [[Southern Manifesto]] that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. A friend described him as someone who \"had a real feeling of kindness toward the black people he knew, but he did not respect the race.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref>\"\n\nWhen the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] came before Smith's committee, Smith said, \"The Southern people have never accepted the colored race as a race of people who had equal intelligence and education and social attainments as the whole people of the South.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=YpFWUrynUl4C&pg=PT154&lpg=PT154&dq=%22The+Southern+people+have+never+accepted+the+colored+race+as+a+race+of+people+who+had+equal+intelligence%22&source=bl&ots=jZ3s0JLtiX&sig=ACfU3U0LBDwBbjiwzbWWaxSUOTk8vo0njQ&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjxoNj52sTjAhWVD2MBHbB1BAYQ6AEwBHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Southern%20people%20have%20never%20accepted%20the%20colored%20race%20as%20a%20race%20of%20people%20who%20had%20equal%20intelligence%22&f=false|title=Nobody Turn Me Around: A People's History of the 1963 March on Washington|last=Euchner|first=Charles|date=2010-09-25|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807095522|language=en}}</ref>\" Others noted him as an apologist for slavery who used the [[Slavery in ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Romans]] in its defense<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nSpeaker [[Sam Rayburn]] tried to reduce his power in 1961, with only limited success.\n\nSmith delayed passage the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. One of Rayburn's reforms was the \"Twenty-One Day Rule\" that required a bill to be sent to the floor within 21 days. Under pressure, Smith released the bill.\n\nTwo days before the vote, Smith offered an amendment to insert \"sex\" after the word \"religion\" as a [[protected class]] of [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The ''Congressional Record'' shows Smith made serious arguments, voicing concerns that white women would suffer greater discrimination without a protection for gender.<ref name=\"Gold\"/> Liberals, who knew Smith was hostile to civil rights for blacks, assumed that he was doing so to defeat the whole bill.<ref>Clinton Jacob Woods, \"Strange Bedfellows: Congressman Howard W. Smith and the Inclusion of Sex Discrimination in the 1964 Civil Rights Act,\" ''Southern Studies,'' 16 (Spring\u2013Summer 2009), 1\u201332.</ref><ref name=Freeman/> In 1968, Leo Kanowitz wrote that, within the context of the anti-civil rights coalition making \"every effort to block\" the passage of Title VII, \"it is abundantly clear that a principal motive in introducing [\"sex\"] was to prevent passage of the basic legislation being considered by Congress, rather than solicitude for women's employment rights.\"<ref>Leo Kanowitz, ''Sex-Based Discrimination in American Law III: Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act of 1963'', 20 Hastings L.

He took his [[LLB]] at the law department of the [[University of Virginia]] at [[Charlottesville]] in 1903, was admitted to the bar in 1904 and practiced in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], he was assistant general counsel to the Federal [[Alien Property Custodian]]. From 1918 to 1922 he was [[Commonwealth's Attorney]] of Alexandria. He served as a judge 1922 to 1930 (he was often referred to as \"Judge Smith\" even while in Congress), and also engaged in [[banking]], [[farming]], and [[dairying]].\n\n==Representative==\nHe was elected in 1930 to the House of Representatives. He initially supported [[New Deal]] measures such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act and the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]]. A leader of the [[conservative coalition]], he led the opposition to the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), established by the [[Wagner Act]] of 1935. Conservatives created a special House committee to investigate the NLRB that was headed by Smith and dominated by opponents of the New Deal. The committee conducted a sensationalist investigation that undermined public support for the NLRB and, more broadly, for the New Deal. In June 1940, amendments proposed by the Smith Committee passed by a large margin in the House, partly because Smith's new alliance with [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]], president of the [[American Federation of Labor]]. The AFL was convinced the NLRB was controlled by leftists who supported the rival [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] in organizing drives. New Dealers stopped the Smith amendments, but Roosevelt replaced the CIO-oriented members on the NLRB with men acceptable to Smith and the AFL.<ref>Storrs, p. 212.</ref>\n\nSmith proposed the [[anticommunist]] Alien Registration Act of 1940 {{UnitedStatesCode|18|2385}}, which became known as the [[Smith Act]]. It required [[resident alien]]s to register. It also banned advocating the overthrow of the [[US government]] or its political subdivisions. [[American Communist Party]] chairman [[Gus Hall]] was one of many communists later convicted of violating its provisions. The [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957) that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protected much radical speech, which halted Smith Act prosecutions under the Act.\n\n===Opposition to civil rights===\nAs chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules]] starting in 1954,<ref name=\"DesMoinesRegister\">{{cite news|title=People in the News...83, Runs Again|publisher=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=March 3, 1966}}</ref> Smith controlled the flow of legislation in the House. An opponent of racial integration, Smith used his power as chairman of the Rules Committee to keep much civil rights legislation from coming to a vote on the House floor.\n\nHe was a signatory to the 1956 [[Southern Manifesto]] that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v.

Under pressure, Smith released the bill.\n\nTwo days before the vote, Smith offered an amendment to insert \"sex\" after the word \"religion\" as a [[protected class]] of [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

Emperor Haile Selassie pleaded to the [[League of Nations]] for aid in resisting the Italians. Nevertheless, the country was formally occupied on 9 May 1936 and the Emperor went into exile.\n\nThe war was full of cruelty: the Ethiopians used [[Dum-dum]] bullets (prohibited by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] of 1899, Declaration IV, 3) and the Italians used gas (prohibited under the [[Geneva Protocol]] of 1922).<ref>Antonicelli, Franco.

Following a failed attack against Addis Ababa by rebels on 28 July 1936, he had the archbishop of Dessie, whom he suspected of being behind the attack shot the same afternoon. All resisting Ethiopians were declared \"bandits\" and he ordered that they be shot on capture. Mussolini approved the decision but requested that the order be kept secret. Following the defeat of rebels led by Ras Desta in the western part of the country in late December 1936, he had 1600 rebel troops who surrendered summarily executed by firing squads. Villages that had been friendly to Desta were burned to the ground and women and children shot. Desta and other captured rebel leaders were executed in February 1937. The Italians undertook many other terrorist actions during this period. Following a bloody attempt on the life of Graziani and other Italian officials by two Eritreans during a ceremony to celebrate the birth of the [[Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples|Prince of Naples]] on 19 February 1937, the police and soldiers, fearing a general uprising, fired indiscriminately into the crowd. Innocent bystanders were shot. For the next three days, the Italians, led by the [[Blackshirts]], went on a rampage of murder and destruction throughout Addis Ababa. By the end of 1937 more than 5000 people had been executed for alleged crimes related to the attempt against Graziani. Among them were virtually all the young educated Ethiopians the Italians could lay their hands on and all the officiers and cadets of the Holeta Military Academy. The Italian viceroy had hermits, soothsayers and travelling minstrels rounded up and executed. Convinced that the high clergy had known about the plot, he had many executed. In May 1937, he ordered 297 monks of the monastery of [[Debre Libanos]] and 23 other individuals suspected of complicity shot. Over 100 deacons and students were also executed. Several hundred monks were sent to concentration camps. Viceroy Graziani was finally replaced in November 1938 by the more humane [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]], who put an end to wanton atrocities which had had the effect of increasing resistance to Italian domination.<ref>Paul B.

The route was enlarged to 6,379&nbsp;km and initially joined [[Rome]] with [[Addis Ababa]] via [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Benghazi]], [[Cairo]], [[Wadi Halfa]], [[Khartoum]], [[Kassala]], [[Asmara]], [[Dire Dawa]].<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/africa_res-2a855323-8b74-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Treccani: Via dell'Impero (in Italian)]</ref> There was a change of aircraft in [[Benghazi]] (or sometimes in [[Tripoli-Castel Benito Airport|Tripoli]]). The route was carried out in three and a half days of daytime flight and the frequency was four flights per week in both directions.

Special maternity wards were built in the hospitals situated in the main locations.

At the heart of the city were the markets: in the capital (Addis Ababa) in 1939 over 75,000 heads of cattle had been slaughtered and thousands of tons of foodstuffs had been sold. Dozens of shops and even department stores were opened in both cities.

Following a failed attack against Addis Ababa by rebels on 28 July 1936, he had the archbishop of Dessie, whom he suspected of being behind the attack shot the same afternoon. All resisting Ethiopians were declared \"bandits\" and he ordered that they be shot on capture. Mussolini approved the decision but requested that the order be kept secret. Following the defeat of rebels led by Ras Desta in the western part of the country in late December 1936, he had 1600 rebel troops who surrendered summarily executed by firing squads. Villages that had been friendly to Desta were burned to the ground and women and children shot. Desta and other captured rebel leaders were executed in February 1937. The Italians undertook many other terrorist actions during this period. Following a bloody attempt on the life of Graziani and other Italian officials by two Eritreans during a ceremony to celebrate the birth of the [[Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples|Prince of Naples]] on 19 February 1937, the police and soldiers, fearing a general uprising, fired indiscriminately into the crowd. Innocent bystanders were shot. For the next three days, the Italians, led by the [[Blackshirts]], went on a rampage of murder and destruction throughout Addis Ababa. By the end of 1937 more than 5000 people had been executed for alleged crimes related to the attempt against Graziani. Among them were virtually all the young educated Ethiopians the Italians could lay their hands on and all the officiers and cadets of the Holeta Military Academy. The Italian viceroy had hermits, soothsayers and travelling minstrels rounded up and executed. Convinced that the high clergy had known about the plot, he had many executed. In May 1937, he ordered 297 monks of the monastery of [[Debre Libanos]] and 23 other individuals suspected of complicity shot. Over 100 deacons and students were also executed. Several hundred monks were sent to concentration camps. Viceroy Graziani was finally replaced in November 1938 by the more humane [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]], who put an end to wanton atrocities which had had the effect of increasing resistance to Italian domination.<ref>Paul B.
