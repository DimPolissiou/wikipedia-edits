The album earned her many awards, including eight [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], two [[American Music Awards]], and a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 for [[Best Contemporary R&B Album]]. The album has since been certified [[triple platinum]] in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide.<ref name=\":3\" /> The lead single for the album, \"[[Foolish (Ashanti song)|Foolish]]\", was a critical and commercial success; it reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. With \"Foolish\", she became the second artist (after [[The Beatles]]) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti wrote and sang for [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s \"[[Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)]]\", which also reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"Ashanti Biography\">[https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_rewind.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&g=Singles&y=5 \"Billboard Chart Rewind\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216232357/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_rewind.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&g=Singles&y=5|date=December 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Ashanti released her second album, ''[[Chapter II (Ashanti album)|Chapter II]]'', which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went [[Platinum record|platinum]], selling over 1.5 million copies in U.S. since its release.<ref name=\":1\" /> The album's singles, \"[[Rock wit U (Awww Baby)]]\" and \"[[Rain On Me]]\", were both commercial successes, peaking at number two and number seven on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, respectively. ''Chapter II'' was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and \"Rock wit U (Awww Baby)\" and \"Rain on Me\" were each nominated in the categories of Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.

In this way, toxins are [[biomagnification|concentrated upward]] within ocean [[food chain]]s. Many particles combine chemically in a manner which depletes oxygen, causing [[estuary|estuaries]] to become [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]]. [[Pesticide]]s and [[toxic metal]]s are similarly incorporated into marine food webs, harming the biological health of marine life. Many [[compound feed|animal feeds]] have a high [[fish meal]] or [[fish hydrolysate]] content. In this way, marine toxins are transferred back to farmed land animals, and then to humans.\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] concentrations have increased over the last century in coastal waters, and more recently have declined in the open ocean.

''[[Mnemiopsis leidyi]]'', a species of comb jellyfish that spread so it now inhabits estuaries in many parts of the world, was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the [[Black Sea]] in a ship's ballast water. The population of the jellyfish grew exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local [[fishing industry]]. \"The [[anchovy]] catch fell from 204,000 tons in 1984 to 200 tons in 1993; [[sprat]] from 24,600 tons in 1984 to 12,000 tons in 1993; horse [[mackerel]] from 4,000 tons in 1984 to zero in 1993.\"<ref name=\"Meinesz\">Meinesz, A.

In this way, toxins are [[biomagnification|concentrated upward]] within ocean [[food chain]]s. Many particles combine chemically in a manner which depletes oxygen, causing [[estuary|estuaries]] to become [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]]. [[Pesticide]]s and [[toxic metal]]s are similarly incorporated into marine food webs, harming the biological health of marine life. Many [[compound feed|animal feeds]] have a high [[fish meal]] or [[fish hydrolysate]] content. In this way, marine toxins are transferred back to farmed land animals, and then to humans.\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] concentrations have increased over the last century in coastal waters, and more recently have declined in the open ocean. Increases in nutrient runoff from land may explain the increases in coastal phytoplankton, while warming surface temperatures in the open ocean may have strengthened stratification in the water column, reducing the flow of nutrients from the deep that open ocean phytoplankton find useful.<ref>Boyce, D.G. and [[Boris Worm|Worm, B.]] (2015) \"Patterns and ecological implications of historical marine phytoplankton change\".

{"title_page": "National Scholastic Surfing Association", "text_new": "The '''National Scholastic Surfing Association''' ('''NSSA''') is a [[surfing]] association in the United States. It is a member organization of Surfing America, the National Governing Body of Surfing in the United States. Founded in 1978 by Tom Gibbons, John Rothrock, Chuck Allen, Laird Hayes, Holly Allen and Rob Hill, the association was formed with the purpose of uniting amateur surfers from around the country under one competitive association tied to the education system.  Since much of the membership consists of students, one of the prerequisites in joining the association is the maintenance of good grades, service to community and an interest in the sport of surfing.\n\nOn February 4, 1978, a group of surf coaches met in Huntington Beach to form a new surfing association for amateur high school and college surfers.\n\nThose present at the meeting voted to name the new entity, the NATIONAL SCHOLASTIC SURFING ASSOCIATION (NSSA).  Several very important resolutions were quickly adopted.  Since membership would consist of students, it was important that any fees established for competitors be minimal.  A fee of $1 per year was voted for student membership and $5 a year for supporting members.  If additional monies were needed, the group decided it would be raised by other means.\n\nThe group agreed to do the utmost to improve the image of the surfer and to stress water safety and fair play in the water.  One way to accomplish this is through supervised surf contests.  Surfers competing on teams are required to maintain the same academic standards as athletes participating in football and other sports.\n\nAnother important resolution adopted was one to allow any NSSA surfer to retain his/her right to also surf in any other amateur surfing associations.\n\nThe next step was to elect officers that had the clout to put things together.  Dr. Laird Hayes, Assistant Dean of Students at Orange Coast College was elected Vice President.  Laird was asked to formulate a scholarship program for the NSSA.  Since financial management would be critical, Chuck Allen surf coach of the El Toro Surf Team and Senior VP of a large savings & loan, was elected Treasurer.  His wife, Holly, was elected Secretary.  Rob Hill, wood shop teacher at Huntington Beach High School and coach of their surf team, was elected Competition Director.  John Rothrock, Director of the Student Career Center at Edison High School and coach of their surf team, was elected Publicity Director.  John also had a background in printing, thus adding that dimension to his post.  Jim Clark, an executive with a large, international insurance company located in San Francisco, was elected Membership Chairman.  Tom Gibbons, surf coach at Marina High School and at California State University Long Beach was elected President.\n\nThe last item for discussion was perhaps the most important.  Since everyone present was interested in founding a surfing association that would last and be meaningful, a Resolution was adopted authorizing President Tom Gibbons to approach the most respected and influential people in the surfing community and ask for their support.\n\nShortly thereafter, the following people had been contacted and had agreed to serve on the NSSA Board of Advisers:\nVince Moorhouse, Director of Harbors and Beaches and President of Would Life Saving.  Dr. Jake Abbott, Superintendent of Huntington Beach Union High School District, the first District in the United States to offer surfing as a letter sport.  Rus Calisch, Advertising Director of Skateboarder Magazine and Executive Director of the United States Surfing Association.  Bill Dinnie, owner of Sunline Surfboards in Huntington Beach and one of the most sought after surf judges in Southern California.  Jim Jenks, President of Ocean Pacific and long-time surfer.  Nancy Katin, truly the first lady of surfing and sponsor of the annual Katin Pro-Am Contest.  Bob Mignogna, Business Director of SURFING MAGAZINE and ultra-hot surfer.  Hugh Murphy, probation officer with the City of Los Angeles and Executive Director of the Western Surfing Association.  Dennis Mangers, California Assemblyman from Huntington Beach and long-time surfer.  Steve Pezman, Publisher of SURFER MAGAZINE and long-time surfer.  Bud Robinson, President of Richton Sportswear and long-time supporter of surfing.  Hoppy Swarts, educator and founder of the United States Surfing Association.  Dr. Jerry Thornsley, Superintendent of Capistrano Unified School District and long-time surfer.  All accepted to serve.\n\nA few days later, the Officers of the NSSA met and set-up a series of 12 surf contests that would last through August, the end of the Open Season surf period.  A mailing outlining the actions taken was sent to over 1,000 people across the USA.  Within days, the response started flowing in.  Membership soared to over 650 surfers, representing 27 surf teams from California to Rhode Island.  Through the efforts of the NSSA Board of Advisors, donations were received from OP, Hang Ten, Kanvas by Katin, Surfer and Surfing Magazines, Quicksilver and others.\n\nThe response from the surfers to the contests proved excellent.  It indicated one thing; surfers want to surf in well-run and fairly judged contests.\n\nThe NSSA hosted the first National Championships in Huntington Beach, California in December of 1978.  The contest winner was Mark McDandel from the University of South Carolina.  As a result of that contest, a National Team including 12 men, 3 women and 3 knee-riders was selected based upon surfing ability, scholarship, and service to community. The Team was composed of student surfers whom younger surfers could look up to as positive role models. The team was provided full competition gear, all specially, uniformly and specifically designed.  Our primary thrust is to encourage high school students to further their education by attending college or trade schools.  One way we do this is to encourage surfing programs at the high schools and colleges.  Scholarships were awarded at the Nationals in December with the first $500.00 scholarship named the \"Nancy Katin\" Scholarship being awarded to Ruben Chappins from Cal State University Long Beach.\n\nFrom short-range planning, the NSSA formulated its long-range goals.  Correspondence from the U.S. Olympic Committee outlining their requirements was studied and we have forwarded a portion of the requirements to them.  The AAU has indicated support and encouragement forwarded an application for Allied Membership.  During our National Championships in December, we will be awarding scholarships.  The National Team's first international competition was against the National Team of Peru at Punta Roca, south of Lima.  The NSSA National Team won this first competition, coached by Tom Gibbons and John Rothrock.\n\nThe NSSA cannot do these things without the support of the entire surfing community.  Early funding received went towards programs that benefit the surfer and work done by the NSSA Officers and Board of Advisors was gratis.\n\nThe NSSA is divided into nine conferences nationwide. Surfers from the various conferences compete for slots in the Regional Championships, with those winners proceeding to the NSSA National Championships.  Top surfers then earn slots into the Surfing America USA Championships which has competitors from all major organizations competing for USA Championship titles and a spot on the USA Surf Team.  Although it has a special emphasis on student surfers, the NSSA membership is open to anyone who wants to surf competitively as an amateur. The NSSA no longer fields its own national team.\n\nMany well known surfers have competed in the NSSA before turning professional.  These include [[Kelly Slater]], [[Andy Irons]], [[Carissa Moore]], Kalani Robb, [[Cheyne Magnusson]], [[Bethany Hamilton]] and [[Bobby Martinez]]. Carissa Moore currently holds the most NSSA Nationals titles with 11 overall while [[Kolohe Andino]] holds the most titles won by a male competitor (9).  \n\n==Champions==\n''' National Scholastic Surfing Association (1978 - 2019)'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!
