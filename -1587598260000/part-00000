This includes all possible inputs to and all potential outputs from a system for some potential or actual user of the system. The internal interfaces of a system or subsystem are documented in their respective interface requirements specifications, while human-machine interfaces might be in a [[system design]] document (such as a [[software design document]]){{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.\n\nInterface control documents are a key element of [[systems engineering]] as they control the documented interface(s) of a system, as well as specify a set of interface versions '''that work together''', and thereby bound the requirements.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAn [[application programming interface]] is a form of interface for a software system, in that it describes how to access the functions and services provided by a system via an interface. If a system producer wants others to be able to use the system, an ICD and interface specs (or their equivalent) is a worthwhile investment.\n\nAn ICD should only describe not the detailed interface documentation itself, and not the characteristics of the systems which use it to connect. The function and logic of those systems should be described in their own requirements and design documents as needed (there are DIDs for all of these). In this way, independent teams can develop the connecting systems which use the interface specified, without regard to how other systems will react to data and signals which are sent over the interface. For example, the ICD and associated interface documentation must include information about the size, format, and what is measured by the data, but not any ultimate ''meaning'' of the data in its intended use by any user.\n\nAn adequately defined interface will allow one team to test its implementation of the interface by simulating the opposing side with a simple communications simulator. Not knowing the business logic of the system on the far side of an interface makes it more likely that one will develop a system that does not break when the other system changes its business rules and logic. (Provision for limits or sanity checking should be pointedly avoided in an interface requirements specification.) Thus, good modularity and abstraction leading to easy maintenance and extensibility are achieved.\n\n== Criticism ==\nCritics of requirements documentation and systems engineering in general often complain of the over-emphasis on documentation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fowler\n|first=M.\n|authorlink=Martin Fowler (software engineer)\n|author2=J.
