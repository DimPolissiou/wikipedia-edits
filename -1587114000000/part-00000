Note also the Infrared obstacle [[sensor]] located on the wall to prevent the gate from closing while a vehicle or other obstacle is in the way.]]\n\nDriveway gate openers can be the rollback (sliding) type that retracks a gate along the fence or wall on wheels or bearing, or the swing type that draws the gate open or closed on hinges. The most popular electric gates for residential properties are swing gates.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} \n\n===Articulated===\nArticulated gate openers can be used for gates with wide posts allowing opening in small spaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/homeandinteriors/homehelp/everything-you-need-to-know-about-access-and-security-around-the-home-293863.html|title=Everything you need to know about access and security around the home|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=October 25, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref> An easy system for DIY installers  as they are simple to install but not as aesthetically pleasing as other motor designs. Also known as Crank arm operators, they are the main type of automation system sold in France, where low aluminium gates are often used.\n\n===Underground===\nUnder-gate Jack operators usually control the gate by directly moving the pivot point of each gate leaf. This makes the unit ideal cosmetically and also allows for up to 180 degrees of leaf swing as required. However controlling the pivot point of the gate, is like opening a door by twisting the hinge, and as so is very difficult due to the loads needed at that point. This is highlighted with snap, as the gate has to change direct, as soon as it can. For this reason they are recommend as only suitable for \u2018Domestic\u2019 systems in a low risk of abuse environment. Another major consideration with the use of under-gate units is that of water immersion/ingress and warranty voidance. If the water table is high or the drainage of the unit\u2019s foundation box inadequate throughout the systems life, then water ingress and unit failure is increased.\n\nRam or link arm units are usually simpler to install and maintain, they are visible to otherwise ignorant abuse and as they fix down along each gate leaf, they also have an obvious and sometimes major, mechanical advantage over Jacks. Therefore, Rams are far more suitable on Multi-user & commercial systems. Also the manual release is always above ground, making it often more user friendly in operation.\n\n===Sliding===\nIf space is an issue or the driveway behind the gates is on a steep incline, a better option would be a sliding gate. Sliding gates are also very popular in a commercial environment. Sliding gates are also used for cantilever gate systems.\n\n==Electric Gate History==\nOne of the first electric gates was invented by a [[Canada|Canadian]] Fred W. Watson in 1881.

An automated gate that has not been fitted with safety in mind can potentially become a major hazard particularly to untrained users. Various safety devices are available to make sure that your gates meet the highest of European or American safety standards.\n\nAt all times a powered gate must respond in a safe way when any person interacts with it. It\u2019s design must take into account that foreseeable interactions may go well beyond normal use (eg children playing around or with / on the powered gate), as well as normal wear and tear, and adverse environmental influences, particular wind and rain / snow and other debris that can impair function.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, two young children died in separate incidents, after being crushed by electric gates on residential developments. One of them, Karolina Golabek died of injuries sustained when she became trapped between the closing edge of a gate and its gate post outside flats near her home.\n\n[https://gate-safe.org/ Gate Safe] was set up to put a stop to any further accidents or fatalities occurring as a result of an unsafe electric gate or barrier installation.

Also known as Crank arm operators, they are the main type of automation system sold in France, where low aluminium gates are often used.\n\n===Underground===\nUnder-gate Jack operators usually control the gate by directly moving the pivot point of each gate leaf. This makes the unit ideal cosmetically and also allows for up to 180 degrees of leaf swing as required. However controlling the pivot point of the gate, is like opening a door by twisting the hinge, and as so is very difficult due to the loads needed at that point. This is highlighted with snap, as the gate has to change direct, as soon as it can. For this reason they are recommend as only suitable for \u2018Domestic\u2019 systems in a low risk of abuse environment. Another major consideration with the use of under-gate units is that of water immersion/ingress and warranty voidance. If the water table is high or the drainage of the unit\u2019s foundation box inadequate throughout the systems life, then water ingress and unit failure is increased.\n\nRam or link arm units are usually simpler to install and maintain, they are visible to otherwise ignorant abuse and as they fix down along each gate leaf, they also have an obvious and sometimes major, mechanical advantage over Jacks. Therefore, Rams are far more suitable on Multi-user & commercial systems. Also the manual release is always above ground, making it often more user friendly in operation.\n\n===Sliding===\nIf space is an issue or the driveway behind the gates is on a steep incline, a better option would be a sliding gate. Sliding gates are also very popular in a commercial environment. Sliding gates are also used for cantilever gate systems.\n\n==Electric Gate History==\nOne of the first electric gates was invented by a [[Canada|Canadian]] Fred W. Watson in 1881.

Discrimination can take the form of gossip, verbal and physical abuse, or social exclusion.<ref name=\":14\" /> Access to treatment, prevention, and support services is greatly hindered by discrimination.<ref name=\":14\">\u201cLesotho 2014.\u201d ''[http://www.stigmaindex.org/sites/default/files/reports/Lesotho%20Stigma%20Index%20draft%20report%206-%20L..pdf The People Living with HIV Stigma Index]'', 2014, pp. 1-42. Lesotho Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS (LENEPWHA).</ref> In 2014, 4% of HIV-infected Basotho reported denied access to healthcare services in the past year, while 5.5% reported denied access to family planning services in the same time period.<ref name=\":14\" /> Discrimination can negatively impact employment opportunities as well as workers' livelihoods. In 2016, 13.9% of Basotho reported that they would not buy vegetables from a vendor living with HIV, according to UNAIDS.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Lesotho subdivisions MH.png|thumb|280x280px|Lesotho is divided into [[Districts of Lesotho|ten districts]], each of which are further subdivided into 80 constituencies. Conflicts between constituencies perpetuate political instability.]]\n\n=== Political factionalism ===\n\nTurkon (2008) suggested that efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Lesotho are undermined by strong partisan divisions in rural communities. UNAIDS has expressed hope that the HIV/AIDS crisis will be the catalyst for Basotho communities to transcend partisan lines and work together as a unit.<ref name=\":10\">Turkon, David. \u201cCommoners, Kings, and Subaltern: Political Factionalism and Structured Inequality in Lesotho.\u201d ''Political and Legal Anthropology Review'', vol. 31, no. 2, 2008, pp. 203\u2013223. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24497353.</ref>\n\nPolitical factions in Lesotho arise from vested interest in governmental control.<ref name=\":10\" /> The people of Lesotho place little trust in the Basotho's political elite to uphold communal values or demonstrate hierarchical reciprocity. This is in part due to political instability present in the country. While the government of Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy, with the [[Prime Minister of Lesotho]] heading the government, a system of chieftaincy informally governs the rural areas.<ref name=\":11\">Coplan, David B., and Tim Quinlan. \"A Chief by the People: Nation versus State in Lesotho.\" ''Africa: Journal of the International African Institute'' 67, no. 1 (1997): 27-60. <nowiki>http://www.jstor.org/stable/1161269</nowiki>.</ref> The chieftaincy operates as an administrative hierarchy, responsible for governing the colonial structure of wards and districts in rural communities. The chieftaincy system as a whole receives support from villagers, while individual chiefs are often heavily criticized for corrupt practices, including dereliction, favoritism, and bribery.<ref name=\":11\" /> Nevertheless, partisan divisions do not only exist between chief and commoner. They often manifest as antagonistic relationships between neighbors in the same village.<ref name=\":10\" /> As a result, community-based approaches to HIV/AIDS treatment are often unsuccessful.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Lack of resources ===\n\nLack of proper resources and lack of access to resources compromises efficacy of HIV treatments. Healthcare centers often lack basic equipment and drug supplies, or are chronically understaffed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal | last1 = McMurchy | first1 = Dale | year = 2005 | title = OHAfrica: Initial Learnings as the OHAfrica Team Commences Its Work at an HIV Clinic in Lesotho | url = | journal = Healthcare Quarterly | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 14\u201315 | doi = 10.12927/hcq..17050 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Furthermore, travel distance to healthcare centers can be financially and physically burdensome for many, particularly rural patients. Round-trip transportation to the healthcare clinic and cost of treatment, totaling about $10, prevents a problem for many Basotho.<ref name=\":12\" /> Moreover, follow-up visits following initial treatment is cost-prohibitive. In 2014, LDHS found that 38% of rural patients walked for more than two hours to reach their healthcare facility, whereas only 3% of urban patients walked.<ref name=\":2\" /> Those too ill to travel alone require accompaniment, at the risk of worsening existing health conditions.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Health conditions ===\n\nPreexisting or concurrent health conditions, both [[Communicable disease|communicable]] and [[Chronic condition|chronic]], can increase an individual's risk of HIV contraction as well as exacerbate the progression of the disease.\n\n[[File:Mielies.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A young boy preps ''[[Pap (food)|Mielie pap]]'', the staple food in Lesotho.]]\n\n==== Malnutrition ====\n\n[[Malnutrition]] may be the greatest obstacle to effective HIV treatment. Starvation allows rapid progression of HIV by undermining the body's natural defense mechanisms<ref name=\":12\" /> and promoting viral replication.<ref name=\":16\">{{cite journal | last1 = Stillwaggon | first1 = Eileen | year = 2008 | title = Race, Sex, and the Neglected Risks for Women and Girls in Sub-Saharan Africa | url = | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 67\u201386 | doi = 10.1080/13545700802262923 }}</ref> This can lead to increased toxicity of HIV/AIDS treatment drugs.<ref name=\":12\" /> General maternal malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies can increase risk of MTCT.<ref name=\":16\" /> In 2015, the World Bank estimated that 11% of Lesotho's population was undernourished.<ref>World Bank Group. \"Prevalence of Undernourishment (% of Population).\" World Bank.

[[Malaria]] is estimated to increase HIV viral load by seven to ten times.<ref name=\":16\" /> Consequently, people with malaria are at increased risk of transmitting HIV to partners.

It is estimated to triple women's risk of HIV infection.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== Tuberculosis co-infection ====\n\nRecent increases in the number of [[tuberculosis]] (TB) co-infections, particularly [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|multi drug resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB), in HIV-infected Basotho hinders effective HIV treatment. The risk of contracting TB is much greater for those already infected with HIV.<ref name=\":13\">Wells, Charles D., et al. \u201cHIV Infection and Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: The Perfect Storm.\u201d ''The Journal of Infectious Diseases'', vol. 196, 2007, pp. s86\u2013s107.

Reasons include competing national health system priorities (such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic), and the toll of TB/HIV co-infection on healthcare workers. Delayed diagnosis, inadequate initial treatment, and prolonged infectiousness of TB further exacerbate the severity of the epidemic.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Adherence to treatment ===\n\nAdherence to treatment, most commonly ART, remains a large barrier to effective provision of HIV treatment. In 2016, about 53% of adults living with HIV in Lesotho were receiving ART.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lesotho has seen a decline in access to ART medication between 2010 and 2016, as 66% of pregnant Basotho women living with HIV had access to ART medicines in 2016, as compared to 72% in 2010.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnce a patient seeks out initial treatment for HIV, follow-up visits are critical to improve and maintain a patient's clinical, immunological, and virological outcome. Adherence to ART drugs delays onset of drug resistance, treatment failure, and subsequent necessity to use a different drug treatment.<ref name=\":15\">Ramatlapeng, Mphu. \u201cWorking Draft\u2014Lesotho National ART Guidelines.\u201d ''Consolidated Guidelines on the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Preventing Infection,'' 2004, pp. 1-156. Lesotho Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), World Health Organization, <nowiki>http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/lesotho_art.pdf</nowiki>.</ref> Maintaining proper adherence to treatment involves meticulous processes, such as taking the correct amount of medication in the specific, regimented manner mandated by health professionals.  Drug treatments must also be stored properly.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nCosts of medication and continual treatment are prohibitive for many Basotho. Other barriers to adherence include lack of transportation to healthcare facilities, lack of access to medication refills, or inconsistency of caregiver.<ref name=\":15\" /> Cultural attitudes of stigma toward HIV diagnosis in Lesotho often leaves those infected without social support, which can negatively impact adherence.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n== Economic impact ==\n\nHIV/AIDS has had a devastating economic impact in Lesotho at both the [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level and the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] level.

Research conducted by De Walque and Kline (2012) has shown that unusually high HIV rates are found in remarried individuals, because many couples become serodiscordant. In Lesotho, around 32.6% of men and 45.6% of women who remarried were HIV infected between 2003-2006.<ref name=\":8\">De Walque, Damien, and Rachel Kline. \u201cThe Association Between Remarriage and HIV Infection in 13 Sub-Saharan African Countries.\u201d ''Studies in Family Planning'', vol. 43, no. 1, 2012, pp. 1\u201310.

Discrimination can take the form of gossip, verbal and physical abuse, or social exclusion.<ref name=\":14\" /> Access to treatment, prevention, and support services is greatly hindered by discrimination.<ref name=\":14\">\u201cLesotho 2014.\u201d ''[http://www.stigmaindex.org/sites/default/files/reports/Lesotho%20Stigma%20Index%20draft%20report%206-%20L..pdf The People Living with HIV Stigma Index]'', 2014, pp. 1-42.

Conflicts between constituencies perpetuate political instability.]]\n\n=== Political factionalism ===\n\nTurkon (2008) suggested that efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Lesotho are undermined by strong partisan divisions in rural communities. UNAIDS has expressed hope that the HIV/AIDS crisis will be the catalyst for Basotho communities to transcend partisan lines and work together as a unit.<ref name=\":10\">Turkon, David. \u201cCommoners, Kings, and Subaltern: Political Factionalism and Structured Inequality in Lesotho.\u201d ''Political and Legal Anthropology Review'', vol. 31, no. 2, 2008, pp. 203\u2013223. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24497353.</ref>\n\nPolitical factions in Lesotho arise from vested interest in governmental control.<ref name=\":10\" /> The people of Lesotho place little trust in the Basotho's political elite to uphold communal values or demonstrate hierarchical reciprocity. This is in part due to political instability present in the country. While the government of Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy, with the [[Prime Minister of Lesotho]] heading the government, a system of chieftaincy informally governs the rural areas.<ref name=\":11\">Coplan, David B., and Tim Quinlan. \"A Chief by the People: Nation versus State in Lesotho.\" ''Africa: Journal of the International African Institute'' 67, no. 1 (1997): 27-60. <nowiki>http://www.jstor.org/stable/1161269</nowiki>.</ref> The chieftaincy operates as an administrative hierarchy, responsible for governing the colonial structure of wards and districts in rural communities. The chieftaincy system as a whole receives support from villagers, while individual chiefs are often heavily criticized for corrupt practices, including dereliction, favoritism, and bribery.<ref name=\":11\" /> Nevertheless, partisan divisions do not only exist between chief and commoner. They often manifest as antagonistic relationships between neighbors in the same village.<ref name=\":10\" /> As a result, community-based approaches to HIV/AIDS treatment are often unsuccessful.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Lack of resources ===\n\nLack of proper resources and lack of access to resources compromises efficacy of HIV treatments. Healthcare centers often lack basic equipment and drug supplies, or are chronically understaffed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal | last1 = McMurchy | first1 = Dale | year = 2005 | title = OHAfrica: Initial Learnings as the OHAfrica Team Commences Its Work at an HIV Clinic in Lesotho | url = | journal = Healthcare Quarterly | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 14\u201315 | doi = 10.12927/hcq..17050 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Furthermore, travel distance to healthcare centers can be financially and physically burdensome for many, particularly rural patients. Round-trip transportation to the healthcare clinic and cost of treatment, totaling about $10, prevents a problem for many Basotho.<ref name=\":12\" /> Moreover, follow-up visits following initial treatment is cost-prohibitive.

It is estimated to triple women's risk of HIV infection.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== Tuberculosis co-infection ====\n\nRecent increases in the number of [[tuberculosis]] (TB) co-infections, particularly [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|multi drug resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB), in HIV-infected Basotho hinders effective HIV treatment. The risk of contracting TB is much greater for those already infected with HIV.<ref name=\":13\">Wells, Charles D., et al. \u201cHIV Infection and Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: The Perfect Storm.\u201d ''The Journal of Infectious Diseases'', vol. 196, 2007, pp. s86\u2013s107.

Reasons include competing national health system priorities (such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic), and the toll of TB/HIV co-infection on healthcare workers. Delayed diagnosis, inadequate initial treatment, and prolonged infectiousness of TB further exacerbate the severity of the epidemic.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Adherence to treatment ===\n\nAdherence to treatment, most commonly ART, remains a large barrier to effective provision of HIV treatment. In 2016, about 53% of adults living with HIV in Lesotho were receiving ART.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lesotho has seen a decline in access to ART medication between 2010 and 2016, as 66% of pregnant Basotho women living with HIV had access to ART medicines in 2016, as compared to 72% in 2010.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnce a patient seeks out initial treatment for HIV, follow-up visits are critical to improve and maintain a patient's clinical, immunological, and virological outcome. Adherence to ART drugs delays onset of drug resistance, treatment failure, and subsequent necessity to use a different drug treatment.<ref name=\":15\">Ramatlapeng, Mphu. \u201cWorking Draft\u2014Lesotho National ART Guidelines.\u201d ''Consolidated Guidelines on the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Preventing Infection,'' 2004, pp. 1-156.

Other barriers to adherence include lack of transportation to healthcare facilities, lack of access to medication refills, or inconsistency of caregiver.<ref name=\":15\" /> Cultural attitudes of stigma toward HIV diagnosis in Lesotho often leaves those infected without social support, which can negatively impact adherence.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n== Economic impact ==\n\nHIV/AIDS has had a devastating economic impact in Lesotho at both the [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level and the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] level.

Presented by [[Live Nation]], the first of a planned annual series of benefit concerts was held at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in Nashville, Tennessee on December 20, 2014 and featured musicians [[Reba McEntire|Reba]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Ronnie Dunn]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Hayley Williams]], [[Chad Gilbert]], [[Charles Esten]], [[Meghan Trainor]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Kix Brooks]], and [[Deborah Allen]] performing renditions of various [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] and tracks from Clarkson's [[Christmas album]] ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'' (2013). The concert raised over US$500,000 ticket sales and donations for four charities based in Nashville: [[Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt]], Monroe Harding Children\u2019s Home, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Thistle Farms. Clarkson had also announced plans to turn Miracle on Broadway into an annual benefit concert and planned to hold one in Bridgestone Arena on December 18, 2015.<ref name=\"ABC News Radio 1\" /> However, this concert was cancelled due to Clarkson's health complications during her second pregnancy.<ref name=\"twitter1\"/> The 2016 concert was held on December 16, 2016.<ref name=\"cidentertainment1\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Bridgestone Arena (North face) 3.JPG|thumbnail|Miracle on Broadway was named after the [[Broadway (Nashville, Tennessee)|Broadway Street]], a major road in Nashville, Tennessee and the site of the [[Bridgestone Arena]] (pictured).<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" />]]\nDuring the 2014 fall season, Clarkson conceived the idea of organizing a benefit concert during a rush-hour commute from Nashville to [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]] while preparing the release of her seventh studio album ''[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson album)|Piece by Piece]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /> She had originally planned to organize a small concert for an intimate audience.<ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /> But upon presenting the idea to her manager Narvel Blackstock, the concept developed into an arena concert featuring prominent musicians who at some point had lived in Nashville.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /> Together, they invited [[Reba McEntire]], Clarkson's mother-in-law and Blackstock's wife. She recalled, \"I figured if I got (McEntire), everyone would have to say yes. I've never asked an artist to do anything other than sing with me which a lot of people had said no and it hurts my feelings, which is okay.\"<ref name=\"The Tennessean 2\" /> Clarkson later invited a various set of musicians: [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Ronnie Dunn]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Hayley Williams]], [[Chad Gilbert]], [[Charles Esten]], [[Meghan Trainor]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Kix Brooks]], and [[Deborah Allen]].<ref name=\"The Tennessean 2\" /> She revealed, \"I basically guilted people into it. And it was a very brave thing for me.\"<ref name=\"CMT 2\" /> [[Dolly Parton]], whom she had also invited, had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /> Clarkson had also revealed that other recording artists had also turned down the offer for the same reason but promised to participate for a 2015 concert.<ref name=\"The Tennessean 2\" /> On the September 5, 2015 date of her [[Piece by Piece Tour]] at the Bridgestone Arena, she announced that the 2015 edition of the benefit concert would be held on December 18, 2015.<ref name=\"ABC News Radio 1\" /> She later announced that the concert in 2015 had been cancelled because of her health problems but promised to hold another concert in 2016.<ref name=\"twitter1\"/> The concert in 2016 was held on December 16 and the guest musicians included Reba McEntire, Ronnie Dunn, [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[RaeLynn]], Charles Esten, [[The SteelDrivers]] and more.<ref name=\"cidentertainment1\"/>\n\nClarkson, who was raised in modesty prior to winning the television competition ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2002, has cited that the main objective for Miracle on Broadway was to raise funds for Nashville charities as a means to give back to the community.<ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 2\" /> She recalled, \"We grew up in a duplex and a trailer. We grew up working really hard. We don't want to punish (our children) for being born into a family with money, but we want to make sure that they are a part of things like this from the get go. You can't grow up in your little world. There's a whole world out there, and there's people that are in need and to know how lucky they are.\"<ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 2\" /> Blackstock had originally proposed to hold the concert for the 2015 Christmas season, but Clarkson insisted to hold it in 2014, after down-scaling the promotional campaign for her Christmas album ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'' in 2013 due to her then-pregnancy.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /> Inspired by the title of the 1947 holiday feature ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', she named the concert as Miracle on Broadway after the [[Broadway (Nashville, Tennessee)|Broadway Street]], a major avenue and [[Bridgestone Arena]]'s primary address in Nashville.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> Proceeds from the fundraising will be sent to the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee for distribution to four Nashville charities: [[Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt]], Monroe Harding Children\u2019s Home, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Thistle Farms.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 1\" /><ref name=\"The Hollywood Reporter 1\" /> Clarkson remarked that the four charities were not randomly selected,<ref name=\"Nash Country Weekly 1\" /> saying \"I have visited each of these organizations, and come to know the people who run them and volunteer and the people they serve. I am so grateful and proud to call Nashville home.\"<ref name=\"People Magazine 2\" />\n\n== Concert overview ==\nMiracle on Broadway's first concert at the Bridgestone Arena was held on December 20, 2014, just 84 days after Clarkson had made its concept.<ref name=\"Nash Country Weekly 1\" /> All of the acts performed only performed various [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] throughout the concert, while Clarkson performed the tracks from ''Wrapped in Red'' and holiday tunes she had previously recorded, except for \"[[Winter Wonderland]]\", \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\", \"[[Hard Candy Christmas]]\", \"[[Jingle Bell Rock]]\", \"[[The Christmas Song]]\", and \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 1\" /> Some of the featured artists performed with Clarkson in her numbers, such as Esten (who was featured on \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\"), McBride (featured on \"The Christmas Song\").<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> In addition to performing their own versions of holiday tunes: Dunn, Reba, and Yearwood, whom Clarkson had featured in ''Wrapped in Red'', also performed with her in their respective songs on the album.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> While Aben Eubanks, Ashley Arrison, and [[Shane McAnally]], Clarkson's co-writers for \"[[Wrapped in Red (song)|Wrapped in Red]]\", sang with her in a [[Bluebird Cafe]]-style performance.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> Other featured musicians also performed solely, such as Trainor, Williams with Gilbert, Kix Brooks with Allen, Musgraves, and Garth Brooks. Clarkson remarked in an interview that \"They all picked awesome songs to sing.\"<ref name=\"Nash Country Weekly 1\" /> The whole concert lasted for over two hours.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\"

Presented by [[Live Nation]], the first of a planned annual series of benefit concerts was held at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in Nashville, Tennessee on December 20, 2014 and featured musicians [[Reba McEntire|Reba]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Ronnie Dunn]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Hayley Williams]], [[Chad Gilbert]], [[Charles Esten]], [[Meghan Trainor]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Kix Brooks]], and [[Deborah Allen]] performing renditions of various [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] and tracks from Clarkson's [[Christmas album]] ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'' (2013). The concert raised over US$500,000 ticket sales and donations for four charities based in Nashville: [[Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt]], Monroe Harding Children\u2019s Home, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Thistle Farms. Clarkson had also announced plans to turn Miracle on Broadway into an annual benefit concert and planned to hold one in Bridgestone Arena on December 18, 2015.<ref name=\"ABC News Radio 1\" /> However, this concert was cancelled due to Clarkson's health complications during her second pregnancy. <ref name=\"twitter1\"/> The 2016 concert was held on December 16, 2016.<ref name=\"cidentertainment1\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Bridgestone Arena (North face) 3.JPG|thumbnail|Miracle on Broadway was named after the [[Broadway (Nashville, Tennessee)|Broadway Street]], a major road in Nashville, Tennessee and the site of the [[Bridgestone Arena]] (pictured).<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" />]]\nDuring the 2014 fall season, Clarkson conceived the idea of organizing a benefit concert during a rush-hour commute from Nashville to [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]] while preparing the release of her seventh studio album ''[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson album)|Piece by Piece]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /> She had originally planned to organize a small concert for an intimate audience.<ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /> But upon presenting the idea to her manager Narvel Blackstock, the concept developed into an arena concert featuring prominent musicians who at some point had lived in Nashville.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /> Together, they invited [[Reba McEntire]], Clarkson's mother-in-law and Blackstock's wife. She recalled, \"I figured if I got (McEntire), everyone would have to say yes. I've never asked an artist to do anything other than sing with me which a lot of people had said no and it hurts my feelings, which is okay.\"<ref name=\"The Tennessean 2\" /> Clarkson later invited a various set of musicians: [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Ronnie Dunn]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Hayley Williams]], [[Chad Gilbert]], [[Charles Esten]], [[Meghan Trainor]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Kix Brooks]], and [[Deborah Allen]].<ref name=\"The Tennessean 2\" /> She revealed, \"I basically guilted people into it. And it was a very brave thing for me.\"<ref name=\"CMT 2\" /> [[Dolly Parton]], whom she had also invited, had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /> Clarkson had also revealed that other recording artists had also turned down the offer for the same reason but promised to participate for a 2015 concert.<ref name=\"The Tennessean 2\" /> On the September 5, 2015 date of her [[Piece by Piece Tour]] at the Bridgestone Arena, she announced that the 2015 edition of the benefit concert would be held on December 18, 2015.<ref name=\"ABC News Radio 1\" /> She later announced that the concert in 2015 had been cancelled because of her health problems but promised to hold another concert in 2016.<ref name=\"twitter1\"/> The concert in 2016 was be held on December 16 and the guest musicians included Reba McEntire, Ronnie Dunn, [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[RaeLynn]], Charles Esten, [[The SteelDrivers]] and more.<ref name=\"cidentertainment1\"/>\n\nClarkson, who was raised in modesty prior to winning the television competition ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2002, has cited that the main objective for Miracle on Broadway was to raise funds for Nashville charities as a means to give back to the community.<ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 2\" /> She recalled, \"We grew up in a duplex and a trailer. We grew up working really hard. We don't want to punish (our children) for being born into a family with money, but we want to make sure that they are a part of things like this from the get go. You can't grow up in your little world. There's a whole world out there, and there's people that are in need and to know how lucky they are.\"<ref name=\"The Tennessean 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 2\" /> Blackstock had originally proposed to hold the concert for the 2015 Christmas season, but Clarkson insisted to hold it in 2014, after down-scaling the promotional campaign for her Christmas album ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'' in 2013 due to her then-pregnancy.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /> Inspired by the title of the 1947 holiday feature ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', she named the concert as Miracle on Broadway after the [[Broadway (Nashville, Tennessee)|Broadway Street]], a major avenue and [[Bridgestone Arena]]'s primary address in Nashville.<ref name=\"People Magazine 1\" /><ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> Proceeds from the fundraising will be sent to the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee for distribution to four Nashville charities: [[Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt]], Monroe Harding Children\u2019s Home, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Thistle Farms.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 1\" /><ref name=\"The Hollywood Reporter 1\" /> Clarkson remarked that the four charities were not randomly selected,<ref name=\"Nash Country Weekly 1\" /> saying \"I have visited each of these organizations, and come to know the people who run them and volunteer and the people they serve. I am so grateful and proud to call Nashville home.\"<ref name=\"People Magazine 2\" />\n\n== Concert overview ==\nMiracle on Broadway's first concert at the Bridgestone Arena was held on December 20, 2014, just 84 days after Clarkson had made its concept.<ref name=\"Nash Country Weekly 1\" /> All of the acts performed only performed various [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] throughout the concert, while Clarkson performed the tracks from ''Wrapped in Red'' and holiday tunes she had previously recorded, except for \"[[Winter Wonderland]]\", \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\", \"[[Hard Candy Christmas]]\", \"[[Jingle Bell Rock]]\", \"[[The Christmas Song]]\", and \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /><ref name=\"CMT 1\" /> Some of the featured artists performed with Clarkson in her numbers, such as Esten (who was featured on \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\"), McBride (featured on \"The Christmas Song\").<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> In addition to performing their own versions of holiday tunes: Dunn, Reba, and Yearwood, whom Clarkson had featured in ''Wrapped in Red'', also performed with her in their respective songs on the album.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> While Aben Eubanks, Ashley Arrison, and [[Shane McAnally]], Clarkson's co-writers for \"[[Wrapped in Red (song)|Wrapped in Red]]\", sang with her in a [[Bluebird Cafe]]-style performance.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone 1\" /> Other featured musicians also performed solely, such as Trainor, Williams with Gilbert, Kix Brooks with Allen, Musgraves, and Garth Brooks.
