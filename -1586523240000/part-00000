[[Let's Play]] videos and comedic formatted shows. Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It is characterised by the presence of abundant Cuartz sediments, along with the pesence of Red Clays. The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases.
