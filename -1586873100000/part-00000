Additionally, many personalities who are active in [[Bollywood]], [[cricket]], and [[politics]] reside in the suburb.\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Bandra\" possibly originates from the [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] word for port, or \"bandar.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/a-tour-through-mumbai-s-historical-neighbourhoods/|title=A Tour Through Mumbai's Historical Neighbourhoods}}</ref> It is described by [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]]'s ''A Dictionary, Hindustani and English'''(1848) as \"a city; an emporium; a port, harbor; a trading town to which numbers of foreign merchants resort\".<ref name=\"Forbes1848\">{{cite book|author=Duncan Forbes|title=A Dictionary, Hindustani and English: To which is Added a Reversed Part, English and Hindustani|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7klIAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=1848|publisher=W.H. Allen}}</ref> In [[Marathi language|Marathi]], Bandra is known as ''Vandre'', which also means 'port' and is possibly derived from the same Urdu/Persian word.\n\nThe area was under the rule of the [[Silhara dynasty]] in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by [[Kolis]] (fishermen) and farmers. It was under the Portuguese before it was acquired by the [[British East India Company]].\n\n===Portuguese Bandra===\nIn 1534, a sea captain, [[Diego da Silveira]], entered Bandra's creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the [[Portuguese crown]].\n\nThis turmoil was the start of a long period of [[Christianization]] of Bandra. Father [[Manuel Gomes da Costa|Manuel Gomes]], a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church's prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptized 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes' \"invincible strength of soul\", as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]].\n\nBandra became a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] possession when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded the region in the Treaty of St. Matthew, which was signed aboard the Portuguese brig ''Sao Mateus'' in [[Vasai|Ba\u00e7aim]] harbor in 1534 and aided by Governor-General [[Nuno da Cunha]] and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese [[enfeoffed]] (gave) Bandra, [[Kurla]], [[Mazagaon|Mazgaon]] and four other villages in 1548 to [[Ant\u00f3nio Pessoa]] as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550.\n\nAs these villages were given for a period of 'two lives', they reverted to the Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa's widow. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel's death, obtained them from the viceroy in 1568 and received royal confirmation in 1570.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.firstpost.com/blogs/have-bandras-xenophobes-forgotten-their-own-history-238786.html\n|title=Have Bandra's xenophobes forgotten their own history?\n|publisher=[[First Post]]\n|date = 9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1661, when King Charles married Catherine of Portugal, the island of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] was given to [[England]] as part of the dowry.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2998461\n|title=Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a (1638\u20131705)\n|publisher=BBC\n}}</ref> However, [[Salsette Island]], on which Bandra lay, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=174|Ref=bom}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese built additional churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]] in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Catholicism among the villagers on the island. Their descendants continued to support the six Catholic parish churches\u2014[[Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bandra|Mount Carmel]], St. Peter's, St. Andrew's, St. Theresa's, St. Anne's and St. Francis d'Assisi\u2014that lie within an area of four square kilometres.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-mumbai-once-a-part-of-bandras-catholic-heritage-a-chapel-at-pali-hill-will-soon-be-history-1824997\n|title=Mumbai: Once a part of Bandra's Catholic heritage, a chapel at Pali Hill will soon be history\n|publisher=[[DNA India]]\n|date = 21 April 2013\n}}</ref> \n\n===British Bandra===\nBandra became part of English territory with the signing of the [[Treaty of Surat]] in 1775, but was retroceded to the [[Marathas]] in 1779 during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. In 1802, [[Bajirao II]] signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947.\n\nOn 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between [[Virar]] and Bombay. Six years later, it was increased to 24 each day. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from [[Pali Naka]], [[Hill Road]] to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After [[World War II]], the building boom began to accommodate immigrants.\n\nBandra was raised to the status of a [[Bandra Municipal Committee|municipality]] in 1876 and then was expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Pali, and Chuim. These have been lost to urban development of the island.\n\n====Mount Mary's Church====\n[[File:Mother mary.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Mother Mary at [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra]].]]\nThe Catholic [[chapel]] of [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra|Mount Mary]] was built around 1640 by the Portuguese. The chapel was destroyed in 1738 by the Marathas during their campaign to evict the Portuguese. The statue of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] was recovered from the sea by fishermen and temporarily installed in St. Andrew's Church, before being shifted to the rebuilt Mount Mary's Church in 1761. 2018 marked the beginning of the \"Feast of Our Lady of the Mount\", also known as the \"Monti Fest\" or the \"Bandra Feast\". To this day, the statue is venerated and many miracles, minor and major, are attributed to the Lady of the Mount. The architect of Mount Mary's Church was Bombay architect [[Shahpoorjee Chandabhoy]]. The basilica was built in 1904 at a cost of INR 1 lakh. The original church was built to serve the garrison posted at the [[Castella de Aguada]] (Fortress of Aguada) at [[Land's End, Bandra]]. In 1879, [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy|Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]] constructed a flight of steps to Mount Mary's Church; these are known as the ''Degrados de Bomanjee'' ('Steps of Bomanjee').\n\nPeople of all faiths and communities visit the church, giving the place a syncretic nature. The [[Bandra Fair]] is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when pilgrims throng the church.<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=255163 Mount Mary fair begins today]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 8 September 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_devotees-throng-to-bandra-fair-on-opening-day-as-stall-owners-protest_1437121 \"Devotees throng to Bandra Fair on opening day as stall owners protest\"], ''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'', 13 September 2010.</ref>\n\n====Educational institutions====\nThe first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew's Parish School, started by Fr. [[Francisco de Melo]] in 1780 to teach catechism to the children of the parish. This later became [[St. Andrew's High School, Mumbai|St. Andrew's High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://saintandrewschoolbandra.in/content/history-0|publisher=St Andrew High School, Bandra|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331133206/http://saintandrewschoolbandra.in/content/history-0|archive-date=31 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The school is located in Bandra West.\n\nSt. Theresa's High School grew out of St. Andrew's Indian Christians' School, housed in a very dilapidated building situated in Old Khar.

Later, it grew to be a full-fledged educational institution for day-scholars as well as boarders. What started out as a school for 40 orphans has grown to support 2,300 students. St. Stanislaus High School is located on Hill Road, in Bandra West. [[Cardinal Gracias High School]] is a [[convent school]] located in Bandra East.

National College]] was originally set up in 1922 in [[Hyderabad, Pakistan]] under the guidance of [[Annie Besant]]. In the run-up to the [[Partition of India]], it was relocated to its present site in 1949 in Bandra. The [[Thadomal Shahani Engineering College]] was established in 1983 by the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]]. It was the first private engineering institute to be affiliated with the federal [[University of Mumbai]] to offer courses in [[Computer Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], [[Biomedical Engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]].\n\nThe Rizvi Education Complex, located off [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]], comprises the Rizvi College of Arts, Science and Commerce (established in 1985); Rizvi High School (established in 1985); [[Rizvi College of Engineering]] (established in 1998); Rizvi College of Architecture; Rizvi College of Hotel Management & Catering Technology; [[Rizvi Law College]]; Rizvi College of Education and the Rizvi College of Fashion Designing & Creative Arts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rizvi.edu.in/|title=Rizvi Education Society|author=|date=|website=www.rizvi.edu.in}}</ref> All are managed by the Rizvi Education Society, and may have the status of Muslim religious minority institution.\n\n====Bandra lake====\n{{main|Bandra Talao}}\n[[Bandra Lake]], also called Bandra Talao or Motha Reservoir was constructed by a rich [[Konkani]] Muslim of [[Navapada]] (also spelt Naupada or Naopara), an adjoining village.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal |title=Gazetteer of Thane District \u2013 Places of Interest, 1882| url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-III/places_Bandra.html}}</ref>\n\nThe lake was later acquired by the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai]]. It was officially renamed [[Swami Vivekananda|Swami Vivekanand]] Sarovar.

In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the [[Mithi River]] in the eastern portion of the city, near the [[Kurla]] border. The newly-formed [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development.\n\nAs the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra's BKC is located between [[Banda Station|Bandra]] and [[Kurla railway station|Kurla]] stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made [[Banda Station|Bandra]] among the busiest stations in India, surpassing [[Andheri]] and [[Bombay Central]], and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra's Western Railway after [[Churchgate railway station]].\n\n==Urban art==\nBandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near Bandstand and Mount Mary Church.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-ranwar-village.html|title=Ranwar Village|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-bollywood-art-project.html|title=Bollywood Art Project|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref> They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls.\nSt+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BollywoodArtProject/|title=Bollywood Art Project \u2013 BAP|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organizations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists.

The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director [[Mehboob Khan]] established the [[Mehboob Studio]]s here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, [[Bollywood]]. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s.<ref name=pn>{{cite news |title=Mehboob mere, Mehboob tere |url=http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |newspaper=Pune Mirror |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718051651/http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=dn>{{cite news |title=Mumbai, meri mehboob?|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/column_mumbai-meri-mehboob_1504231 |newspaper=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=  7 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, [[Bandra-Kurla complex|Bandra-Kurla Commercial Complex]], the office of the state housing development authority ([[Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority|MHADA]]) and the office of the [[District Collector]]. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here.\n\nMost roads and places in Bandra were given English names during [[British rule]]. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names.\n\n* Neighbouring suburbs: [[Dharavi]], [[Khar, Mumbai|Khar]], [[Kurla]], [[Mahim]], [[Santa Cruz (Mumbai)|Santacruz]]\n* Arterial Roads: [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] (S.V Road), [[Linking Road]], Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), [[Hill Road]] (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]] (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), [[Western Express Highway]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] connects the western part of Bandra to [[Worli]] by the sea route, thus diverting a lot of road traffic.\n\n[[File:Worli skyline from Bandra.jpg|thumb|300px|Worli skyline as seen from Bandra Reclamation]]\n[[File:Bandra Linking road.jpg|thumb|A stall on Linking Road]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:India Mumbai Bridge .jpg|thumb|[[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] Project]]\n[[Bandra railway station]] is connected with the [[Western Railway Zone (India)|Western Railway]] and the [[Harbour Line]], which is an offshoot of the suburban [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]].

The important trains include the Bandra-[[New Delhi]] Rajdhani Express, Bandra-[[Indore]] Express, Bandra-[[Patna]] Express, Bandra-[[Jaipur]] Express, Bandra-[[Jodhpur]] Express and the Bandra-[[Amritsar]] Express\n\nPublic transport also includes [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering [[Mahim]], only taxis are allowed to ply.\n\nThe [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] bridge connects Bandra West with [[Worli]], located in central Mumbai.

Allen}}</ref> In [[Marathi language|Marathi]], Bandra is known as ''Vandre'', which also means 'port' and is possibly derived from the same Urdu/Persian word.\n\nThe area was under the rule of the [[Silhara dynasty]] in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by [[Kolis]] (fishermen) and farmers. It was under the Portuguese before it was acquired by the [[British East India Company]].\n\n===Portuguese Bandra===\nIn 1534, a sea captain, [[Diego da Silveira]], entered Bandra's creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the [[Portuguese crown]].\n\nThis turmoil was the start of a long period of [[Christianization]] of Bandra. Father [[Manuel Gomes da Costa|Manuel Gomes]], a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church's prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptized 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes' \"invincible strength of soul\", as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]].\n\nBandra became a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] possession when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded the region in the Treaty of St. Matthew, which was signed aboard the Portuguese brig ''Sao Mateus'' in [[Vasai|Ba\u00e7aim]] harbor in 1534 and aided by Governor-General [[Nuno da Cunha]] and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese [[enfeoffed]] (gave) Bandra, [[Kurla]], [[Mazagaon|Mazgaon]] and four other villages in 1548 to [[Ant\u00f3nio Pessoa]] as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550.\n\nAs these villages were given for a period of 'two lives', they reverted to the Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa's widow. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel's death, obtained them from the viceroy in 1568 and received royal confirmation in 1570.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.firstpost.com/blogs/have-bandras-xenophobes-forgotten-their-own-history-238786.html\n|title=Have Bandra's xenophobes forgotten their own history?\n|publisher=[[First Post]]\n|date = 9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1661, when King Charles married Catherine of Portugal, the island of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] was given to [[England]] as part of the dowry.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2998461\n|title=Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a (1638\u20131705)\n|publisher=BBC\n}}</ref> However, [[Salsette Island]], on which Bandra lay, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=174|Ref=bom}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese built additional churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being [[St. Andrew's Church, Mumbai|St. Andrew's Church]] in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Catholicism among the villagers on the island. Their descendants continued to support the six Catholic parish churches\u2014[[Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bandra|Mount Carmel]], St. Peter's, St. Andrew's, St. Theresa's, St. Anne's and St. Francis d'Assisi\u2014that lie within an area of four square kilometres.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-mumbai-once-a-part-of-bandras-catholic-heritage-a-chapel-at-pali-hill-will-soon-be-history-1824997\n|title=Mumbai: Once a part of Bandra's Catholic heritage, a chapel at Pali Hill will soon be history\n|publisher=[[DNA India]]\n|date = 21 April 2013\n}}</ref> \n\n===British Bandra===\nBandra became part of English territory with the signing of the [[Treaty of Surat]] in 1775, but was retroceded to the [[Marathas]] in 1779 during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. In 1802, [[Bajirao II]] signed the [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]] with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947.\n\nOn 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between [[Virar]] and Bombay. Six years later, it was increased to 24 each day. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from [[Pali Naka]], [[Hill Road]] to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After [[World War II]], the building boom began to accommodate immigrants.\n\nBandra was raised to the status of a [[Bandra Municipal Committee|municipality]] in 1876 and then was expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Pali, and Chuim. These have been lost to urban development of the island.\n\n====Mount Mary's Church====\n[[File:Mother mary.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Mother Mary at [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra]].]]\nThe Catholic [[chapel]] of [[Mount Mary Church, Bandra|Mount Mary]] was built around 1640 by the Portuguese. The chapel was destroyed in 1738 by the Marathas during their campaign to evict the Portuguese. The statue of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] was recovered from the sea by fishermen and temporarily installed in St. Andrew's Church, before being shifted to the rebuilt Mount Mary's Church in 1761. 2018 marked the beginning of the \"Feast of Our Lady of the Mount\", also known as the \"Monti Fest\" or the \"Bandra Feast\". To this day, the statue is venerated and many miracles, minor and major, are attributed to the Lady of the Mount. The architect of Mount Mary's Church was Bombay architect [[Shahpoorjee Chandabhoy]]. The basilica was built in 1904 at a cost of INR 1 lakh. The original church was built to serve the garrison posted at the [[Castella de Aguada]] (Fortress of Aguada) at [[Land's End, Bandra]]. In 1879, [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy|Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]] constructed a flight of steps to Mount Mary's Church; these are known as the ''Degrados de Bomanjee'' ('Steps of Bomanjee').\n\nPeople of all faiths and communities visit the church, giving the place a syncretic nature. The [[Bandra Fair]] is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when pilgrims throng the church.<ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=255163 Mount Mary fair begins today]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 8 September 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_devotees-throng-to-bandra-fair-on-opening-day-as-stall-owners-protest_1437121 \"Devotees throng to Bandra Fair on opening day as stall owners protest\"], ''[[DNA (newspaper)]]'', 13 September 2010.</ref>\n\n====Educational institutions====\nThe first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew's Parish School, started by Fr. [[Francisco de Melo]] in 1780 to teach catechism to the children of the parish.

National College]] was originally set up in 1922 in [[Hyderabad, Pakistan]] under the guidance of [[Annie Besant]].

The [[Thadomal Shahani Engineering College]] was established in 1983 by the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]]. It was the first private engineering institute to be affiliated with the federal [[University of Mumbai]] to offer courses in [[Computer Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], [[Biomedical Engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]].\n\nThe Rizvi Education Complex, located off [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]], comprises the Rizvi College of Arts, Science and Commerce (established in 1985); Rizvi High School (established in 1985); [[Rizvi College of Engineering]] (established in 1998); Rizvi College of Architecture; Rizvi College of Hotel Management & Catering Technology; [[Rizvi Law College]]; Rizvi College of Education and the Rizvi College of Fashion Designing & Creative Arts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rizvi.edu.in/|title=Rizvi Education Society|author=|date=|website=www.rizvi.edu.in}}</ref> All are managed by the Rizvi Education Society, and may have the status of Muslim religious minority institution.\n\n====Bandra lake====\n{{main|Bandra Talao}}\n[[Bandra Lake]], also called Bandra Talao or Motha Reservoir was constructed by a rich [[Konkani]] Muslim of [[Navapada]] (also spelt Naupada or Naopara), an adjoining village.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal |title=Gazetteer of Thane District \u2013 Places of Interest, 1882| url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-III/places_Bandra.html}}</ref>\n\nThe lake was later acquired by the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai]].

In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the [[Mithi River]] in the eastern portion of the city, near the [[Kurla]] border. The newly-formed [[Bandra-Kurla Complex]] (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development.\n\nAs the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra's BKC is located between [[Banda Station|Bandra]] and [[Kurla railway station|Kurla]] stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made [[Banda Station|Bandra]] among the busiest stations in India, surpassing [[Andheri]] and [[Bombay Central]], and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra's Western Railway after [[Churchgate railway station]].\n\n==Urban art==\nBandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near Bandstand and Mount Mary Church.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-ranwar-village.html|title=Ranwar Village|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/03/india-bollywood-art-project.html|title=Bollywood Art Project|accessdate= 22 March 2016|publisher=Minor Sights}}</ref> They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls.\nSt+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BollywoodArtProject/|title=Bollywood Art Project \u2013 BAP|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organizations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists.

The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director [[Mehboob Khan]] established the [[Mehboob Studio]]s here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, [[Bollywood]]. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s.<ref name=pn>{{cite news |title=Mehboob mere, Mehboob tere |url=http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |newspaper=Pune Mirror |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718051651/http://www.punemirror.in/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Mumbai&sectid=3&contentid=20081101200811012008337798596fdb6 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=dn>{{cite news |title=Mumbai, meri mehboob?|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/column_mumbai-meri-mehboob_1504231 |newspaper=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=  7 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, [[Bandra-Kurla complex|Bandra-Kurla Commercial Complex]], the office of the state housing development authority ([[Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority|MHADA]]) and the office of the [[District Collector]]. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here.\n\nMost roads and places in Bandra were given English names during [[British rule]]. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names.\n\n* Neighbouring suburbs: [[Dharavi]], [[Khar, Mumbai|Khar]], [[Kurla]], [[Mahim]], [[Santa Cruz (Mumbai)|Santacruz]]\n* Arterial Roads: [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] (S.V Road), [[Linking Road]], Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), [[Hill Road]] (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]] (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), [[Western Express Highway]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] connects the western part of Bandra to [[Worli]] by the sea route, thus diverting a lot of road traffic.\n\n[[File:Worli skyline from Bandra.jpg|thumb|300px|Worli skyline as seen from Bandra Reclamation]]\n[[File:Bandra Linking road.jpg|thumb|A stall on Linking Road]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:India Mumbai Bridge .jpg|thumb|[[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] Project]]\n[[Bandra railway station]] is connected with the [[Western Railway Zone (India)|Western Railway]] and the [[Harbour Line]], which is an offshoot of the suburban [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]].

The important trains include the Bandra-[[New Delhi]] Rajdhani Express, Bandra-[[Indore]] Express, Bandra-[[Patna]] Express, Bandra-[[Jaipur]] Express, Bandra-[[Jodhpur]] Express and the Bandra-[[Amritsar]] Express\n\nPublic transport also includes [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering [[Mahim]], only taxis are allowed to ply.\n\nThe [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]] bridge connects Bandra West with [[Worli]], located in central Mumbai.

The crown-of-thorns starfish receives its name from venomous thorn-like spines that cover its upper surface, resembling the biblical [[crown of thorns]]. It is one of the largest starfish in the world.\n\n''A. planci'' has a very wide [[Indo-Pacific]] distribution. It is perhaps most common in [[Australia]], but can occur at tropical and subtropical latitudes from the [[Red Sea]] and the east African coast across the Indian Ocean, and across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of Central America. It occurs where coral reefs or hard coral communities occur in this region.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Crown of Thorns-jonhanson.jpg|thumb|Unusual brightly coloured crown-of-thorns starfish, Thailand]]\nThe body form of the crown-of-thorns starfish is fundamentally the same as that of a typical [[starfish]], with a central disk and radiating arms. Its special traits, however, include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed, flexible, [[prehensile]], and heavily spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=97\u201398}} Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous [[tube feet]] that extend to the tip of each arm. In being multiple-armed, it has lost the five-fold symmetry (pentamerism) typical of starfish, although it begins its life cycle with this [[Symmetry in biology|symmetry]].

The spines are stiff and very sharp, and readily pierce through soft surfaces. Despite the battery of sharp spines on the aboral surface and blunt spines on the oral surface, the crown-of-thorns starfish's general body surface is membranous and soft. When the starfish is removed from the water, the body surface ruptures and the body fluid leaks out, so the body collapses and flattens. The spines bend over and flatten, as well. They recover their shape when reimmersed, if they are still alive.<ref name=\"Lucas76\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/263409a0 |pmid=972678 |title=Hybrid crown-of-thorns starfish (''Acanthaster planci x A.

It is generally recognised as a distinctly isolated [[taxon]]. Recently, Blake concluded from comparative morphology studies of ''Acanthaster planci'' that it has strong similarities with various members of the Oreasteridae. He transferred Acanthasteridae from the Spinulosida to the Valvatida and assigned it a position near to the Oreasteridae, from which it appears to be derived.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=DJ|title=The affinities and origins of the crown-of-thorns sea star ''Acanthaster Gervais|journal=J. Nat. Hist.|year=1979|volume=13|issue=3|pages=303\u2013314|doi=10.1080/00222937900770241}}</ref> He attributed ''Acanthaster'' [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] as possibly evolving in association with its locomotion over irregular coral surfaces in higher energy environments. There is a complication, however, in that ''Acanthaster'' is not a [[Monotypic taxon|monospecific]] genus and any consideration of the genus must also take into account another species, ''[[Acanthaster brevispinus]]'', which lives in a completely different environment. ''A. brevispinus'' lives on soft substrates, perhaps buried in the substrate at times like other soft substrate-inhabiting starfish, at moderate depths where presumably the surface is regular and there is little wave action.\n\n===Genus and species===\n[[File:Acanthaster ellisii.JPG|thumb|Short-spined form from Gulf of California &ndash; live specimen]]\n\n''Acanthaster planci'' has a long history in the scientific literature with great confusion in the generic and species names from the outset, with a long list of complex [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=13\u201319}} [[Georg Eberhard Rhumphius]] first described it in 1705, naming it ''Stella marina quindecium radiotorum''. Later, [[Carl Linnaeus]] described it as ''Asterias planci'' based on an illustration by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743), when he introduced his system of [[binomial nomenclature]]. No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant.\n\nSubsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included ''Stellonia'', ''Echinaster'' and ''Echinites'', before settling on ''Acanthaster'' ([[Paul Gervais|Gervais]] 1841). Species names included ''echintes'', ''solaris'', ''mauritensis'', ''ellisii'', and ''ellisii pseudoplanci'' (with subspecies). Most of these names arose from confusion in the historical literature, but ''Acanthaster ellisii'' came to be used for the distinctive starfish in the eastern Pacific [[Gulf of California]].\n\nThe eastern Pacific ''Acanthaster'' is very distinctive (see image to the right) with its rather 'plump' body, large disk to total diameter ratio and short, blunt spines. It gives the impression of living in a habitat where having sharp defenses against predators has little value, although it lives on coral reef and feeds on coral.\n\n===Genetic studies===\n\nNishida and Lucas examined variation at 14 allozyme loci of ten population samples of ''A. planci'' using starch-gel electrophoresis. The samples were from localities across the Pacific: Ryukyu archipelago (four locations), Micronesia (two locations), and samples from one location each of the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji, Hawaii, and Gulf of California. A sample of 10 specimens of ''A. brevispinus'' from the Great Barrier Reef region was included for comparison. There was considerable genetic differentiation between the ''A. brevispinus'' and ''A. planci'' populations (D= 0.20 +/\u2212 0.02)(D is [[genetic distance]]). The genetic differences between geographic populations of ''A. planci'' were, however, small (D = 0.03 +/\u2212 0.00; Fsr = 0.07 + 0.02) (Fsr is standardized genetic variance for each [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] locus) despite the great distances separating them. A positive correlation was observed between degree of genetic differentiation and geographic distance, suggesting the genetic homogeneity among ''A. planci'' populations is due to [[gene flow]] by planktonic larval dispersion. The distance effect on genetic differentiation most probably reflects decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances. In view of the level of macrogeographic homogeneity, significant allele frequency differences were observed between adjacent populations separated by approximately 10&nbsp;km. The Hawaiian population was most differentiated from other populations. Treating the morphologically distinctive, eastern Pacific ''Acanthaster'' as a separate species, ''A. ellisii'', is not supported by these data. The lack of unique alleles in the central (Hawaii) and eastern Pacific (Gulf of California) populations suggests they were derived from those in the western Pacific.\n\nFurther details of the genetic relationship between ''A. planci'' and ''[[Acanthaster brevispinus]]'' are presented in the entry for the latter species. These are clearly [[sibling species]] and it is suggested that ''A. planci'', the specialised coral-feeding species arose from ''A. brevispinus'', the less specialised soft-bottom inhabitant.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Lucas, J S |author2=Nash, W J |author3=Nishida, M |chapter=Aspects of the evolution of ''Acanthaster planci'' (L) (Echinodermata, Asteroidea).|year=1985|title=Proceedings of the fifth international coral reef congress, Tahiti 27 May - 1 June 1985, Vol. 5}}</ref>\n\nIn a very comprehensive geographic study, Benzie examined allozyme loci variation in 20 populations of '' A. planci'', throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Benzie, JAH|title=Major genetic differences between crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) populations in the Indian and Pacific Oceans|journal=Evolution|year=1999|volume=53|issue=6|pages=1782\u20131795|doi=10.2307/2640440|pmid=28565442|jstor=2640440}}</ref> The most striking result was a very marked discontinuity between the Indian and Pacific Ocean populations. Those, however, off northern Western Australia had a strong Pacific affinity.

Again, the pattern of decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances is apparent.

The living tissue of the encrusting algae is approximately pink to dark red and feeding by these early juveniles results in white scars on the surface of the algae (photograph). During the next months, the juveniles grow and add arms and associated madreporites in the pattern described by Yamaguchi<ref name=Yamaguchi/> until the adult numbers is attained 5\u20137 months after metamorphosis. Two hard corals with small polyps, ''Pocillopora damicornis'' and ''Acropora acunimata'', were included in the aquaria with the encrusting algae and at about the time the juvenile starfish achieved their full number of arms they began feeding on the corals.<ref name=\"Lucas76\"/>\n\nJuvenile ''A. planci'' that had reached the stage of feeding on coral were then reared for some years in the same large closed-circuit seawater system that was used for the early juveniles. They were moved to larger tanks and kept supplied with coral so that food was not a limiting factor on growth rate.

This was followed by a phase of rapid growth which led to sexual maturity at the end of the second year. The starfish were in the vicinity of 200&nbsp;mm diameter at this stage. They continued to grow rapidly and were in the order of 300&nbsp;and tended to decline after 4 years. Gonad development was greater in the third and subsequent years than at 2 years and there was a seasonal pattern of gametogenesis and spawning with water temperature being the only apparent cue in the indoor aquarium. Most specimens of ''A. planci'' died from 'senility' during the period 5\u20137.5 years, i.e. they fed poorly and shrank.\n\n===Field observations of life-cycle===\nThe data above are derived from laboratory studies of ''A. planci'', which are much more readily obtained than equivalent data from the field. The laboratory observations, however, accord with the limited field observations of life-cycle.\n\nAs in laboratory studies where ''A. planci'' larvae were found to select coralline algae for settlement, early juveniles (<20&nbsp;mm diameter) were found on subtidal coralline algae (''Porolithon onkodes'') on the windward reef front of Suva Reef (Fiji).<ref name=\"Zann, L Brodie, J; Berryman, C; Naqasima, M 1987\">{{cite book|author1=Zann, L Brodie, J |author2=Berryman, C |author3=Naqasima, M |title=Recruitment, ecology, growth and behavior of juvenile ''Acanthaster planci'' (L.)

He didn't report growth rates based on these age determinations, and mark and recapture data, but he reported that the growth bands revealed 12+ year-old starfish: much older than those that became 'senile' and died in the laboratory.\n\nIn a small number of field studies, mortality rates of juvenile A. planci have to found to be very high, e.g. 6.5% per day for month-old and 0.45% per day for 7-month-old. Most of the mortality comes from predators, such as small crabs, that occur in and on the substrate with the juveniles.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Keesing JK, Halford AR|title=Field measurement of survival rates of juvenile Acanthaster planci : Techniques and preliminary results|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|year=1992|volume=85|issue=1\u20132|pages=107\u2013114|doi=10.3354/meps085107|bibcode=1992MEPS...85..107K|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is possible, however, that these rates may not reflect mortality over the range of habitats occupied by small juveniles.\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Ecological impact on reefs===\n[[File:Pre A. planci.jpg|thumb|Coral before ''A. planci'' predation]]\n[[File:Post A. planci.jpg|thumb|Filamentous algae encrusting coral skeletons after ''A. planci'' predation]]\n[[File:After Crown-of-thorns predation and storm.JPG|thumb|Collapsed coral skeletons after ''A. planci'' predation and storm]]\n\nPopular anxiety to news of high densities of ''A. planci'' on the Great Barrier Reef was reflected in many newspaper reports and publications such as 'Requiem for the Reef',<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Peter|title=Requiem for the Reef: The Story of Official Distortion About the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish|year=1976|publisher=Foundation Press|location=Brisbane}}</ref> which also suggested that there was a cover-up of the extent of damage. There was a popular idea that the coral and with it whole reefs were being destroyed by the starfish. In fact, as described above, the starfish preys on coral by digesting the surface of living tissue from the coral skeletons. These skeletons persist, together with the mass of coralline algae that is essential for reef integrity. The initial change (first order effect) is loss of the veneer of living coral tissue.\n\n''A. planci'' is a component of the fauna of most coral reefs and the effects of ''A. planci'' populations on coral reefs are very dependent on the population density. At low densities (1 to perhaps 30/hectare) the rate at which coral is being preyed upon by the starfish, is less than the growth rate of the coral, i.e. the surface area of living coral is increasing. The starfish may, however, influence the coral community structure. Because the starfish don't feed indiscriminately they may cause a distribution of coral species and colony sizes that differs from a pattern without them. This is evident by comparison of coral reefs where ''A. planci'' hasn't been found to the more typical reefs with ''A. planci''.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=needed}}\n\nSome ecologists suggest that the starfish has an important and active role in maintaining coral reef [[biodiversity]], driving [[ecological succession]]. Before overpopulation became a significant issue, crown-of-thorns prevented fast-growing coral from overpowering the slower growing coral varieties.<ref>{{cite video | people = Larry Zetlin | title = Predators of the Great Barrier Reef | medium = TV-Special | publisher = Gulliver Media Australia | location = Queensland, Australia | date = 2004 }}</ref>\n\nAt high densities ('outbreaks', 'plagues'), which may be defined as when the starfish are too abundant for the coral food supply, coral cover goes into decline. The starfish must broaden their diet from their preferred species, colony size and shape. The starfish often aggregate during feeding, even at low densities, but during high densities the cleared coral patches become almost continuous or completely continuous (photograph).\nThere are second-order effects of these large areas of predated coral.\n* The bare coral skeletons are rapidly colonised by filamentous algae (photograph)\n* Large stands of staghorn coral, ''Acropora'' species, may collapse and become rubble reducing the topographical complexity of the reef (photograph)\n* Sometimes the predated surfaces are further invaded by macroalgae, soft coral and sponges. These tend to take over reef surfaces for long periods as alternatives to hard coral communities, as, once established, they limit recruitment by hard coral larvae.\n\nAesthetically, in all the above cases, the reef surface is not as attractive as the living coral surface, but it is anything but dead.\n\nThere is a third-order effect potentially arising from the invasion by filamentous algae. Animals that depend directly or indirectly on hard corals, e.g. for shelter and food, should lose out, and herbivores and less specialist feeders gain. It would be expected that this would be most conspicuous in the fish fauna and long-terms studies of coral reef fish communities confirm this expectation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilson, Shaun K |author2=Graham, Nicholas AJ |author3=Pratchett, Morgan S |author4=Jones, Geoffrey P |author5=Polunin, Nicholas VC |title=Multiple disturbances and the global degradation of coral reefs: are reef fishes at risk or resilient?|journal=Global Change Biology|year=2006|volume=12|issue=11|pages=2220\u20132234|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01252.x|bibcode=2006GCBio..12.2220W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wilson, S K |author2=Dolman, A M |author3=Cheal, A J |author4=Emslie, MJ Pratchett |title=Maintenance of fish diversity on disturbed coral reefs|journal=Coral Reefs|year=2009|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3\u201314|doi=10.1007/s00338-008-0431-2|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2009CorRe..28....3W |doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n===Population outbreaks===\n[[File:Acanthaster planci, \u00e9toiles mangeuses de corail.jpeg|thumb|Outbreak in [[French Polynesia]]]]\nLarge populations of crown-of-thorns starfish (sometime emotively known as 'plagues') have been substantiated as occurring at twenty one locations of coral reefs during the 1960s to 1980s.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=36\u201340}} These locations ranged from the Red Sea through the tropical Indo-Pacific region to French Polynesia.

Also, they would need to be consumed completely or almost completely to die. 17\u201360% of starfish in various populations had missing or regenerating arms.<ref name=\"Moran 1986 379\u2013480\"/> Clearly the starfish experience various levels of sublethal predation. When the damage includes a major section of the disk together with arms, the number of arms regenerating on the disk may be less than the number lost.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|p=38}}\n\nAnother hypothesis is the \"aggregation hypothesis\", whereby large aggregations of ''A. planci'' appear as apparent outbreaks because they have consumed all the adjacent coral. This seems to imply that there is apparently a dense population outbreak when there has already been a more diffuse population outbreak that has been dense enough to comprehensively prey on large areas of hard coral.\n\nFemale crown-of-thorns starfish are very fecund.

Considering two hypothetical situations.\n\nTwenty million eggs from a female spawning, having a survival rate of about 0.00000001% throughout development, would replace two adult starfish in a low-density population where the larvae recruit. If, however, the survival rate increases to 0.1% (one in a thousand) throughout development from one spawning of 20 million eggs this would result in 20,000 adult starfish where the larvae have recruited.

The crown-of-thorns starfish receives its name from venomous thorn-like spines that cover its upper surface, resembling the biblical [[crown of thorns]]. It is one of the largest starfish in the world.\n\n''A. planci'' has a very wide [[Indo-Pacific]] distribution. It is perhaps most common in [[Australia]], but can occur at tropical and subtropical latitudes from the [[Red Sea]] and the east African coast across the Indian Ocean, and across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of Central America. It occurs where coral reefs or hard coral communities occur in this region.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Crown of Thorns-jonhanson.jpg|thumb|Unusual brightly coloured crown-of-thorns starfish, Thailand]]\nThe body form of the crown-of-thorns starfish is fundamentally the same as that of a typical [[starfish]], with a central disk and radiating arms. Its special traits, however, include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed, flexible, [[prehensile]], and heavily spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=97\u201398}} Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous [[tube feet]] that extend to the tip of each arm. In being multiple-armed, it has lost the five-fold symmetry (pentamerism) typical of starfish, although it begins its life cycle with this [[Symmetry in biology|symmetry]].

The spines are stiff and very sharp, and readily pierce through soft surfaces. Despite the battery of sharp spines on the aboral surface and blunt spines on the oral surface, the crown-of-thorns starfish's general body surface is membranous and soft. When the starfish is removed from the water, the body surface ruptures and the body fluid leaks out, so the body collapses and flattens. The spines bend over and flatten, as well. They recover their shape when reimmersed, if they are still alive.<ref name=\"Lucas76\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/263409a0 |pmid=972678 |title=Hybrid crown-of-thorns starfish (''Acanthaster planci x A.

It is generally recognised as a distinctly isolated [[taxon]]. Recently, Blake concluded from comparative morphology studies of ''Acanthaster planci'' that it has strong similarities with various members of the Oreasteridae. He transferred Acanthasteridae from the Spinulosida to the Valvatida and assigned it a position near to the Oreasteridae, from which it appears to be derived.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=DJ|title=The affinities and origins of the crown-of-thorns sea star ''Acanthaster Gervais|journal=J. Nat. Hist.|year=1979|volume=13|issue=3|pages=303\u2013314|doi=10.1080/00222937900770241}}</ref> He attributed ''Acanthaster'' [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] as possibly evolving in association with its locomotion over irregular coral surfaces in higher energy environments. There is a complication, however, in that ''Acanthaster'' is not a [[Monotypic taxon|monospecific]] genus and any consideration of the genus must also take into account another species, ''[[Acanthaster brevispinus]]'', which lives in a completely different environment. ''A. brevispinus'' lives on soft substrates, perhaps buried in the substrate at times like other soft substrate-inhabiting starfish, at moderate depths where presumably the surface is regular and there is little wave action.\n\n===Genus and species===\n[[File:Acanthaster ellisii.JPG|thumb|Short-spined form from Gulf of California &ndash; live specimen]]\n\n''Acanthaster planci'' has a long history in the scientific literature with great confusion in the generic and species names from the outset, with a long list of complex [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=13\u201319}} [[Georg Eberhard Rhumphius]] first described it in 1705, naming it ''Stella marina quindecium radiotorum''. Later, [[Carl Linnaeus]] described it as ''Asterias planci'' based on an illustration by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743), when he introduced his system of [[binomial nomenclature]]. No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant.\n\nSubsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included ''Stellonia'', ''Echinaster'' and ''Echinites'', before settling on ''Acanthaster'' ([[Paul Gervais|Gervais]] 1841). Species names included ''echintes'', ''solaris'', ''mauritensis'', ''ellisii'', and ''ellisii pseudoplanci'' (with subspecies). Most of these names arose from confusion in the historical literature, but ''Acanthaster ellisii'' came to be used for the distinctive starfish in the eastern Pacific [[Gulf of California]].\n\nThe eastern Pacific ''Acanthaster'' is very distinctive (see image to the right) with its rather 'plump' body, large disk to total diameter ratio and short, blunt spines. It gives the impression of living in a habitat where having sharp defenses against predators has little value, although it lives on coral reef and feeds on coral.\n\n===Genetic studies===\n\nNishida and Lucas examined variation at 14 allozyme loci of ten population samples of ''A. planci'' using starch-gel electrophoresis. The samples were from localities across the Pacific: Ryukyu archipelago (four locations), Micronesia (two locations), and samples from one location each of the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji, Hawaii, and Gulf of California. A sample of 10 specimens of ''A. brevispinus'' from the Great Barrier Reef region was included for comparison. There was considerable genetic differentiation between the ''A. brevispinus'' and ''A. planci'' populations (D= 0.20 +/\u2212 0.02)(D is [[genetic distance]]). The genetic differences between geographic populations of ''A. planci'' were, however, small (D = 0.03 +/\u2212 0.00; Fsr = 0.07 + 0.02) (Fsr is standardized genetic variance for each [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] locus) despite the great distances separating them. A positive correlation was observed between degree of genetic differentiation and geographic distance, suggesting the genetic homogeneity among ''A. planci'' populations is due to [[gene flow]] by planktonic larval dispersion. The distance effect on genetic differentiation most probably reflects decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances. In view of the level of macrogeographic homogeneity, significant allele frequency differences were observed between adjacent populations separated by approximately 10&nbsp;km. The Hawaiian population was most differentiated from other populations. Treating the morphologically distinctive, eastern Pacific ''Acanthaster'' as a separate species, ''A. ellisii'', is not supported by these data. The lack of unique alleles in the central (Hawaii) and eastern Pacific (Gulf of California) populations suggests they were derived from those in the western Pacific.\n\nFurther details of the genetic relationship between ''A. planci'' and ''[[Acanthaster brevispinus]]'' are presented in the entry for the latter species. These are clearly [[sibling species]] and it is suggested that ''A. planci'', the specialised coral-feeding species arose from ''A. brevispinus'', the less specialised soft-bottom inhabitant.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Lucas, J S |author2=Nash, W J |author3=Nishida, M |chapter=Aspects of the evolution of ''Acanthaster planci'' (L) (Echinodermata, Asteroidea).|year=1985|title=Proceedings of the fifth international coral reef congress, Tahiti 27 May - 1 June 1985, Vol. 5}}</ref>\n\nIn a very comprehensive geographic study, Benzie examined allozyme loci variation in 20 populations of '' A. planci'', throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Benzie, JAH|title=Major genetic differences between crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) populations in the Indian and Pacific Oceans|journal=Evolution|year=1999|volume=53|issue=6|pages=1782\u20131795|doi=10.2307/2640440|pmid=28565442|jstor=2640440}}</ref> The most striking result was a very marked discontinuity between the Indian and Pacific Ocean populations. Those, however, off northern Western Australia had a strong Pacific affinity. With the exception of the very strong connection of southern Japanese populations to the Great Barrier Reef populations, the patterns of variation within regions were consistent with isolation by distance. Again, the pattern of decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances is apparent. Benzie suggests that the divergence between Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean populations began at least 1.6 million years ago and is likely to reflect responses to changes in climate and sea level.\n\nA more recent comprehensive geographic study of ''A. planci'' by Vogler ''et al''., using  [[genetic analysis|DNA analyses]] (one [[mitochondrial gene]]), suggests it is actually a species complex consisting of four species or [[clades]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0454 |pmid=18832058 |pmc=2614177 |title=A threat to coral reefs multiplied?

In humans, this immediately causes a sharp, stinging pain that can last for several hours, persistent bleeding due to the [[haemolytic]] effect of saponins, and nausea and tissue swelling that may persist for a week or more.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=131\u2013132}} The spines, which are brittle, may also break off and become embedded in the tissue where they must be removed surgically.\n\nSaponins seem to occur throughout the lifecycle of the crown-of-thorns starfish.

In the classic pattern for echinoderms, the bilaterally symmetrical larva is replaced by a pentamerously symmetrical stage at metamorphosis, with the latter's body axis bearing no relationship to that of the larva. Thus the newly metamorphosed starfish are five-armed and are 0.4\u20131&nbsp;mm diameter. (Note the size of the tube feet relative to the size of the animal.) They feed on the thin coating layers of hard encrusting algae (coralline algae) on the undersides of dead coral rubble and other concealed surfaces. They extend their stomach over the surface of the encrusting algae and digest the tissue, as in the feeding by larger crown-of-thorns starfish on hard corals. The living tissue of the encrusting algae is approximately pink to dark red and feeding by these early juveniles results in white scars on the surface of the algae (photograph). During the next months, the juveniles grow and add arms and associated madreporites in the pattern described by Yamaguchi<ref name=Yamaguchi/> until the adult numbers is attained 5\u20137 months after metamorphosis. Two hard corals with small polyps, ''Pocillopora damicornis'' and ''Acropora acunimata'', were included in the aquaria with the encrusting algae and at about the time the juvenile starfish achieved their full number of arms they began feeding on the corals.<ref name=\"Lucas76\"/>\n\nJuvenile ''A. planci'' that had reached the stage of feeding on coral were then reared for some years in the same large closed-circuit seawater system that was used for the early juveniles. They were moved to larger tanks and kept supplied with coral so that food was not a limiting factor on growth rate.

This was followed by a phase of rapid growth which led to sexual maturity at the end of the second year. The starfish were in the vicinity of 200&nbsp;mm diameter at this stage. They continued to grow rapidly and were in the order of 300&nbsp;and tended to decline after 4 years. Gonad development was greater in the third and subsequent years than at 2 years and there was a seasonal pattern of gametogenesis and spawning with water temperature being the only apparent cue in the indoor aquarium. Most specimens of ''A. planci'' died from 'senility' during the period 5\u20137.5 years, i.e. they fed poorly and shrank.\n\n===Field observations of life-cycle===\nThe data above are derived from laboratory studies of ''A. planci'', which are much more readily obtained than equivalent data from the field.

He didn't report growth rates based on these age determinations, and mark and recapture data, but he reported that the growth bands revealed 12+ year-old starfish: much older than those that became 'senile' and died in the laboratory.\n\nIn a small number of field studies, mortality rates of juvenile A. planci have to found to be very high, e.g. 6.5% per day for month-old and 0.45% per day for 7-month-old. Most of the mortality comes from predators, such as small crabs, that occur in and on the substrate with the juveniles.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Keesing JK, Halford AR|title=Field measurement of survival rates of juvenile Acanthaster planci : Techniques and preliminary results|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|year=1992|volume=85|issue=1\u20132|pages=107\u2013114|doi=10.3354/meps085107|bibcode=1992MEPS...85..107K|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is possible, however, that these rates may not reflect mortality over the range of habitats occupied by small juveniles.\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Ecological impact on reefs===\n[[File:Pre A. planci.jpg|thumb|Coral before ''A. planci'' predation]]\n[[File:Post A. planci.jpg|thumb|Filamentous algae encrusting coral skeletons after ''A. planci'' predation]]\n[[File:After Crown-of-thorns predation and storm.JPG|thumb|Collapsed coral skeletons after ''A. planci'' predation and storm]]\n\nPopular anxiety to news of high densities of ''A. planci'' on the Great Barrier Reef was reflected in many newspaper reports and publications such as 'Requiem for the Reef',<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Peter|title=Requiem for the Reef: The Story of Official Distortion About the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish|year=1976|publisher=Foundation Press|location=Brisbane}}</ref> which also suggested that there was a cover-up of the extent of damage. There was a popular idea that the coral and with it whole reefs were being destroyed by the starfish. In fact, as described above, the starfish preys on coral by digesting the surface of living tissue from the coral skeletons. These skeletons persist, together with the mass of coralline algae that is essential for reef integrity. The initial change (first order effect) is loss of the veneer of living coral tissue.\n\n''A. planci'' is a component of the fauna of most coral reefs and the effects of ''A. planci'' populations on coral reefs are very dependent on the population density. At low densities (1 to perhaps 30/hectare) the rate at which coral is being preyed upon by the starfish, is less than the growth rate of the coral, i.e. the surface area of living coral is increasing. The starfish may, however, influence the coral community structure. Because the starfish don't feed indiscriminately they may cause a distribution of coral species and colony sizes that differs from a pattern without them. This is evident by comparison of coral reefs where ''A. planci'' hasn't been found to the more typical reefs with ''A. planci''.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=needed}}\n\nSome ecologists suggest that the starfish has an important and active role in maintaining coral reef [[biodiversity]], driving [[ecological succession]]. Before overpopulation became a significant issue, crown-of-thorns prevented fast-growing coral from overpowering the slower growing coral varieties.<ref>{{cite video | people = Larry Zetlin | title = Predators of the Great Barrier Reef | medium = TV-Special | publisher = Gulliver Media Australia | location = Queensland, Australia | date = 2004 }}</ref>\n\nAt high densities ('outbreaks', 'plagues'), which may be defined as when the starfish are too abundant for the coral food supply, coral cover goes into decline. The starfish must broaden their diet from their preferred species, colony size and shape. The starfish often aggregate during feeding, even at low densities, but during high densities the cleared coral patches become almost continuous or completely continuous (photograph).\nThere are second-order effects of these large areas of predated coral.\n* The bare coral skeletons are rapidly colonised by filamentous algae (photograph)\n* Large stands of staghorn coral, ''Acropora'' species, may collapse and become rubble reducing the topographical complexity of the reef (photograph)\n* Sometimes the predated surfaces are further invaded by macroalgae, soft coral and sponges. These tend to take over reef surfaces for long periods as alternatives to hard coral communities, as, once established, they limit recruitment by hard coral larvae.\n\nAesthetically, in all the above cases, the reef surface is not as attractive as the living coral surface, but it is anything but dead.\n\nThere is a third-order effect potentially arising from the invasion by filamentous algae. Animals that depend directly or indirectly on hard corals, e.g. for shelter and food, should lose out, and herbivores and less specialist feeders gain. It would be expected that this would be most conspicuous in the fish fauna and long-terms studies of coral reef fish communities confirm this expectation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilson, Shaun K |author2=Graham, Nicholas AJ |author3=Pratchett, Morgan S |author4=Jones, Geoffrey P |author5=Polunin, Nicholas VC |title=Multiple disturbances and the global degradation of coral reefs: are reef fishes at risk or resilient?|journal=Global Change Biology|year=2006|volume=12|issue=11|pages=2220\u20132234|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01252.x|bibcode=2006GCBio..12.2220W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wilson, S K |author2=Dolman, A M |author3=Cheal, A J |author4=Emslie, MJ Pratchett |title=Maintenance of fish diversity on disturbed coral reefs|journal=Coral Reefs|year=2009|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3\u201314|doi=10.1007/s00338-008-0431-2|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2009CorRe..28....3W |doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n===Population outbreaks===\n[[File:Acanthaster planci, \u00e9toiles mangeuses de corail.jpeg|thumb|Outbreak in [[French Polynesia]]]]\nLarge populations of crown-of-thorns starfish (sometime emotively known as 'plagues') have been substantiated as occurring at twenty one locations of coral reefs during the 1960s to 1980s.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|pp=36\u201340}} These locations ranged from the Red Sea through the tropical Indo-Pacific region to French Polynesia.

Also, they would need to be consumed completely or almost completely to die. 17\u201360% of starfish in various populations had missing or regenerating arms.<ref name=\"Moran 1986 379\u2013480\"/> Clearly the starfish experience various levels of sublethal predation. When the damage includes a major section of the disk together with arms, the number of arms regenerating on the disk may be less than the number lost.{{sfnp|Birkeland|Lucas|1990|p=38}}\n\nAnother hypothesis is the \"aggregation hypothesis\", whereby large aggregations of ''A. planci'' appear as apparent outbreaks because they have consumed all the adjacent coral. This seems to imply that there is apparently a dense population outbreak when there has already been a more diffuse population outbreak that has been dense enough to comprehensively prey on large areas of hard coral.\n\nFemale crown-of-thorns starfish are very fecund.

Considering two hypothetical situations.\n\nTwenty million eggs from a female spawning, having a survival rate of about 0.00000001% throughout development, would replace two adult starfish in a low-density population where the larvae recruit. If, however, the survival rate increases to 0.1% (one in a thousand) throughout development from one spawning of 20 million eggs this would result in 20,000 adult starfish where the larvae have recruited. Since the larvae are the most abundant stages of development it is likely that changes in survival will be most importance during this phase of development.\n\nTemperature and salinity have little effect on the survival of crown-of-thorns larvae.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=John|title=Reproductive and larval biology and Acanthaster planci (L.) in Great Barrier Reef.|journal=Micronesica|year=1973|volume=9|issue=2|pages=197\u2013203}}</ref> However, abundance and species of the particular component of [[phytoplankton]] ([[unicellular]] [[flagellates]]) on which the larvae feed has a profound effect on survival and rate of growth.
